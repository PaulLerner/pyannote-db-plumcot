galadriel I amar prestar aen Han mathon ne nen Han mathon ne chae A han noston ned gwilith Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it.
galadriel It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
galadriel Three were given to the elves. Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men. Who above all else, desire power.
galadriel For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom ( the dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ring to control all others and into this Ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all.
galadriel One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.
elrond Tangado haid!
elrond Leithio i philinn!
galadriel Victory was near. But the power of the Ring could not be undone.
galadriel It was in this moment, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.
galadriel Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur. Who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
galadriel It betrayed Isildur to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth, and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came It ensnared a new bearer.
gollum My Precious!
galadriel The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him.
gollum It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious.
galadriel The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived. Its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
bilbo What's this?
galadriel A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
bilbo A Ring!
gollum Lost! My Precious is lost.
galadriel For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
bilbo The 22nd day of September in the year 1400 by Shire reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth. The Third Age of this world.
bilbo There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins. Now, where to begin? Ah, yes. Concerning Hobbits.
bilbo Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. Middle Earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted amongst the very wise.
bilbo Frodo, someone at the door. In fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food. A rather unfair observation As we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales and the smoking of pipeweed. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet and good tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow. And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
bilbo Frodo, the door! sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!
gandalf Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm hmm hmm hmm
gandalf And I must follow if I can. The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow if I can.
frodo You're late!
gandalf A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.
frodo Its wonderful to see you Gandalf.
gandalf You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
gandalf So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a party of special significance?
frodo You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar.
gandalf Well that should please him.
frodo Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
bilbo And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings with change coming slowly, if it comes at all. For things are made to endure in the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End
bilbo And there always will be.
frodo To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd lately. I mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study. He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
bilbo Where's it gone?
bilbo Aaaaah.
frodo He's up to something. All right then, keep your secrets!
gandalf What?
frodo But I know you have something to do with it.
gandalf Good gracious me!
frodo Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
gandalf Indeed?
frodo We never had any adventures, or did anything unexpected.
gandalf If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
frodo Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a 'disturber of the peace.'
gandalf Oh really?
CHILDREN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 HOBBITS Gandalf! Gandalf!

CHILDREN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 HOBBITS Hooooraaaay!
frodo Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.
gandalf So am I dear boy. So am I.
bilbo No thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!
gandalf And what about very old friends?
bilbo Gandalf?
gandalf Bilbo Baggins.
bilbo My dear Gandalf!
gandalf It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old who would believe it. You haven't aged a day!
bilbo Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are.
bilbo Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old as I am.
bilbo It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?
gandalf Just tea, thank you.
gandalf Owwwh!
bilbo I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will.
bilbo You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here, oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge cake! I can make you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?
gandalf Just tea, thank you.
bilbo Oh right. You don't mind if I do, do you?
gandalf Oh not at all!
voice_of_the_ring Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
bilbo I'm not at home! It's the Sackville-Bagginses.
voice_of_the_ring I know you're in there!
bilbo They're after the house! They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf. And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!
gandalf So you mean to go through with your plan then?
bilbo Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you.
gandalf Frodo suspects something.
bilbo Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
gandalf You will tell him wont you?
bilbo Yes, yes.
gandalf He's very fond of you.
bilbo I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.
bilbo Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing.
bilbo Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to remember. 41 to 44 45 to 46 END
bilbo Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome
frodo Go on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
sam Ah, I think I'll just have another ale.
frodo Oh no you dont Go on
bilbo So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly. They spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first light cracked open over the top of the trees. Poof! and turned them all into stone!
merry Quickly
merry No no! the big one, big one!
bilbo Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome welcome. Are all these children yours ?
mrs_proudfoot BRACEGIRDLE Yeah
bilbo Good gracious you have been productive!
bilbo Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly! Hide!
bilbo Oh! Thankyou my boy You're a good lad Frodo. I'm very selfish you know. Yes, I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
frodo Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ?
bilbo No. Well yes, b b b but thats not the point. The point is, Frodo, You'll be alright.
pippin Done!

HOBBIT#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 Happy Birthday!
bilbo Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve.
gandalf I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
bilbo Come on Gandalf. Did you see their faces!
gandalf There are many magic rings in this world Bilbo Baggins and none of them should be used lightly
bilbo It was just a bit of fun! Oh, you're probably right as usual! You will keep an eye on Frodo won't you ?
gandalf Two eyes.
bilbo Thanks
gandalf As often as I can spare.
bilbo I'm leaving everything to him.
gandalf What about this ring of yours ? Is that staying too ?
bilbo Yes, yes. Its in an envelope over there on the mantlepiece.
bilbo No! Wait.... it's... here in my pocket. Ha! Isn't that Isn't that odd now. Yet after all why not, Why shouldn't I keep it.
gandalf I think you should leave the ring behind Bilbo. Is that so hard ?
bilbo Well no ...... and ... yes.. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine, I found it! It came to ME!
gandalf There's no need to get angry
bilbo Well if I'm angry it's your fault! It's mine My only.... My Precious
gandalf Precious ? It's been called that before. Not by you!
bilbo OH! What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!
gandalf I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
bilbo You want it for yourself!
gandalf BILBO BAGGINS! Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks! ) I am not trying to rob you! I'm trying to help you.
gandalf All your long years we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go
bilbo You're right Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo It's late, the road is long Yes, it is time.

gandalf Hmm. Bilbo's Ring.
frodo Where are you going ?
gandalf I have some things I have to attend to.
frodo What things ?
gandalf Questions Questions that need answering.
frodo You've only just arrived! I don't understand.
gandalf Neither do I. Keep it Secret. Keep it Safe. I
gollum VOICE Murder! Shire! Baggins!
gandalf READING The year 3434 of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, the High King of Gondor, and the finding of the Ring of Power. It has come to me, the One Ring, and it shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for I shall risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me. Though I buy it with a great pain The markings upon the band begin to fade The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared A secret now that only fire can tell.

HOBBIT#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale!
sam Oi Mind who you're sweet talking!
frodo Don't worry Sam, Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one!
sam Does she ?
frodo Good Night Sam
gandalf Is it secret ? Is it safe ?
frodo Ha! What are you doing!
gandalf Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool. What can you see ? Can you see anything ?
frodo Nothing. There's nothing Wait. There are markings Its some form of Elvish. I can't read it
gandalf There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
frodo Mordor!
gandalf In the common tongue it says
gandalf This is the One Ring. Forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
frodo Bilbo found it. In Gollum's Cave
gandalf Yes, for sixty years the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping prolonging his life. Delaying old age. But no longer Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. Its heard its master's call.
frodo But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed
gandalf No Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Barad-D'r is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it. All his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it
frodo Alright. We put it away. We must never speak of it again. No one knows its here. Do they ?
gandalf There is one other who knew Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum but the enemy found him first. Admist the endless screams and inane babble they discerned two words.
gollum Shire! Baggins!
frodo Shire! Baggins! But that will lead them here!
HOBBIT#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 Who goes there ?
frodo Take it Gandalf!
gandalf No Frodo.
frodo You must take it!
gandalf You cannot offer me this Ring
frodo I'm giving it to you
gandalf Don't! Tempt me Frodo I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo I would use this Ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine
frodo But it cannot stay in The Shire!
gandalf No! No it can't
frodo What must I do ?
gandalf You must leave, and leave quickly.
frodo Where ? Where do I go ?
gandalf Get out of The Shire. Make for the village of Bree
frodo Bree. What about you ?
gandalf I'll be waiting for you. At the Inn of the Prancing Pony
frodo and the Ring will be safe there ?
gandalf Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me Frodo, he'll know what to do You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you. For that name is not safe outside The Shire. Travel by day and stay off the road
frodo I can cut across country easily enough
gandalf My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all there is to know about them in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you.
gandalf Get down!
gandalf Confound you Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping ?
sam I haven't been dropping no eaves. Sir honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there. If you follow me
gandalf A little late for trimming the verge don't you think ?
sam I heard raised voices
gandalf What did you hear ? Speak!
sam Nothing important That is I heard a good deal about a ring and a dark lord and something about the end of the world, but please Mr Gandalf Sir, please don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything... unnatural
gandalf No ? Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.
gandalf Come along Samwise, keep up!
gandalf Be careful, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service. Birds, Beasts Is it safe ? Never put it on for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember Frodo the Ring is trying to get back to its Master. It wants to be found.
sam This is it
frodo This is what ?
sam If I take one more step, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
frodo Come on Sam Remember what Bilbo used to say. Its a dangerous business
bilbo VOICE Going out your door. You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to
frodo Sam!
frodo Wood elves!
frodo They're going to the harbour beyond the white towers To the Grey Havens
sam They're leaving Middle Earth
frodo Never to return
sam I don't know why.... It makes me sad
sam Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back
frodo Just shut your eyes and imagine you're back in your own bed, with a soft matress and a lovely feather pillow
sam Its not working Mr Frodo Oh! I'm never going to be able to sleep out here
frodo Me neither Sam
saruman_ VOICE Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom The hour grows late and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my Council
saruman_ For that is why you have come, is it not ? My old friend
gandalf Saruman
saruman_ You are sure of this ?
gandalf Beyond any doubt
saruman_ So the Ring of Power has been found
gandalf All these long years it was in The Shire under my very nose
saruman_ and yet you did not have the wits to see it. Your love of the Halflings leaf has clearly slowed your mind
gandalf But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly
saruman_ Time! What time do you think we have ?
saruman_ Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
gandalf The Eye of Sauron
saruman_ He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle Earth
gandalf You know this ? How ?
saruman_ I have seen it.
gandalf A palantir is a dangerous tool Saruman.
saruman_ Why ? Why should we fear to use it ?
gandalf They are not all accounted for. The lost seeing stones. We do not know who else maybe watching.
saruman_ The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul
gandalf The Nine!
saruman_ The crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve disguised as riders in black.
gandalf They've reached The Shire?
saruman_ They will find the Ring and kill the one who carries it.
gandalf Frodo
saruman_ You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron ? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory. We must join with him Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise my friend
gandalf Tell me. Friend... When did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness ?
saruman_ I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. But you.. have elected.. the way of pain!

frodo Yes
aragorn Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.
sam Let him go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!
aragorn You have a stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming
frodo What are they ?
aragorn They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring Drawn to the power of the One They will never stop hunting you.
frodo Where are you taking us ?
aragorn Into the wild

merry He's foul enough
frodo We have no choice but to trust him
sam But where is he leading us ?

aragorn Frodo Frodo
frodo VOICE GANDALF!
gandalf Gwaihir go! Gwaihir
sam Look Frodo. It's Mr Bilbo's trolls
sam He's going cold!
pippin Is he going to die ?
aragorn He's passing into the Shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them.
merry They're close!
aragorn Sam! Do you know the Athelas plant ?
sam Athelas ?

sam Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed!
aragorn It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!

merry Who is she?

sam She's an elf!
arwen He's fading
arwen He's not going to last. We must get him to my father.
arwen I've been looking for you for two days. There are five wraiths behind you, where the other four are I do not know
aragorn Dartho guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon.

arwen VOICE What grace has given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared
arwen VOICE Save him
elrond Lasto beth n'n. Tolo dan na ngalad.
frodo Where am I ?
gandalf You are in the House of Elrond and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the 24th, if you want to know
frodo Gandalf!
gandalf Yes, I am here and you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid, but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
frodo What happened Gandalf ?
frodo Why didn't you meet us ?
gandalf Oh, I'm sorry Frodo I was delayed
saruman_ The friendship of Sauron is not lightly thrown aside
saruman_ One ill turn deserves another it is over
saruman_ Embrace the power of the Ring, or embrace your own destruction
gandalf There is only Lord of the Ring Only one who can bend it to his will and he does not share power
saruman_ So you have chosen death
frodo Gandalf ? What is it ?
gandalf hmm Nothing Frodo
sam Frodo! Frodo!
frodo Sam!
sam Bless you
gandalf Sam has hardly left your side
sam We were that worried about you, weren't we Mr Gandalf ?
gandalf by the skills of Lord Elrond you're beginning to mend
elrond Welcome to Rivendell Frodo Baggins
frodo Bilbo!
bilbo Hello Frodo my lad
frodo Bilbo
frodo "There and Back Again... A Hobbits Tale" by Bilbo Baggins This is wonderful
bilbo I meant to go back. Wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again but age it seems has finally caught up with me
frodo I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else... off with you on one of your adventures...... My own adventure turned out to be quite different I'm not like you Bilbo
bilbo My dear boy
sam Now what have I forgotten
frodo Packed already ?
sam No harm in being prepared
frodo I thought you wanted to see the elves Sam
sam I do
frodo More than anything
sam I did. Its just We did what Gandalf wanted didn't we ? We got the Ring this far to Rivendell and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon ..... off home
frodo You're right Sam We did what we set out to do the Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home
elrond His strength returns
gandalf That wound will never fully heal, he will carry it for the rest of his life
elrond And yet to come so far, still bearing the Ring, the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil
gandalf It is a burden he should never have had to bear. we can ask no more of Frodo
elrond Gandalf! The enemy is moving Sauron's forces are massing in the east, his eye is fixed on Rivendell ..... and Saruman you tell me has betrayed us... Our list of allies grows thin!
gandalf His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men, he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and gather great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.
elrond This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard Gandalf! the Ring cannot stay here
elrond This peril belongs to all in Middle Earth they must decide now how to end.
elrond The time of the elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone ? The dwarves ? They hide in their mountains seaking riches, they care nothing for the troubles of others
gandalf It is in men we must place our hope
elrond Men! Men are weak the race of men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity all but forgotten. It is because of men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf I was there three thousand years ago when Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed Isildur hurry, follow me I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom Come!
elrond Where the Ring was forged. The one place it could be destroyed
elrond Cast it into the fire
elrond Destroy it!
isildur No
elrond Isildur!
elrond It should have ended that day but evil was allowed to endure
elrond Isildur kept the Ring. The line of Kings is broken. There's no strength left in the world of men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless
gandalf There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor
elrond He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile
boromir You are no elf
aragorn Men of the South are welcome here
boromir Who are you ?
aragorn I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey
boromir Then we are here on a common purpose friend.
boromir The shards of Narsil The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand Ah! Its still sharp but no more than a broken heirloom
arwen Why do you fear the past. You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate
aragorn The same blood flows in my veins The same weakness
arwen Your time will come. You will face the same evil and you will defeat it A si i-Dh'ath '-orthor, Aragorn. ' or le a ' or nin.
arwen Renech i lu i erui govannen? ( )
aragorn Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.
arwen Gwenwin in enninath...U-arnech in naeth i si celich. ( ) Renech i beth i pennen?
aragorn You said you would bind yourself to me foresaking the immortal life of your people
arwen and to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone
arwen I choose a mortal life
aragorn You cannot give me this
arwen It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart
elrond Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the Ring, Frodo
boromir So it's true
boromir In a dream I saw the Eastern sky grow dark In the West a pale light lingered A voice was crying, your doom is near at hand Isildur's bane is found Isildur's Bane
elrond Boromir!
gandalf Ash nazg durbatul'k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul'k agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
elrond Never before has anyone uttered words of that tongue here in Imladris
gandalf I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West The Ring is altogether evil
boromir Aye it is a gift! A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring ? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept the forces of Mordor at bey. By the of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy, let us use it against him
aragorn You cannot wield it. None of us can The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master
boromir and what would a ranger know of this matter ? LEGOLAS; This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn son of Arathorn You owe him your allegiance
boromir Aragorn! This.. is Isildur's heir
legolas and heir to the throne of Gondor
aragorn Havo dad, Legolas ( .)
boromir Gondor has no King. Gondor needs no King
gandalf Aragorn is right. We cannot use it
elrond You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.
gimli Then what are we waiting for
elrond The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came. One of you........... must do this There is silence
boromir One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful. Tis a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly
legolas Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed
gimli and I suppose you think you're the one to do it.
boromir and if we fail what then ? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ?
gimli I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf
gimli Never trust an elf
gandalf Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed
frodo I will take it I will take it I will take the Ring to Mordor Tho, I do not know the way
gandalf I will help you bear this burden Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.
aragorn If by my life or death I can protect you, I will You have my sword
legolas and you have my bow
gimli and my axe
boromir You carry the fate of us all little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done
sam Mr Frodo's not going anywhere without me
elrond No indeed it is hardly possible to seperate you, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not!
merry Wait! we're coming too!
merry You'd have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us
pippin Anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission ...........quest ..........thing
merry Well that rules you out Pip
elrond Nine companions... So be it! You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring!
pippin Great! Where are we going?
elrond IN THE BACKGROUND Anirne hene beriad i ch'n 'n. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. ( )
elrond IN THE BACKGROUND In her heart your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life
elrond but you'd never escape your fate. The skill of the elves can reforge the sword of Kings, but only you have the power to wield it.
aragorn I do not want that power, I have never wanted it
elrond You are the last of that blood line, there is no other
bilbo My old sword, Sting Here, take it, take it.
frodo Its so light!
bilbo Yes Yes Made by the elves you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close and its times like that my lad, when you have to be extra careful. Here's a pretty thing. Mithril! as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on, go on.
bilbo My my old ring. Well I should... very much like to hold it again, one last time.
bilbo I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy I'm sorry that you must carry this burden I'm sorry for everything Scene 30
elrond The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and you who travel with him, no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will Farewell. Hold to your purpose and may the blessings of elves and men , and all free folk go with you.
gandalf The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.
frodo Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ?
gandalf Left. Scene 31
gandalf We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
boromir Good, very good.
aragorn Move your feet
merry You look good Pippin
pippin Thanks
gimli If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
gandalf No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
pippin ARGH!
boromir Sorry!
merry Get him!
pippin For the Shire. Hold him, hold him down Merry!
aragorn Gentlemen, that's enough!
pippin You've got my arm... argh!... you've got my arm
sam What is that ?
gimli Nothing, its just a whisp of cloud
boromir Its moving fast.... against the wind
legolas Crebain! From Dudland!
aragorn Hide!
boromir Hurry!
aragorn Frodo! Take cover!
gandalf Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched We must take the Pass of Caradhras Scene 32
aragorn Frodo!
aragorn Boromir
boromir It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing such a little thing
aragorn Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo
boromir as you wish! I care not
saruman_ So Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go ?
saruman_ If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road
saruman_ Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya!
legolas There is a fell voice on the air
gandalf It's Saruman!
aragorn He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must turn back!
gandalf No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!
saruman_ Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar!
boromir We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!
aragorn The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
gimli If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it! Let us go through the Mines of Moria
saruman_ Moria... you fear to go into those mines.
saruman_ the dwarves delved too greadily and too deep
saruman_ You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-d'm
saruman_ Shadow, flame
gandalf Let the Ringbearer decide
boromir We cannot stay here! This will be the death of the hobbits!
gandalf Frodo ?
frodo We will go through the Mines
gandalf So be it
gandalf Frodo, come and help an old man How's your shoulder?
frodo Better than it was
gandalf and the Ring ? You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship and I fear from within.
frodo Who then do I trust ?
gandalf You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.
frodo What do you mean ?
gandalf There are many powers in this world for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested
gimli Ah! The walls of Moria!
gimli Dwarf doors are invisible when closed
gandalf Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten!
legolas Why doesn't that surprise me!
gimli Ach! GANDALF Ah... now let me see.... Ithildin It mirrors only starlight... and moonlight
gandalf It reads "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend and Enter"
merry What do you suppose that means ?
gandalf Oh it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (
gandalf Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.
pippin Nothing's happening
gandalf I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and orcs
pippin What're you going to do then ?
gandalf Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if that does not shatter them and I'm allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will try to find the opening words.
gandalf Ando Eldarinwa'a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa'
aragorn The Mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as Bill.
sam BuBye Bill
aragorn Go on, go on Don't worry Sam. He knows the way home. )
aragorn Do not disturb the water
gandalf Oh it's useless
frodo It's a riddle!
frodo Speak friend... and enter. What's the elvish word for friend ?
gandalf Mel..lon
gimli Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone!
gimli This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call it a Mine!
gimli A Mine!
boromir This isn't a mine, it's a tomb
gimli Nooooo! NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
legolas Goblins!
boromir We make for the gap of Rohan. We should never have come here
boromir Now get out of here! Get out!
merry AND PIPPIN Frodo! Frodo!
sam Strider! Get off him!
merry Aragorn!
merry Frodo!
frodo Strider!
gandalf Into the Mines!
boromir Legolas!
gandalf We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world
gandalf The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril
gandalf Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him
gimli Aww that was a Kingly gift
gandalf Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of The Shire!
merry Pippin!
gandalf I've no memory of this place
pippin Are we lost ?
merry No
pippin I think we are
sam Ssh! Gandalf's thinking
pippin Merry!
merry What!
pippin I'm hungry
frodo There's something down there
gandalf It's Gollum
frodo Gollum!
gandalf He's been following us for three days
frodo He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r!
gandalf Escaped or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story Yes he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad
frodo It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance
gandalf Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many
frodo I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
gandalf So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way
merry He's remembered
gandalf No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
gandalf Let me risk a little more light Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf.
sam There's an eye-opener and no mistake
gimli Oh!
gandalf Gimli!
gimli No, no no
gandalf Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria. He is dead then. Its as I feared.
legolas We must move on, we cannot linger.
gandalf They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming.
gandalf Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!
sam Frodo!
legolas Orcs! Boromir runs to the doors.Two arrows fly past his head, narrowly missing him, and stick into the door.
aragorn Get back! and stay close to Gandalf.
boromir They have a cave troll!
gimli Agh! Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
aragorn Pull!
sam Think I'm getting the hang of this.
aragorn Frodo!
frodo Aragorn! Aragorn!
aragorn Frodo!
sam Frodo!
sam Frodo!
aragorn Oh no!
sam He's alive!
frodo I'm alright. I'm not hurt.
aragorn You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar
gandalf I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.
gimli Mithril! You are full of surprises Master Baggins!
gandalf To the Bridge of Khazad-d'm
boromir What is this new devilment ?
gandalf A balrog, a demon of the ancient world. Its foe is beyond any of you RUN!
aragorn Gandalf!
gandalf Lead them on Aragorn. The Bridge is near!
gandalf Do as I say! Swords are of no more use here.
legolas Gandalf!
boromir Merry! Pippin!
aragorn Sam!
gimli Nobody tosses a dwarf! Mind the beard!
aragorn Steady! Hold on!
aragorn Hang on!
aragorn Lean forward!
legolas Come on!
gandalf Over the Bridge! Fly!
gandalf You cannot pass!
frodo Gandalf!
gandalf I am the Servant of the Secret Fire. Wielder of the Flame of Anor.
gandalf The dark fire will not avail you. Flame of Ud'n!
gandalf Go back to the shadow!
gandalf You shall not pass!
boromir No!
frodo Gandalf!
gandalf Fly you fools!
frodo NOOoooooooooooooo!
boromir Aragorn!
aragorn Legolas! Get them up!
boromir Give them a moment! For pities sake!
aragorn By nightfall this hills will be swarming with orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothl'rien. Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up ! On your feet Sam, Frodo ? Frodo!
gimli Stay close young hobbits.
galadriel Frodo! Frodo!
gimli ..and are never seen again
galadriel Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here! Ringbearer!
sam Mr Frodo ?
gimli Well! Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!
gimli Oh!
haldir The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
haldir Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
legolas Govannas v'n gwennen le, Haldir o L'rien.
haldir A, Aragorn in D'nedain istannen le ammen.
aragorn Haldir
gimli So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!
haldir We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark days.
gimli
aragorn That! was not so courteous!
haldir You bring great evil with you You can go no further!
aragorn Boe ammen veriad l'n. Andelu i ven!
aragorn Merin le telim.
haldir Aragorn!
aragorn Andelu i ven. .
boromir Gandalf's death was not in vain. Nor would he have you give up hope You carry a heavy burden Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead.
haldir You will follow me.
