DEAGOL Oh Smeagol Ive got one! Ive got a fish Smeagol, Smeagol! 
SMEAGOL Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in! 
DEAGOL Arrghh! 
SMEAGOL Deagol! 
SMEAGOL Deagol! 
SMEAGOL Deagol! 
SMEAGOL Give us that! Deagol my love 
DEAGOL Why? 
SMEAGOL Because� it�s my birthday and I wants it. 
SMEAGOL My precious. 
SMEAGOL They cursed us 
(GOLLUM Murderer) 
SMEAGOL �Murderer� they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. 
SMEAGOL Gollum� Gollum� Gollum� and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone. 
SMEAGOL and cool, so nice for feet� and we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet. 
SMEAGOL And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. 
GOLLUM My precious! 
GOLLUM Wake up! Wake up! Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once. 
SAM Haven�t you had any sleep Mr Frodo? 
SAM And I�ve gone and had too much. It must be getting late. 
FRODO No, it isn�t. It isn�t midday yet. The days are growing darker. 
GOLLUM Come on! Must go! No time! 
SAM Not before Mr Frodo�s had something to eat. 
GOLLUM No time to lose silly! 
SAM Here. 
FRODO What about you? 
SAM Oh no, I�m not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread. 
FRODO Sam! 
SAM Oh alright, but we don�t have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I�ve rationed it, there should be enough. 
FRODO For what? 
SAM The journey home. 
GOLLUM Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry. 
MERRY It�s good. Definitely from the Shire. Longbottom leaf eh? 
PIPPIN uhh huh I feel like I�m back at the Green Dragon. 
MERRY Mmmm Green Dragon! 
PIPPIN A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day�s work. 
MERRY Only, you�ve never done a hard day�s work. . 
PIPPIN Ahaha! 
MERRY Welcome, my lords to Isengard! 
GIMLI You young rascals. A merry hunt you�ve led us on and now we find you feasting and � and smoking! 
PIPPIN We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts The salted pork is particularly good. 
GIMLI Salted pork� 
GANDALF Hobbits! 
MERRY We�re under orders from Treebeard who�s taken over management of Isengard. 
TREEBEARD Hoooom, young master Gandalf, I�m glad you�ve come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower 
ARAGORN Show yourself. 
GANDALF Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous. 
GIMLI Well then let�s just have his head and be done with it. 
GANDALF No, we need him alive. We need him to talk. 
SARUMAN You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace you and I? 
THEODEN We shall have peace�. We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg� are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows� we shall have peace! 
SARUMAN Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess� the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D�r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards! 
GANDALF Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy�s counsel. 
SARUMAN So you have come here for information. I have some for you. Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. You are all going to die! But you know this don�t you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him� those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death. 
GIMLI I�ve heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob! 
GANDALF No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared! 
SARUMAN Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it! 
GANDALF Saruman�.. your staff is broken! 
THEODEN Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down. 
SARUMAN A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires! 
THEODEN Grima�. Come down! Be free of him! 
SARUMAN Free? He will never be free! 
GRIMA No! 
SARUMAN Get down cur! 
GRIMA Ah! 
GANDALF Saruman! You were deep in the enemy�s counsel. Tell us what you know! 
SARUMAN You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here! 
GANDALF Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike. 
TREEBEARD The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. Young trees. Wild trees. 
ARAGORN Pippin! 
TREEBEARD Bless my bark! 
GANDALF Peregrin Took. I�ll take that my lad! Quickly now! END 
END 
THEODEN Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. 
THEODEN Hail the victorious dead 
PEOPLE Hail! 
EOMER No pauses, no spills. 
GIMLI And no regurgitation! 
LEGOLAS So� it�s a drinking game? 
ROHIRRIM Aye! 
GIMLI Last one standing wins heh heh heh! 
GENERAL SHOUT Lets drink to Victory! To Victory! 
EOWYN West� Aragorn, hal . 
THEODEN I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man. 
EOWYN You are both honourable men. 
THEODEN It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. 
THEODEN Ach, don�t listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you. 
GIMLI Heh heh heh heh Here, here. Raaar it�s the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women haha 
LEGOLAS I feel something. A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it�s affecting me. 
GIMLI heh heh heh what did I say? He can�t hold his liquor. 
LEGOLAS Game over! 
MERRY and PIPPIN Oh you can search far and wide, You can drink the whole town dry, But you�ll never find a beer so brown, But you�ll never find a beer so brown, As the one we drink in our hometown, As the one we drink in our hometown. You can drink your fancy ales, You can drink them by the flagon But the only brew for the brave and true, 
MERRY Pippin! 
MERRY and PIPPIN Comes from the Green Dragon! 
MERRY Thank you! I win! 
ARAGORN No news of Frodo? 
GANDALF No word. Nothing. 
ARAGORN We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor. 
GANDALF Do we know that? 
ARAGORN What does your heart tell you? 
GANDALF That Frodo is alive. Yes� yes he�s alive. 
GOLLUM Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both! 
SMEAGOL No! 
GOLLUM Sshh, quiet, mustn�t wake them. Mustn�t ruin it now. 
SMEAGOL But they knows, they knows, they suspects us! 
GOLLUM What�s it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve? 
SMEAGOL No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them�. Dead! 
GOLLUM And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again! Its ours! Ours! 
SMEAGOL We must get the precious! We must get it back! 
GOLLUM Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her! 
SMEAGOL We lead them to the winding stair. 
GOLLUM Yes, the stairs and then? 
SMEAGOL Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel. 
GOLLUM And when they go in, there�s no coming out. She�s always hungry. She always needs to� feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. 
SMEAGOL And they doesn�t taste very nice, does they Precious? 
GOLLUM No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes then we will find it. 
SMEAGOL And take it for Meee! 
GOLLUM For us. 
SMEAGOL Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! 
SAM You treacherous little toad! 
GOLLUM No, no! Master! 
FRODO No Sam! Leave him alone! 
SAM I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. 
GOLLUM Never! Smeagol wouldn�t hurt a fly! Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! 
SAM You miserable little maggot! I�ll stove your head in! 
FRODO Sam! 
SAM Call me a liar? You�re a liar! 
GOLLUM Waaaah! 
FRODO If you scare him off then we are lost! 
SAM I don�t care! I can�t do it Mr Frodo! I won�t wait around for him to kill us! 
FRODO I�m not sending him away. 
SAM You don�t see it do you? He�s a villain. 
FRODO We can�t do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. 
SAM I�m on your side Mr Frodo 
FRODO I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol. 
EOWYN What time is it? ARAGORN Not yet dawn. 
EOWYN I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn I could only stand there, waiting. 
ARAGORN Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. 
LEGOLAS The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice The eye of the enemy is moving. 
MERRY What are you doing? 
MERRY Pippin! 
MERRY Pippin! 
MERRY Pippin! Are you mad? 
PIPPIN I just want to look at it, just one more time. 
MERRY Put it back! 
MERRY Pippin! 
MERRY No! 
MERRY Pippin! 
LEGOLAS He is here! 
SAURON I see you! 
MERRY Pippin! 
MERRY Help! Gandalf help! 
MERRY Help him! 
MERRY Pippin! 
GANDALF Fool of a Took! 
GANDALF No. 
GANDALF Look at me. 
PIPPIN Gandalf, forgive me! 
GANDALF Look at me! What did you see? 
PIPPIN A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead. The city was burning. 
GANDALF Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? 
PIPPIN I saw� I saw him! I could hear his voice in my head. 
GANDALF And what did you tell him? Speak! 
PIPPIN He asked me my name. I didn�t answer. He hurt me! 
GANDALF What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? 
GANDALF There was no lie in Pippin�s eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains. 
GANDALF He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We�ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy�s plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. 
GAN DALF His defeat at Helm�s Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war. 
THEODEN Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor? 
ARAGORN I will go! 
GANDALF No! 
ARAGORN They must be warned! 
GANDALF They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships. Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith and I wont be going alone. 
GANDALF Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry! 
PIPPIN Where are we going? 
MERRY Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? 
PIPPIN I don�t know, I can�t help it. 
MERRY You never can! 
PIPPIN I�m sorry alright? I won�t do it again. 
MERRY Don�t you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here. 
PIPPIN And you? You�re coming with me? Merry? 
MERRY Come on! 
PIPPIN How far is Minas Tirith? 
GANDALF Three days ride as the Nazg�l flies. And you�d better hope we don�t have one of those on our tail. 
MERRY Here, something for the road. 
PIPPIN The last of the Longbottom Leaf? 
MERRY I know you�ve run out. You smoke too much Pippin. 
PIPPIN But, we�ll see each other soon? 
PIPPIN Wont we? 
MERRY I don�t know! I don�t know whats going to happen. 
PIPPIN Merry? 
GANDALF Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste. 
PIPPIN Merry! 
ARAGORN Merry! 
MERRY He�s always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now he�s gone. Just like Frodo and Sam. 
ARAGORN One thing I�ve learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk. 
MERRY Foolhardy maybe. He�s a Took! END 
END 
ELROND Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Und�miel. 
ELROND There is nothing for you here only death. 
FIGWIT Lady Arwen we cannot delay. My lady! 
ARWEN Tell me what you have seen. 
ELROND Arwen. 
ARWEN You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? 
ELROND I looked into your future and I saw death. 
ARWEN But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. 
ELROND That future is almost gone. 
ARWEN But it is not lost. 
ELROND Nothing is certain. 
ARWEN Some things are certain. 
ARWEN If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time. 
ARWEN From the ashes of fire shall be woken, A light from the shadow shall spring, Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king. 
ARWEN Reforge the sword� ada. 
ELROND Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. 
ARWEN This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship now that can bear me hence. 
GANDALF We have just passed into the realm of Gondor. 
GANDALF Minas Tirith. City of Kings. 
PIPPIN It�s the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf. 
GANDALF Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. 
GANDALF Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir�s father. To give him news of his beloved son�s death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if you don�t speak at all Peregrin Took. 
GANDALF Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. 
GANDALF I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. 
DENETHOR Perhaps you come to explain this. 
DENETHOR Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead. 
PIPPIN Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. 
GANDALF Pippin. 
PIPPIN I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt. 
DENETHOR This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not? So mighty as man as he was. 
PIPPIN The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by many. 
GANDALF Get up! 
GANDALF My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor�s armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. 
DENETHOR You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship. 
GANDALF Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward. 
DENETHOR The rule of Gondor is mine and no others! 
GANDALF Come! 
GANDALF All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again. 
PIPPIN Why are they still guarding it? 
GANDALF They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay. The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. 
PIPPIN Mordor. 
GANDALF Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. 
PIPPIN A storm is coming. 
GANDALF This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron�s making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin. 
PIPPIN Well� Minas Tirith� very impressive. So where are off to next? 
GANDALF Oh, it�s too late for that Peregrin. There�s no leaving this city. Help must come to us. END 
END 
SAM It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. 
GOLLUM We�re not in decent places. 
SAM Mr Frodo?  What is it? 
FRODO It�s just a feeling.  I don�t think I�ll be coming back. 
SAM Yes you will.  Of course you will.  That�s just morbid thinking.  We�re going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.  You�ll see. 
FRODO I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor. 
FRODO Long ago, when there was a King. 
SAM Mr Frodo, look!  The King has got a crown again. 
GOLLUM Come on, Hobbits!  Mustn�t stop now.   This way! 
PIPPIN So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don�t actually expect me to do any fighting,   do they? 
GANDALF You�re in the service of the steward now.  You�ll have to do as you are told Peregrin Took. 
GANDALF Ridiculous Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel! 
GANDALF Thank you. 
PIPPIN There�s no more stars!  Is it time? 
GANDALF Yes. 
PIPPIN It�s so quiet. 
GANDALF It�s the deep breath before the plunge. 
PIPPIN I don�t want to be in a battle.  But waiting on the edge of one I can�t escape is even worse. Is there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam? 
GANDALF There never was much hope.  Just a fool�s hope. Our enemy is ready. His full strength�s gathered.   Not only orcs, but men as well Legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast All will answer Mordor�s call. 
CAPTAIN Come on! 
GANDALF This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.    Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone. 
PIPPIN But we have the white wizard.  That�s got to count for something. 
PIPPIN Gandalf? 
GANDALF Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant. The one who will lead Mordor�s army in war. The one they say no living man can kill. The Witch King of Angmar. You�ve met him before. He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. He is the lord of the Nazg�l.  The greatest of the nine. 
GOLLUM The Dead City!  Very nasty place full of enemies. 
GOLLUM Quick, quick!  They will see, they will see! 
GOLLUM Come away, come away.  Look we have found it.  The way into Mordor. 
GOLLUM The secret stair.  Climb. 
SAM No!  Mr Frodo 
GOLLUM Not that way! 
GOLLUM Whats it doing? 
SAM No! 
FRODO They�re calling me. 
SAM No! 
GOLLUM Hide, hide! 
FRODO I can feel his blade. 
GANDALF We come to it at last. The great battle of our time. 
GOLLUM Come away Hobbits.  We climb.  We must climb. 
GANDALF The board is set, the pieces are moving. 
GOLLUM Up, up, up the stairs we go.  And then it�s into the tunnel. 
SAM Hey,  what�s in this tunnel? You listen to me!  You listen good and proper.  Anything happens to him, you�ll have me to answer to.   One sniff that something�s not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over.  No more slinker, no more stinker. You�re gone.  Got it?  I�m watching you. 
FRODO What was that about? 
SAM Nothing.  Just clearing something up. END 
END 
GANDALF Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done.  Another opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me. 
FARAMIR It�s been very quiet across the river. 
MADRIL The Orcs are lying low.  The garrison may have moved out.  We�ve sent scouts to Cair Andros.  If the Orcs attack from the North, we�ll have some warning. 
GOTHMOG Quiet. 
SOLDIER We need 10 more. 
GOTHMOG Kill him. 
FARAMIR They�re not coming from the North!  To the river quick, quick! 
DAMROD Go,  come on! 
GOTHMOG Faster! Draw swords. 
SOLDIER Hold!  Hold them! 
SOLDIER What? 
GANDALF Amon D�n. 
SOLDIER The beacon!  The beacon of Amon D�n is lit. 
GANDALF Hope is kindled! 
ARAGORN The beacons of Minas Tirith!  The beacons are lit! 
ARAGORN Gondor calls for aid. 
THEODEN And Rohan will answer!  Muster the Rohirrim. Assemble the army at Dunharrow,  as many men as can be found.  You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor� and war. 
EOMER Forward! 
SOLDIER Very good sir. 
THEODEN Gamling. 
GAMLING My lord! 
THEODEN Make haste across the Riddermark.  Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow. 
GAMLING I will. 
ARAGORN Do you ride with us? 
EOWYN Just to the encampment.  It�s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. The men have found their captain.  They will follow you into battle.  Even to death.  You have given us hope. 
MERRY Excuse me! I have a sword.  Please accept it! I offer you my service Theoden King. 
THEODEN And gladly, I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan. 
GIMLI Horse men!  I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy. 
LEGOLAS Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.  I fear war already marches on their own lands. 
THEODEN 
EOMER Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan.  Oaths you have taken.  Now fulfil them all, to Lord and Land!  Hah! END 
END 
MADRIL We can�t hold them.  The city is lost. 
FARAMIR Tell the men to break cover.  We ride for Minas Tirith. 
DAMROD Nazg�l! 
FARAMIR Take cover!  Nazgul!  Fall back.  Fall back to Minas Tirith! 
FARAMIR Fall back! Retreat!  Retreat!  Run for your lives! 
GOTHMOG The age of men is over.  The time of the Orc has come. 
SOLDIERS Keep going.  It�s the Nazgul.  Take cover my lord. It�s coming. 
SOLDIERS IN MINAS TIRITH Its Mithrandir!  The White Rider! 
SOLDIER Pull! 
FARAMIR Mithrandir! They broke through our defences.  They�ve taken the bridge and the West bank.  Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. 
IROLAS It is as the Lord Denethor predicted!  Long has he foreseen this doom! 
GANDALF Foreseen and done nothing! 
GANDALF Faramir?  This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path. 
FARAMIR No. 
PIPPIN You�ve seen Frodo and Sam? 
GANDALF Where?  When? 
FARAMIR In Ithilien.  Not two days ago.  Gandalf, they�re taking the road to the Morgul vale. 
GANDALF And then the pass of Cirith Ungol. 
PIPPIN What does that mean? What�s wrong?  He looks at Gandalf. 
GANDALF Faramir tell me everything.  Tell me all you know. 
DENETHOR This is how you would serve your city?  You would risk its utter ruin? 
FARAMIR I did what I judged to be right. 
DENETHOR What you judged to be right!  You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling!  It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. Hidden.  Dark and deep in the vaults� not to be used. unless, at the uttermost end of need. 
FARAMIR I would not use the Ring.  Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her. 
DENETHOR Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old. Boromir would have remembered his father�s need.   He would have brought me a kingly gift 
FARAMIR Boromir would not have brought the Ring.   He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen. 
DENETHOR You know nothing of this matter! 
FARAMIR He would have kept it for his own.  And when he returned you would not have known your son. 
DENETHOR Boromir was loyal to me!   Not some wizard�s pupil. 
FARAMIR Father? 
DENETHOR My son! Leave me! 
GOLLUM Careful master!  Careful.   Very far to fall.  Very dangerous are the stairs. 
GOLLUM Come master. 
GOLLUM Come to Smeagol. 
SAM Mr Frodo! Get back you!  Don�t touch him. 
GOLLUM Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master? Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.  Fat one cannot know. He wants it.  He needs it.  Smeagol sees it in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for it.  You will see.   The fat one will take it from you! 
WITCH KING Send forth all legions.  Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. 
WITCH KING Slay them all! 
GOTHMOG What of the wizard? 
WITCH KING I will break him. 
SOLDIER 1 Where are Theoden�s riders? 
SOLDIER 2 Will Rohan�s army come?  Mithrandir? 
GANDALF Courage is the best defence that you have now. END 
END 
PIPPIN What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men? 
FARAMIR It was well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. You are to join the tower guard. 
PIPPIN I didn�t think they would find any livery that would  fit me. 
FARAMIR It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies. 
PIPPIN This was yours? 
FARAMIR Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me. 
PIPPIN Well, I�m taller than you were then.  Though, I�m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. 
FARAMIR It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike he and my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong. 
PIPPIN I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father will see it. 
PIPPIN Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living or dying, from � from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me. 
DENETHOR And I shall not forget it! nor fail to reward  that which is given. Fealty with love. Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance. I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences that your brother long held intact. 
FARAMIR What would you have me do? 
DENETHOR I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be retaken. 
FARAMIR My lord Osgiliath is over run. 
DENETHOR Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lord�s will? 
FARAMIR You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and Boromir had lived. 
DENETHOR Yes, I wish that. 
FARAMIR Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead. If I should return, think better of me father. 
DENETHOR That will depend on the manner of your return. 
GOLLUM Ech! 
SAM What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we? 
GOLLUM Sneaking?  Sneaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.  Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say �sneak!�  Sneak? Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice! 
SAM Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing? 
GOLLUM Sneaking. 
SAM Fine, have it your own way. I�m sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on. 
FRODO It�s dark still. 
SAM It�s always dark here. It�s gone! The elven bread! 
FRODO What?  That�s all we have left! 
SAM He took it.  He must have. 
GOLLUM Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.  Smeagol hates nasty elf bread. 
SAM You�re a lying rat!  What did you do with it? 
FRODO He doesn�t eat it. He can�t have taken it. 
GOLLUM Look, what�s this? Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it! He took it! I�ve seen him, he�s always stuffing his face when master�s not looking. 
SAM That�s a filthy lie! You stinking, two faced sneak! 
FRODO Sam! 
SAM Call me� 
FRODO Stop it! 
SAM I�ll kill him! 
FRODO Sam, no! 
SAM Oh my!   I�m sorry.  I didn�t mean it to go so far.  I was just so, so angry!  Here just� let�s just rest a bit. 
FRODO I�m all right. 
SAM No.  No you�re not all right, you�re exhausted.  It�s that Gollum.  It�s this place.  It�s that thing around your neck. I could help a bit.  I could carry it for a while , carry it for a while I could carry it� I could carry it� Share the load� share the load� share the load 
FRODO Get away! 
SAM I don�t want to keep it. I just want to help. 
GOLLUM See?  See?  He wants it for himself. 
SAM Shut up you! Go away!  Get out of here! 
FRODO No Sam!  It�s you! I�m sorry Sam. 
SAM But he�s a liar!  He�s poisoned you against me. 
FRODO You can�t help me any more. 
SAM You don�t mean that. 
FRODO Go home. 
GANDALF Faramir!  Faramir! Your father�s will has turned to madness.  Do not throw away your life so rashly. 
FARAMIR Where does my allegiance lie if not here?  This is the city of the men of N�menor.  I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory, her wisdom. 
GANDALF Your father loves you Faramir. He will remember it before the end. 
DENETHOR Can you sing Master Hobbit? 
PIPPIN well, yes.  At least well enough for my own people.  But we have no songs for great halls and evil times. 
DENETHOR And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?  Come, sing me a song. 
PIPPIN Home is behind, The world ahead, And there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall �fade. 
ORCS March, march!   March, march march! END

SOLDIER Make way for the King!  Make way, the King is here 
SOLDIER My lord! 
SOLDIER Hail to you sire! THEODEN Grimbold, how many? 
GRIMBOLD I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord. 
SOLDIER We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King. 
THEODEN Where are the riders from Snowbourn? 
SOLDIER None have come my lord. 
THEODEN Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for. 
ARAGORN Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. 
THEODEN More will come 
ARAGORN Every hour lost hastens Gondor�s defeat. We have until dawn then we must ride. 
LEGOLAS The horses are restless and the men are quiet. 
EOMER They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. 
GIMLI That road there where does that lead? 
LEGOLAS It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain. 
EOMER None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil. 
GIMLI Aragorn! Let�s find some food. 
EOWYN There.  A true esquire of Rohan. 
MERRY I�m ready! Sorry.  It isn�t all that dangerous.  It�s not even sharp. EOWYN Well that�s no good.  You wont kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.  Come on. 
EOWYN To the smithy, go! 
EOMER You should not encourage him. 
EOWYN You should not doubt him. 
EOMER I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. 
EOWYN Why should Merry be left behind?  He has as much cause to go to war as you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves? 
EOMER You know as little of war as that Hobbit.   When the fear takes him and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold.  Do you think he would stand and fight?  He would flee.  And he would be right to do so. War is the province of men Eowyn. ARWEN I choose a mortal life. I wish I could have seen him one last time. 
SOLDIER Sir?  King Theoden awaits you my lord. 
THEODEN I take my leave. 
ARAGORN My lord Elrond 
ELROND I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is failing.  As Sauron�s power grows her strength wanes.  Arwen�s life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has come. 
ARAGORN It will not be our end, but his. 
ELROND You ride to war but not to victory.  Sauron�s armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know. But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be in the city in two days.  You�re outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men. 
ARAGORN There are none. 
ELROND There are those that dwell in the mountain. 
ARAGORN Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight?  They believe in nothing.  They answer to no one 
ELROND They will answer to the King of Gondor. And�ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil. 
ARAGORN Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil. 
ARAGORN The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith. 
ELROND The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become who you were born to be �nen i-Estel Edain. 
ARAGORN �-chebin Estel anim. 
EOWYN Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men. 
ARAGORN Eowyn� 
EOWYN We need you here. 
ARAGORN Why have you come? 
EOWYN Do you not know? 
ARAGORN It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what you seek. 
ARAGORN I have wished you joy since first I saw you. 
GIMLI Just where do you think you�re off to? 
ARAGORN Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli. 
GIMLI Hmmmm 
LEGOLAS Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves? 
GIMLI You might as well accept it.  We�re going with you laddie.  Aragorn smiles. 
SOLDIER What�s happening, where is he going?  I don�t understand.  ( Lord Aragorn!  Why does he leave on the eve of battle? 
GAMLING He leaves because there is no hope. 
THEODEN He leaves because he must. 
GAMLING To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor. 
THEODEN No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. 
THEODEN I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the battle goes ill. 
EOWYN What other duty would you have me do my lord? 
THEODEN Duty? no. I would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed � and no more despair END 
END 
GIMLI What kind of army would linger in such a place? 
LEGOLAS One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor�s need was dire, they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight, the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead. 
GIMLI The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. 
LEGOLAS The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it. The way is shut. 
ARAGORN Brego! 
ARAGORN I do not fear death! 
GIMLI Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, I�d never hear the end of it. 
THEODEN We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. 
THEODEN Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc. 
MERRY All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind. 
THEODEN It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burdon. 
MERRY I want to fight! 
THEODEN I will say no more. 
EOWYN Ride with me! 
MERRY My lady! 
EOMER Form up, move out! Form up, move out! 
THEODEN Ride! Ride now to Gondor. 
GIMLI What is it? What do you see? 
LEGOLAS I see shapes of men and of horses. 
GIMLI Where? 
LEGOLAS Pale banners like shreds of cloud. Spears rise like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They have been summoned. 
GIMLI The dead? Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. Very good. Very good. Legolas! 
ARAGORN Do not look down. 
KING OF THE DEAD Who enters my domain? 
ARAGORN One who will have your allegiance. 
KING OF THE DEAD The dead do not suffer the living to pass. 
ARAGORN You will suffer me! 
KING OF THE DEAD The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep it.  The way is shut! Now you must die! 
ARAGORN I summon you to fulfil your oath! 
KING OF THE DEAD None but the King of Gondor may command me! 
KING OF THE DEAD That blade was broken! 
ARAGORN It has been remade. Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? What say you? 
GIMLI Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they have none now in death. 
ARAGORN I am Isildur�s heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled. What say you? 
ARAGORN You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death! What say you? 
GIMLI Stand you traitors! 
ARAGORN Out! 
ARAGORN Legolas! Run! 
KING OF THE DEAD We fight! 
SOLDIER Open the gate, quick! 
IROLAS Quick! Hurry! 
DENETHOR Faramir! Say not that he has fallen. 
IROLAS They were outnumbered! None survived.

GANDALF Bring them down! 
GANDALF Fight them back! Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel. 
PIPPIN They called us out to fight. 
GANDALF This is no place for a Hobbit! 
GANDALF Guard of the Citadel indeed! Now back up the hill quickly. Quick! 
GOTHMOG What are you doing you useless scum? 
ORC The door wont give. It�s too strong. 
GOTHMOG Get back there and smash it down! 
ORC But nothing can breach it! 
GOTHMOG Grond will breach it! Bring out the wolf�s head.

ARAGORN You may go no further. 
ARAGORN You will not enter Gondor 
BOSON Who are you to deny us passage? 
ARAGORN Legolas, fire a warning shot past the boson�s ear. 
GIMLI Mind your aim. 
GIMLI Oh! That�s it, right, we warned you! Prepare to be boarded! 
MERCENARY Boarded, by you and whose army? 
ARAGORN This army. 
GOLLUM In there. 
FRODO What is this place? 
GOLLUM Master must go inside the tunnel. 
FRODO Now that I�m here I don�t think I want to. 
GOLLUM It�s the only way. Go in� or go back. 
FRODO I can�t go back. 
FRODO What�s that smell. 
GOLLUM Orcses� filth. Orcses come in here sometimes. 
GOLLUM Hurry! This way. 
FRODO Smeagol? 
GOLLUM Over here. 
FRODO Ah aah! Its sticky, what is it? 
GOLLUM You�ll see. Oh yes, you will see. 
FRODO Smeagol?  SMEAGOL! SMEAGOL! 
FRODO Sam. 
SAM Ow! 
GALADRIEL And you Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of E�rendil, our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. 
FRODO Aiya E�rendil Elenion Ancalim� 
GOLLUM Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? Caught in a web. Soon you�ll be eaten. 
GOLLUM Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time. 
FRODO NO! 
SMEAGOL It wasn�t us. It wasn�t us. Smeagol wouldn�t hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it. 
FRODO I have to destroy it Smeagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes. 
GOLLUM NO! Aaaaaaaaa. 
FRODO I�m so sorry Sam. I�m so sorry. 
GALADRIEL This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way, no one will. 
EOMER The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level�s in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance. 
THEODEN Time is against us. Make ready! 
EOWYN Take heart Merry. It will soon be over 
MERRY My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds�but I�m not. I�m a Hobbit. And I know I can�t save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again. 
EOMER Prepare to move out! 
THEODEN Make haste. We ride through the night. 
EOWYN To battle 
MERRY To battle 
GANDALF Back to the gate! Hurry! END

DENETHOR I am steward of the house of An�rion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep. 
DENETHOR Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must. 
DENETHOR No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. Bring wood and oil.

SHAGRAT No. This fellow ain�t dead. 
SAM Not dead. 
SHAGRAT She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa� then she has her way with them. That�s how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower! 
SAM Samwise you fool. 
ORC This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. 
SHAGRAT Then he�ll wish he�d never been born. 
DENETHOR The house of his spirit crumbles. He is burning. Already burning. 
PIPPIN He�s not dead. HE�S NOT DEAD NO! NO! He�s not dead.

SHAGRAT I�m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig! 
SAM Not if I stick you first! 
FRODO Sam! 
FRODO Oh Sam, I�m so sorry.  Sorry for everything. 
SAM Let�s get you out of here. 
FRODO It�s too late.  It�s over.  They�ve taken it Sam,  they took the Ring! 
SAM Begging your pardon but they haven�t. 
SAM I thought I�d lost you.  So I took it, only for safekeeping. 
FRODO Give it to me! Give me the Ring Sam. Sam!  Give me the Ring. You must understand.  The Ring is my burden.  It will destroy you Sam. 
SAM Come on Mr Frodo.  We�d best find you some clothes.  You can�t go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin. 
SAM We did it Mr Frodo.  We made it to Mordor. 
FRODO There are so many of them.  We�ll never get through unseen. 
FRODO It�s Him, the Eye! 
SAM We have to go in there Mr Frodo.  There�s nothing for it. Come on let�s just make it down the hill for starters. 
GANDALF Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. 
ARAGORN If Sauron had the Ring we would know it. 
GANDALF It�s only a matter of time.  He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. 
GIMLI Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care? 
GANDALF Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. 
GANDALF I�ve sent him to his death. 
ARAGORN No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth.  We can give him that. 
GIMLI How? 
ARAGORN Draw out Sauron�s armies.  Empty his lands.   Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. 
EOMER We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. 
ARAGORN Not for ourselves.  But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron�s eye fixed upon us.   Keep him blind to all else that moves. 
LEGOLAS A diversion. 
GIMLI Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for? 
GANDALF Sauron will suspect a trap.  He will not take the bait. 
ARAGORN Oh, I think he will. 
ARAGORN Long have you hunted me.  Long have I eluded you.  No more! Behold, the Sword of Elendil! END

GENERAL Oy!  I�ll have your guts if you don�t shut this rabble down! 
FRODO Go Sam.  Now! 
GENERAL Move along scum! 
CAPTAIN Get back in the line you maggots!  Get back in the line you slugs! 
FRODO I can�t!  I can�t� I can�t manage the Ring Sam.  It�s� it�s� such a weight to carry.  It�s such a weight. 
SAM We�re going that way, straight as we can.  There�s no point carrying anything we�re not sure to need. 
SAM Mr Frodo, look. There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch. 
SAM Take mine. There�s a few drops left. 
FRODO There will be none left for the return journey. 
SAM I don�t think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo. 
SAM Frodo, get down! Hide! 
SAM Frodo!

MOUTH OF SAURON My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome. 
MOUTH OF SAURON Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? 
GANDALF We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed.    Tell your master this.  The armies of Mordor must disband.  He is to depart these lands, never to return. 
MOUTH OF SAURON Aha!  Old Greybeard!  I have a token I was bidden to show thee. 
PIPPIN Frodo! 
PIPPIN Frodo! 
GANDALF Silence! 
MERRY No! 
GANDALF Silence! 
MOUTH OF SAURON The Halfling was dear to thee I see.  Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.  Who would�ve thought one so small could endure so much pain?  And he did Gandalf, he did. 
MOUTH OF SAURON And who is this?  Isildur�s heir?  It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade. 
GIMLI I guess that concludes negotiations. 
ARAGORN I do not believe it.  I will not. END 
END 
ARAGORN Pull back! Pull back! 
SAM It�s gone Mr Frodo. The light�s passed on, away towards the North. Something�s drawn its gaze. 
ARAGORN Hold your ground! Hold your ground! 
ARAGORN Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers.  I see it in your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! 
ARAGORN By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West! 
GIMLI Never thought I�d die fighting side by side with an elf. 
LEGOLAS What about side by side with a friend? 
GIMLI Aye! I could do that. 
SAM Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields, and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? 
FRODO No Sam. I can�t recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the touch of grass. I�m naked in the dark. There�s� there�s nothing, no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him with my waking eyes! 
SAM Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can�t carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on! 
EYE OF SAURON Aragorn! Elessar! 
ARAGORN For Frodo. 
SAM Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We�re almost there! 
GOLLUM Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn�t go that way. Mustn�t hurt the precious! 
FRODO You swore! You swore on the precious! 
FRODO Smeagol promised! 
GOLLUM Smeagol lied! 
SAM AAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhh! 
GOLLUM AAAAAHH 
SAM Frodo! END 
END 
PIPPIN The eagles! The eagles are coming! 
SAM Frodo! 
FRODO I�m here Sam! 
SAM Destroy it! 
SAM Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! 
SAM What are you waiting for? Just let it go! 
FRODO The Ring is mine! 
SAM No! 
SAM Nooooooo! 
GOLLUM Yeees! Yeees! Precious! My Precious! 
SAM Give me your hand. 
SAM Take my hand. 
SAM No! Don�t you let go! Don�t let go! Reeeaaach! 
MERRY Frodo! Frodo! 
PIPPIN Frodo. 
FRODO It�s gone. It�s done. 
SAM Yes Mr Frodo. It�s over now. 
FRODO I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf�s fireworks. The lights on the party tree. 
SAM Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have been her. It would�ve been her. 
FRODO I�m glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things. They hug. END 
END 
FRODO Gandalf? 
FRODO Oooohhh! 
MERRY Frodo! 
GIMLI Aaaahh! 
FRODO Gimli! 
FRODO Aragorn! 
GANDALF Now come the days of the King. May they be blessed. 
ARAGORN This day does not belong to one man, but to all. Let us together rebuild this world, that we may share in the days of peace. 
ARAGORN Et E�rello Endorenna ut�lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn� Ambar-metta! 
ARAGORN Hannon le. 
ARAGORN My friends, you bow to no-one. 
FRODO And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended. Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. 
FRODO We were home. 
PIPPIN Alright! 
HOBBIT Hey watch the pumpkin. 
ROSIE Goodnight lads. 
PIPPIN Hmm? 
FRODO How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken hold. 
SAM Mr Frodo? What is it? 
FRODO It�s been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It�s never really healed. 
SAM There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it. 
FRODO Not quite. There�s room for a little more. 
FRODO Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must come and go in the telling. Bilbo�s story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him. save one. 
BILBO Tell me again lad, where are we going? 
FRODO To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place on the last ship to leave Middle Earth. 
BILBO Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you? 
FRODO I�m sorry uncle. I�m afraid I lost it. 
BILBO Oh, pity.  I would have like to have held it one last time. 
BILBO Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before. 
GALADRIL The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of men. 
ELROND I Aear c�n ven na mar. 
BILBO I think I�m quite ready for another adventure. 
GANDALF Farewell my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil. It is time Frodo. 
SAM What does he mean? 
FRODO We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me. 
SAM You don�t mean that. You can�t leave. 
FRODO The last pages are for you Sam. 
FRODO My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on. 
SAM Well, I�m back. END
