gandalf You cannot pass!
frodo Gandalf!
gandalf I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
gandalf You shall not pass!
boromir No! No!
frodo Gandalf!
gandalf Fly, you fools!
frodo No!Gandalf!
frodo Gandalf!
sam What is it, Mr. Frodo?
frodo Nothing. Just a dream.
sam Can you see the bottom?
frodo No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!
sam Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
sam Mr. Frodo!
frodo I think I've found the bottom.
sam Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it.
frodo What's in this?
sam Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
frodo Roast chicken?!
sam You never know.
frodo Sam. My dear Sam.
sam It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire.
frodo It is special. It's a little bit of home.
frodo We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
sam Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry.
frodo Real Elvish rope.
sam Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer. And it's the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
frodo He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam......but they did.
sam Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?
frodo It's getting heavier.
frodo What food have we got left?
sam Let me see.Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread.
sam I don't usually hold with foreign food.....but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
frodo Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
sam Those rain clouds might.
sam This looks strangely familiar.
frodo It's because we've been here before. We're going in circles.
sam What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
frodo Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone.
gollum The thieves............... The thieves. The filthy little thieves. Where is it?............. Where is it? They stole it from us............. My precious......... Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
frodo This is Sting. You've seen it before......haven't you, Gollum? Release him or I'll cut your throat.
gollum Yessssss
gollum It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it.
gollum Take it off us!
sam Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
gollum No! That would kill us! Kill us!
sam It's no more than you deserve!
frodo Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him.
gollum We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears.
frodo There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
gollum We swears......to serve the master ........... of the precious. We will swear on.....on the precious, Gollum. Gollum.
frodo The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
gollum Yes......on the precious.....On the precious.
sam I don't believe you!
sam Get down! I said, down!
frodo Sam!
sam He's trying to trick us. If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep
frodo You know the way to Mordor?
gollum Yes.
frodo You've been there before?
gollum Yes.
frodo You will lead us to the Black Gate
gollum To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
gollum No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
gollum But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
gollum No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
sam Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises
gollum This way, Hobbits. Follow me!
pippin Merry! Merry!
grishnakh You're late Our master grows impatient.He wants the Shire-rats now.
ugluk I don't take orders from Orc-maggots. Saruman will have his prize. We will deliver them.
pippin Merry! Merry? Wake up
pippin My friend is sick. He needs water. Please!
URUK#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HAI Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!
pippin Stop it!
URUK#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HAI Can't take his draught!
pippin Leave him alone!
URUK#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HAI Why? You want some?
URUK#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HAI Then keep your mouth shut.
pippin Merry.
merry Hello, Pip.
pippin You're hurt.
merry I'm fine. lt was just an act.
pippin An act?
merry See? I fooled you too. Don't worry about me, Pippin.
ugluk What is it? What do you smell?
URUK#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HAI Man-flesh
ugluk They've picked up our trail.
pippin Aragorn.
ugluk Let's move!
aragorn Their pace has quickened. They must have caught our scent. Hurry!
legolas Come on, Gimli!
gimli Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
aragorn Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
legolas They may yet be alive.
aragorn Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
legolas Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
gimli I'm wasted on cross-country. We Dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances.
aragorn Rohan. Home of the Horse-lords. There's something strange at work here.Some evil gives speed to these creatures. Sets its will against us.
aragorn Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
legolas The Uruks turn northeast. They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard.
aragorn Saruman.
saruman_ The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard......and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman......and the union of the two towers?
saruman_ Together, my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
saruman_ The Old World will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...... and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.
saruman_ I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 But, my lord, there are too many! They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
saruman_ Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
saruman_ The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it.
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Yes.
wildman_ We will fight for you.
saruman_ Swear it. The Wildman cuts his palm
wildman_ We will die for Saruman.
saruman_ The Horse-Men took your lands. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
wildman_ Murderers!
saruman_ Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village!
saruman_ We have only to remove those who oppose us. It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.
morwen Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two. FREDA Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf. He is too big for him.
morwen Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?
eothain Yes, Mama.
freda I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.
morwen Freda, I will find you there. Morwen glances at the running people and sees the masses of Wildmen coming into the village
morwen Quickly! Go, child. As the children look back they see the village being burnt and the villagers being attacked by Wildmen and Uruk-hai
saruman_ Rohan, my lord......is ready to fall.
eomer Theodred. Find the king's son!
ROHAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HORSEMAN Mordor will pay for this
eomer These Orcs are not from Mordor.
ROHAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 HORSEMAN My Lord Eomer, over here!
eomer He's alive.
eowyn Theodred.
eowyn Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
eomer He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force
wormtongue_ That is a lie. Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
theoden Grima. Grima. Grima.
eomer Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman
wormtongue_ Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent......your warmongering.
eomer Warmongering? How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
eomer Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps.
wormtongue_ You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
wormtongue_ Too much. You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan......and all its domains under pain of death.
eomer You have no authority here. Your orders mean nothing.
wormtongue_ This order does not come from me. It comes from the king. He signed it this morning.
gimli Keep breathing. That's the key. Breathe.
legolas They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 We're not going no further......until we've had a breather.
ugluk Get a fire going!
pippin Merry! Merry!
merry I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
pippin What's making that noise?
merry It's the trees.
pippin What?
merry You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall......and come alive.
pippin Alive?
merry Trees that could whisper......talk to each other......even move.
URUK-HAI#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 I'm starving. We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
snaga Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?! What about them? They're fresh.
ugluk They are not for eating.
grishnakh What about their legs? They don't need those.
grishnakh They look tasty.
ugluk Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.
grishnakh Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport?
ugluk They have something. An Elvish weapon. The master wants it for the war.
pippin They think we have the Ring.
merry Ssh! As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
snaga Just a mouthful... ...a bit of the flank.
ugluk Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
merry Pippin. Let's go.
grishnakh Go on. Call for help. Squeal. No one's going to save you now.
merry Pippin!
pippin Aaaaaaaagh!
legolas A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.
aragorn Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark?
eomer What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!
gimli Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
eomer I would cut off your head, Dwarf......if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
legolas You would die before your stroke fell.
aragorn I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
eomer Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. Not even his own kin. Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king......and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there, they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked. And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
aragorn We are no spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They have taken two of our friends captive.
eomer The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
gimli But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them?
aragorn They would be small. Only children to your eyes.
eomer We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them.
gimli Dead?
eomer I am sorry.
eomer Hasufel! Arod! May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
eomer Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands. We ride north!
gimli It's one of their wee belts.
legolas Hiro hyn h'dh' ab 'wanath...
aragorn Aaaaagh!
gimli We failed them.
aragorn A Hobbit lay here. And the other.
aragorn They crawled. Their hands were bound.
aragorn Their bonds were cut.
aragorn They ran over here. They were followed
merry The belt! Run!
aragorn Tracks lead away from the battle...
aragorn ...into Fangorn Forest.
gimli Fangorn? What madness drove them in there?
pippin Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Come here!
merry Trees. Climb a tree.
merry He's gone.
pippin Merry! Pippin looks down in horror at Merry, as he turns around he notices two eyes looking at him
treebeard Hooom!
merry Aaagh!
ORC#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
pippin Run, Merry!
treebeard Little Orcs.
pippin It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.
treebeard Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent.
merry A tree-herder. A shepherd of the forest.
pippin Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it!
treebeard Treebeard, some call me.
pippin And whose side are you on?
treebeard Side? I am on nobody's side......because nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
merry We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
treebeard Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire. They come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
merry No! You don't understand. We're Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-folk!
treebeard Maybe you are......and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know.
pippin The White Wizard?
merry Saruman. Treebeard puts them down and they look up to see the White Wizard.
gollum See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit.
sam It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.
gollum A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
sam I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
gollum No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious!
frodo Here.
gollum What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve!
sam Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
gollum Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go.
frodo Don't touch me!
sam There are dead things! Dead faces in the water.
gollum All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights.
gollum Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones......and light little candles of their own.
sam Frodo!
frodo Gollum?
gollum Don't follow the lights.
frodo Gollum!
sam Mr. Frodo! Are you all right?
gollum So bright. So beautiful.
gollum Our precious.
frodo What did you say?
gollum Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
frodo Who are you?
gollum Mustn't ask us. Not its business. Gollum. Gollum.
frodo Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
gollum Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travellers far from home
frodo He said your life was a sad story.
gollum They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
frodo You were not so very different from a Hobbit once. Were you? Smeagol.
gollum What did you call me?
frodo That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.
gollum My name. My name. Smeagol.
gollum Aagh!
sam Black Riders!
gollum Hide! Hide!
frodo Aagh!
frodo Aagh!
sam Come on, Frodo. Come on!
gollum Quick! They will see us! They will see us!
sam I thought they were dead.
gollum Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
gollum Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it.They are calling for the precious.
sam Mr. Frodo! It's all right. I'm here.
gollum Hurry, Hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.
gimli Orc blood.
aragorn These are strange tracks.
gimli The air is so close in here.
legolas This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory......and anger.
legolas The trees are speaking to each other.
aragorn Gimli! Lower your axe.
gimli oh!
legolas They have feelings, my friend. The Elves began it. Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
gimli Talking trees. What do trees have to talk about? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
legolas Aragorn, nad no ennas
aragorn Man cenich?
legolas The White Wizard approaches.
aragorn Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
aragorn We must be quick.
WHITE#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 WIZARD You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
aragorn Where are they? WHITE WIZARD They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
aragorn Who are you? Show yourself!
aragorn It cannot be.
legolas Forgive me.
legolas I mistook you for Saruman.
gandalf I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
aragorn You fell.
gandalf Through fire.....and water.
gandalf From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...... I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
gandalf Until at last I threw down my enemy......and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
gandalf Darkness took me......and I strayed out of thought and time.
gandalf Stars wheeled overhead......and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. The white light fades and Gandalf is seen lying naked in the snow. His wounds are healed his hair and beard are snowy white. He gasps
gandalf I've been sent back...... until my task is done.
aragorn Gandalf.
gandalf Gandalf? Yes. That was what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.
gimli Gandalf.
gandalf I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now......at the turn of the tide.
gandalf One stage of your journey is over. Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
gimli Edoras? That is no short distance!
aragorn We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.
gandalf Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
gimli Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here......in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--? I mean, charming......quite charming forest.
gandalf It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones......that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
aragorn In one thing you have not changed, dear friend. You still speak in riddles.
gandalf A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up.....and find that they are strong.
gimli Strong?! Oh, that's good.
gandalf So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf. Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
gimli This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
legolas That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
gandalf Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friend through many dangers. In Fangorn. Merry and Pippin are sitting in Treebeard's branches, as he walks through the forest. Treebeard is reciting
treebeard
merry ls it much further?
treebeard Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty. You might call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe. And safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one too. It's one of my own compositions. Right.
treebeard Sleep, little Shirelings. Heed no nightly noise. Sleep till morning light. I have business in the forest. There are many to call. Many that must come. The Shadow lies on Fangorn. The withering of all woods is drawing near.
gandalf The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no rival. From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has reached him. The heir of Numenor still lives.
gandalf Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears what you may become. And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men. He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War is coming. Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall. The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's. His hold over King Theoden is now very strong. Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose. But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden. And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet entered their darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit. Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo. Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest.
gandalf Do not regret your decision to leave him. Frodo must finish this task alone.
aragorn He's not alone. Sam went with him.
gandalf Did he? Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good.
gollum The Black Gate of Mordor.
sam Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
gollum Master says to show him the way into Mordor. So good Smeagol does, master says so.
frodo I did.
sam That's it, then. We can't get past that.
sam Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down.
frodo Sam, no!
gollum Master!
frodo I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
sam I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
frodo Now!
gollum No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it.
gollum No! There's another way. More secret. A dark way.
sam Why haven't you spoken of this before?
gollum Because master did not ask.
sam He's up to something.
frodo Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
gollum Yes. There's a path......and some stairs. And then......a tunnel.
frodo He's led us this far, Sam.
sam Mr. Frodo, no.
frodo He's been true to his word.
sam No.
frodo Lead the way, Smeagol.
gollum Good Smeagol always helps.
merry Hello? Treebeard? Where has he gone?
pippin I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.And we smoked all of it. And then......you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
merry Did you hear that? There it is again. Something's not right here. Not right at all.
merry You just said something...Treeish.
pippin No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
merry You're taller.
pippin Who?
merry You!
pippin Than what?
merry Than me!
pippin I've always been taller than you.
merry Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one.
pippin Please, Merry. You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7". 3'8"!
merry Three-foot-eight. You did something.
pippin Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
pippin Merry! No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
merry I want some!
pippin lt could well be dangerous!
pippin Give me it back. Merry!
pippin What's happening?!
merry Aaagh! It's got my leg!
pippin Merry!
merry and PIPPIN Help!
treebeard Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
treebeard Go to sleep. Away with you. Come, the forest is waking up.
treebeard It isn't safe. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
pippin Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? Are there Ent children?
treebeard Bru-ra-hroom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
merry Why is that?
treebeard We lost the Entwives.
pippin Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die?
treebeard Die? No. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
merry Can't say that I have. You, Pip?
pippin What do they look like?
treebeard I don't remember now.
gandalf Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
eowyn My lord, your son......he is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing?
gandalf Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here.
wormtongue_ Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king......to lose his only son and heir. He sits on the bed and puts a hand on her shoulder
wormtongue_ I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
eowyn Leave me alone, snake!
wormtongue_ Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness ......in the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing in. So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging to winter's chill.
eowyn Your words are poison.
gimli You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
hama I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue.
hama Your staff
gandalf Hmmm You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
wormtongue_ My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe.
gandalf The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden King.
wormtongue_ He's not welcome.
theoden Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow?
wormtongue_ A just question, my liege. Late is the hour......in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest.
gandalf Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
wormtongue_ His staff. I told you to take the wizard's staff.
gandalf Theoden......son of Thengel......too long have you sat in the Shadows.
gimli I would stay still if I were you.
gandalf Hearken to me! I release you......from the spell.
theoden You have no power here ......Gandalf the .
gandalf I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
aragorn Wait.
theoden If I go, Theoden dies.
gandalf You did not kill me......you will not kill him.
theoden Rohan is mine.
gandalf Be gone.
theoden I know your face. Eowyn. Eowyn. Gandalf?
gandalf Breathe the free air again, my friend.
theoden Dark have been my dreams of late.
gandalf Your fingers would remember their old strength better......if they grasped your sword.
wormtongue_ I've only......ever served you, my lord.
theoden Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
wormtongue_ Send me not from your sight.
aragorn No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
wormtongue_ Get out of my way!
hama Hail, Theoden King!
theoden Where is Theodred? Where is my son?
eowyn The tomb in which Theodred lays is shown. In front of it a single Simelmyne flower. It falls to the ground
theoden Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live......to see the last days of my house.
gandalf Theodred's death was not of your making.
theoden No parent should have to bury their child.
gandalf He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h'l. Fer'u, Th'odred, Fer'u. In the Golden Hall the children are eating ravenously, as Eowyn sits with them
eowyn They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.
freda Where is Mama?
eowyn Sssh
gandalf This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight.
aragorn You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
theoden They will be 300 leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
aragorn Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
theoden When last I looked......Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan. GANDALF Then what is the king's decision?
hama By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
hama Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
gandalf Helm's Deep.
gimli They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king?
aragorn He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
gandalf There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses to hold.
aragorn They will hold.
gandalf The Grey Pilgrim. That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.
aragorn Go.
ROHAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 STABLEMAN That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
aragorn F'ste, stille n', f'ste, stille n'. Lac is drefed, gefr'gon.
aragorn Hw't nemna' 'e? Hm? Hw't nemna' 'e? (
eowyn His name is Brego. He was my cousin's horse.
aragorn Brego. 'in nama is cynglic. ( )
aragorn Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich? ( )
eowyn I have heard of the magic of Elves......but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.You speak as one of their own.
aragorn I was raised in Rivendell......for a time.Turn this fellow free. He's seen enough of war.
saruman_ Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
wormtongue_ There were three who followed the wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
saruman_ You stink of horse. The Man......was he from Gondor?
wormtongue_ No, from the North. One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was. His cloth was poor. And yet he bore a strange ring Two serpents with emerald eyes.. One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
saruman_ The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir. The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The line was broken years ago. It matters not. The world of Men shall fall. It will begin at Edoras.
theoden I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse.
theoden This is not a defeat. We will return. We will return.
aragorn You have some skill with a blade.
eowyn
Women#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 of this country learned long ago Those without swords can still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
aragorn What do you fear, my lady?
eowyn A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
aragorn You're a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan. I do not think that would be your fate.
wormtongue_ Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It's vulnerable. He knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep......the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.
saruman_ Send out your Warg-riders. Smeagol is swimming along in a rocky stream, trying to catch a jumping fish. Sam and Frodo follow him
sam Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
frodo Why do you do that?
sam What?
frodo Call him names. Run him down all the time.
sam Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in him but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
frodo You have no idea what it did to him......what it's still doing to him. I want to help him, Sam.
sam Why?
frodo Because I have to believe he can come back.
sam You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
frodo What do you know about it? Nothing! I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
sam I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it.
frodo I know what I have to do, Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! My own!
sam Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?
gollum We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False.
gollum No. Not master.
gollum Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
gollum Master's my friend.
gollum You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.
gollum Not listening. I'm not listening.
gollum You're a liar and a thief.
gollum No.
gollum Murderer.
gollum Go away.
gollum Go away?
gollum I hate you. I hate you.
gollum Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me.
gollum Not anymore.
gollum What did you say?
gollum Master looks after us now. We don't need you.
gollum What?
gollum Leave now......and never come back.
gollum No.
gollum Leave now and never come back.
gollum Leave now and never come back!
gollum We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious. Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free!
gollum Look. Look. See what Smeagol finds?
gollum They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!
sam You'll make him sick, you will......behaving like that. There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
gollum What's it doing? Stupid, fat Hobbit. It ruins it.
sam What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.
sam What we need is a few good taters.
gollum What's taters, precious? What's taters? Eh?
sam Po-ta-toes.
sam Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
sam Even you couldn't say no to that.
gollum Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish. Give it to us raw... ...and wriggling. You keep nasty chips.
sam You're hopeless.
sam Mr. Frodo?
sam Who are they?
gollum Wicked Men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.
sam Ready to do what?
gollum To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
frodo We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
sam Mr. Frodo. Look. It's an oliphaunt.
sam No one at home will believe this.
frodo Smeagol?
frodo We've lingered here too long. Come on, Sam.
sam Wait! We're innocent travelers!
faramir There are no travelers in this land. Only servants of the Dark Tower.
frodo We are bound to an errand of secrecy. Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
faramir The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is......where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace. War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands. The Rohan people are still walking around the lakes. Gimli rides on a horse led by Eowyn
gimli It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance......that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
aragorn It's the beards.
gimli This, in turn, has given rise to the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground...
gimli ...which is, of course, ridiculous.
gimli It's all right. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
theoden I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief.
theoden Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
eowyn Gimli.?
gimli No, I couldn't I really couldn't.
eowyn I made some stew. It isn't much, but it's hot.
aragorn Thank you. It's good.
eowyn Really?
eowyn My uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.
aragorn King Theoden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time.
eowyn Then you must be at least 60.
eowyn Seventy? But you cannot be 80!
aragorn Eighty-seven.
eowyn You are one of the Dunedain. A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend.
aragorn There are few of us left. The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
eowyn I'm sorry. Please, eat.
arwen The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane. It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart. Go to sleep.
aragorn I am asleep. This is a dream.
arwen Then it is a good dream. Sleep.
aragorn Minl' pendich nin i aur hen telitha.

arwen Si peliannen i v'd na dail l'n. Si boe '-dhannathach.
aragorn Arwen....
arwen Ae '-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen.
eowyn Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel.
elrond Our time here is ending. Arwen's time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be ever green.
aragorn But never more than memory.
elrond I will not leave my daughter here to die.
aragorn She stays because she still has hope.
elrond She stays for you. She belongs with her people.
arwen Nach gwannatha sin?
arwen Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?
aragorn '-ethelithon.

aragorn '-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
arwen O man pedich?
aragorn Edra le men, men na guil edwen. Haer o auth a n'r a naeth.
arwen Why are you saying this?
aragorn I am mortal. You are Elf-kind. It was a dream, Arwen. Nothing more.
arwen I don't believe you.
aragorn This belongs to you.
arwen It was a gift. Keep it.
eowyn My lord?
aragorn She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
gamling What is it? Hama?
hama I'm not sure.
gamling Wargs!
legolas A scout!
theoden What is it? What do you see?
aragorn Warg! We're under attack!
aragorn Get them out of here!
theoden All riders to the head of the column.
gimli Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider. Come on!
theoden You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
eowyn I can fight.
theoden No! You must do this, for me.
theoden Follow me!
gimli Forward. I mean, charge forward.
eowyn Make for the lower ground!
gimli That's it! Go on!
eowyn Stay together!
gimli Bring your pretty face to my axe.
gimli That one counts as mine! Stinking creature.
legolas Aragorn!
gimli Aragorn?
gimli Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
sharku He's......dead. He took a little tumble off the cliff.
legolas ( You lie.
theoden Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of lsengard will return. Leave the dead.
theoden Come. He walks away, leaving Legolas, grasping the Evenstar, and Gimli, staring into the river.
PEOPLE#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 At last! Helm's Deep There it is, Helm's Deep. We're safe!
LADY#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 We're safe, my lady. Thank you.
freda Mama!
morwen Eothain! Freda!
eowyn Where is the rest?
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 This is all we could save, my lady.
eowyn Take it to the caves.
gamling Make way for the king. Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.
eowyn So few. So few of you have returned.
theoden Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
gimli My lady.
eowyn Lord Aragorn......where is he?
gimli He fell.
theoden Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.
gamling What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
theoden Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
wormtongue_ Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvert at its base...... which is little more than a drain.
wormtongue_ How? How can fire undo stone?
wormtongue_ What kind of device could bring down the wall?
saruman_ If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
wormtongue_ Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning......thousands, to storm the Keep.
saruman_ Tens of thousands.
wormtongue_ But, my lord, there is no such force.
saruman_ A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand.
saruman_ This night......the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive!
saruman_ To war!
saruman_ There will be no dawn for Men.
pippin Look. There's smoke to the south.
treebeard There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days.
merry Isengard?
treebeard There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.
pippin What is it?
merry It's Saruman's army. The war has started.
arwen May the grace of the Valar protect you.
aragorn Brego.
elrond Arwen. Tollen i l'. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no c'rar.
arwen I have made my choice.
elrond He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
arwen There is still hope.
elrond If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king......and all that you hope for comes true......you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
elrond Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you......no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death......an image of the splendor of the kings of Men......in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
elrond But you, my daughter......you will linger on in darkness and in doubt......as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell......bound to your grief under the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
elrond Arwen. There is nothing for you here......only death.
elrond A im, '-'erin veleth l'n?
arwen Gerich veleth n'n, ada.
galadriel I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston ned 'wilith.
faramir What news?
madril Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
faramir How many?
madril Some thousands. More come every day.
faramir Who's covering the river to the north?
madril We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
faramir Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
faramir My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
sam Spies? Now wait just a minute.
faramir Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
faramir Speak.
frodo We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
faramir Your bodyguard?
sam His gardener.
faramir And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored look.
frodo There was no other. We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
faramir You're a friend of Boromir?
frodo Yes. For my part.
faramir It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
frodo Dead? How? When?
faramir As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
frodo If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
faramir His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart. He was my brother.
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Boromir! Boromir!
boromir This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty and music. And so it shall be once more!
Let#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 the armies of Mordor know this Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
all@ For Gondor!
boromir For Gondor!
all@ For Gondor!
boromir For Gondor!
faramir Good speech. Nice and short.
boromir Leaves more time for drinking! Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!
boromir Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good.
boromir What?
faramir He's here.
boromir One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
denethor_ Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?
boromir Father!
denethor_ They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
boromir They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.
denethor_ But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
denethor_ Were you not entrusted to protect it?
faramir I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
denethor_ Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
faramir That is not my intent.
boromir You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
boromir He loves you, Father.
denethor_ Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses, and they are few. We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
boromir The One Ring. lsildur's Bane.
denethor_ lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor.
boromir Gondor.
denethor_ It's dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you, you are strong. And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go. Bring me back this mighty gift .
boromir No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.
denethor_ Would you deny your own father?
faramir lf there is need to go to Rivendell......send me in his stead.
denethor_ You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. I think not. I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not fail me.
boromir Remember today, little brother.
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Captain Faramir! We found the third one.
faramir You must come with me. Now.
faramir Down there.
faramir To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death. They wait for my command. Shall I shoot?
gollum The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet
frodo Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please......Iet me go down to him.
frodo Smeagol. Master is here. Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come.
gollum We must go now?
frodo Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on.
frodo Don't hurt him! Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.
gollum Master!
faramir That's enough. Where are you leading them? Answer me.
gollum Smeagol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?
gollum Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us.
gollum Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
gollum Master is our friend. Our friend.
gollum Master betrayed us.
gollum No. Not its business. Leave us alone!
gollum Filthy little Hobbitses! They stole it from us!
gollum No. No.
faramir What did they steal?
gollum My precious!
sam We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.
frodo I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but.... I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it on......he'll find me. He'll see.
sam Mr. Frodo....
faramir So this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call. The Ring of Power within my grasp. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor......to show his quality.
frodo No!
sam Stop it! Leave him alone. Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
sam Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Captain?
faramir Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor.
aragorn Mae carnen, Brego, mellon n'n.
WOMAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 He's alive!
gimli Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him! You are the luckiest, the canniest .....and the most reckless man I ever knew. Bless you, laddie.
aragorn Gimli, where is the king?
legolas Le abdollen. You look terrible.
aragorn Hannon le.
theoden A great host, you say?
aragorn All lsengard is emptied.
theoden How many?
aragorn Ten thousand strong at least.
theoden Ten thousand?
aragorn It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men. They will be here by nightfall.
theoden Let them come!
theoden I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall.
theoden We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg!
gimli This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
theoden I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
theoden They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn. We've seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these walls......we will outlast them.
aragorn They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to destroy its people......down to the last child.
theoden What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end......as to be worthy of remembrance.
aragorn Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
theoden And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
aragorn Gondor will answer.
theoden ( Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--? No, my Lord Aragorn......we are alone. Get the women and children into the caves.
gamling We need more time to lay provisions--
theoden There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate.
treebeard We Ents have not troubled......about the wars of Men and wizards......for a very long time. But now, something is about to happen......that has not happened......for an age. Entmoot.
merry What's that?
treebeard 'Tis a gathering.
merry A gathering of what?
treebeard Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents......will go to war.
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Move back! Move to the caves!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Come on, people! Quickly, now!
aragorn We'll place the reserves along the wall. They can support the archers from above the gate.
legolas Aragorn, you must rest. You're no use to us half alive.
eowyn Aragorn! I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
aragorn That is an honorable charge.
eowyn To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. What renown is there in that?
aragorn My lady, a time may come for valor without renown. Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
eowyn Let me stand at your side.
aragorn lt is not in my power to command it.
eowyn You do not command the others to stay!
eowyn They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. Because they love you.
eowyn I'm sorry. ARAGORN Farmers, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.
gimli Most have seen too many winters.
legolas Or too few.
legolas Look at them. They're frightened. I can see it in their eyes.
legolas Boe a hyn: neled herain dan caer menig!
aragorn Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.
legolas Aragorn, nedin dagor hen '-'erir... ortheri. Natha daged dhaer!
aragorn Then I shall die as one of them!
gimli Let him go, lad. Let him be
gamling Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury. My lord?
theoden Who am l, Gamling?
gamling You are our king, sire.
theoden And do you trust your king?
gamling Your men, my lord......will follow you to whatever end. THEODEN To whatever end. Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?
theoden They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West... ...behind the hills......into Shadow.
theoden How did it come to this?
merry It's been going for hours.
pippin They must have decided something by now.
treebeard Decided? No. We only just finished saying.....good morning.
merry But it's nighttime already. You can't take forever.
treebeard Don't be hasty.
merry We're running out of time!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Move! Move to the outer wall.
aragorn Give me your sword.
aragorn What is your name?
haleth Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men are saying we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless.
aragorn This is a good sword. Haleth, son of Hama... ...there is always hope.
legolas We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
aragorn '-moe edaved, Legolas.
gimli We had time, I'd get this adjusted. It's a little tight across the chest.

SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Open up the gate!
theoden How is this possible?
haldir I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and Men. Long ago we fought and died together. We come to honor that allegiance.
aragorn You are most welcome.
haldir We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
gimli You could have picked a better spot.
gimli Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
legolas Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
gimli Let's hope they last the night.
aragorn A Eruch'n, '-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas!
gimli What's happening out there?
legolas Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box? ARAGORN Dartho!
theoden So it begins.
aragorn Tangado a chadad!
legolas Faeg i-varv d'n na lanc a nu ranc.
aragorn Leithio i philinn!
gimli Did they hit anything?
theoden Give them a volley.
gamling Fire!

legolas Nineteen!
pippin Merry.
treebeard We have just agreed.
merry Yes?
treebeard I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not Orcs.
pippin Well, that's good news.
merry And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?
treebeard Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
merry Hasty? Our friends are out there. They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.
treebeard War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig. But you must understand, young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old Entish... ...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.
gimli Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one!
aragorn Causeway!
theoden Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
aragorn Togo hon dad, Legolas!
aragorn Dago hon! Dago hon!
theoden Brace the gate!
theoden Hold them! Stand firm!
gimli Aragorn!
aragorn Gimli!
aragorn Hado i philinn!
aragorn Herio!
treebeard The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.
merry How can that be your decision?!
treebeard This is not our war.
merry But you're part of this world! Aren't you?!
merry You must help. Please. You must do something.
treebeard You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.
pippin Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.
merry The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And.... And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
theoden Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!
aragorn Nan Barad! Nan Barad! Haldir, nan Barad! (
gimli What are you doing? What are you stopping for?
haldir Nan Barad!
aragorn Haldir!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Brace the gate!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Hold them!
theoden To the gate. Draw your swords!
gamling Make way! ( We cannot hold much longer!
theoden Hold them!
aragorn How long do you need?
theoden As long as you can give me.
aragorn Gimli!
theoden Timbers! Brace the gate!
gimli Come on. We can take them.
aragorn It's a long way.
gimli Toss me.
aragorn What?
gimli I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!
gimli Don't tell the Elf.
aragorn Not a word.
theoden Shore up the door!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Make way!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Follow me to the barricade.
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Watch our backs!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Throw another one over here!
theoden Higher!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Hold fast the gate!
theoden Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
legolas Aragorn!
theoden Pull everybody back. Pull them back.
gamling Fall back! Fall back!
theoden They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
gamling Fall back!
theoden Retreat!
aragorn Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
gamling Into the Keep! They run inside. Legolas leaves a departing shot of two arrows
treebeard I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
pippin Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.
treebeard South? But that will lead you past lsengard.
pippin Yes. Exactly. If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.
treebeard That doesn't make sense to me. But then......you are very small. Perhaps you're right. South it is, then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.
merry Are you mad? We'll be caught.
pippin No, we won't. Not this time. Faramir and his men are walking across the plains with Frodo and Sam and Gollum on a rope towards Osgiliath
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Look! Osgiliath burns!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Mordor has come.
frodo The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please......Iet me go.
faramir Hurry.
frodo Faramir! You must let me go!
treebeard And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
treebeard They're always trying to get somewhere where they....
treebeard Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
pippin I'm sorry, Treebeard.
treebeard They had voices of their own.
treebeard Saruman. A wizard should know better!
treebeard There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.
pippin Look! The trees! They're moving!
merry Where are they going?
treebeard They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.
merry Yes!
treebeard Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom. Last march......of the Ents.
madril Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we will be overrun.
sam Mr. Frodo?
frodo It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.
sam Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.
faramir Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
sam Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
SOLDIER#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 Watch out!
sam Mr. Frodo?
frodo They're here.
frodo They've come.
faramir Nazgul!
faramir Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover!
theoden The fortress is taken. It is over.
aragorn You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it.
WOMAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 They are breaking in!
WOMAN#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 They're past the door!
aragorn Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
aragorn Is there no other way?
gamling There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
aragorn Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!
theoden So much death. What can Men do against such reckless hate?
aragorn Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.
theoden For death and glory.
aragorn For Rohan. For your people.
gimli The sun is rising.
gandalf Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.
theoden Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.
gimli Yes!
theoden Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
theoden Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.
theoden Forth Eorlingas!
aragorn Gandalf.
gandalf Theoden King stands alone.
eomer Not alone. Rohirrim!
theoden Eomer.
eomer To the king!
pippin Yes!
treebeard A hit. A fine hit.
treebeard Break the dam! Release the river!
merry Pippin! Hold on!
treebeard Hold on, little Hobbits.
sam What are you doing?
sam Where are you going?
sam It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?
frodo I can't do this, Sam.
sam I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?
theoden Victory! We have victory!
sam But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
sam Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going......because they were holding on to something.
frodo What are we holding on to, Sam?
sam That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.
faramir I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
madril You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
faramir Then it is forfeit. Release them.
eomer Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!
legolas Final count.....42.
gimli Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
legolas Forty-three.
gimli He was already dead.
legolas He was twitching.
gimli He was twitching......because he's got my axe embedded in his nervous system!
merry He doesn't look too happy, does he?
pippin Not too happy at all, Merry.
merry Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
pippin Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good.
pippin What are you doing?
merry Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all.
pippin No, it isn't. I'm starving.
merry Good luck trying to find something decent around here. Probably only dead rats and mouldy bread.
merry Saruman's storeroom!
pippin I don't believe it.
merry It can't be.
pippin lt is!
merry Longbottom Leaf. The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
pippin It's perfect. One barrel each. Wait. Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
merry Share it? No. No. Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. Could be a distant relative.
pippin I get it. Don't be hasty.
merry Exactly. Bar-hrum.
faramir This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. You'll find cover in the woods there.
sam Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir.
sam The very highest.
faramir The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor.
faramir What road will you take once you reach the woods?
frodo Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
faramir Cirith Ungol?
faramir ls that its name?
gollum No. No! Yes.
faramir Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. You cannot go that way.
gollum lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
frodo I must.
faramir Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.
frodo Thank you.
faramir May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
sam Come on, keep up.
sam Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was trying to save you, see?
gollum Save me?
sam So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.
gollum No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master. Nice Hobbits.
sam Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
gandalf Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
gandalf The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
gandalf All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
gandalf ...somewhere in the wilderness.
sam I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
frodo What?
sam I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring." And they'll say, "Yes! That's one of my favourite stories." "Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? " "Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot."
frodo
Well,#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 you've left out one of the chief characters "Samwise the Brave." I want to hear more about Sam.
frodo Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
sam Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.
frodo So was l.
sam "Samwise the Brave." Gollum has gone ahead. Frodo and Sam cannot see him through the trees
frodo Smeagol?
sam We're not going to wait for you. Come on.
gollum Master. Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us.
gollum Master broke his promise.
gollum Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.
gollum Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we take the precious......and we be the master!
gollum But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
gollum Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
gollum Yes. Yes. Yes.
gollum Kill them both.
gollum Yes. No! No! It's too risky. It's too risky.
sam Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
frodo Smeagol?
gollum We could let do it.
gollum Yes. She could do it.
gollum Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.
gollum Once they're dead. Ssssssssssssssh!
gollum Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smeagol will show you the way.
gollum Follow me.
