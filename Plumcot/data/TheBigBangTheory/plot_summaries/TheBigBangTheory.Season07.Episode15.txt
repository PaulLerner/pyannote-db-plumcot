Sheldon and Amy take a train ride to Napa Valley with Howard and Bernadette on Valentine's Day. Leonard and Penny take Raj's dog to the vet when she accidentally eats some chocolate.
Amy and Sheldon's annual relationship status discussion takes place in the lead up to Valentine's Day. Amy is able to convince Sheldon to go away for Valentine's to a bed & breakfast in Napa as what Amy hopes will be a romantic weekend will include some familiar faces in Howard and Bernadette going as well but more importantly something specifically for Sheldon, namely a trip on a vintage train to Napa. The question becomes whether both Amy and Sheldon will get out of the trip what they want, which on the surface may be incompatible, and especially as Sheldon's gift of the train trip comes first. Meanwhile, Leonard and Penny have decided to have a romantic stay-at-home Valentine's. As such, they agree to dog-sit Cinnamon while Raj has his own solo romantic Valentine's Day star gazing. Their collective Valentine's Day takes a roller coast ride of emotions because of an incident initiated by Cinnamon.
It's Valentine's and Amy thinks she planned the perfect getaway for her and Sheldon. They're going to Napa and Bernadette and Howard will be accompanying them and they're going on a vintage train. Things seem going well till Sheldon meets a guy on the train who loves trains like him and he spends most of his time with him instead of Amy. And Raj is all alone again so he decides to work and asks Leonard and Penny to look after his dog. And when they leave her alone, she eats something she's not suppose to so they take her to the vet and when Raj arrives he and the vet connect.
