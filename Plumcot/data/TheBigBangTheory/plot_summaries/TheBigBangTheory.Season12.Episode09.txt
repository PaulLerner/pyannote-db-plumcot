Sheldon and Amy are devastated after learning from a Russian paper that super asymmetry has already been theorized and disproved. Also, ultra-competitive Bernadette asks Stuart's girlfriend, Denise, to teach her how to beat Howard in a popular video game.
Sheldon and Amy have finally completed their paper on super asymmetry, Sheldon in particular believing a Nobel Prize being in their imminent future. Because they are so protective of the material before it's published, they decide to entrust the last task of the paper to Leonard instead of what would usually be done by a grad student, namely to double check all the citations which requires being holed up in a remote section of the library for hours upon end. Leonard agrees to the task, also co-opting Raj in the process. Beyond a certain item in this task having an adverse effect on Leonard's health, Leonard and Raj discover some information in their research which may throw a wrench into this paper being Sheldon and Amy's path to Nobel. Meanwhile, Bernadette is determined to show Howard that she can play the latest video game he and Raj are playing, namely Fortnite, if only because, in an off the cuff comment, Howard says that it's hard and can only be mastered by real gamers.
