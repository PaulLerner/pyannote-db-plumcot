Sheldon has a revelation when he realizes why a song was stuck in his head. Meanwhile, Amy invites Dave over for dinner despite their previously awkward date, and Howard and Raj become obsessed with a fan of their band.
Sheldon doesn't realize that he's humming until Leonard points it out to him. After that, Sheldon, and by association everyone around him, "descend into madness" in Sheldon's words as Sheldon tries to figure out the song which he is continually humming. As he racks his brain, he may or may not realize that the song has some special meaning in his life. Being rejected by Sheldon in her attempt to get back together with him, Amy decides to try another date with Dave despite the disaster that was their last date. He promises to keep Sheldon out of their date this time, which may be easier said than done. And Raj has created a fan page for his and Howard's band, Footprints on the Moon, which has received their first fan, Trent Monaco. Finding out what they can about Trent, they seem more enamored of him than he may be of their band.
