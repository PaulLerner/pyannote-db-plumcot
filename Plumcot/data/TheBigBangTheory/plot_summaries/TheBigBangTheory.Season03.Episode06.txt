Leonard tries to learn about football to fit in with Penny's friends. Meanwhile, a loss in a kite war threatens to end Raj and Howard's friendship.
To chase after a woman with whom he had no chance - again - Howard leaves Raj at a critical moment during a kite flying challenge against Sheldon and Leonard. This is the last straw for Raj who sees himself as second priority behind Howard's quest for unattainable women. Will Howard be able to regain Raj's friendship? Meanwhile, Leonard learns that Penny has not invited him to a football game watching party at her apartment. He realizes that he has never met any of Penny's friends, which makes him think she's ashamed of him. She assures him that it is only because she feels he will be bored. But to fit in with Penny's friends, Leonard makes an effort to learn all about football by watching games and reading text books on the subject. Not quite grasping the whole football game watching culture, Leonard soon learns that someone unexpected in his own social circle knows all about football and may be able to teach him better than "Football for Dummies" can.
