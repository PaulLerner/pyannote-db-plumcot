As Howard prepares for his mission into space, flashbacks show the recent events leading up to his and Bernadette's wedding.
As Howard is in the Soyuz space capsule awaiting the launch to the International Space Station, his new wife and their friends are at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment watching the launch on the NASA channel. Howard, still scared about dying most specifically now by a botched launch, reminisces about the lead up to what was his and Bernadette's wedding. Bernadette was the one who decided that they should get married before the launch in a small but special ceremony, with only their immediate family and closest friends in attendance. The ceremony was threatened by the fact that their first and at that time only option of a civil ceremony at city hall couldn't happen due to a backlog. But Raj came up with what they all believed was an even better second option on launch day if they could pull it off. The personal issues of each within the wedding party had the potential of overshadowing what should have been Howard and Bernadette's most important day. That important day may also be shattered if Soyuz itself shatters upon launch.
