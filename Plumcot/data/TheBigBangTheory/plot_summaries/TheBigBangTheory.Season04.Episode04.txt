Howard tries to get Penny's help in winning back Bernadette, but first has to confess the embarrassing reason why they broke up in the first place. Raj and Sheldon clash over a desk.
Howard is still uncomfortable in even seeing Bernadette, which is obvious when he spots her at work at the Cheesecake Factory. But when Bernadette enters his dreams instead of his usual fantasy girl, Howard wonders if Bernadette would be willing to get back together with him despite the embarrassing reason why she broke up with him. Penny vows to help him only if he discloses to her the reason for the break-up. Howard gets a little advice from two other unlikely sources. Meanwhile, Raj is mad at Sheldon for not letting him have a desk in their shared office. But once Sheldon reluctantly agrees only on the condition that Raj pay for it himself, Raj decides to exact his own form of revenge, which escalates into an all out office war.
