Penny is forced to turn to Sheldon for help when she dislocates her shoulder in the bathtub. Meanwhile, the rest of the guys accidentally get stoned in the desert while waiting for a meteor shower.
While Leonard, Howard and Raj are off camping to observe the Leonid meteor shower, Sheldon is at home doing work. It's lucky for Penny that Sheldon did stay behind as she dislocated her shoulder when she slipped taking a shower. She is immobile in her bathtub. She yells loud enough for Sheldon to hear and for him to come help her. On Penny's pleas, Sheldon agrees to drive her to the emergency room, despite he only holding a learner's permit and never having driven an actual automobile. Will Sheldon do better behind the wheel of an actual car than he has on his driving simulator? Beyond the drive to and from the hospital, Penny asks Sheldon for a few special favors. Meanwhile back at the campsite, Leonard, Howard and Raj are feeling the effects of the special ingredient in the cookies they ate that were given to them by some hippie women.
