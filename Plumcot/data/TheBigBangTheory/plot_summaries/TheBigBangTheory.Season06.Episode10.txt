Howard tries to bond with Bernadette's father during a fishing trip. When Sheldon is obligated to take care of a sick Amy, she finds ways to take advantage of the situation.
Howard isn't looking forward to the dinner he and Bernadette are having at her parent's house. In particular, he and Bernadette's father, with who Bernadette would really like him to bond, have nothing in common. Mr. Rostenkowski doesn't make it any easier since he isn't the most talkative of people. That dinner, which ends up being as bad for Howard as he initially believed, gets worse when Bernadette pressures Howard and her father to bond through going on a fishing and hunting trip together, activities about which Howard knows nothing and in which he has even less interest. Howard goes on a quest to learn about these stereotypically macho activities in order to please his wife and bond with his father-in-law. Meanwhile, Amy has come down with a fever. As per her and Sheldon's relationship agreement, Sheldon is forced to take care of her, even though he has no interest in doing so. Despite Sheldon's bedside manner being less than caring, the experience ends up being not quite what Amy had expected.
