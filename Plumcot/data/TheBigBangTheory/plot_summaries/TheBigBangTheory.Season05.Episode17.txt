Sheldon battles Kripke for a coveted office at the university. Penny receives a very unusual gift from Amy.
With Professor Rothman's retirement - or what could be considered him being forced out due to mental instability - there is a battle in the physics department between Sheldon and Barry Kripke for his lucrative office space. Each feels entitled to the office, Sheldon because he has a longer tenure and is smarter, Kripke because he said dibs and was actually in the office first. Their department head will not deal with the matter and President Siebert wants them to figure it out themselves, he who doesn't really care who gets it. So Leonard, Howard and Raj try to determine a fair "duel" to see who should get the office, the activity not one that they are equally adept at, but rather one that they are equally bad at. Meanwhile, Amy gives her bestie Penny a gift to show her how much she appreciates Penny in her life. Unfortunately for Penny, she hates it and doesn't know what to do with it, especially due to its large size and Amy noticing if it went missing.
