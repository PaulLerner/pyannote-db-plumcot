An FBI agent interviews the guys when Howard needs to obtain a security clearance.
Howard has been chosen to work on the Defense Department's Laser Equip Surveillance Satellite project. He needs security clearance to work on the project which means the FBI will be interviewing each of Sheldon, Leonard and Raj, with the interviews being conducted by Agent Page, a beautiful young woman. Raj can't speak to her until he gets drunk, and still then he believes her sole goal is to deport him back to India. Woman-hungry Leonard decides to try his new confident persona to pick her up, which has unintended consequences. And Sheldon wants to speak more about his past encounters with the FBI than about Howard. Howard fails to receive the clearance to work on the project due to one specific incident in one of the three interviews. The guilty party fails to disclose the gaffe to Howard. Will the guilty party ultimately confess and will he be able to make it up to Howard regardless of if that confession happens?
