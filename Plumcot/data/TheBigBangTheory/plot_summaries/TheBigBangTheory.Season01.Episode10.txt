Leonard lies to Penny so that he and Sheldon can get out of watching her perform. However, Sheldon believes that the lie has too many loose ends, so he comes up with a new, unnecessarily complex one to replace it.
Penny has the role of Mimi in a one-day workshop stage production of Rent, and asks Leonard and Sheldon if they want to go see her perform. Based on hearing Penny sing badly, Leonard and Sheldon decline, with Leonard even lying to her to get out of it. Sheldon is feeling uncomfortable in being a part of Leonard's lie, so he takes proactive measures to get out of that lie. Sheldon's actions don't hurt Penny but rather confuse Leonard. But Sheldon takes his proactive measure to the extreme, utilizing the hidden talents of Toby Loobenfeld, a research assistant in the particle physics lab.
