The gang finds out Wil Wheaton hosts a celebrity Dungeons and Dragons game involving William Shatner, Joe Manganiello, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kevin Smith. Deception and betrayal are the path to make it to the one open seat.
To apologize for something bad he inadvertently did on the Professor Proton Show, Sheldon goes to Wil Wheaton's house. In the process, Sheldon discovers that Wil hosts a Dungeons and Dragons game night for some of his celebrity friends, the only one that Sheldon is certain being among those celebrities is William Shatner. As such, Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj do whatever they can to be invited to Wil's next game night, especially when they learn one of the people that attended the one that Sheldon almost walked in on was someone they know that is less than a celebrity. But the issue of being invited by Wil starts to expand when some others within their social circle learn which other celebrities are included that may appeal to other than the nerd senses of Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
