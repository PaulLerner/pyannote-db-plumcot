Sheldon annoys the gang when Leonard can't drive him to and from work, so they try to teach him how to drive.
Leonard is unable to drive Sheldon to work for the next couple of weeks, leaving Sheldon, who refuses to take the bus, to find an alternate ride for the commute. After going through Penny then Howard then Raj, alienating each in those drives, Sheldon has run out of friends who will drive him. They come up with what they think is the best solution for all: that Sheldon learn how to drive himself. But can a genius in theoretical applications master an everyday mundane task that involves the unpredictable decisions of other people?
Leonard has been working nights on a special project, forcing Sheldon to find a ride to get to work. After his annoying personal habits burn out the favors from Penny, Howard and Raj, the gang holds an intervention to encourage him to learn to drive. He gets as far as earning a learner's permit (chiefly because he drives the DMV worker crazy with insipid questions), Howard hooks up a highly sophisticated simulator to get him use to driving. However, Sheldon gives up, feeling that he's too evolved for such a menial task as driving.
