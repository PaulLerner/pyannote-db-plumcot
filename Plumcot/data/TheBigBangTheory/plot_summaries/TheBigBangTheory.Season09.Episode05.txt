Kripke expresses interest in Amy while leading a fencing lesson for the guys. Meanwhile, Stuart seeks help from the girls in getting more women interested in the comic book store.
Bernadette, through a gift to Howard, indirectly gets Leonard and thus the guys to think about getting more exercise in their lives. All things considered, they decide to attend a fencing class led by Barry Kripke, largely so that they can become swashbucklers like their movie heroes without having to break too much of a sweat. Beyond learning the technical aspects of fencing, the guys try to place their own sensibilities on the proceedings, while Kripke himself decides to act upon some information he learns in the class. Meanwhile, Stuart asks Penny, Amy and Bernadette for advice on how to attract more female customers to the comic book store. Stuart may not fully comprehend what they, especially Penny, tell him, as partly demonstrated through a comment he makes to Amy.
