Penny becomes jealous when a gorgeous new neighbor attracts the guys' attention.
In Sheldon's view, the tenants in the apartment directly above his and Leonard's are perfect neighbors since they never make any noise and he doesn't even know them. So he is horrified when he learns they are moving. Sheldon's fears are laid to rest when he questions the new tenant, Alicia, who is an aspiring actress like Penny and who answers all his questions on her living habits correctly to his specifications. Leonard, Howard and Raj, on the other hand, are more than happy as Alicia is a beautiful young woman. As Leonard, Howard and Raj fawn over Alicia, Penny becomes jealous. Penny does whatever she can to compete with Alicia and regain what she believes is the loss of her queen bee status within the group. But equally as important, Penny wants to expose Alicia's motives for her friendship with the guys.
