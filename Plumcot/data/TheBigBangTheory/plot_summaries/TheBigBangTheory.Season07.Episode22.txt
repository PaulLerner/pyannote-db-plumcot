As the gang celebrate Star Wars Day, Sheldon has difficulty dealing with the recent death of Arthur "Professor Proton" Jeffries.
The guys are organizing Star Wars (1977) day, which is on May the 4th, the date so chosen because..., and as such the date cannot be changed. They run into a conundrum when they learn that Arthur Jeffries, Leonard and Sheldon's friend and childhood idol as "Professor Proton", has just passed away, his funeral service to be held that day. While Penny plans to accompany Leonard to the funeral, Sheldon plans to partake in Star Wars day with Howard and Raj, since he believes mourning is a wasted emotion, and funerals a superstitious ritual. While Amy and Bernadette are helping with the Star Wars preparations, Sheldon, Howard and Raj start watching the marathon of six movies. But Arthur's death may be hitting Sheldon harder than he realizes, as witnessed by the break he takes from watching the movies. At the funeral, Penny makes an admission about funerals in general, while Leonard contemplates his mortality.
