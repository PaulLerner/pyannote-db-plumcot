Leonard is upset when the owner of the comic book store goes on a date with Penny, so he convinces Howard and Raj to take him to a bar so that he can pick up a woman of his own.
It's "Anything Can Happen Thursday", the third Thursday in the month the guys have deemed the day to do something different to get out of their rut. Sheldon proposes that they go to the comic book store (as comic book store night is usually Wednesday). Penny tags along to buy a gift for her nephew. In addition to getting something for her nephew, she also gets something else: picked up, specifically by Stuart, the comic book store owner. Leonard has mixed emotions: he is buoyed by the fact that someone that is somewhat like him at first glance can get a girl like Penny, but is jealous that Penny picked Stuart instead of him. To get over this situation, Leonard, with Howard and Raj, decides to do what Howard suggested to get them out of their funk: go to a bar to pick up desperate women.
