Leonard and Sheldon go to great lengths to secure the helium they need during a nation-wide shortage. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang try to find Amy a new boyfriend on a dating app.
Leonard and Sheldon learn that a Swedish scientific team has read their paper and is trying to beat them in completing the experiment to prove or disprove their hypothesis. Leonard and Sheldon's problem is that they require some liquid helium to complete the experiment, the element which is currently in short supply in the US with their order backlogged by one month. Kripke has a supply but will not give them any of his. Howard knows "someone" who would be able to get them some illegally. Leonard and Sheldon have to decide whether to buy from this black market supplier, with the knowledge that if they get caught it could mean jail and their reputation in tatters. Meanwhile, Stuart has been using a mobile phone app which has resulted in him getting a few dates. Penny and Bernadette think that Amy should use the app herself in moving forward with her love life without Sheldon. Beyond Penny, Bernadette, Howard, Raj and Stuart making Amy's search for true love using this app a party game, Amy seems less than enthused about using the app, but it's not quite the reason they believe it is.
