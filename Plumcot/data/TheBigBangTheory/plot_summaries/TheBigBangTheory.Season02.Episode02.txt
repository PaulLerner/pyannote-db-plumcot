Sheldon is annoyed when Leonard turns to Leslie for comfort after seeing Penny with another guy.
Leonard does not want to admit that he felt awkward seeing Penny on a date with another man. Leonard states to the guys that he is happy that Penny is moving on with her life, as has he. However, they all know that there is no other woman yet in Leonard's life. Against Sheldon's sensibilities, Raj suggests to Leonard that he ask Leslie Winkle out again. Surprisingly, Leslie is open to the idea as she is no longer using sex solely as an occasional to rarely used stress reliever. Leslie suggests they pursue a traditional dating ritual with the objective of marriage and children. Because Leslie and Leonard are dating, Sheldon tries to convince Penny to hook-up with Leonard again. But if Penny doesn't comply, he may make Leonard choose between Leslie and him.
