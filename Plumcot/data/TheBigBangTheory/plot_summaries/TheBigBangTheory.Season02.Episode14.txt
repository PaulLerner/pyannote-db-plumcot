Leonard and Sheldon try to help out Penny when she can't afford to pay her rent.
Penny is hiding from the building manager since she is behind in her rent due to some unforeseen bills and her hours being cut back at the restaurant. After she borrows money from Sheldon, who freely offered it to her, and after Leonard allows her to forgo paying for her share of their group meals, Penny begins to get agitated whenever the issue of money in whatever form is discussed. Since she is obviously stressed about her financial situation, Leonard looks over her finances, and sees one financial outlay which is a cause of most of the problem. Although he could get physically hurt by this action, Leonard decides to help Penny get this money back which is rightfully hers.
