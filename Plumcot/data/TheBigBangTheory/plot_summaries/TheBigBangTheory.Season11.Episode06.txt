Sheldon and Wil Wheaton both go head-to-head for the role of the new Professor Proton, Meanwhile Penny takes care of Halley when Bernadette and Howard are on bed rest.
Sheldon learns that the Professor Proton show is being resurrected. He believes that he would make the perfect twenty-first century Professor Proton, a character he loves. The problem that he doesn't quite understand is that he has contempt for his potential audience, namely impressionable young children. When Penny likens what he needs to do in his audition tape is akin to acting, he decides to get some professional assistance in that matter, which leads to unintended consequences for him. Meanwhile, Howard has just got a vasectomy. His recuperation coincides with Bernadette being told by her physician that she requires total bed rest for a few days in being run off her feet, in part in waiting on Howard. The person who volunteers to help look after Halley in both Bernadette and Howard being incapacitated is Penny, who they don't really trust in the role of baby sitter.
