Howard is offended when his return from space is met with little fanfare. Penny and Amy take on Sheldon and Leonard during game night.
Howard returns to Earth feeling dejected when he finds out that his friends are not waiting for him at the airport at the request of Bernadette, who wants to spend some quality time with him. She, however, is suffering from allergies, preventing them from spending some private time together. Howard also feels dejected when he learns that during his time away, his mother is having an affair with his dentist, Dr. Schneider and Stuart has taken over his spot in his friendship with Raj, since they are living together. Meanwhile, Sheldon, Leonard, Penny and Amy hang out at the guys' apartment and participate in a guys versus girls competition. First they are playing Pictionary and then other made-up games where the guys never seem to win.
A relieved Howard makes it back to terra firma in one piece after his stint in space. He is expecting a hero's welcome, at least from his family and friends, but at the airport there is only Bernadette waiting for him, with another "Howie" stealing the spotlight. She tells him that she asked their friends to allow her to have him all to herself for the first night, hence their absence. That night doesn't go quite according to Bernadette's plan or Howard's wants, he who ends up going from his mother's house to his friends' places all in the search for that hero's welcome. Meanwhile, it's boys against the girls in games night, with Leonard and Sheldon on one side and Penny and Amy on the other. Sheldon needs to show his superiority in any game, but that superior attitude may end up being counterproductive.
