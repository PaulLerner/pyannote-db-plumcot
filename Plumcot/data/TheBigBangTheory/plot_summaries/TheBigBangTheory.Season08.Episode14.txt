Leonard and Sheldon defend themselves against criticism from an online bully, while the girls confront embarrassing moments from their pasts.
Through a casual conversation with Penny, Leonard believes he's come up with a revolutionary scientific idea. Requiring some sort of validation, he asks Sheldon for his opinion. Sheldon likes the idea so much, that he on his own makes all the necessary calculations and writes a paper on the subject. The two decide to post the paper as co-authors online before anyone else can claim the work as their own. The responses to the paper are universally positive... except for one anonymous poster who ridicules Sheldon and Leonard. Sheldon in particular can't stand that anyone would denigrate his work, which leads to a war of online words with this anonymous poster. Raj may ultimately give Sheldon and Leonard a good perspective on the matter. Meanwhile, Penny, Bernadette and Amy are deciding on what to watch on their girls night in. Bernadette and Amy dualaterally decide that they will find Penny's "gorilla" movie online and watch that, much against Penny's wishes. As such, Penny can't help but get a little retribution by finding embarrassing instances of Bernadette and Amy online.
