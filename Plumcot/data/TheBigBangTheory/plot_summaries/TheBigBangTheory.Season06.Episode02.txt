Penny continues to have doubts about her relationship with Leonard. Meanwhile, Howard becomes the target of practical jokes on the space station.
Penny tries to figure out what her feelings for Leonard are, since she is happy with their relationship, yet she is unsure if she is in love just yet. She confides in Bernadette and Amy about the matter, which results in Amy telling Sheldon about it. Sheldon, out of concern for Leonard and his hatred for changes, tries to talk Penny into maintaining her relationship with Leonard. Meanwhile, Raj finds a new friend in Stuart, to fill the void left by Howard, and Stuart gets accepted into their social group by Sheldon, so long as he behaves as Howard would. Howard meanwhile, gets bullied by his fellow astronauts.
While Penny, Bernadette and Amy talk about their respective relationships, Penny implies that she isn't sure what her feelings are for Leonard. She thinks she loves Leonard, but she has been in love before, and her feelings for Leonard no where match that experience. From those statements, Bernadette and Amy infer that Penny may be contemplating breaking up with Leonard. This information gets back to Sheldon, who now has a vested interest in seeing that Leonard and Penny stay together. Sheldon does whatever he can to tell Leonard without telling him directly, which may be a bit confusing for Leonard, while Penny contemplates what she should do without hurting Leonard. Meanwhile, Stuart becomes the official unofficial "Howard" in the group during Howard's absence. And Howard feels like he's being picked on by the other astronauts.
