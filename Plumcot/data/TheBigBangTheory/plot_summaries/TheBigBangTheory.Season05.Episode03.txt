Leonard accompanies Amy to a colleague's wedding. Howard tries to convince Bernadette to live with his mother after they get married.
After a group dinner at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, Leonard and Amy are the unlikely pair left alone at the apartment as everyone else goes off for the evening. Despite it being a somewhat uncomfortable evening for Leonard, he agrees to accompany Amy to an upcoming wedding, she who refuses to take Sheldon based on a past incident. At the reception, Amy, who "whored" herself up to meet her perception of social convention, is the one of the two who tries to enjoy their time together in this social setting. Leonard ultimately appreciates Amy's attempts. But both Amy and Sheldon misinterpret Leonard's appreciation. Meanwhile, Howard tells a disbelieving Bernadette that he expects them to live with his mother in her house after they're married. After an argument, Bernadette at least agrees to go through a trial weekend at the Wolowitz house. And Sheldon is off in his own literally little world as he plays with his new HO model train set.
