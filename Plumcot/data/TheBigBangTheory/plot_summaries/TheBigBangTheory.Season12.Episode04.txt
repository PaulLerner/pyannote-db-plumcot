Sheldon won't tell anyone why he's never mentioned Tam, his childhood best friend, so Leonard takes matters into his own hands. Also, Bernadette and Penny take out Raj's fianc√©e, Anu, for dinner to get the skinny on her.
Sheldon receives a message from his best friend in high school, Tam Nguyen, that he is coming to California to show his son around Cal Tech. Sheldon's closest group of friends wonder why Sheldon has never mentioned Tam before. The reason?: Sheldon and Tam have not spoken in twenty years since Tam is now on Sheldon's enemies list, because, according to the list, Tam "knows what he did". As such, Sheldon has no intention of meeting with Tam. While whatever the issue, Leonard, Howard and Raj believe that the reason will be nothing material to any normal person and thus without even knowing what it is, already side with Tam. After going through several channels without finding out the reason, Leonard, Howard and Raj do locate Tam on campus to find out directly from him, Tam who doesn't divulge why for a very good reason. They eventually do learn the reason from Sheldon, all his friends who try to bridge the gap from Sheldon back to Tam. Meanwhile, Penny and Bernadette decide to do some sleuthing on their own about Anu, who Raj has decided to marry. Much like Leonard, Howard and Raj, Penny and Bernadette decide to take the direct approach in going to the hotel where she works as a concierge to introduce themselves. The resulting dinner that Penny, Bernadette and Anu have together may have some unintended consequences.
