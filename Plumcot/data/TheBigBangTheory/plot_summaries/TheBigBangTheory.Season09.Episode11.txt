Professor Proton visits Sheldon in a dream and gives him advice about whether to go see the new Star wars film or spend the time with his newly reunited girlfriend Amy on her birthday. Meanwhile, Leonard, Howard and Raj try to decide who will get their extra ticket to the movie premiere.
Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj have managed to get tickets for the Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) premiere. Penny reminds Sheldon that that is the day of Amy's birthday, something he may not want to place on the back-burner in favor of the movie considering that they just got back together. When he decides Amy's birthday over the movie, the next step is to decide what to give her as a gift. Asking Penny and Bernadette for advice, Sheldon may give Amy the ultimate gift that she would actually want. If Penny and Bernadette can't keep the secret, Amy may be disappointed if she doesn't get what she thinks. Meanwhile, Sheldon has given his movie ticket to the guys to give to whomever they feel worthy. They may regret their choice.
