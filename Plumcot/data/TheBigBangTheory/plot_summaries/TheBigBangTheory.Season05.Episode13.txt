Leonard and Penny contemplate reviving their romantic relationship.
After thinking about it long and hard, Leonard decides to ask Penny out on a real date again, which not only garners a shocked reaction from Penny, but the same from the rest of their mutual friends. Penny accepts Leonard's date request. While Bernadette and Amy give Penny their two cents worth of advice, Howard and Raj give Leonard theirs. After what can be described as a disastrous date, Leonard and Penny make a decision on what to do about whether or not to get back together again. Much of their decision is based on Penny's assertion that Leonard over-thinks everything. An action by Leonard shows just how much he over-thinks everything. Meanwhile, Sheldon contemplates whether or not to keep the "Zachary Quinto" life-sized cardboard cutout of Spock he received, when he really ordered the "Leonard Nimoy" Spock. And a clueless Sheldon, while playing a game with Howard and Raj, has no idea his comments are laced with sexual innuendo.
