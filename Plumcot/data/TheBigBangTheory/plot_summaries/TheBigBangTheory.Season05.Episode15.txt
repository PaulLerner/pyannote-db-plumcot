Leonard signs out of his roommate agreement, reducing himself and Sheldon to mere acquaintances, while Howard tries to think of a cool astronaut nickname for himself.
As Leonard is feeling sleep deprived because of Sheldon, Leonard is in no mood to have to drive Sheldon to the dentist's office as per the roommate agreement. As such, Leonard willingly invokes what Sheldon tells him is clause 209 in the agreement, namely that the agreement be dissolved, that they no longer be friends, and that their only formal responsibilities to each other be payment of rent, payment of utilities and the perfunctory "'sup" as they pass each other in the hallway. Sheldon is equally as willing. However, Sheldon may change his mind when no one in his social circle, even Amy, seems willing to take on the duties that used to be performed by Leonard. Sheldon tries to show Leonard that he needs him as a friend, while Leonard really doesn't mind doing these little favors for Sheldon but wants them not to be a mandatory part of their relationship. Meanwhile, Raj has noticed that all Howard's astronaut colleagues have cool nicknames, while Howard doesn't. As Howard states that the nicknames are provided by the other astronauts, Raj comes up with a plan to get Howard's nickname to be what he wants it to be, namely "Rocket Man".
