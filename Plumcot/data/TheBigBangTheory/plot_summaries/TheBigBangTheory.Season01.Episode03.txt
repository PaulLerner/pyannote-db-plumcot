Leonard gets upset when he discovers that Penny is seeing a new guy, so he tries to trick her into going on a date with him.
Leonard is still pining over Penny, but comes to the realization that she is out of his league when he sees her with her handsome latest date. Moving on, Leonard decides to ask out his colleague, Dr. Leslie Winkle, instead, who wants to treat this event like a sped up science experiment, with the results being more important than the process. With Leonard still thinking about Penny, Sheldon clarifies to Leonard that Penny has not rejected him since Leonard has never asked her out. But Penny's interpretation of Leonard's question makes Leonard reevaluate how to approach their "first date".
Leonard's mission to win Penny's heart come to a halt when he sees her with, Doug, her latest boyfriend. Feeling that his pursuits are all for nothing, he decides to pursue another path. His alternative involves trying to ask fellow physicist Leslie Winkle for a date, but she puts it in terms of a scientific experiment and postulates that the ending results (bound up in the goodnight kiss) were interesting but didn't exactly make the Earth move. Feeling down, Leonard gives Penny another try, inviting her to dinner under the impression that the other guys will be joining them. On, what is not clearly defined as "a date," she begins to realize that Leonard has feelings for her.
