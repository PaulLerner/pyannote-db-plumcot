Howard questions his engineering abilities when he and Sheldon can't get a toy drone to fly. A cancelled flight nearly prevents Leonard from giving the commencement address at his former high school. Raj pits his parents against each other when his father cuts him off financially.
Leonard has been asked by those at his New Jersey high school to provide the commencement speech as this year's graduation ceremony. He plans to take Penny along with him, which along with his work is meant for him to show metaphorically his past that he is a success despite the pain he endured in high school. Their plans hit a snag when a storm on the east coast has grounded all flights into the region to make it to New Jersey in time for the ceremony. Penny, figuring there are other ways in this day and age of technology, arranges for Leonard to be able to give his speech to the graduating class via Skype. But Leonard has a change of heart about the core message of his speech as he gives it based on reliving that pain. Meanwhile, Raj has purchased a drone as a toy. As it isn't working, he asks Howard and Sheldon to help him fix it. While mechanically inclined Howard does whatever he can to fix it - which isn't as easy as he or Sheldon would have believed - Raj runs into an associated problem involving his father.
