Although he outwardly considered their relationship "friends with benefits" and as such had no emotional connotation, Howard is feeling dejected after he is dumped by Leslie Winkle. Thinking he needs to do something fun to get over Leslie, Leonard and Raj decide to drag Howard to Las Vegas for a weekend getaway. Once there, Leonard and Raj learn that it will take more than just fun they can conjure up to get Howard out of his depression. They resort to professional help. Meanwhile, Sheldon is expecting to have a peaceful weekend alone in the apartment.
