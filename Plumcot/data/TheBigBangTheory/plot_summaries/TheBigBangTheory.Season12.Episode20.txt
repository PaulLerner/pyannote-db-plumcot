Koothrappali is worried people won't take him seriously in his own field after publishing a paper that suggests he may have discovered alien life. Leonard wants to be the principal investigator on a plasma physics study.
Leonard discovers that he does things solely to please people - a "satisfizer" in Sheldon's vernacular - with no consideration for what he really wants, which in turn usually makes him miserable. In standing up for what he believes he truly wants, Leonard may have to renegotiate his relationships with the university, with Sheldon and with Penny in particular. Meanwhile, Raj has written a paper in which he does not rule out the possibility of alien life being the cause of something he discovers. In the process, the figurative "world" begins solely to fixate on the alien issue of the paper, he being mocked in the process. Raj has to figure out how to restore his reputation as a serious scientist.
