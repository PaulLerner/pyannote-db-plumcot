The guys's skills are put to the test when they get a flat tire on the way to Mexico for Leonard's bachelor party. The girls throw Penny a mini-bachelorette party.
Because Leonard and Penny eloped, neither got a bachelor or bachelorette party before their marriage. As such, Howard and Raj, with Penny's help, kidnap a willing Leonard and a less than willing Sheldon to take them away to a mystery destination for a bachelor party. The plan in general sits well with Leonard, and a little less so with Sheldon, until he learns of some science related aspects to the plan. But all four will have to use a little more science on this trip than they anticipated. With the boys out of town, the girls have a bachelorette party of their own. As Penny doesn't want to go to a strip club, they decide instead to have a girls' night in to talk about their current lives. Penny's marriage to Leonard and Amy's break-up with Sheldon lead to two telephone calls, one which contains a little more information than Penny would have liked, and a physical transformation for a new look.
Howard and Raj want to give Leonard a bachelor party. And he says OK and they "take" Sheldon with them. They plan to go to Mexico in an old van which was owned by one of Sheldon's idols. When the van breaks down they have a hard time trying to repair it. The girls get together and they encourage Penny to call her mother and tell her she married Leonard. Only her father answers and he takes the moment to tell her something he's been keeping to himself. And they also learn Amy didn't tell her mother that she broke up with Sheldon and tells her to call her mother.
