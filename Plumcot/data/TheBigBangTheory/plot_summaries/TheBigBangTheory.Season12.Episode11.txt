Penny and Leonard organize a paintball game, which results in mayhem when Sheldon becomes jealous of Amy. Raj catches Anu with her ex-boyfriend. Stuart doesn't want to move in with Denise.
The generally positive reviews to Amy and Sheldon's paper on Super Asymmetry leads to a plethora of interview requests, which President Siebert wants Amy to handle in Sheldon not really presenting himself well when it comes to dealing with people. President Siebert is able to convince Sheldon and Amy to this fact. But when the first interview results in a headline that places Amy in the spotlight and Sheldon in the back seat when it comes to the work - the headline no fault of Amy's - Sheldon may have issue not only with Amy handling all the interviews but with Amy herself. Meanwhile, Raj has just helped Anu install a doorbell camera at her place. Keeping a copy of the app on his phone, Raj sees a man who he doesn't know at Anu's doorstep, he with who she seems just a little too "familiar" for Raj's liking. Raj has to decide what to do with this information which amounts to he spying on her. And Denise asks Stuart to move in with her, his reaction being a little less positive than she would have liked or expected. All three of these relationship issues may come to a head at the paintball match Penny and Leonard have arranged for their friends.
