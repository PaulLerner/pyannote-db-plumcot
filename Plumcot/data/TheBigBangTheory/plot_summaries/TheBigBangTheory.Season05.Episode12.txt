Penny helps Sheldon work on his relationship with Amy when he trivializes one of her accomplishments. Howard is irked by Bernadette's dislike of children.
On Sheldon and Amy's scheduled monthly date night, Amy becomes obviously upset with Sheldon. Penny, who witnessed the incident, tells Sheldon that Amy's anger is due to his indifference to news that she shared that was important to her, specifically that her article was published in a prestigious scientific journal. Sheldon is uncertain if he can feign interest in something he doesn't find interesting. Leonard convinces him that he can make it up to her by buying her a romantic gift, such as jewelry. But will Amy, who also has her own unconventional sensibilities, be swayed by pressurized carbon i.e. diamonds? Meanwhile, Bernadette reluctantly agrees to be Howard's assistant in his magic act at his little cousin's birthday party. What she is required to do as his assistant brings up the issue that she hates children and doesn't want any of her own, which ends up being a possible deal breaker in their relationship.
