Howard believes that his mom suffered a heart attack because he told her that he's marrying Bernadette, Sheldon freaks out over germs, and Penny and Priya compare notes on Leonard.
Howard and Bernadette have started planning their wedding, but they have failed either to tell Bernadette's parents or Mrs. Wolowitz that they are even engaged. To ingratiate Bernadette to Mrs. Wolowitz, Howard thinks that the two primary women in his life need to have some quality alone time at a deli lunch. After the fact, Bernadette believes the lunch went well, and that her future mother-in-law actually likes her. So Howard, in a moment of bravery - while Mrs. Wolowitz is behind a locked bathroom door doing nature's business - tells his mother about being engaged to Bernadette. Immediately after the announcement, Howard hears a thud on the bathroom floor. Howard believes his mother has had a heart attack over the news. After getting her to the hospital, Howard has to decide if he will tell Bernadette that Mrs. Wolowitz's hospitalization is due to her. Meanwhile, Penny and Priya come to a somewhat new understanding in their non-relationship all based on their common knowledge of Leonard. And mysophobe Sheldon reluctantly enters the germ filled hospital to support Howard. The visit ends up being even worse than Sheldon could have imagined.
