The guys are invited to Penny's Halloween party, where Leonard has yet another run-in with Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt.
When Penny asks the guys to her party, which will include dancing, they seriously think about not attending as they aren't "dance" people. But when they learn it's a costume party (the fact of it being Halloween irrelevant), they change their collective minds and decide to go. Leonard wants this party to be an opportunity for Penny to see him as someone in her social circle. But Leonard's goals for the evening change when Kurt, Penny's ex-boyfriend, shows up, he who seems to be an invited guest and who Penny seems happy to see. Leonard, still smarting from his first and only other previous encounter with Kurt, tries to be Penny's protector while protecting himself from a potentially painful beating from Kurt.
After a disastrous afternoon of paintball, the guys come back to the apartment where Penny invites them to her Halloween party. After a miscommunication leads to the four guys dressing like The Flash, they all change and go with Leonard as Frodo, Sheldon as The Doppler Effect, Howard as Robin Hood and Raj as Thor. Not accustomed to parties with normal people, they feel out of place but when Leonard tries to socialize, he discovers that Penny's hulking ex-boyfriend Kurt has shown up and is attempting to patch things up. Leonard is undaunted and tries to get him to leave despite the man's massive size. The unfortunate encounter leads none-the-less to his first kiss with Penny.
