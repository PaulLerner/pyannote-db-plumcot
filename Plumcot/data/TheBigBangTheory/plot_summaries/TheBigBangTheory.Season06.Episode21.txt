Amy tries to help a depressed Sheldon find closure when one of his favorite TV shows is canceled. Raj becomes paranoid when he finds Lucy's blog.
Sheldon has just learned that his favorite television show, Alphas (2011) has been canceled after two seasons on the air. What's inconceivable about the situation is that the second season ended on a cliffhanger, meaning that he will never learn what happened after that. Amy believes that Sheldon's issue is that his compulsive self needs closure. Being a neuroscientist, she believes she can help him break that need. Although he doesn't think he has a problem, he allows her to perform her therapy on him. This process will either cure him, or tear them apart. Meanwhile, Raj finds an on-line blog that Lucy has written, describing their relationship. Although he finds it a little creepy to read it - likening it to reading someone's diary - he can't help but read it anyway. Howard convinces him to use the information contained in the blog for his own carnal advantage with Lucy. And Penny can't understand why Leonard gets so excited by what she considers the little, insignificant things in life.
