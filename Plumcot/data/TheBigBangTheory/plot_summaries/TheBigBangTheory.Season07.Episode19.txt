While Raj is wracked with guilt when he tries to date Lucy and Emily at the same time, Penny wrestles with whether to take a role in a cheesy movie and Sheldon is torn trying to choose between two gaming systems.
Penny returns from what she believes was a promising audition for a role she actually wants. Her anticipation turns to disappointment when the telephone call she receives is the offer once again for the cheesy horror movie role she was earlier offered but turned down since she thought it was beneath her. Although she asks Leonard for advice about whether to take the horror movie role, Penny may get the most useful advice from someone's who been there: Wil Wheaton. Meanwhile, Raj runs into Emily, the woman he met online, with Amy being the intermediary in their one and only face-to-face encounter. Despite that first date being a disaster, Raj is able to convince Emily to give him another chance. Immediately following, Raj receives a message from Lucy, asking to meet. Raj has to figure out what to do about his upcoming date with Emily considering Lucy's message. Sheldon is having a major conundrum about whether to purchase a Xbox One or PS4 as his next gaming system. This dilemma by association affects Amy the most. And Bernadette makes an innocent but major gaffe at work concerning signing what she believed was a retirement card for a colleague but which turned out to be for something completely different.
