Sheldon wreaks havoc when he tries to get a haircut from his regular barber, who is ill. Howard runs into a few problems with astronaut training.
Sheldon's orderly world is thrown into a tailspin when his regular barber, Mr. D'Onofrio, is in the hospital with a coma when Sheldon's regularly scheduled appointment arrives. He won't let anyone else in the area cut his hair since he believes Mr. D'Onofrio is the only one who can since he has all Sheldon's haircut records from Texas (or so Sheldon's mother told him). Even after his regularly scheduled haircut appointment is one day overdue, Sheldon can't stand it as he can hear his hair growing out of control. If Sheldon can't get Mr. D'Onofrio out of his coma, he will either have to let someone else cut his hair, or live with longer than usual hair. But what's worse, Sheldon believes that total anarchy will ensue since world order is based on his own personal order. The result of not getting is haircut makes Sheldon reevaluate his life plan. Meanwhile, Howard is scheduled to begin his astronaut training. Howard finds that the anticipation of the excitement of the training is nowhere close to the reality of training itself.
