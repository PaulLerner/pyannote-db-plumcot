Chaos ensues when the gang spend the weekend together at a science convention.
Penny initially declines an invitation from Amy Farrah Fowler, who considers Penny her best friend, to accompany her, Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj and Bernadette to a weekend long science conference at which they'll all be speaking. Penny changes her mind when she learns that the conference is all expenses paid at a four star spa resort in Big Sur. Penny wishes she could change her mind once again when the drive to Big Sur with Leonard, Sheldon and Amy ends up being a nerd's version of a road trip. She probably wouldn't appreciate being in Bernadette, Howard and Raj's car either, the former two who are too happy in love and who demonstrate it in the drive to Big Sur. That love may be in jeopardy when at the conference, Howard meets Bernadette's handsome and 6'7" tall ex-boyfriend Glenn. An unfortunate comment from Howard to Bernadette about her former relationship with Glenn sets off a series of musical beds and musical bedrooms between the seven which culminates in a no holds barred airing of all their feelings at the conference's panel discussion.
Tension runs high when everyone is staying at the same hotel for a science event and Bernadette runs into her ex-boyfriend.
