Raj's honesty about his past comes back to haunt him after Emily takes a dislike to Penny. Meanwhile, the guys consider investing in the comic book store.
Emily joins the gang for the first time for one of their regular dinners at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, she never yet having met either Leonard or Penny. As Emily is a physician, more specifically a dermatologist, Bernadette suggests that Penny try out her pharmaceutical sales techniques on Emily, to which Emily agrees. After the dinner, Penny believes that Emily, for whatever reason, didn't like her on first sight, but she doesn't know what she would have done in such short a period to make Emily dislike her so. At the sales pitch, Penny decides to confront Emily on the issue. Penny finds out that her perception was not incorrect and she finds out the reason for Emily's dislike of her. Penny has to figure out if she can overcome Emily's preconceived notion based on the reason. Meanwhile, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj are at a rival comic book store, they discussing among other things the fact that Stuart has not yet been able to rebuild his since his insurance moneys are insufficient for him to be able to do so. All four of them think it would be fun to be Stuart's investors, and as such be part owners of Stuart's store. Penny, Amy and Bernadette may have their own thoughts on the matter, as may Stuart and a fifth party.
