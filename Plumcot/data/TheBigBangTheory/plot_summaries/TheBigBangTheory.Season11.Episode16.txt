When Bernadette won't go into labor, the gang try different tactics to get things started. Also, Wolowitz confronts Bernadette after Amy accidentally reveals she's already chosen their son's name.
Bernadette's due date has come and gone with no sign of her and Howard's baby boy anywhere close to being in sight much to her chagrin. While Howard, who has already done his part to induce labor, figures he has all this extra time and thus is finishing work with Amy on their project proposal, their friends do whatever they can both to keep Bernadette company and to see if they can do anything to make the baby arrive faster. It is during his time with Amy that Howard learns some news about a decision that Bernadette has made unilaterally which may negatively affect what should be one of the happier moments of their joint lives.
