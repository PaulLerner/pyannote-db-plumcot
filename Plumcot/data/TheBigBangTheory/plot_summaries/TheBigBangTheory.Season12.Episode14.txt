Sheldon is thrilled to help Bernadette and Howard navigate bureaucracy concerning a neighbor's non-compliant balcony until he learns they too have ignored codes. Leonard is disappointed when his friends are uninterested in his new laser.
Howard and Bernadette's new neighbor, Andy, an otherwise seemingly nice man, has built a porch overlooking their backyard, in combination with his motion activated flood light which has totally invaded any privacy they had in their backyard. Going down to city hall to investigate, they discover that they have to go through a bureaucratic quagmire just to learn if Andy obtained a permit for the porch, and if not a separate bureaucratic quagmire to see if the porch in any way contravenes zoning. They feel at a loss if to proceed until the learn that rule-obsessed and detail-oriented Sheldon loves such bureaucracy and is willing will go through the bureaucracy for them. The tables may be turned when Sheldon discovers something about Howard and Bernadette which could threaten him not only not helping them but their friendship in its entirety. Meanwhile, Leonard is professionally feeling a little left behind, with Sheldon and Amy perhaps on the brink of a Nobel. The latest issue is that Bert has asked Raj for help with a found meteorite, Bert wants Raj's opinion on his suspicion of organic matter contained within. The kicker ends up being when Bert and Raj decide to cut open the meteorite and decline Leonard's offer to use his laser - Leonard believing his option is superior - in favor of Bert's diamond blade circular saw.
