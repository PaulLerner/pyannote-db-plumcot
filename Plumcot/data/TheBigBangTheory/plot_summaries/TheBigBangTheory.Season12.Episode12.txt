Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack learns that he is infertile, so he asks Leonard for help; Koothrappali attempts to mend things with his ex-fiancee Anu.
In Penny, Amy and Bernadette's girls' night out, they run into Penny's old boyfriend, Zack, who tells them that he has sold his company and retired a wealthy man, but perhaps most importantly that he has gotten married. He invites Penny and Leonard to a get together with him and his wife, Marissa, on their boat. Leonard feels uncomfortable enough as he has always been a bit jealous of Zack if only because he used to date Penny, but even more so now considering Zack's seeming success and financial security. But when Penny and Leonard do get together with Zack and Marissa, Penny may be the uncomfortable one when their hosts tell them the ulterior motive they had in inviting them. Their request may bring Leonard and Penny's relationship under greater scrutiny. And in what was the boys' games night in, the issue of Raj and the seeming end of his relationship with Anu keeps coming up. In thinking about it, Raj wants to get back together with her. In speaking to both Anu and his father, the former who may not have forgiven Raj, Raj may come to a realization about the true nature of him and Anu as a couple.
