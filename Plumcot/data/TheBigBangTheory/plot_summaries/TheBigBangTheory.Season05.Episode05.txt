Sheldon takes offense when Leonard wants to attend a party with Wil Wheaton, while Bernadette tries to block Howard's opportunity to go into outer space.
Since they are in the comic book store when he stops in, Leonard and Sheldon are invited by Wil Wheaton to a party at his house. Leonard has every intention of going, which may place his and Sheldon's friendship on shaky ground as Wil is still on Sheldon's arch enemy list. Can anything convince Sheldon to attend the party himself? If so, he may end up meeting more arch enemies. Meanwhile, Howard, whose project has been chosen by NASA for the International Space Station, has been asked by them to go on a three week mission to the station. He believes that all his friends will be as happy for him as he is excited about it. But one person who isn't excited at all is Bernadette, who doesn't want him to go. Bernadette uses a tactic to convince Howard not to go, but that tactic may actually paint Bernadette as the bad guy.
