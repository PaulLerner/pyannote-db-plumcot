While being interviewed for a documentary about Spock from Star Trek (1966), Sheldon struggles to suppress his emotions about his recent break-up from Amy. Meanwhile, Howard and Bernadette butt heads over renovating his mother's house.
Sheldon is excited to learn through his friend Wil Wheaton that Adam Nimoy, the son of Leonard Nimoy, Sheldon's hero, is making a documentary on the character of Mr. Spock, and wants to interview him, as a fan, for the documentary. Sheldon is to talk about how the character of Mr. Spock has influenced his life. Elsewhere, Bernadette wants to renovate the house to make it feel more like her and Howard's home, and not the Wolowitz home. Howard would rather the house remain as it is, the way he remembers it in all his memories, good and bad, especially of his recently deceased mother. Bernadette and Howard each bring in reinforcements to support their side. With both the documentary and the redecorating, certain other issues come to light which change the focus of the tasks at hand.
