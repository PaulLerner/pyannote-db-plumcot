The guys are stranded in the middle of nowhere when Leonard's car is stolen on the way to the Bakersfield Comic-Con. Back home, the girls try to figure out why the guys are so fascinated with comic books.
The guys are off to a Comic-Con in Bakersfield. On the way they decide to stop at Vasquez Rocks where many Star Trek episodes were filmed and take some pictures of their own in their costumes. While doing so, the car is stolen, along with their street clothes, wallets and cell phones. In the meantime, the girls don't understand the attraction of Comic-Con since none of them have ever read a comic, so they go to the comic book store and buy a Thor comic. After reading it, they all decide it is stupid, but then start arguing about attributes in the comic, such as who can pick up and use Thor's hammer.
Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj head to Bakersfield for a local Comic-Con event. Driving on the way, they decide on the spur of the moment to stop at Vasquez Rocks where many episodes of Star Trek (1966) were filmed, there where they can get into their Star Trek costumes and pretend to be on the show. Their stop doesn't end up being quite what they expect, which leads to a surprising reaction from the group about their comic book focus. Meanwhile, Penny, Bernadette and Amy ponder why the guys are so enthralled with comic books. As such, the females head to the comic book store to ask Stuart for his recommendations on what novice comic book readers to should read. Reading the chosen comic book also leads to a surprising reaction between the three.
