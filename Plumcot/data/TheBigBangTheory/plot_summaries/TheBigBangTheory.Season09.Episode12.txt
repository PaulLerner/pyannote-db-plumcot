Penny gets more than she bargained for when Leonard agrees to meet with a psychiatrist on her behalf to make a sale. Meanwhile, Sheldon and Raj collaborate on an astronomical discovery, and Howard and Bernadette's happiness is short-lived after Stuart moves out.
With Amy away at a convention, Sheldon hangs out with the friend with "the best offer", which happens to be Raj who has time booked in the telescope room searching for rogue planets. While Raj initially regrets asking Sheldon to join him, Sheldon does become a useful participant in the process. However, the successful result of their time may cause further problems down the road for the two of them. Meanwhile, Penny is having problems trying to arrange a business appointment to meet with a psychiatrist named Dr. Gallo. Penny is able to convince Leonard to book an appointment with Dr. Gallo pretending to be a patient to lay the groundwork for getting Penny an appointment. Leonard and Penny's resulting time with Dr. Gallo may have deeper implications than they would have imagined. And just as Howard and Bernadette are beginning the process of remodeling the house, Stuart gives them the news that he has found an apartment and will be moving out. Despite Stuart being a thorn in their sides, Howard and Bernadette may get the feeling of being empty nesters once Stuart is truly gone.
