Penny sets up Raj with a deaf friend, not knowing that she's actually a gold digger, and Sheldon decides to let his minor decisions rest on the roll of the dice.
Especially with Howard and Bernadette's impending marriage, everyone, including Raj himself, is feeling sorry for Raj not having a girlfriend. The problem of Raj finding a girlfriend or one of his friends finding him a girlfriend is his inability to speak to women unless intoxicated. Penny, however, thinks she's come up with the perfect girl who at least gets around that talking issue. Emily, who Penny knows solely from her spin class, is deaf. Despite initially needing Howard to translate since Howard knows ASL - Howard who feels he needs to take poetic license in translating what Raj wants to say - Raj and Emily seem to hit it off. Raj quickly falls head over heals in love with her, and the gang believes Emily has fallen head over heels in love with Raj. However, they soon change their minds about Emily's feelings, believing that she has only one selfish interest in Raj, which makes them see Raj in a slightly different light. As the one who got Raj into the relationship, Penny feels she has to take whatever measure necessary to get him out of it, which Raj may or may not appreciate or fully understand. Meanwhile, to free up his brain for more important matters, Sheldon is leaving all trivial decisions of his life literally up to the roll of the dice.
Raj finally meets a girl he can communicate with.
