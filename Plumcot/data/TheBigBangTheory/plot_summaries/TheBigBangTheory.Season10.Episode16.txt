Sheldon and Amy have their first fight since moving in together. Meanwhile Raj is shocked at the reality of financial independence when he stops receiving support from his father.
In the latest video chat Raj has with his father who still pays for Raj's every expense despite Raj having a job, Raj learns that Dr. Koothrappali has, in his own words, "given up" on Raj ever getting married, his previous thought that his efforts to help Raj having gone awry being his fault in some way, while he now believes the failings are all Raj's. Dr. Koothrappali believes the core issues are that Raj is spoiled and overly sensitive. In his anger toward his father for thinking this way, Raj, in his first inclination, decides to get back at him by spending his money even more indiscriminately than he usually does if that is possible (yes it is). In speaking to his friends about the discussion with his father, Raj learns that they too think that he is spoiled. With those close to him feeling the same way, Raj has to decide if he has to make a fundamental change to his life. Meanwhile, Amy and Sheldon are out on one of their date nights. In running into Bert, Amy learns that everyone at the university knows that they only have sex once a year, that knowledge from Sheldon speaking about it to anyone to who he happens to be talking. Sheldon has to figure out how to make it up to Amy in her anger over the issue, with a problem still being Sheldon having no idea what he did being wrong.
