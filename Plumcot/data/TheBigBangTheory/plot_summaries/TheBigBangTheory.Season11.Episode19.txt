Leonard runs against Sheldon to be president of the tenants association; Wolowitz and Koothrappali find a drone in the backyard.
Because of something that happens associated with the building that they are not too happy about, Leonard, Penny and Amy not only learn that Sheldon is the President of the building's Tenants' Association, but that he *is* the Tenants' Association. As such, he has had the power to implement whatever rule and regulation for the building he feels suits his needs, and issue the associated fine or other penalty to the offending tenant behind the cover of the Association. Having been at the receiving end of of those penalties, Leonard and Penny not only want to challenge Sheldon's presidency but put Leonard in the position instead. Finding that support in the building to topple Sheldon may be more difficult than they imagine. But one person secretly on their side is Amy, who has to find a way to provide that support in a meaningful way without Sheldon knowing that she is going against him. Meanwhile, Howard and Raj find a drone in the backyard. While they want to repair it and keep it, Bernadette wants them to place some effort into finding its true owner. Discovering some information about the drone, Raj ends up siding with Bernadette solely because of that information.
