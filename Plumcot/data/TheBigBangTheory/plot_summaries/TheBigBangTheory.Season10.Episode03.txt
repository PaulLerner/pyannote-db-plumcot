Bernadette confesses to Raj that she isn't sure if she's ready to be a mother, Penny accompanies Amy to a university mixer, and Sheldon goes to unusual extremes to assist Howard with his military project.
With only two months to complete the contract for the Air Force, Howard, Leonard and Sheldon are working around the clock. Sheldon in particular is feeling sleep deprived as someone who doesn't drink coffee to stay awake. Feeling delirious, Sheldon, during one of the guys' working sessions, is lured to the dark side by the hallucination of one of his idols, the dark side being an energy drink. Sheldon is affected negatively by the experience, probably partly by the stimulants themselves, but also by the thought of what those chemicals are doing to his system. But what may be most negatively affecting Sheldon is the core reason why he is feeling so tired. With Howard at work, Bernadette is left to spend the day with Raj, who suggests they start preparing the baby's room. Slowly, Bernadette lets Raj know in no uncertain terms that she is concerned that her maternal instincts have not kicked in as she is less than excited about being pregnant. Unable to reassure her, Raj calls in who he believes is an expert in the field to help Bernadette deal with her emotions. And Penny volunteers to accompany Amy to a science department "party", the attendees being all Amy's scientist colleagues. Penny figures that even if she doesn't understand any of the conversations, she can always keep herself company with a glass of wine. Both Amy and Penny are surprised by how much fun they end up having at the gathering, that fun based on some revelations concerning Amy.
