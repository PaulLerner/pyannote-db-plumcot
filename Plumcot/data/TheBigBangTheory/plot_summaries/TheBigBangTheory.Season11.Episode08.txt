Howard and Leonard become upset after they discover that Sheldon has been working with the military without telling them; Bernadette asks Raj to investigate her suspicions that Ruchi is attempting to take her job away from her.
When Leonard and Howard find out that Sheldon worked with the military behind their backs, they are furious and ask Kripke to help them, much to Sheldon's annoyance. Meanwhile, Bernadette asks Raj to see if Ruchi is trying to steal her job.
Sheldon lets it slip (quite easily) to Leonard that the military has rehired him to work on the guidance system as Sheldon approached them with a way to turn it into a communications system. Colonel Williams confirms that fact to Leonard and Howard. Feeling betrayed that Sheldon is benefiting from what was originally their project, Leonard and Howard, as an insult, accuse Sheldon of being a Thomas A. Edison - a scientist he considers opportunistic - as opposed to being a Nikola Tesla - a scientist he truly admires as standing by his principles. Beyond that insult, Howard, on an idea Leonard has regarding the guidance system, believes there is a better way to get back at Sheldon. However they require the help of a third party, who may have his own motives. Meanwhile, Bernadette, still bedridden, receives a social visit from Raj and Ruchi. Stemming from what most would consider a friendly comment made by Ruchi, Bernadette believes that Ruchi is out to steal her job. Incensed, Bernadette asks Raj, Ruchi's current friend with benefits, to act as her mole, placing Raj in the middle between his sex partner and his goddess idol.
