The gang convince Sheldon to celebrate his birthday and throw him a party.
Sheldon's birthday is approaching, and Amy wants to throw him a party despite he not ever having wanted a birthday party in the past. When Amy, Leonard, and Penny learn the reason why he's never wanted a party, they assure him that this one will make up for the disappointments that were his birthday parties when he was a child. In trying to figure out what to get him for a present, Leonard, Howard and Raj decide that what would make up for those childhood party disappointments would be to have a Batman show up, specifically in the form of Adam West. Even with all the details of what Sheldon wants for his birthday, such as a three layer chocolate cake with strawberry frosting, Sheldon will have to overcome a lot of bad memories to make it through what his friends want to be a good party for him.
