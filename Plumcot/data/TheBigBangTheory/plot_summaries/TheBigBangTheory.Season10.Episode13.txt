Leonard and Penny ask for Sheldon's and Amy's help on putting the romance back in their marriage. Howard and Raj go to extreme lengths to stop the floor in Halley's bedroom from making noise.
Penny laments not only that Leonard no longer does romantic things for her like he used to before and when they first got married, but that he doesn't even seem to try anymore, the latter which makes her feel like he takes her for granted. Although she is reluctant to do so, Penny tells Leonard what is bothering her, which leads to a fight between the two, Leonard who feels he has made all the effort throughout their entire relationship. Penny decides she needs some time away from Leonard, and as such takes Amy on the romantic trip to the spa she had originally planned with Leonard. As Penny and Leonard turn to Amy and Sheldon respectively for advice and support, they may come to a drastic conclusion about what needs to be done. Meanwhile, Howard has discovered that the wood floor in Halley's bedroom squeaks. Despite Casey's advice to Bernadette that they just rip out and replace the entire floor, Howard and Raj try to figure out ways not to make the existing floor squeak, Raj wanting them to think outside the box. And Sheldon has decided to make an effort to be more interested in the goings-on in other people's lives, despite in doing so he coming into some knowledge overload of a certain kind.
