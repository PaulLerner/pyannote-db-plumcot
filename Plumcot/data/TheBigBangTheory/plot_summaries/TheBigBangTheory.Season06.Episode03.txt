When Sheldon hires a female grad student to assist him, a jealous Amy asks Penny to help her spy on them. On the space station, Howard begins behaving erratically.
Sheldon needs someone to read through the works he did during his elementary school days, to find out if he has made a scientific breakthrough that was Nobel Prize worthy, since he thinks his time is too important to do the task himself. He eventually hires an attractive Physics grad student named Alex Jensen. When Alex answers Amy's video call to Sheldon, Amy gets shocked to learn that Alex is a girl. Amy and Penny go to Caltech to spy on them. In the cafeteria, it turns out that Alex is flirting with Leonard, much to Amy's relief and Penny's surprise. Penny has to consider that Leonard is attractive to other women. Meanwhile, Howard tells Bernadette that he have a layover in space of an additional 7 - 10 days. He is sick of his time in space and is having bad anxiety attacks that is causing erratic behavior.
Sheldon believes that his Nobel Prize winning project is buried somewhere deep within the many projects on which he's worked ever since he was an infant. On Leonard's advice, Sheldon decides to hire a grad student to help him sift through all his old materials. She is the beautiful Alex Jensen, who is in awe of Sheldon and ends up also acting as his administrative assistant in every capacity. Beyond Alex's generally workmanlike relationship with Sheldon, her arrival onto the scene affects Amy, Raj, Leonard and Penny all in slightly different ways, and for most not in good ways. Meanwhile, Howard's Soyuz rocket ride back to Earth has been delayed by at least a week. Anxiety ridden Howard isn't sure if he will survive the delay.
