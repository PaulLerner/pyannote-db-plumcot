A successful gene experimentation leaves Sheldon excited to procreate with Amy, and he pulls out all stops to get her on board. Meanwhile, Raj takes an interest in the cleaning lady at the university.
Despite the parts that he doesn't like about it, Amy is able to convince Sheldon to take a skin sample from him so that she can develop a brain cell from a combination of both his and hers. Sheldon is so enamored with the result of Amy's experiment that he proposes something else that shocks Amy. Sheldon does whatever he can to convince Amy to go along - those measures which would normally excite her - but she resists to the best of her ability if only because of what the end result would be. Meanwhile, Raj has met a woman, Issabella, at the university to who he is attracted, and who he would like to start dating. Beyond that physical and emotional attraction he has to her, there is one aspect of her being about which he may not be able to overcome and which colors what he says about her to his friends.
Amy combines cells from her and Sheldon to form a brain cell. When Sheldon sees the results, he wants to take it to the next level--have a baby with Amy but she's unwilling to do it so Sheldon sets out to entice her. When Raj meets the cleaning woman at the university, he's taken with her. When the guys discover he's seeing someone he tells them he met someone at work and they assume it's another scientist and he doesn't correct them.
