It is Valentine's Day and everybody is trying to figure out what to do to make it special. Girlfriendless Raj and Stuart decide to hold a party at the comic book store for all the single people to spend together. Amy wants to have a romantic evening with Sheldon, who reluctantly plans to accommodate her, despite not liking it. He even goes out of his way to buy her a romantic gift... sort of. But Amy gives Sheldon the greatest gift of all, which Amy in turn feels about what he ends up giving her. Leonard also wants his night with Penny to be special, despite Penny believing that the day never lives up to the hype. That special evening includes a romantic dinner, and which also includes Howard and Bernadette, since Howard's planned gift did not quite come to pass. The dinner starts off badly due to an argument between Howard and Bernadette even before they arrive. But Penny goes out of her way to sabotage the evening. She and Leonard need to figure out why for their relationship to survive.
