The guys throw Howard a bachelor party, and some embarrassing details about his life get posted on the Internet.
It's two weeks before Howard and Bernadette's wedding. While the gals have a gift bag packing evening while talking about Bernadette's chosen married name and some other unmentionables mentioned by Amy, the guys are out for what Howard assumes will be a subdued stag party since he has promised Bernadette that there will be no strippers at the event. It does end up being subdued as most bachelor parties go, but some information that comes to light at the stag threatens the wedding as well as Bernadette's friendship with Penny. Penny and Howard do whatever they can to right whatever wrongs came to light.
