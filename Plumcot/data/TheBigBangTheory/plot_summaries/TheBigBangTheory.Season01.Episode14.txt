Penny gets mad at the guys when their full scale model of a time machine causes her to miss work, which prompts Leonard to give up all of his nerd memorabilia.
Leonard buys a replica time machine online. As the boys move it into the apartment they accidentally make Penny late for work causing her to lash out at Leonard for his nerdy ways. Upset, Leonard decides to get rid of all his 'nerdmabelia' and the guys try to convince him not to.
On an impulse, Leonard makes a bid of $800 on eBay for a miniature time machine prop used in The Time Machine (1960), $800 which he does not have. Unfortunately, his is the winning bid. The guys make a pact to split the cost and its use four ways before they see the actual machine, which is full sized. But Leonard comes to regret buying it when Penny's reaction to it is less than enthusiastic. Her comments make him think about whether the time machine and other like minded toys that he has are preventing him from ever attracting a woman like Penny. Will anything change his mind?
On a whim, Leonard buys a replica of the time machine from the 1960 film The Time Machine for $800, only to find that it is actually life-sized. Penny becomes angry when his new purchase causes her to be late for work and lashes out at the guys for being grown men who still play with toys. This causes Leonard to rethink his priorities to the point where he is ready to sell his beloved collection. The guys try and talk him out of it, but Sheldon blames his current distress on a hypocritical Penny whose apartment also has collections of stuffed bears and Hello Kitty memorabilia.
