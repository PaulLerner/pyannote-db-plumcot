Sheldon and Leonard make a road trip to wrangle a reluctant wedding guest.
Sheldon learns that his mother will not be attending his and Amy's wedding unless Sheldon invites his older brother, Georgie (who now prefers to be called George), which Sheldon had no intention of doing for all the years that George bullied him when they were growing up. In trying to contact George, Sheldon learns that George equally has no intention of attending. With his mother's attendance on the line, Sheldon, with Leonard tagging along for moral support, has no other option but to go to Dallas, where George lives and works as a tires salesman, to speak to him face-to-face about the issue. As a bystander in the matter, Leonard sees that the facts as told by Sheldon and George may be similar, but the perspective may be a little different. In seeing that difference in perspective, Leonard may find a way for the brothers to bridge the gap. Back in Pasadena, Howard and Bernadette's children have a direct effect on the outward attractiveness of the wedding, the specific issue affecting almost all of the gang. While they as a group try to determine what to do about the matter so as not to have that negative effect on the wedding which is only a week away, Amy, in turn, has to hide it at all cost from Sheldon, this issue which could be a deal breaker for him in going through with the ceremony.
