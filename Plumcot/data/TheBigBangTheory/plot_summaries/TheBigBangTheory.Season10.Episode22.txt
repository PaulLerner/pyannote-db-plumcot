Leonard is less than thrilled when Penny considers accepting a job offer from her ex-boyfriend, Zack. Sheldon worries that he hasn't reached his full potential soon enough.
An event demonstrates to Sheldon that his cognitive abilities are weakening. This thought dismays him for many reasons, including the fact that his time to come up with a Nobel award winning project is getting shorter and shorter. Sheldon having read that taxing one's mental skills makes them sharper, his friends come up with different ideas as skills that Sheldon may learn to help him feel like his mental acuity is strengthening. In the process, Amy comes to some conclusions, including that Sheldon's task is a catch-22 proposition for failure. Meanwhile, Penny, Amy and Bernadette, on a girls' night out, run into Penny's old boyfriend, Zack, who has among his news that he is engaged. He proposes that he, his fianc√©e, Penny and Leonard go out as a foursome to catch up, Zack who has always liked Leonard. Leonard reluctantly agrees. That reluctance is strengthened when, at dinner, an issue comes to light about Penny's current life, with Zack coming up with a proposition to solve that problem, that solution which would entail the two of them spending more time together. Leonard doesn't want Penny to do it still feeling insecure about Zack, and despite he knowing that it would make Penny happy. Penny wants to do it, but not if it will drive a wedge between her Leonard. The Hofstadters have to come to a negotiated settlement about the issue.
