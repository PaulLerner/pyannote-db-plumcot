Penny is thrown for a loop when Leonard is offered a job overseas, but the news is an even bigger shock to Sheldon. Raj and Lucy's relationship comes to a crossroad.
Howard thinks that Leonard has a good shot at one of the positions working for Stephen Hawking on a four month long expedition on a ship in the North Sea. Leonard is excited to learn the job is his if he wants it. Sheldon is both jealous of Leonard and sad if Leonard goes if only because of Leonard's role as his primary gopher. In trying to convince Leonard not to go, Sheldon ultimately brings up the one item that may stop him from going: Penny. However, Penny, supporting Leonard in his dream, wants him to go. Both Penny and Sheldon have to come to terms about what losing Leonard for four months will mean to their lives. Meanwhile, Raj convinces Lucy to meet at least one of his friends, as meeting the entire group is too frightening a thought. The encounter with who ends up being the surprise choice of that friend doesn't go quite the way Raj wants, but it does lead to Raj further convincing Lucy to meet all his friends at Leonard's farewell party. Can Lucy handle the pressure of this group situation? It does result in a surprising action by Raj.
