When Leonard and Sheldon are invited to speak at UC Berkeley, they take a detour to try and meet one of their idols. Meanwhile, while cleaning out Mrs. Wolowitz's house, a ping pong battle ensues when Howard and Bernadette argue over the fate of his TARDIS.
Leonard and Sheldon have been invited to present their joint paper at UC-Berkeley. As they have plenty of time on the drive to Berkeley, they decide to stop by George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch, with Leonard's expectation that they will end up seeing what they can see through the gates, while Sheldon's expectation is that they will meet Lucas himself. They have to come up with a plan to achieve Sheldon's goal... or not. Meanwhile, Howard, Bernadette, Penny, Amy and Raj are cleaning out Mrs. Wolowitz's garage and deciding what they should sell at the ensuing garage sale. Two of items found are Howard's TARDIS and a ping pong table, the latter which ends up being the battleground on what happens to the former, with a little psychology thrown in.
