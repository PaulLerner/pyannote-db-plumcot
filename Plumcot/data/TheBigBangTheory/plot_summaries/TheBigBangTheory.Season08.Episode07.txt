The guys befriend one of Penny's clients when he shows up at her apartment. Meanwhile, Bernadette gets upset when Amy torpedoes an article about her for a local magazine.
Bernadette is excited to be asked to be included in a magazine photo shoot featuring the fifty sexiest female scientists. The topic places a wedge between her and Amy, who doesn't believe that strutting one's sex appeal advances the scientific profession... or does Amy have ulterior motives in her stance? Meanwhile, Dr. Lorvis, one of Penny's clients who has done an Internet search looking for her, stops by her apartment unannounced with flowers hoping to initiate a romantic relationship with her, because she seemed single (i.e. she was not wearing her engagement ring, at least not on her left ring finger), she touched his arm for "two Mississippis", and she winked at him. Leonard is able to intercept him before he gets to Penny, who ultimately does admit she flirts to make sales. But Dr. Lorvis ends up making a bigger impression on the entire gang than he did on Penny.
