The guys struggle to cope with Raj's arrogance after he is featured in a People magazine article.
Because of his finding and reporting of a previously unknown planetary object, Raj has been named one of People magazine's "30 Under 30 to Watch". In his usual manner, Sheldon mocks this achievement, which hurts Raj's feelings. Regardless, Raj becomes Gablehauser's new star because of the notoriety of the article and the associated money coming into the department. Along with Gablehauser's gushing comes some perks available only to Raj. Raj's fifteen minutes of fame starts to go to his head. He starts to alienate Leonard, Sheldon and Howard. Penny doesn't understand why his friends aren't providing Raj with the support he deserves, especially in attending the magazine's reception on the article. She's the only one of the four attending the function with Raj, hence she'll be his "date", which silently gnaws at Leonard. But Sheldon sees Raj's absence from the group as a potential opportunity.
Raj's discovery of a trans-Neptunian object called 2008 NQ17, (which he nicknames "Planet Bollywood") gets him noticed by People Magazine who want to put him in their "30 under 30 to watch." The guys, especially Sheldon, are not very supportive of his new found semi-fame. The next day they try and apologize to him, only to find that fame has gone to his head, making him insufferable. Penny is angry about their frustration and agrees to go with him to the VIP party, which puts their friendship on the line when he comes on to her.
