Sheldon and Bernadette spend the evening together while the rest of the gang go to a wine tasting party, but things get uncomfortable for Raj when Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack shows up and takes an interest in Claire.
Penny has received tickets to a wine tasting, and has invited all her friends to go with her. Everyone accepts except Sheldon, who has no interest, and Bernadette, who can't drink since she's pregnant. So Sheldon suggests that when everyone else is at the wine tasting, he and Bernadette spend time together doing things for that he normally likes to do and that Bernadette is reduced to now only being able to do since she's pregnant. Bernadette reluctantly accepts Sheldon's invitation. She ends up being surprised by their time together. At the wine tasting, the gang runs into Zack, Penny's old boyfriend who she hasn't seen since before she and Leonard got married. Zack's simplistic way of looking at the world makes for an uncomfortable evening for Leonard, Howard and Raj, the first two who reevaluate working on their prototype for the guidance system, and Raj who is trying to play it overly casual with his date for the evening, Claire, upon her first meeting with his friends.
