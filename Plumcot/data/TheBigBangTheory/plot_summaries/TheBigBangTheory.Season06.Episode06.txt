Penny is taking a history class at Pasadena Community College, but she doesn't want to tell anyone, especially Leonard who she feels will make too big a deal out of it. Indeed, when she does eventually tell him, Leonard reacts exactly the way she expected him to, which isn't what she wants. So when he asks to read her first essay, she refuses to let him, believing that he will be supportively critical. So, behind her back, Leonard does end up reading her paper before she is ready to submit it. The problem becomes how can he tell her that he thinks her paper is terrible without letting her know that he read it behind her back, but at the same time help her so that she doesn't fail the class. Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Hawking has accepted Sheldon's invitation to play a game of "Words with Friends" online. By the sheer name of the game, Sheldon believes they really are friends. So when Hawking suddenly stops playing in the middle of the game while being far behind, Sheldon believes he has lost the friendship of the only man he believes smarter than himself. Sheldon learns from Howard that Hawking doesn't like to lose. If Hawking does reemerge into the game, Sheldon has to decide if he should lose on purpose to regain Hawking's friendship.
