Leonard and Penny's first night together goes awkwardly. Sheldon and Howard wager on the species of a cricket.
After hearing a cricket chirping, Howard and Sheldon make a wager, the winner to get one of the other's favorite comic books. Their wager is on whether the cricket is a common field cricket (Howard's assertion) or a snowy tree cricket (Sheldon's assertion). To determine who wins the bet, first they have to find the cricket, second they have to capture the cricket, and third they have to decide who can make the ultimate determination. The person they choose is entomology Professor "Creepy" Crawley, who is facing some issues of his own. Meanwhile, Leonard and Penny eventually admit to each other that their first time together as lovers was less than thrilling. They have to figure out how to overcome this problem, or if not what to do about it.
