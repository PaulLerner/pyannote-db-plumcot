An impending change to his living arrangements inspires Sheldon to revert to 2003, before he met Penny and Leonard. Raj and Howard form a band for the comic book store.
Leonard and Penny finally move in together leaving Sheldon very upset with this big change in his life and wishing he could go back to a time when he had no emotions in 2003 before he met Leonard. Raj, Howard and Stuart attempt to form a band.
Leonard and Penny have finally made the decision for Leonard to move into her apartment, Leonard relinquishing all his rights to his and Sheldon's apartment. They try to soften the blow in delivering the news to Sheldon, whose mind changes on the issue when Bernadette informs him that he could find a better roommate than Leonard. When finding that replacement doesn't come as easily as Sheldon thought, he reverts back to what he considers the last stable time in his life, namely just before he met Leonard in 2003. That drastic change to living life like he did twelve years ago may give Leonard and Penny some pause about what their moving in together will do for their collective lives. Meanwhile, Stuart is looking for a band to play for free at the store. Howard and Raj believe they can fulfill both Stuart's request and their lifelong dream by forming a band of their own. Their concept for a band is even the same of folk-oriented acoustic sci-fi inspired music. But is a concept enough to sustain their band, especially when they may be working on different priorities?
