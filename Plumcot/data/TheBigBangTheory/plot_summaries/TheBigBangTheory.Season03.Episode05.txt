Leonard is forced to ask Penny to set Howard up with one of her friends, while Sheldon seeks payback against sci-fi star Wil Wheaton.
Howard reminds Leonard of a five year old pact between the two. Effectively, the pact stipulates that Penny has to set Howard up with one of her friends. Leonard has to tread lightly to ask Penny for this favor. A reluctant Penny does find someone, but she may regret it when she and Leonard go on a double date with them. Meanwhile, Raj tries to talk Sheldon into entering a $500 top prize Mystic Warlords of Ka'ah tournament with him to be held at the comic book shop. Sheldon has no interest in entering because, with his eidetic memory, the game is no challenge. Sheldon changes his mind when he learns that Wil Wheaton, number six on his arch enemy list (Wil didn't show up for a scheduled appearance at a sci-fi convention that Sheldon attended in 1995), has entered. Sheldon's goal is to crush 'Wesley Crusher'. During the tournament, can Wil do anything to change Sheldon's mind about him?
Now that Leonard is dating Penny, Howard reminds him of a pact they made that if one of them gets a girlfriend that he should ask his girlfriend to set up the other one with one of her friends. Leonard doesn't remember it but Sheldon does. So Leonard asks Penny and she reluctantly sets him up with a girl named Bernadette. They go on a double date, and they don't have anything in common which makes Leonard and Penny think it's a mistake. Sheldon goes to the comic book store and learns there's a collectible card tournament, Raj wants to enter and needs a partner and asks Sheldon but he doesn't think it will a challenge. But when he learns Will Wheaton will be joining he sees this as his opportunity to get back at him for not showing up at a convention he was suppose to attend which Sheldon went to.
