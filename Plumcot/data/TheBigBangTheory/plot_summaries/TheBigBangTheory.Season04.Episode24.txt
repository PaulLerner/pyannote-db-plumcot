Raj moves in with Sheldon after hearing Leonard and Priya engage in a Star Trek fantasy in his apartment. Bernadette receives her doctorate.
Bernadette has just announced that her dissertation has been accepted, meaning that she will soon get her Ph.D. On top of that, she has received a lucrative job offer with a pharmaceutical company. Although Howard states that he is happy for her, the fact that everyone else in their group, who also have their Ph.D.'s, may cause a bit of problem for his ego, especially as they all kid him about being the inferior one in their relationship. Meanwhile, Leonard and Priya doing some Star Trek (1966) sex role playing in the Koothrappali apartment is a bit much for Raj to handle. Tired and needing a place to sleep, he eventually ends up asking Sheldon if he can sleep in Leonard's bed. After Leonard finds out, he suggests this move be a longer term one until Priya gets her own apartment. Having Penny as a next door neighbor may have some benefits for Raj. And Leonard accidentally learns some information about Priya's future.
