Leonard's book raises questions, and Amy guest stars on the new Professor Proton show.
The reboot of the "Professor Proton" show with Wil Wheaton assuming the titular role from the now-deceased Arthur Jeffries has just started airing. Sheldon wanting to be Professor Proton has placed Wil back on his enemy list. Without watching it, Sheldon decides to do whatever he can to ensure that the show doesn't succeed. However, in Amy convincing Sheldon at least to watch the show before he criticizes it, Sheldon is surprised that he actually does like the show. But a specific incident on the show brings to light something within Sheldon about which he was somewhat unaware that negatively affects his relationships with his friends, including Amy. Will that incident lead to Sheldon becoming a more empathetic friend, especially to Amy? Meanwhile, Leonard has just started to write his novel, the central character, he wishfully basing on himself, being a physicist named Logan Dean who solves crimes using science. Bernadette, who reads the early pages, convinces Leonard that the lead female character, Ilsa, a beautiful, tough, mean blonde, is based on Penny, whether it be consciously or unconsciously done. If Penny finds out, she may not take too kindly to that characterization of her. If Leonard didn't consciously base it on her, could Ilsa actually be someone else?
