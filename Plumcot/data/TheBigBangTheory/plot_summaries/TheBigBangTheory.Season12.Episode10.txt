A VHS tape from Sheldon's past inspires him and Amy not to give up when they're still feeling down about their theory being disproven. Bernadette turns into a pageant mom when she tries to help Howard with his Magic Castle audition.
Amy, and especially Sheldon, are still reeling from learning that their theory on super asymmetry, which Sheldon at least believed was his path to a Nobel, had long ago been disproven and thus will not be his path to a Nobel. As such, Sheldon begins to question what were all his natural instincts which scares Amy as she believes it will only be a matter of time before he starts to question their relationship and marriage. While all their friends try to avoid setting off any triggers to make the situation worse, Leonard believes that two people who Sheldon admires most in the world may be able to help him, one being Beverly and the other being who Sheldon truly believes is the smartest person in the world. It may be some associated items that may help Sheldon the most. Meanwhile, Bernadette learns that Howard had once contemplated auditioning to be a member of the Magic Castle as the Great Howdini, he never went through with it believing he didn't quite have the right stuff to be in the big leagues. Bernadette vows to help Howard achieve this long put aside dream, perhaps with a little ulterior motive on her part and a unique perspective.
