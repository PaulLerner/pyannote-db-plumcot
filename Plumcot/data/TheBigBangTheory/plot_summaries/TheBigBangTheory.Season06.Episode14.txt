Sheldon is forced to work with Kripke on a project and must concoct an elaborate lie when he can't hold up his end of the work. Howard and Raj get superhero figurines made of themselves.
Sheldon and Barry Kripke are both working on grant proposals for the same thing. As the university can only submit one proposal, they make Sheldon and Kripke work together, which outrages Sheldon. Regardless, Sheldon reluctantly agrees to Kripke's plan that they trade proposals to see where they both stand. After both read the other's proposal, they get sidetracked on an issue behind the quality of Sheldon's proposal. Meanwhile, Raj finds a company that can make action figures of oneself for $500 apiece. He convinces Howard that they each should buy one. The resulting figures don't look remotely like Raj or Howard. They decide that they can make their own by purchasing an expensive 3D printer. Although the resulting figures are more to Howard and Raj's liking, it also has an unexpected consequence.
Kripke informs Sheldon that they're working on similar projects and the university told him that they have to work together which infuriates Sheldon. They agree to exchange data. Sheldon upon seeing Kripke's work is amazed that Kripke's superior to his. When they meet Kripke tells him that he's work is not good because he is spending too much time with his girlfriend and Sheldon doesn't correct him. Howard and Raj order action figures that are made in their image but upon receiving them, they see they're not. Raj then suggests that they get a 3D printer which is a little expensive so Howard uses the money from the joint account he shares with Bernadette. And when he tells her what he did she freaks out.
