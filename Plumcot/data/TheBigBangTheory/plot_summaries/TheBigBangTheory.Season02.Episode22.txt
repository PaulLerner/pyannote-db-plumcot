Penny's second date with Stuart has significant implications for Leonard. Howard enlists the guys' help with one of his NASA projects.
Despite how poorly their first and only date ended (albeit the poorness caused by Sheldon), Stuart and Penny are going out on a second date. Not wanting to screw things up, Stuart asks Leonard for advice on Penny's expectations of the date getting "physical". Penny also asks Leonard for advice on how to get Stuart to come out of his shyness shell. Leonard doesn't want Stuart and Penny's relationship to advance, but he doesn't want to lose either as friends. Leonard ends up giving Stuart what he considers some intentionally bad advice. Feeling guilty about it, he tries to find out what happened on their date so that he can clear his conscience. Meanwhile, Howard has completed the International Space Station's "Wolowitz Zero Gravity Human Waste Disposal System" (i.e. their toilet). After it's been deployed to the station, Howard realizes that he made an error in his calculations, and the system will fail within ten flushes. He has to figure out how to fix the problem only using materials available at the station (which he is having problems with) and how to implement the fix without embarrassment to himself.
