Leonard, Penny and Raj adjust to their new living arrangements; Sheldon expresses an interest in Amy's work.
Raj has now moved in with Leonard and Penny. Instead of a roommate for both of them, what Raj becomes is Penny's closest girlfriend, with Leonard feeling left out. It's not even so much that Leonard feels like a third wheel or that Raj is having a better time with his wife than he is that is the problem in Leonard's rational deduction about his emotions. Leonard turns to Howard and Bernadette for solace and advice, they who may be able to provide a different perspective on the matter. Meanwhile, Sheldon has taken an interest in Amy's work on the neuroscience of the decision making process. He believes that throwing a little physics into the mix would lead to a truly revolutionary project, to which Amy agrees. Even with ground rules laid out, Amy and Sheldon have to decide if the successes in the project are worth the anguish of the arguments and name calling which may ultimately ruin their personal relationship.
