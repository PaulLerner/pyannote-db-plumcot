After their wedding, Amy and Sheldon go on their honeymoon.
Sheldon and Amy are on their honeymoon. The good news for Amy: Sheldon wants to have more coitus than usual and thus what she was expecting despite it being their honeymoon. The bad news for Amy: Sheldon has their coitus all scheduled like he has their entire honeymoon which for her is taking the romance out of it in she wanting some spontaneity. While Sheldon and Amy are away, Leonard and Penny learn that Mr. Fowler has been hiding from Mrs. Fowler in Sheldon and Amy's apartment. In seeing Mr. and Mrs. Fowler in a more up close and personal light, one of Leonard and Penny can't help but wonder if they are just a younger version of a ball-busting wife and a meek timid husband. And Raj has been asked by one of the local news television stations to talk about the meteor shower on the air, to which Howard states that it seems to be the same career trajectory as Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is now a celebrity. As such, Raj places himself on the same playing field as Dr. deGrasse Tyson in throwing down a gauntlet of sorts to his more famous colleague.
