Amy gets inadvertently caught in the middle of a fight between Sheldon and Penny over a chair. Leonard tries to add some spice to his long-distance relationship with Priya.
With Priya having moved back to India, she and Leonard decide to try having a long distance relationship, which includes Skyping each other on a regular basis. Howard suggests that they take that communication one step further by having high speed on-line sex with each other. When conventional on-line sex between the two of them fails, Howard has some equipment that he thinks will enhance their on-line experience, which he demonstrates with Raj while an uncomfortable Leonard looks on. While Leonard and Priya are talking on-line, Sheldon takes refuge in Penny's apartment. Sheldon is in love with how comfortable Penny's new chair is, until he finds out that it is a used chair that she found discarded on the street. A freaked out Sheldon is certain that he has contracted some nasty bug from sitting in the chair, and does whatever he can to make Penny get rid of it. None of Sheldon's tactics works. Something else may make Penny think twice about keeping the chair.
