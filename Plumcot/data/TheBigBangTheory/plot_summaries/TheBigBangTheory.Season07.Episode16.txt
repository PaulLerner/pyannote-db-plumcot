Leonard's purchase of a dining room table causes Sheldon to reevaluate the changes in his life. Meanwhile, Howard is offered a chance to go back to space and Bernadette struggles with whether or not to encourage him.
Penny sitting on the floor during dinner makes everyone in the gang think that Leonard and Sheldon should invest in a dining room table, that is except for Sheldon, despite they having unused space for one and only because it is change which Sheldon does not like. Despite Sheldon being against getting one, Leonard, on Penny's urging to stand up for his rights, decides to buy one anyway, although he does keep in the back of his mind what he thinks Sheldon would or would not like, if he was to like anything. The resulting dining room table in the apartment ends up being a metaphor for Sheldon's current life. Meanwhile, Howard gets a call from NASA asking him to go back to the Space Station, about which he is thrilled. Bernadette is less than excited by the news, if only because of her remembrance of how miserable Howard was during his last space experience. Will the thought of the thrill of space travel trump Howard's memory?
