Raj gets quite a surprise when he asks his parents to set him up on a date. Penny buys Leonard and Sheldon a pair of Star Trek keepsake collectibles.
To show her appreciation for all the free meals she's had at their apartment, Penny, using money from an acting residual check, gives Leonard and Sheldon each a gift: a vintage, mint, in-the-box, 1975 Mego Star Trek (1966) Transporter, with real transporter action - apiece. They both love their gift. It has additional special meaning for Leonard since it was given to him from Penny with love. And it has additional special meaning for Sheldon since his Leonard Nimoy Spock miniature action figure would fit in the toy. However, Penny is dismayed to learn that neither Leonard or Sheldon plan on opening their respective gift to play with it since doing so would diminish its value. Later, Sheldon, hearing the voice of his Spock miniature action figure in his dreams telling him to do so, decides to open his gift to play with it. The result makes him contemplate secretly switching his now useless toy with Leonard's mint condition, still-in-the-box toy. Meanwhile, on the question of whether he will bring a date to Howard and Bernadette's wedding, a girlfriendless Raj makes a drastic decision: he will allow his parents to arrange a marriage for him. Although he really likes Lakshmi, his parent's choice of a wife for him, after their initial first few dates and thinks she may indeed be the one, an admission on her part makes Raj have to decide if marriage at any cost is worth it.
