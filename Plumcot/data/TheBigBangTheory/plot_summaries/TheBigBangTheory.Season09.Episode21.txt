The gang pick sides when a small argument between Leonard and Sheldon erupts into a heated fight during a "Game of Thrones" viewing party.
Leonard's mad at Sheldon for having to attend yet another "useless" quarterly roommate agreement meeting, on which Penny falls on Sheldon's side in wanting to keep the peace. Sheldon's mad at Amy for siding with Leonard against him and Penny as she admits she never liked to attend girlfriend agreement meetings. Howard's mad at Raj for continually flaunting the fact that he is dating both Emily and Claire all in form of complaining how difficult it all is. All these disagreements have the potential to come to a head when the gang gets together to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones (2011) as Stuart is the brunt of yet another prank by Howard, and as further revelations emerge about why Amy sided with Leonard against Sheldon and Penny, and about where Bernadette falls into the complicated relationship between Howard and Raj.
