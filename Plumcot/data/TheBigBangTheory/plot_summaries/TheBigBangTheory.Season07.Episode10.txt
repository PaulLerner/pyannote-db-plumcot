Leonard has to deal with the fallout of disproving Sheldon's new scientific discovery. Raj spends a week at Howard and Bernadette's apartment.
Ever since Sheldon made the major scientific discovery of how to stabilize a new, stable super heavy element, Sheldon has been miserable promoting his discovery since he and the world knows he came across the discovery solely by an error on his part. Even being touted as possibly winning a Nobel Prize, albeit in Chemistry, makes the situation worse. Competing actions by Leonard and Wil Wheaton make Sheldon come to a different perspective on the matter. Meanwhile, Bernadette is upset with Howard for lying to her about Raj and Cinnamon's stay with them, which she thought was only going to be for one night, but which she learns is going to be a for a week. Raj ends up having a profound effect on the Wolowitz/Rostenkowski household.
