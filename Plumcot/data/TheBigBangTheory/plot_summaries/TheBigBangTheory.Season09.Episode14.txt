Sheldon is thrilled when his Meemaw comes to visit, but his excitement quickly fades when she butts heads with Amy. Meanwhile, Raj meets a girl at the comic book store who makes him question his relationship with Emily.
Meemaw comes to visit her Moonpie. In other words, Sheldon's grandmother, Constance, comes for a visit. Although it may seem to Sheldon that her visit is purely a want to spend some time with her Moonpie, it is really to size up Amy. Meemaw has some negative preconceived notions of Amy walking in, which may or may not change based upon meeting her. But if Meemaw's views don't change, Sheldon may be forced to choose between his girlfriend and his beloved Meemaw. In the process, the rationale for that view may also come to light. Meanwhile, Howard and Raj meet Claire, a beautiful young woman, at the comic book store. She is an aspiring filmmaker who wants to pick Raj's brain on science issues for her sci-fi animated children's project. Raj seeks some advice from Howard and Bernadette about whether he should meet with Claire, the issue being the "vibe" Raj felt between the two of them, and whether he should tell Emily about meeting her or meeting with her if he does.
