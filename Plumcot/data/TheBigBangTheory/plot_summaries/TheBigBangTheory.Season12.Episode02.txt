Leonard and Penny give Sheldon and Amy a baffling wedding gift.
Sheldon and Amy are back from their honeymoon, and are in the process of opening their wedding presents when they come across Leonard and Penny's gift which the card states is the "perfect gift for the perfect couple". The problem for Sheldon and Amy is that they have no idea what it is and don't want to ask Leonard and Penny being their best friends who put so much effort into giving them what they consider the perfect gift. Sheldon and Amy go on a literal and figurative scavenger hunt to figure out what the gift is, which is indeed the perfect gift, at least from Leonard's perspective. Meanwhile, Stuart and Denise have not broached the subject of making out at the wedding, they who are now tip-toeing around each other. Taking a chance, Stuart does ask her out, to which she accepts. In preparing for the date, Stuart goes a little overboard. And Stuart and Denise's date makes Raj come to a conclusion about his life, to which he takes what he believes is the appropriate action.
