When Sheldon tries to be spontaneous, it leads to unexpected friction between the girls. Meanwhile, Raj seeks Howard's help in preparing for a date with Emily.
Howard and Raj have a boys' night in together as Raj wants to watch a horror movie - such movies which he doesn't like or understand why anyone would like - as Emily wants to watch it with him. He wants to take a test run so that he can both understand what Emily sees in them, and not be embarrassed by whatever shocks may occur during his viewing with Emily. Meanwhile, to get Sheldon's mind off of what he will now do with his professional life since giving up on the idea of string theory, Leonard suggests they re-institute "Anything Can Happen" Thursdays, and have a spontaneous evening out. With Howard and Raj already preoccupied, Bernadette needing to work late, and Amy under the weather, this first Thursday out will only be comprised of Leonard, Sheldon and Penny. What happens on this first night out may threaten Penny's friendship with Bernadette and Amy, and her relationship with Leonard, while strengthening her bond with Sheldon.
