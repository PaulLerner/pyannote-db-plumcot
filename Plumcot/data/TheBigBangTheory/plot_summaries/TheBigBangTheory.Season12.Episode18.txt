Rivals Pemberton and Campbell charm America on a publicity tour so Sheldon and Amy try to win over Nobel laureates Kip Thorne, George Smoot and Frances Arnold. Halley's fear of the dark causes opportunity and conflict at the Wolowitz home.
In the battle for the hearts of Nobel for the work on Super Asymmetry, Drs. Campbell and Pemberton, on a general media tour and posting some self-promoting Youtube videos, seem at least to be winning the war with the general public in their affable, easy-going and non-scientific (not knowing any of the science) nature. To combat Campbell and Pemberton's approach, President Siebert believes they have to approach the problem on the scientific level, getting as many Nobel science laureates on Sheldon and Amy's side as possible. The problem with President Siebert's list of Nobel laureates is that it solely contains the names of people that Sheldon has pissed off in one way or another, primarily in his condescending comments about their work. Sheldon and Amy, or their representatives, have to figure out a way to rebuild the bridges Sheldon has burned with the Nobel laureates. Meanwhile, Halley is at a stage of life where she's afraid of everything. Overhearing a story Howard tells Halley to comfort her, Bernadette, ultimately with Stuart's artistic help, ends up turning that story into a children's book. Although it was meant solely as a gift for Howard, Bernadette and Stuart receive some interest to publish it, which may not sit well with Howard who may be all right with telling the story in private, but may not like being portrayed to the world as "the scared, little astronaut".
