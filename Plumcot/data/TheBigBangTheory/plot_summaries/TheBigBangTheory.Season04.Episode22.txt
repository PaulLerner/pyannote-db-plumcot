Sheldon invents a three-player chess game, Penny and Amy use Bernadette to spy on Leonard and Priya, and Raj tries a new drug to treat his social anxiety.
Priya and Leonard ask Howard and Bernadette to join them for a couples only dinner at the Koothrappalis' apartment. Amy sees the invitation as Priya's way of conquering and dividing Bernadette especially from Penny. But Amy also sees it as an opportunity for Bernadette to be a mole to feed false information about how great Penny's life is to Priya and Leonard, while gathering intel about Priya and Leonard to feed back to Penny. Bernadette, who doesn't like to lie and doesn't do it very well, doesn't like the idea, but she agrees, with Amy to coach her via text messaging throughout the evening. Will Bernadette be able to hold up the ruse for the entire evening? Meanwhile, Raj is thinking about testing a new drug to help with his social anxiety disorder. And Sheldon develops a new game: three-man chess.
