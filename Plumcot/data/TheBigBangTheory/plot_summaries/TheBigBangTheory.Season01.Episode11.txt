When Sheldon gets sick, Leonard, Howard and Raj go AWOL, leaving a reluctant Penny to deal with him.
Germaphobe Sheldon is more hyper-vigilant than ever after Penny comes back from Nebraska where she was visiting with family who were sick with an unknown bug. Regardless, Sheldon does come down with a bug. Leonard enacts "Code Milky Green", a protocol between himself, Howard and Raj to avoid Sheldon at all cost because of his illness. They decide to attend a Planet of the Apes (1968) marathon at a local cinema. So Sheldon turns to the only person left, Penny, who is unaware of Code Milky Green. But when Leonard's glasses break at the cinema with his only spare pair at the apartment, he has to decide if it is worth the risk to go back to the apartment or watch a bunch of totally fuzzy looking apes for 10 hours.
