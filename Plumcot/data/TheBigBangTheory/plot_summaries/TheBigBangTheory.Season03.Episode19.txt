Sheldon takes on Wil Wheaton in a game of bowling. Leonard and Penny's relationship comes to a crossroad.
The guys and Penny have a friendly but wagered bowling match against Stuart and his team. The match gets a little heated when one of Stuart's regulars can't make it, the missing spot filled by Wil Wheaton, Sheldon's arch enemy. But Wil's presence isn't the only distraction for Sheldon's team. Leonard told Penny that he loves her, but Penny isn't yet at that point to say it back to him. Leonard tells her that he is OK with her not yet being able to tell him the same. His actions, however, make her feel even more pressured to tell him that she loves him. After a chat with Wil at the bowling match, Penny decides what she should do with regard to her and Leonard's relationship.
