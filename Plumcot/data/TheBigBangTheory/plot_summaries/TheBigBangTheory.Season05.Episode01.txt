The gang deal with the fallout from Penny and Raj's night together.
In the aftermath of Raj and Penny's night together from which Raj believes he's in love with her, everyone seems to be mad at Raj. Although he has no intention of getting back together with Penny despite Priya having moved back to India, Leonard is mad at Raj for sleeping with his old girlfriend. Leonard turns to an unlikely source for advice about his feelings. Howard is mad at Raj for taking his supposed place as second in line (after Leonard) in Penny's loins. Howard is also mad at Raj when it comes to light that Raj fantasized about Bernadette. And Bernadette is mad a Raj for making Howard think that there was something going on between them. While Penny takes refuge away from the guys at Amy's, she contemplates her future, which includes thoughts of moving back to Nebraska since her acting career is no career at all. Ultimately, Penny and Raj need to discuss what happened, which Penny finds out is not quite what she thought. Through it all, Sheldon can only think about his leadership in the upcoming paint-ball battle against the geology department. Sheldon's actions may unwittingly bring the friends back together.
