Sheldon, Howard and Raj post an ad online to find a new girlfriend for Sheldon. Penny and Bernadette decide to spy when Amy is secretive about who she is dating.
Catching Amy kissing another man, Sheldon realizes that Amy has indeed moved on from him. As such, he decides to move on from her. As they were the ones who "found" Amy, Sheldon asks Howard and Raj to find his next girlfriend. After discussing the best approach to the task based on Sheldon's high standards, Howard thinks he has the perfect way to find that replacement to Amy. If all goes according to Howard and Raj's eventual plan, that perfect woman for Sheldon should arrive on his doorstep by the end of the evening. The questions become if any women will show up and if they do if any of them will be who Sheldon was expecting. Meanwhile, Amy is going out on a third date with Dave, the man she has been seeing. She has been short on information about Dave to Penny and Bernadette, so they decide to spy on Amy and Dave's date, knowing the restaurant where they will be dining. What they and their unexpected third see through the restaurant window may not tell the entire story of what is going-on on Amy and Dave's date.
