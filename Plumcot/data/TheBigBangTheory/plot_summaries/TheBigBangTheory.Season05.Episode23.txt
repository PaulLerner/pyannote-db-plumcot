NASA cancel, and later reinstate Howard's mission into space, coinciding with his wedding. Leonard inadvertently jeopardizes his relationship with Penny.
With only a few weeks until the launch, Howard's space mission is scrapped due to technical difficulties. Rather than be disappointed, Howard is relieved, since he had always been scared of dying in space, something that he doesn't mention to anyone. However, NASA decides they do want him to go after all, instead sending him on an earlier mission... one that is scheduled to launch two days before his and Bernadette's wedding. He is hoping that Bernadette or Bernadette's tough as nails father will demand that he not go. Meanwhile, Penny decides that she wants to speed things up with Leonard, which Leonard is more than happy to do. But Leonard accidentally speeds things up just a little too much. And Amy does some speeding up of her own regarding her and Sheldon's relationship, regardless of if Sheldon likes it or not.
