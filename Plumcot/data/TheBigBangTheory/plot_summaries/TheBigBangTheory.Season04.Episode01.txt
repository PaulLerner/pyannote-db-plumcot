Penny ends up tagging along on Sheldon's first ever date with Amy, while Howard finds an unusual use for a robotic arm.
It's been four months since Sheldon met neuro-biologist Amy Farrah Fowler, who Sheldon believes is his intellectual equal as well as his emotional female equivalent. Although they text each other every day, they never see each other and Sheldon doesn't consider her his girlfriend. That fact does not stop the guys from naming the two of them "Shamy". Regardless of them being boyfriend/girlfriend or not, Sheldon and Amy are thinking about having a baby together - via in vitro fertilization as Sheldon regards coitus as being too "messy" - to bless the world with their progeny. Penny convinces Sheldon that he should get to know the mother of his future child by going on date with Amy, this date which would be his first ever. As Sheldon needs a ride to the date, Penny, his chauffeur, ends up accompanying him on the date, which she quickly comes to regret. Meanwhile, Howard has developed a mechanical arm to be used as a repair tool aboard the international space station. Showing it off to the gang, Howard demonstrates to them what it can do. But he also finds some personal uses for the arm, which gets him into an embarrassing and slightly painful predicament.
