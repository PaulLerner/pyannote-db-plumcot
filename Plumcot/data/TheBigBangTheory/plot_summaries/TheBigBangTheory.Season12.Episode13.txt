Sheldon and Amy are thrilled when their super asymmetry theory is proven by two physicists, until they try to kick Amy off the Nobel nomination. Bernadette gets one of her drugs approved and wants a reluctant Penny to head the sales team.
Sheldon and Amy "did it" in that their theory on super asymmetry has been confirmed by a pair of experimental physicists, Drs. Pemberton and Campbell with Chicago-based Fermilab, through their own work. President Siebert now believes they may be on track for that much sought after Nobel prize. As a sign to strengthen that thought, Drs. Pemberton and Campbell are on their way to Caltech to meet with Sheldon and Amy. Sheldon and Amy may find that this visit by their colleagues has consequences they didn't consider, and places Sheldon in a potential quandary. Meanwhile, the drug that Bernadette has been working on for three years has finally been approved for production and she wants Penny to head the drug's marketing team. Without telling her, Penny doesn't really want the job. While Penny tries to get out of it, Bernadette tries to manipulate the situation, like she has manipulated situation after situation, to her benefit.
