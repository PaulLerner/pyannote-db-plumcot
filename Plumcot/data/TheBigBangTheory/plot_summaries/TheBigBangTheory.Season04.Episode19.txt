The guys go all out to help Sheldon find the person responsible for hacking his online gaming account, while the girls' hatred for Priya increases.
Sheldon is totally distraught - even to the point of calling in the police and trying to call in the FBI - after someone has hacked into his World of Warcraft (2004) account and stolen all his information and his "virtual" possessions. With Howard, Leonard and Raj on the case with Sheldon trolling though the game with made up new characters, Howard is able to determine that the thief is someone by the name of Todd Zarnecki who lives in nearby Carlsbad. Sheldon convinces the guys to drive to Carlsbad to confront the thief. But without a plan upon arrival, will they manage to get Sheldon's things back? Meanwhile, the primary topic of conversation between Penny, Bernadette and Amy is how Penny groomed Leonard to be a "cool" boyfriend for some other woman - Priya - who now refuses to even let her see Leonard. Bernadette and Amy try to convince Penny that she needs to take some sort of action against Priya in return.
