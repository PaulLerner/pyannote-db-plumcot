Raj falls apart after his date sneaks out on him, and Sheldon reluctantly returns the favor after Penny helps him out with his "Fun With Flags" program.
Raj and Lucy have coffee together after they meet at the comic book store and get along until she unexpectedly runs off. Raj gets depressed and won't leave his apartment. Sheldon has Penny as a guest on "Fun with Flag" honoring the flag of her home-state, Nebraska. The gang goes to see Penny in her acting class' performance of "A Streetcar Named Desire." Sheldon is dragged to it and is impressed by Penny's acting skills. Howard takes a note to Raj from Lucy with her phone number on it. They get together and find that both of them have social skill problems and agree to another date.
Raj is heartbroken that his coffee date with Lucy ended when she snuck out into the night through the coffee shop bathroom window, especially as he thought the date was going so well up to that point. Depressed, Raj decides to retreat from life and all worldly pleasures, and in turn hole up in his apartment forever. Leonard, Howard and Bernadette try to get him out of his funk, but truly understanding why Lucy left may be the only way Raj will willingly reenter the real world, at least as he knew it before this incident. Meanwhile, Sheldon's next guest on "Fun with Flags" is Penny, who ends up giving him what he considers constructive advice on how to appear on camera. Sheldon is as grateful as Sheldon can be, but based on advice from Amy, Sheldon has to decide what form that gratitude will take while still remaining within his own sensibilities.
