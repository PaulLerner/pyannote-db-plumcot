Sheldon tries to get into the spirit of Halloween by trying to scare the guys after they prank him. Leonard seeks Penny's advice when an attractive comic book artist takes an interest in him.
Leonard is nonplussed when he is approached by a beautiful woman named Alice while they're both in the comic book store. He figures that her interest in him is purely on that comic book level, especially when he finds out that she is a comic book artist herself. But he soon finds out that her interest in him also extends to the carnal. Leonard doesn't know what to do about the situation. For him, Alice may be that perfect and rare woman - both a nerd and beautiful - but he doesn't want to risk ruining his relationship with Priya, who he sees could one day be his wife and despite their current long distance relationship not being totally satisfying. He turns to the only one of his friends who has any relationship experience, Penny, for advice. He realistically wants her to tell him that he can have his cake and eat it too. Meanwhile, Sheldon is trying to get back at Leonard, Howard and Raj for a Halloween prank they pulled on him which made him both faint and relieve himself of some bodily fluids. But will Sheldon, who has less than conventional sensibilities, be able to pull off such stunts himself?
