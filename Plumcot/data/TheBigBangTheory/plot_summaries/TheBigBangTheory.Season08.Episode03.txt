Howard becomes nervous after NASA asks him to throw out the first pitch at a Los Angeles Angels game. Meanwhile, Leonard and Penny try to prove Sheldon wrong when he says that he and Amy have a 'superior' relationship.
Although not their first choice, NASA asks Howard to throw the first pitch for a Los Angeles Angels game on Space Day. Non-athletic Howard is worried that he will make a fool of himself. Bernadette and Raj help him practice, while Michael Massimino provides him with some sage advice. In the end, Howard will see if he is as good a pitcher as he is a scientist. Meanwhile, Leonard and Penny have agreed to go on a double date with Sheldon and Amy. On that date, Sheldon tries to convince Leonard and Penny that his and Amy's relationship is far superior to theirs, and he has the scientific proof to back up his claim. Based on Sheldon's argument about the method of evaluation, Penny fears he may be right, which in turn places fears in her about being the future Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter.
