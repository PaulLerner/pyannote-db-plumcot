On Thanksgiving, Sheldon and Amy try to spend time together as friends and go to an aquarium, Howard reluctantly agrees to volunteer at the soup kitchen with Bernadette, Raj and Emily, and Penny discovers that Leonard knows more about her than she thought.
Sheldon is looking for someone to take his second ticket to the aquarium's annual Thanksgiving buffet lunch, which he would have normally gone to with Amy. Leonard and Penny already have plans in that that are cooking all day for the group's Thanksgiving dinner. In the process of preparing the meal, Leonard and Penny learn that he knows almost everything about her but that she in return knows little about him, even the basics. Penny trying to become a better wife to match Leonard's care in knowledge about the other takes a turn when Penny learns how he gleaned some of that information. Bernadette and Raj can't go with Sheldon as they and Emily had long ago decided to volunteer for a six hour shift at the soup kitchen that day. Howard also volunteers to go with them just to get out of the lunch with Sheldon, although he kicks and screams all the way. As the three abandon Howard in the kitchen alone while they go work the "front of the house" line, Howard may come to a new appreciation about the meaning of Thanksgiving in how it affects his own life based on a chance encounter. With no one to go to the aquarium with him, Sheldon decides to give both tickets to Amy for her to take whomever she pleases. She proposes that they go together solely as friends. Their outing will show if they can be just friends, and not boyfriend/girlfriend.
