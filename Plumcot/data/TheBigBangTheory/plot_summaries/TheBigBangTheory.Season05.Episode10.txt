When Stuart asks Amy on a date, Sheldon considers having a more serious relationship with her. Meanwhile, the guys become obsessed with a new card game involving Wild West heroes and witches.
When Stuart meets Amy as she accompanies Sheldon to the comic book store, Stuart feels they had a moment. As such, Stuart wants to ask her out on a date. Not knowing what Amy's relationship status with Sheldon is, Stuart asks Leonard to ask Sheldon if it's OK for him to ask her out. Sheldon's ultimate response is that Amy is not his possession, so she is free to do whatever she wants. In reality, Sheldon's indirect allowance for Amy to date Stuart is only in the belief that Amy has no interest in Stuart. Sheldon's wrong as Amy does agree to go out with Stuart. Sheldon has to figure out what his true feelings for Amy are, and if they are in the realm of boyfriend/girlfriend, he has to figure out what to do to get her back.
