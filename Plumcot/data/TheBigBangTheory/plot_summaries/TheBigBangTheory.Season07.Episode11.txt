While Sheldon is at home in Texas, the rest of the gang decorate for Christmas and think about how much he has affected their lives.
Just as he is about to head to the airport, Sheldon decides to tell his friends that he is going to Texas to fill in for his brother-in-law at his sister's at home baby delivery. With Sheldon away, his friends decide to have a Christmas tree decorating party at Sheldon and Leonard's place. The fact of Sheldon not being there and having a discussion about the movie It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the gang hypothesizes about what their collective lives would have been like if they didn't know Sheldon, most specifically if Leonard didn't move in to Sheldon's apartment. Beyond the fact that many of them wouldn't have ended up even knowing each other let alone those that ended up as couples, each person interjects a little of what they like to think would have happened to each person as each story progresses.
