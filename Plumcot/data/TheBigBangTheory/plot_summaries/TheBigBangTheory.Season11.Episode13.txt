Sheldon kicks Amy out of the apartment to work solo, and she and Leonard end up bonding during a series of science experiments; Howard is replaced by Bert in Footprints on the Moon.
In Raj, Amy and Leonard celebrating some professional successes however small, it comes to light that Sheldon is currently working on nothing, which is bothering him. As such, Amy encourages him to focus his attentions on finding a new scientific project to work on. In Sheldon wanting some solitude to focus his attention, Amy takes refuge at Leonard and Penny's. Leonard and Amy bond when they learn that they both were spelling bee champs at school. So they decide to recreate together science projects from their youth. Leonard and Amy's time together leaves Penny to find something else to preoccupy herself in her lack of interest in what Leonard and Amy are doing. Across the hall, the solitude is only magnifying Sheldon's frustration in not having any idea what he wants to do. He may get some inspiration from the most unlikely of sources. Meanwhile, Footprints on the Moon, Howard and Raj's band, has an upcoming gig at a bar mitzvah. Their rehearsing is causing problems at the Wolowitz/Rostenkowski home, both in the noise and Bernadette needing Howard to take care of Halley. This situation leads to Howard suggesting to Raj that he find another band mate to take his place so that he can focus his time on helping Bernadette take care of Halley. While Raj goes on his search for Howard's replacement, Howard manages to find something else to do with his time that has nothing to do with Halley.
