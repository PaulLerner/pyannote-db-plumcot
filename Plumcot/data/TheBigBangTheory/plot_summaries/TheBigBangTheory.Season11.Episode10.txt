Sheldon and Amy try to eliminate stress from wedding planning by applying math to the process. Raj and Howard come to blows when Raj begins to feel like Howard hurts his confidence.
Raj blows yet another job interview, this one at a planetarium. Raj's father believes that Raj's lack of confidence is primarily due to his friendship with Howard, who is always making fun of him, which Howard would probably say is his way of being friends. A comment Howard makes after Dr. Koothrappali's talk with Raj makes Raj believe that his father may be right. So Raj decides what's best for him to move on productively with life is to take a break from Howard. The questions then become if a Howardless life will make any difference in Raj's confidence, and if Howard can do anything to make Raj change his mind. Leonard sees some similarities in the way that Penny treats him. Will that make Penny treat Leonard any differently? Meanwhile, Sheldon and Amy have decided to use the mathematical approach of decision theory to help plan their wedding, the science alone which makes it fun for Sheldon. However, science alone can't overcome some of the differences Sheldon and Amy have in what they envision their wedding to be. They'll have to figure out a way to overcome their impasse.
