Leonard jumps through hoops to help secure the perfect wedding venue for Sheldon and Amy. Also, Bernadette and Wolowitz have a hard time deciding who should stay at home with the kids and who should go back to work.
Amy and Sheldon, more precisely Sheldon has finally decided on a wedding date, which is only two months away. Among the things they have to do now is decide on a venue. Despite the many obstacles, most specifically its exclusivity and the short time frame, they decide on the Athenaeum Club at Cal-Tech, which, from Amy's perspective, is a beautiful locale, while, from Sheldon's perspective, is a place where Albert Einstein frequented as a member and is a place where Albert Einstein frequented as a member and is a place where Albert Einstein frequented as a member. That exclusivity is displayed by Leonard and Sheldon long having been on the wait list to become members. Beyond that exclusivity, Amy and Sheldon waffle on the idea of the Club when they discover certain aspects of it. They do however decide that they would like to hold it there. The problem ends up being that the Club is already booked that day. Under the circumstances, Leonard feels like he should jump through hoops to make this venue happen for Amy and Sheldon. Meanwhile, Howard has decided that either he or Bernadette should be a full time stay at home parent to their two children. In discussing the issue, Howard has a specific choice on which of the two of them it should be, while Bernadette has mixed feelings on her own self as the choice. A day apart in certain routines may show them who, if either, would be the better choice for their situation.
