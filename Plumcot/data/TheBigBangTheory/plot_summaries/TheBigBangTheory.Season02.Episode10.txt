Leonard tries to slow down his relationship with Stephanie when he realizes that they are living together, while Sheldon becomes convinced that he has an untraceable disease.
With Leonard now dating Stephanie, Sheldon's hypochondria kicks into high gear. Instead of ensuring Leonard's relationship with her is maintained, Sheldon now takes advantage of it by asking Stephanie to do a plethora of tests and examinations on him to figure out what ails him. Sheldon doesn't feel the need to ensure the maintenance of the relationship since Stephanie has moved in. Sheldon's assertion of Stephanie's living status is news to Leonard, who doesn't believe she has indeed moved in. They get an objective third opinion: Penny too believes Stephanie has moved in. When Leonard finally comes to the realization that Stephanie has moved in, he asks Penny for advice on how to slow it down without ending the relationship.
Penny meets Stephanie and informs a doubting Leonard that they are living together. He doesn't notice until he realizes that his Bat Signal is missing. Fearing that the relationship is moving too fast, he tries to talk her into putting on the brakes, but every time he tries to talk to her she becomes amorous and has sex with him.
