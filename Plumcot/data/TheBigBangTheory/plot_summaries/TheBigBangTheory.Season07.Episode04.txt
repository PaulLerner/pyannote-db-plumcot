Sheldon gets mad at Amy for ruining one of his favorite movies, Raj and Stuart try to make their online dating profiles more appealing, and Leonard tries to play the sympathy card with Penny.
For her Psychology class, Penny has on the recommended reading list one of Leonard's mother's books. Leonard doesn't want Penny to read it, and all about his troubled childhood. Penny does whatever she can, including having sex, to help Leonard overcome his feelings about her reading the book. Although Leonard's depressed feeling about Penny reading the book and about his childhood are short lived, Leonard decides to continue the ruse to get favors out of Penny. Meanwhile, Amy is indulging Sheldon's latest want, that to watch one of his favorite movies with him, namely Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Although she does not intend to do so, Amy ends up ruining the movie for Sheldon by pointing out that the character of Indiana Jones really is incidental to the movie's outcome, i.e. that the outcome would have happened with or without Indy. Sheldon goes to great lengths to ruin one of Amy's favorite arts/entertainment titles for her, which isn't as easy as he would like. And Raj and Stuart decide to try on-line dating.
