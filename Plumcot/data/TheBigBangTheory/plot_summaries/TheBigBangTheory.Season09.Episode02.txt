Leonard and Penny try to work through their marital issues. Meanwhile, Sheldon films a special episode of "Fun with Flags" after his breakup with Amy, and Bernadette feels guilty about withholding a secret from Penny.
It's been less than twenty-four hours since Leonard and Penny's wedding and they aren't talking to each other as Penny can't handle the thought that Leonard sees the woman he kissed, Mandy Chow, at work every day. Leonard goes through different thoughts about how to deal with the problem in his personal want to get back together with his now wife. Out of all those thoughts, some which come to him through a nightmare, Leonard decides that he has to speak directly to Mandy about what's going on. Despite Mandy's less than enthusiastic discussion with Leonard about the issue, she at least gets Leonard on a track to understanding the why of what happened between him and Penny. Meanwhile, Amy is as angry at Sheldon as she ever was, largely because she seems to see him more now that they have broken up than when they were a couple. Sheldon dealing with "their baby" on his own leads to different perspectives between the two of them of the future of their now non-relationship. And Bernadette and Raj have differing views of how much information they want from Howard.
Leonard tries to ease Penny's mind as she becomes more concerned about his kiss with another girl at sea. Sheldon plans a special episode of "Fun With Flags" shortly after his break up with Amy. Bernadette feels bad about keeping a secret.
