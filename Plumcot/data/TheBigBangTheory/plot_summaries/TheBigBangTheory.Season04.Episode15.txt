To secure needed funding for the university, Sheldon convinces Leonard to get friendly with a wealthy benefactor.
The university's President Siebert orders the guys to attend a fundraising party. Leonard, Howard and Raj are more than happy to go for the free food and drinks and the promise of a few pretty girls in attendance. Sheldon, however, refuses, believing such fundraising practices demeaning. Amy makes Sheldon reconsider by telling him that his future research funding is dependent upon others, such as Leonard and Raj, making a credible argument to the donors on his behalf. At the party, the guys come across wealthy Mrs. Latham, a formidable older woman who they later learn enjoys making smart people feel ill at ease - which she did with Leonard, Howard and Raj - just for the fun of it. Believing he made a terrible impression, Leonard is surprised to learn that Mrs. Latham wants to speak to him further about his research. But that's not all Mrs. Latham wants from Leonard.
A wealthy donor to the university makes Leonard consider how far he's willing to go for the sake of science.
