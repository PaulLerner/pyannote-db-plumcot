Amy doesn't have time to work on super-asymmetry, so Sheldon goes to great lengths to ensure she's available to work with him even it if means accidentally sabotaging her career in the process. Also, Koothrappali doesn't want Wolowitz to join him in hosting a show at the planetarium.
Both Sheldon and Amy like working together on their super asymmetry project, but Sheldon feels that ever since they've returned from their honeymoon, Amy has been sidetracked on her own neurobiology work to devote any substantial time to their joint project. Sheldon, doing what he believes is good for the project and for Amy, embarks to right what he sees as the wrong without telling Amy what he's up to. When Amy discovers what he's done, she may have a different view of it than her husband and scientific partner. Meanwhile, when Raj's friends attend the latest of his talks at the planetarium, Raj's boss learns that Raj's friend Howard is an astronaut. As such, she suggests that Howard be a co-presenter at one of Raj's upcoming talks, an idea Raj quickly shuts down. While Raj feels insecure in Howard possibly stealing the limelight in his arena, Howard feels upset that his best friend would not want to work side-by-side with him for something about which Howard himself is proud. Raj and Howard will have to find some way to overcome this issue to maintain their friendship.
