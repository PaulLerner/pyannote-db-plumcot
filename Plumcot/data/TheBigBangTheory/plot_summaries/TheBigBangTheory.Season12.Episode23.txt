Sheldon and Amy await big news.
Sheldon and Amy nervously await the announcement of the Nobel Prize recipients for this year, with Leonard and Penny by their side for moral support. When the Physics prize recipient is announced, Sheldon and Amy react to the news in unexpected ways, but for different reasons. While Amy is able to overcome her negative feelings with a little help from Raj, Sheldon may be a little more difficult a case in consoling. Meanwhile, Leonard, Howard and Bernadette try to take advantage of Sheldon and Amy's new situation, each in a slightly different way. And something different is going on with the apartment building which may further push Sheldon over the edge.
