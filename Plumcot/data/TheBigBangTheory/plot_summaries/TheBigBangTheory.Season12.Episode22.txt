Leonard is pleasantly surprised when Beverly comes to visit and she's genuinely kind to him, until he finds out the real reason she's there. Also, Denise and Stuart overstay their welcome at the Wolowitz house.
For Beverly's visit, she has accepted Leonard and Penny's invitation to stay at the apartment with them rather than her usual routine of staying at a hotel, that offer which Leonard may regret in the continuing strain he has with his mother. To Leonard's surprise, Beverly, upon her arrival, seems truly interested in and eager to spend time with him, the criticizing "but" which doesn't seem to materialize. Does Beverly have an ulterior motive in her behavior or has she truly come to see Leonard in a more loving light? Meanwhile, Howard and Bernadette are uncomfortable with how much time Denise has been spending at the house, even when Stuart isn't there. As such, Stuart and Denise try spending a night in at her apartment, even if her "creepy" roommate Mitch is there. And Anu, at a concierge conference in London, telephones with the news that she has been offered a managerial job in London, that job which she is seriously considering. Raj and Anu have to decide what accepting the job means for their relationship.
