Sheldon's trip comes to an end when he is robbed, Penny interviews for a job at Bernadette's company, and Howard is weirded out by his mother's relationship with Stuart.
Forty-five days after leaving Pasadena to regroup after a series of unwanted changes in his life, Sheldon telephones Leonard to come pick him up in Kingman, Arizona, where he is currently stranded as all his possession were stolen. Leonard decides to ask Amy to come along on the twelve hour round trip drive. Beyond explaining what he did on his time away and if it achieved its goal of redefining his life, Sheldon has some more precise explaining to Amy about one specific more immediate matter. Penny didn't go along on the trip as Bernadette got her a job interview as a pharmaceutical salesgirl with her company. Penny is apprehensive and not confident about the interview, doubting her own abilities. The result of the interview doesn't go quite as she expects. And now that Mrs. Wolowitz's cast has come off, Howard expects Stuart to move out of her house, which he doesn't. Howard, who has no idea the nature of his mother and Stuart's relationship, still feels uncomfortable about it and decides to confront Stuart about it.
