After a bad breakup, Penny finally agrees to go out on a date with Leonard, however they both develop doubts and turn to Sheldon for advice.
Penny has just broken up with her latest boyfriend Mike who blogged about their sex life. Besides feeling embarrassed about the blog contents, she's angry with herself for what she sees as her poor choice in men, who all seem to fit into the same mold. After a few discussions between the two on her break-up and a few tantrums on Penny's part, Leonard finally asks Penny out on an official date. Penny agrees despite or perhaps because Leonard does not fit into that mold. Afterward, Penny has second thoughts about going on a date with Leonard and speaks to the one person who she feels can place the best perspective on it: Sheldon. Leonard too has second thoughts and speaks to his best friend, Sheldon. Using the analogy of Schr√∂dinger's cat, Sheldon tells both individually that they have to risk opening the box to find out what's inside. Will either do so?
Penny becomes enraged when her latest boyfriend posts details about their sex life on his blog. Attempting to console her, Leonard says the wrong combination of words and accidentally ends up causing her to forgive him. It doesn't work, so Leonard takes the opportunity to finally ask Penny for a date.
