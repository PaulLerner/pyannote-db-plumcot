Sheldon's assistance with Penny's home-based business leads to chaos.
Based on a some products that she made previously and sold to friends at a nominal profit, Penny is contemplating starting a home-based business called Penny Blossoms, in which she would make and sell flower shaped hair barrettes. Penny asks Sheldon for advice on the business aspects so that she can possibly turn this venture into a full time job. Sheldon agrees if only on the stipulation that she must listen to everything he says and not to make any sarcastic remarks. She agrees. But when Leonard, Howard and Raj get wind of what Sheldon and Penny are up to, the four guys collectively can't help but provide more than their two-cents worth of advice about every aspect of the business. The advice turns to total control. Problems arise because they forgot internal communication between departments of the business is key to success.
