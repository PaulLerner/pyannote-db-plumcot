Sheldon believes that Leonard will wreck his relationship with Stephanie, so he decides to take matters into his own hands.
Leonard and Stephanie's budding romance has an unlikely supporter: Sheldon. Being a highly respected physician, Stephanie is the first of Leonard's few girlfriends who meets Sheldon's criteria of someone who he can more than tolerate. To ensure that Leonard doesn't screw it up, Sheldon not only insists on accompanying them on any date, but vows to take control of anything Leonard does to advance the relationship. He feels he needs to based on Leonard's poor track record with women. He even asks Penny, Raj and Howard for advice. Sheldon's actions don't quite have the desired effect.
In an effort to make sure that things go smoothly, Sheldon begins meddling in Leonard's relationship with Stephanie due to Leonard's poor history with women and his understanding of biology during the courting process. All of his efforts nearly drive Leonard insane, but never-the-less endear him to Stephanie.
