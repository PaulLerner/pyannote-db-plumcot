The gang become concerned when Sheldon's former admirer, Ramona Nowitzki, resurfaces while Amy is away at Princeton.
Amy has now started her summer research stint at Princeton. Much to Leonard's chagrin, he has reassumed many of the responsibilities for Sheldon that Amy had taken over when she and Sheldon started seriously dating, such as driving him to specific places. But one of the responsibilities that Leonard can and will not take over may be instead assumed by Dr. Ramona Nowitzki, who Sheldon first met years ago when she was an admiring grad student and who has now reentered his life as she does research at Cal Tech. Sheldon then could not see that Ramona had a romantic interest in him, but now having been in an intimate relationship with Amy, Sheldon may now be more susceptible to romantic female advances. Sheldon and Amy's friends do not know if Ramona is once again after Sheldon, and thus if they should be worried for Amy's sake and do something to intervene or at least inform Amy of Ramona. Things take on new dimensions when Amy does find out about Ramona, and at least one person within this group does learn if Ramona still has a romantic interest in Sheldon.
