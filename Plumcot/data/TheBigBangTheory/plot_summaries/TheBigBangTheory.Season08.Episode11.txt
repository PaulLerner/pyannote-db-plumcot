Amy hosts a traditional Victorian Christmas Eve dinner as Raj's father comes to visit, while the guys try to shoo out a bird they let into the university clean room.
Raj can't host this year's Christmas Eve dinner party because his soon to be divorced father is coming for a visit. So Amy volunteers to host the dinner, she choosing the theme of a traditional Victorian Christmas. Raj and Dr. Koothrappali are nonetheless invited. The day of the party, Leonard and Howard, working on an experiment in the clean room, are detained and require Raj's help when an accident causes the clean room to be not so clean. They have to figure out what to do, the three ultimately deciding that the blame falls on one person, who has a sense of déjà vu for the remainder of the evening and as they deal with the issue. Bernadette is driving Sheldon to Amy's. Irked that Amy would agree to host a dinner that he wants no part of, Sheldon tries to figure out a way to get back at Amy. That leaves Amy, Penny and Dr. Koothrappali alone at the party, which is dominated by Dr. Koothrappali's less than positive current view of marriage, and Amy's focus on making everything as traditionally Victorian as possible.
It's Christmas and Raj who usually hosts it says he can't because his father who just separated from his wife is coming. So Amy offers to host it and wants the theme to be Victorian and Sheldon wants no part of it. Leonard and Howard are working in the clean room and were about to leave when a bird flies in and they both accuse the other of not closing the door. And Howard not wanting anyone to know what happened wants to handle it themselves. They call Raj who leaves his father with Penny and Amy, and he can't help but go on about how mean his wife is. Sheldon who is going to the party, is going with Bernadette is still upset decides to go buy Amy a present.
