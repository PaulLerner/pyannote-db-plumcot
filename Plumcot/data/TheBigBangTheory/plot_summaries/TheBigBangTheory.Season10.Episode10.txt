Dividing up their possessions becomes an all-out war between Leonard and Sheldon. Stuart asks to live with Howard and Bernadette and tries to supplant Raj's efforts to help with the new baby.
Amy tells Sheldon they need to remove some of Penny's things and bring some of his from the old apartment. Sheldon goes there and takes practically everything with no regard for Leonard. He tells Leonard to pick something he wants and what he picks is something Sheldon holds dear. So in retaliation he does things like change the wifi password and rent out his room to a homeless guy. Stuart tells Howard and Bernadette that he was evicted and would like to stay with them. Bernadette reluctantly lets him. Raj is upset that Stuart is doing the things he normally does.
Amy's suggestion to Sheldon that they redecorate their apartment - what was Penny's old apartment with all her possessions still there - leads to Sheldon wanting to move everything that was in his old apartment - where Penny and Leonard live - into his new apartment. Before he can do so, he and Leonard have to divvy up all those possessions. What starts out as a negotiation on each individual item between Sheldon and Leonard ends up being Sheldon wanting to keep everything, an attitude Leonard sees as Sheldon being selfish. An action by Leonard in obvious retaliation results in a battle of oneupmanship between the former roommates. Meanwhile, Howard and Bernadette decide to abide Stuart's request to move in - if only on a temporary trial basis - as Stuart has been evicted from his apartment. Howard and Bernadette's agreement is based on how well Stuart treated Debbie when they lived together, with the belief that Stuart may be able to provide some support when the baby arrives. Stuart moving in does not sit well with Raj as Raj and Stuart battle for the place as Howard and Bernadette's alpha third wheel, which Raj sees as more important now with the imminent arrival of the baby.
