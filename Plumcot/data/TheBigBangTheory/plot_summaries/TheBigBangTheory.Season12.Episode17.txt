Bernadette and Penny travel to San Diego for a pharmaceutical sales convention. Back home, Amy and the guys experiment on the Wolowitz children when Sheldon finds a book on it.
Bernadette and Penny are attending a pharmaceutical conference in San Diego to promote the new drug. Penny is taking the job seriously in wanting to put the company and the drug in a good light. Penny may do too good a job as Danny, the rep for a competing drug company and a person that Bernadette seems to detest, woos Penny to join their company. Penny even talking to Danny may place both her and Bernadette's professional and personal relationships on the line. Bernadette being gone leaves Howard to look after the two kids on his own. Wanting some company, he invites all his friends over for a day of board games. While Leonard and Raj readily accept, Sheldon and Amy, who weren't going to attend because of Sheldon's want not to hang out with the kids, are last minute attendees. The reason for them attending ends up taking over the day, that reason, which may have seemed spontaneous, actually being manipulated by someone for his/hew own ulterior motive, that manipulation which may work just a little too well.
