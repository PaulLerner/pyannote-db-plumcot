Sheldon is flattered when a graduate student takes a shine to him, however her extreme devotion becomes too much to handle.
Leonard and Sheldon make an orientation presentation to the incoming graduate physics class, most of whom have a "deer in the headlights" look when listening to Sheldon's speech. One student in particular, though, looks that way for a different reason. Ramona Nowitzki is enthralled with everything about Sheldon. Sheldon is oblivious to Ramona's romantic intentions, despite her being obvious in her pursuit. He does however enjoy the idolatry she bestows upon him, and the associated slave work she does for him. Leonard, Howard, Raj and Penny are amazed by what is happening between the two - especially Penny, who has never discussed with the guys what Sheldon uses as a sexual surrogate - and watch the interaction whenever they can out of pure curiosity except when it gets to be too embarrassingly gross in their view. But does even Sheldon have a limit on how much idol worship he can take?
