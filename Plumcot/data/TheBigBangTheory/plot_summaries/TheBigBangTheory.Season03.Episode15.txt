When Leonard is offered a trip to Switzerland on Valentine's Day to visit the CERN laboratory, Sheldon uses any and all means to be his guest instead of Penny.
Valentine's Day is approaching. Leonard thinks he's hit some good luck in that he has been asked to attend a conference and view the Hadron super collider in Switzerland during Valentine's. He's allowed to bring a guest with him which he has chosen to be Penny. There, the two can have a romantic first Valentine's Day together. This decision doesn't sit well with Sheldon who has always dreamed of seeing the collider. Sheldon does whatever he can to make Leonard change his mind, including reminding him of their documented roommate agreement. But the harder Sheldon tries to convince Leonard to change his mind, the more Leonard seems to resist. But outside forces may end up deciding for Leonard who will accompany him to Switzerland.
