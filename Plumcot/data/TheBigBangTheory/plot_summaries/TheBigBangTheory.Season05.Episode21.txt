Sheldon uses any and all means to meet his hero, Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Renowned scientist Stephen Hawking is coming to the university for an extended guest lecture series, and an excited Howard has been asked to maintain the equipment on his wheelchair for his entire stay. Since Howard knows that Sheldon is enamored with Hawking considering him the only person on the face of the planet that is his intellectual equal, Howard plans on introducing Sheldon to Hawking, that is until Sheldon, who is yet unaware of Hawking's visit or Howard's connection, makes yet another of his condescending remarks about Howard's intellect or lack thereof. So Howard changes his mind. After Sheldon's pleading, Howard compromises: he will show Hawking Sheldon's just written paper on the boson particle, and if Hawking wants to meet him after that, he will arrange it. But first, Sheldon has to do a few favors for him, which Howard knows he can make as painful and degrading as he wants since this meeting is Sheldon's dream. Regardless, the paper will prove whether Sheldon really is Hawking's intellectual equal.
