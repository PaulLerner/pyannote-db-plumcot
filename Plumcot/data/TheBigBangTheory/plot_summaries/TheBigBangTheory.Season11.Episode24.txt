When Amy's parents and Sheldon's family arrive, everybody is focused to make sure all wedding arrangements go according to plan - everyone except the bride and groom.
Sheldon and Amy's wedding is just days away, with all their friends handling everything for them so that they can focus on what they need to. Something unexpected happens to Howard which affects the wedding in a way that Howard hopes will please Sheldon, but may irk someone else with a key role in the wedding. Much of what the friends need to do is to attend to the needs of the Coopers and the Fowlers who are all arriving from out of town. Those needs are great, especially by Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Fowler, their wants which may threaten to overtake the festivities. Meanwhile, Sheldon and Amy can only think of something else, all stemming from Amy's comment to Sheldon that in tying his bow tie, it should be asymmetrical and not symmetrical like he is trying to tie it.
