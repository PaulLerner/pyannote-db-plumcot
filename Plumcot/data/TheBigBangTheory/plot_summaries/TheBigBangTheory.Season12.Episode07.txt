Leonard is caught between a rock and a hard place when he's responsible for distributing extra grant money. Also, Bernadette turns the backyard playhouse into a hideaway from her husband and kids.
President Siebert has asked Leonard to be in charge of dispersing what little of the administrative funds there are left for the year, Siebert not caring what is done with those funds. While Siebert could not care less, he foisting the job on Leonard solely to get it off his own plate, Leonard takes the job very seriously. Being a scientist, he wants to make the decision as empirical as he can. The decision becomes even harder when he has a shortlist of three, those three individuals, which includes some friends among the ranks, who place more and more pressure on him to come up with a decision that will make at least two hate him, which he could not tolerate in always needing validation in his life. Leonard figures that he has to make the best of a bad situation. Meanwhile, Bernadette is feeling overwhelmed both at work and at home. On the spur of the moment, she decides to tell Howard a little white lie in that she has to work late, while in reality she ends up hiding in the newly built playhouse in their backyard for Halley. This "one hour" little white lie every workday ends up being her sanctuary. But Bernadette may be able to keep her secret from the rest of the world for only so long before unexpected consequences start to emerge.
