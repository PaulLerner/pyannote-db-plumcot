Sheldon demands Leonard make up for a mistake from their past. Penny confronts Raj's ex-girlfriend, Lucy.
Out of circumstance, Leonard admits to Sheldon that he still has in his possession a DVD rental from seven years ago that was under Sheldon's name, and that Leonard was supposed to return. After a good amount of time passed, Leonard figured to keep the DVD since nothing bad had happened. Leonard never told Sheldon about it as he knew Sheldon would "overreact". On the contrary, Sheldon outwardly remains relatively calm, but he figures that Leonard needs figuratively to walk a mile in his shoes to understand how upset he really is about what Leonard did. He makes Leonard do something that he knows will bother him until he returns the DVD, namely wear an ugly wool sweater against his bare skin, the sweater to which Leonard is probably allergic. To prove a point, Leonard agrees to Sheldon's payback. But Sheldon has in his possession some information that he knows will make it a little more difficult for Leonard to endure what Leonard believes will be an easy task. Still, Amy tries to figure out why Sheldon seems so calm about the situation. Meanwhile, at the Cheesecake Factory with Penny and Bernadette, Amy recognizes another one of the customers: Raj's old girlfriend Lucy. Penny wants to stand up for Raj against Lucy, who broke up with Raj via email. Penny's actions have some expected and unexpected consequences.
