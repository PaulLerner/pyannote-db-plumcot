Sheldon reaches his limit when he works on projects with Leonard, Howard and Amy in one day. Bernadette has doubts about leaving Halley when she goes back to work.
Much to Amy, Leonard and Howard's chagrin, Sheldon boasts that he can work on their two separate projects in the same time that the three of them are working on one. That's why Amy, Leonard and Howard are pleasantly surprised by Sheldon's efficiency, perhaps not so much in the time management itself, but how clearly he can see things with the projects having spent some time away working on the other. But Sheldon's double duty has its consequences, one of them being that he loses his notebook with all his classified notes, he having no idea where, as he has no idea where he's been for about twelve hours during that time when he would have lost it. With Raj's help, Sheldon is able to retrace his steps for those twelve hours, what end up being very surprising steps in more ways than one. Meanwhile, Bernadette is scheduled to go back to work soon, and she is feeling depressed about it if only because she feels like she's abandoning Halley. Not wanting to burden Howard, she doesn't tell him. However, Howard can sense that all is not right with Bernadette, he scouring his brain for what he may have done wrong this time.
