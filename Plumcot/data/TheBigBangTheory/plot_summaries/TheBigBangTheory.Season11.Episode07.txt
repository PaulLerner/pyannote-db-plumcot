When Bert asks Sheldon to collaborate on a project with him, Sheldon becomes worried about others finding out because he thinks geology is beneath him. Raj seeks advice after reconnecting with Ruchi.
Bert asks Sheldon to collaborate on a project on dark matter where Bert requires some math expertise. Sheldon neither wants to admit to anyone that he is interested in Bert's offer or that he has accepted that offer. As such, Sheldon has to hide his activities from his friends, meaning working late hours. In the process, Sheldon has mixed emotions as even though he enjoys the work and the project, he still doesn't respect the field of Geology and so feels ashamed of collaborating in such work. He has to reconcile his feelings before it affects his work on the project. Meanwhile, Raj, out at a bar one evening with Howard, runs into Ruchi. Unlike their last awkward encounter, Raj and Ruchi have a good time together, so much so that Ruchi wants to have a casual relationship with him. If he agrees, Raj will have to see if he really can do so as he has never had a casual relationship with a woman in his life, he always having seen in the back of his mind whatever woman he's been with as his soul mate.
