To improve his skills as an instructor, Sheldon asks Penny to give him acting lessons. Meanwhile, Raj begins having impure fantasies about Bernadette.
Raj laments the fact of his single status. An admission by Bernadette totally preoccupies Raj's thoughts in his fragile state. Meanwhile, Sheldon has just conducted a guest lecture to the university's brightest doctoral candidates. He believes the lecture was an overwhelming success, but messages posted on various social networking sites show that Sheldon's perception and reality are polar opposites. A less than happy Sheldon decides to take some advice from Amy. As teaching is a performance art, she suggests that he take acting lessons. Despite or in part because he thinks she an acting failure, Sheldon asks Penny to be his teacher, his thoughts along the lines of the old adage, "those who can't do, teach". As Penny and Sheldon go through their antagonistic teacher/student relationship, Penny manages to get through to Sheldon in a way she couldn't have even imagined.
