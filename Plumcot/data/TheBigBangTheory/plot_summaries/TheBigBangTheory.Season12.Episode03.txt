The Wolowitzes' life gets complicated when Stuart starts bringing his new girlfriend home. Also, Penny and Leonard talk about starting a family while Koothrappali explores an arranged marriage.
After completing a survey to find out all they need to know about each other, Raj is going on a date with Anu, the woman his father set him up with.

Even before taking some of the survey themselves, Leonard and Penny already know that they are not the most compatible couple. But their answers to one specific question may place an impassable wedge between the two of them. While Penny and Raj turn to Bernadette and Howard with their problems, Bernadette and Howard can't understand why their friends wouldn't just take their sage advice. And now that Stuart and Denise are dating, Howard ad Bernadette aren't sure if they can handle the fact of Stuart having sex in their house.
