Penny gets upset when she finds out Leonard and the guys plan to work at the North Pole for the summer.
Based on work that he has done, Sheldon has been chosen to go on a summer long expedition to the magnetic North Pole. Sheldon is in a conundrum. On the one hand, his work there could lead to a finding that would validate his primary project on string theory. On the other hand, the work is outside in a harsh environment. He tentatively agrees on the condition that Leonard, Howard and Raj accompany him as his support team. After discussing the extreme pros and the extreme cons, the three agree. The guys decide to use the restaurant's walk-in freezer to acclimatize themselves. This simulation is how Penny finds out about the trip. She seems a bit irked. Leonard also seems a bit irked that Penny doesn't seem more disappointed that he'll be gone for three months. After receiving a going away present from Penny, Leonard has second thoughts about going. He'll only know what to do after having a heart-to-heart with Penny.
