Sheldon can't contain his jealousy when Bert wins a grant for his geology research. A distasteful toy built by Howard faces judgement from the gang.
Bert in the Geology Department has just won a prestigious MacArthur grant, and with it $500,000 which need not be used for his research. Everyone around him is happy for him, everyone that is except for Sheldon, who can't feel anything but jealousy. Subsequent events around the grant award just makes Sheldon more and more jealous. One by one, his friends try to get him out of his funk about this issue. But it may be Bert himself who has the answer to Sheldon's problem. Meanwhile, Howard has found a remote control miniature toy he once made of Stephen Hawking. While Howard thinks the toy is hilarious, Bernadette believes it is in poor taste. Because of Bernadette's belief, Howard tries to get validation as to his thought about the issue. He may need it if he has any hope of taking Bernadette up on her dare: to show the toy to Hawking himself.
