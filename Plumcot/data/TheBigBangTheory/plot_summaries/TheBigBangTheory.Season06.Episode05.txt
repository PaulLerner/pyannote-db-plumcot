While Raj plans Stuart's Halloween party at the comic book store, Howard annoys the rest of the gang by constantly talking about space, and Penny tries to take more of an interest in Leonard's work.
Stuart decides to organize a Halloween party at his comic book store so Raj decides to become the party planner. At the encouragement of Amy and Bernadette, Penny decides to take more effort to understand what Leonard does for a living, but ends up hooking up with him at his workplace. Meanwhile, Howard, who just got back from space cannot stop talking about his time in space by making multiple references about space, which annoys Bernadette. Sheldon and Amy face a conflict when they cannot agree on the costumes to wear to the Halloween party.
Stuart is holding his ninth annual Halloween party - this year organized by Raj - which he has used as a venue to try and pick up girls. The party will act as the latest testing ground for the status of both Leonard and Penny, and Sheldon and Amy's relationships. Amy and Bernadette feel Penny doesn't give enough in the give and take of a relationship, and so she decides to give in to going to the party which she really doesn't want to attend. But what may be the more difficult give for Penny is trying to understand what Leonard does for a living without him realizing that she has no clue whatsoever what he does. Penny may find that giving has its benefits. Amy is still looking for signs of Sheldon being a real boyfriend, which means matching costumes for the party. What the theme of their costumes will be may be a point of contention. Meanwhile, Howard turns every conversation into discussion about his time in space, which is annoying his friends, including Bernadette.
