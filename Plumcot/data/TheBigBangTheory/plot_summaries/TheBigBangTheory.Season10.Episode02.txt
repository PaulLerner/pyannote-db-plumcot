Howard is visited by an Air Force colonel regarding his invention. Penny accidentally lets it slip about Bernadette's pregnancy to their co-workers.
Howard passes along the fact that Colonel Williams wants to meet to discuss the guidance system to Leonard and Sheldon, the three and Raj who discuss amongst themselves their continued concern about the system being used for military purposes. They do agree at least to meet with him, but believe they have to get some legal advice beforehand. What happens in that meeting may depend largely on the wild card in the equation, namely something named "Sheldon". Meanwhile, Bernadette discovers that her coworkers know that she is pregnant, something that she hasn't yet told anyone at work and something she didn't want her coworkers yet to know, fearing that her superiors will use the information against her in assigning a coveted research project to another scientist. Bernadette wants to get back at whoever blabbed, she who will go to extreme lengths for revenge. Penny has to decide if she will confess to the reality of being the source, and in the process possibly face the wrath of Bernadette or worse possibly lose her as a friend forever.
