When the university forces Sheldon to use vacation days, he decides to hang out in Amy's lab. Howard becomes upset when he hears Bernadette wants him to sign a prenuptial agreement.
Much to Sheldon's chagrin, President Siebert orders him to take his mandatory vacation time immediately. Sheldon does whatever he can to pretend to take his vacation but still go to work. Since that doesn't work, he decides to do what he considers the next best thing: invade someone else's laboratory, namely Amy's. Amy welcomes him, but will Sheldon, who believes he's superior to everyone else regardless of the field of endeavor, be able to take a subservient role in his girlfriend's laboratory work? Meanwhile, Bernadette is worried that Howard won't take the news well that her father wants him to sign a prenuptial agreement since she makes more money than he does.
