Leonard, Howard and Raj decide that they will get tickets from a scalper, which Sheldon refuses to do as if they are caught, they will be banned from Comic-Con for life. Leonard, Howard and Raj have to decide if this little seed of information is enough to scare them off from doing what bad boys would do and proceed to buy the tickets through a scalper. Sheldon's plan is instead to start his own comic book convention. He goes on a search for at least one science fiction celebrity who would appear as a headliner at his convention, barring those who have restraining orders against him already. Sheldon's celebrity stalking doesn't turn out quite the way he expected. Meanwhile, Penny, Amy and Bernadette go on a quest to do something that makes them feel grown-up that they would like and not just something that makes them feel like they're pretending to be grown up.
