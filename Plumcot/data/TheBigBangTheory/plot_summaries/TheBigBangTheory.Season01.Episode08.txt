Raj's parents back in New Delhi have set him up with a childhood acquaintance of his named Lalita Gupta, who has just moved to California. Their plan is for the two to get married. Raj does not want to meet with Lalita let alone get married to her if only because he still has difficulties even speaking to women. Howard decides to take matters into his own hands to get Raj to at least meet with her. Meanwhile, Penny, wanting to practice her bartending skills, uses the guys as guinea pigs, which opens up a whole new world for Raj, especially at this critical time in his mating life. But even if Raj can speak to Lalita, the words that come out of his mouth will be equally as important. Lalita does end up having a connection while on their date, but...
In spite of the fact that he can't speak to women, Raj's parent set up a date with a woman that they have arranged for him to marry. In a conundrum about his mutism, he discovers that he has no anxiety when he's under the influence. When he meets the girl, the beautiful Lalita Gupta, he insults her because he's drunk. Yet, Sheldon charms her when he compares her to a beautiful princess in a storybook that he read as a child.
