Amy's desire to have an intimate night with Sheldon on her birthday is interrupted by Bernadette going into labor.
It's around midnight. Bernadette has gone into labor, with Howard, Raj and Stuart rushing her to the hospital. News of the labor makes its way back to their friends. It's the start of Amy's birthday, the news of the labor which interrupts Sheldon's annual gift of birthday coitus. Beyond Amy looking forward to this annual event, other items beyond the labor may make it more difficult for both Sheldon and Amy to get back into the mood. A baby coming into the world and the fact of Amy's birthday gift lead to Leonard and Penny thinking they too should have sex, which is dependent upon Leonard being able to find some things, including his breath. And in the process of the evening, Raj does something which may place him in Howard and Bernadette's bad books for the evening if not longer. Raj, feeling depressed about putting nine months into being there for Howard and Bernadette and potentially missing the birth, leads to he being shuttled between friends, who may or may not want to help him get out of his funk.
