When Wolowitz dresses up as Sheldon for Halloween, Sheldon seeks retaliation at Leonard and Penny's Halloween party. Also, Leonard is shocked that Penny doesn't remember their first kiss.
Halloween is upcoming, and in addition to the guys planning on wearing costumes to work on the actual day, Leonard and Penny decide to host a costume party the following night. Sheldon thinks nothing of Howard's costume, that is until he learns that Howard is dressed up like him. As such, Sheldon gets a view of how others think of him, as an object of ridicule. Because of Sheldon's reaction, Howard decides on a different costume for the party the following night, while Amy is angry at Bernadette for encouraging Howard to make fun of Sheldon. This situation leads to Amy and Sheldon deciding to get back at Howard and Bernadette. The question then becomes how Howard and Bernadette will react to Sheldon and Amy's comeback. Meanwhile, the fact of hosting a Halloween party leads to Leonard and Penny discussing what was their first kiss, it being at the only Halloween party hosted by Penny that she ever invited the guys to when she lived across the hall. Leonard and Penny have quite different perspective of that evening and thus the kiss.
