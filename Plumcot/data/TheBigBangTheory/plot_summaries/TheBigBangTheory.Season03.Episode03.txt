Sheldon attempts to covertly alter Penny's habits, while Howard and Raj try their luck meeting women at a Goth-style club.
Now that Leonard and Penny are dating, which means that Penny will be at the guys' apartment more often, Sheldon and Penny have to come to an understanding on how to get along better. Sheldon's approach is to use positive reinforcement, which he plans on using to "train" Penny. Meanwhile, Howard is sporting a new look in preparation for his and Raj's first night out to a goth bar. Miraculously, at the bar, Howard and Raj are picked up by two women named Bethany and Sarah (not that anyone cares about Sarah). The girls take the guys on an outing that may out the guys as being non-goth.
