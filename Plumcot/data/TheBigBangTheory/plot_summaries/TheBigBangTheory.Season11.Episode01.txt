Amy has trouble deciding whether or not she should marry Sheldon. Meanwhile, Bernadette confides in Penny when she finds out some huge news.
Following Ramona kissing him, Sheldon has flown to New Jersey to ask Amy to marry him in the realization that he wants Amy to be the only woman ever to kiss him. Before doing so, he believes he has asked the advice and permission from the appropriate person. What happens with the proposal may depend on how Sheldon acts around Amy's Princeton colleagues, who only know of her brilliance and not his idiosyncrasies. Meanwhile, Bernadette and Howard learn of another upcoming change to their personal situation. In trying to deal with the surprising turn of events, Bernadette and Howard look to Leonard and Penny not so much for advice but rather to ask them for a favor in dealing with the news a bit easier. And in light of Sheldon's marriage proposal, the two singletons, Raj and Stuart, continue to commiserate with each other. Their want to do so may change with a turn of fortunes.
