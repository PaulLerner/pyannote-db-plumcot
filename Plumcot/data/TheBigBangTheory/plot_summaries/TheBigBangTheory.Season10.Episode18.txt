When the gang offer places for Raj to live, it creates unexpected conflict among everyone.
Raj has posted on social media that he can no longer afford his apartment and is looking for a cheaper place to live. Independent of each other, both Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny want but don't really want to help their friend by offering him a temporary place to stay - the Wolowitz's garage and Sheldon's old bedroom respectively. After all three parties learn about all that is on the table as options for Raj, the collective decide that the best temporary solution would be for Raj to move into Sheldon's old bedroom. Although most knew Sheldon would feel uncomfortable with the situation - like Raj is invading his space - it is some other comments that Sheldon makes about the issue that places a strain between himself and Raj. Knowing that what he is feeling is irrational, Sheldon turns to Beverly for her professional opinion on why he is feeling the way he is. Beverly entering the fray has unintended consequences for all involved. Meanwhile, Sheldon is thinking about getting another roommate of another kind, Amy who makes her feelings about the issue well known.
