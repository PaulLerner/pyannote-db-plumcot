The gang get competitive when they are forced to take part in Raj's scavenger hunt.
The gang, after rebuking Raj's attempt of a social gathering in the form of a murder mystery dinner party, are surprised that they actually like Raj's latest idea: an intellectual scavenger hunt based on those held at post-secondary institutions. Even Penny likes the idea, but no one, including Leonard, seems to like the idea of being partnered with her, who they see as the liability among the group. Randomly drawing names, Sheldon and Penny are partnered, Leonard and Bernadette are partnered, and Howard and Amy are partnered. In their "hunt", Sheldon and Penny continue their intellectual versus gut instinct approaches to deciphering the clues. Leonard remains focused on how he will make it up to Penny for not wanting to be her partner, while Bernadette shows her killer instinct in game playing. And Howard and Amy, who have not spent much time alone together, try to find if there is anything to their friendship beyond their indirect association through the others in the group. Meanwhile, Raj, the scavenger hunt developer, may have the last laugh in the game.
