Raj worries a probe he designed will not work in outer space, while Leonard and Sheldon go shopping with Penny and Amy.
Raj was part of a team which launched the New Horizon Space Probe nine years ago to collect data about Pluto, the probe which is now within distance to provide its first data... that is if it is still operational. While waiting to hear any news about the probe with Howard and Bernadette, Raj can't help but feel totally stressed. He makes a surprising decision on how to calm down. Meanwhile, Penny and Amy, who feel that they always have to do what Leonard and Sheldon want to do, are given the privilege of deciding what the four will do for the day. As Penny wants to do something that she knows Leonard and Sheldon will hate, Sheldon comes up with the answer to appease Penny: dress shopping. While Penny and Amy are in the change rooms, and Leonard and Sheldon wait outside, each pair talks about their respective friendships, most specifically the issue of compromise.
