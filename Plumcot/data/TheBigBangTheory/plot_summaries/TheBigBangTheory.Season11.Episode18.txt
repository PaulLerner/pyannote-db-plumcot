Leonard, Howard and Raj try to meet Bill Gates, who's meeting with Penny to merge their companies; Sheldon thinks he's the victim of an April Fool's prank.
Penny informs her friends that she has been asked by her company to be Bill Gates' guide when he comes for a visit. Despite especially Leonard, but also Howard and Raj's pleas to meet him, Penny tells them that it is solely a work function and that she doesn't have the authority to invite anyone along. Using some information inadvertently passed along by Penny, Leonard thinks he's found a way possibly to meet Gates. Going behind Penny's back may backfire on Leonard. Sheldon isn't involved in the begging to meet Gates as he initially believes that being April 1st that it is Penny playing an April's Fools prank solely on him. As the thought that Penny isn't pranking him slowly seeps into Sheldon's brain, he becomes easy prey truly to get pranked. Meanwhile, Stuart is taking the kids for the day leaving Bernadette free to go out for lunch with Amy. Bernadette finds that it is not only difficult to put the Mommy side of herself away, but that her brain has turned to Mommy mush. Amy helps her try to make that adult side of her brain function again. And Stuart is trying to learn Spanish so that he can hit on all the other nannies in the park.
