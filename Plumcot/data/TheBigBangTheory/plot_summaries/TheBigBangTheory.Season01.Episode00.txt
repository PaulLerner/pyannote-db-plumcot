The first Pilot of what will become "The Big Bang Theory". Leonard and Sheldon are two awkward scientists who share an apartment. They meet a drunk girl called Katie and invite her to stay at their place, because she has nowhere to stay. The two guys have a female friend, also a scientist, called Gilda.
Roommates, physics geniuses, academics and socially inept nerds Leonard and Sheldon are in need of some short term cash for dinner money and use their genius status for such purpose. On their way to dinner from their money making venture, they encounter Katie, a beautiful, sexually liberated and streetwise young woman, in some distress. She has just broken up with her boyfriend because of an issue he just disclosed to her, and due to another issue with her mother and her mother's new husband has nowhere to live. Despite Katie being out of their league, Leonard invites her to dinner and to stay at their place, she agreeing only on being up front that neither of them have any chance with her, and that her stay will only be for a predetermined short term time period. Despite these stipulations, Katie's stay does not sit well with Leonard and Sheldon's colleague Gilda, who sees her and Leonard someday getting together regardless of the fact that they have yet to go on a date or to have sex.
