The gang are drawn into a fight between Howard and Sheldon over Sheldon's vacant parking spot at the university.
Howard finally replaces his scooter with a car and is assigned a parking spot at Caltech. Unfortunately it's "Sheldon's spot" even though he doesn't own a car or drive. A war escalates between Howard and Sheldon that also affects the friendship of Amy and Bernadette.
Howard has just bought a new car. As Sheldon doesn't use his assigned parking spot since he doesn't know how to drive or therefore own a car, the university unilaterally decides to reassign Sheldon's parking spot to Howard. Sheldon sees this decision as an affront to his rights, regardless of if he owns a car or not. Sheldon demands his spot back, which Howard or the university won't give back. This feud leads to a contest of oneupmanship between Sheldon and Howard on taking something of the other that they aren't using. The feud ultimately extends to Amy and Bernadette, each who stands by her man. The parking spot uncovers some deeper issues. Ultimately, Penny is the one caught in the middle. Meanwhile, Raj tries to convince Leonard and Sheldon that zombies are the same as mummies.
