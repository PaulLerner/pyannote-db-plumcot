Sheldon goes to Vegas to win money for science. Also, Penny and Bernadette take Amy wedding dress shopping, but her terrible choice entangles them in a web of lies.
Sheldon is generally all right with the notion that his current work on black holes can never be duplicated in an experiment and thus never be definitively proven. When Leonard devises a way for Sheldon to design an environment in which an experiment can be modeled, Sheldon decides to ask the university for the money needed to do so: $500,000,000. After his friends tell him there is no way the university is going to give him half a billion dollars, Sheldon has to decide whether to ask for a smaller amount which would no where come close to being able to achieve what he wants to do, or figure out some other way to get the money he really needs. Meanwhile, Amy is in the process of picking out a wedding dress. When Penny and Bernadette accompany her to the dress shop, Amy finds that every dress she tries on is "the one", with Penny and Bernadette agreeing that all the dresses have been beautiful. But when Amy finds the dress she truly believes is the one, Penny and Bernadette have to decide whether to tell Amy that that dress definitely is NOT the one.
