The gang spend Thanksgiving at Mrs. Wolowitz's house. Howard tries to bond with his father-in-law, and a mistake from Penny's past comes back to haunt her.
Howard invites all his friends over to his mother's house for Thanksgiving. He does have ulterior motives: his father-in-law, Mike Rostenkowski, with ho he has nothing in common, is alone for the holidays, has also been invited and Howard doesn't want to spend time with him without others to buffer him from Mike. Despite Sheldon's want not to go, they all accept Howard's invitation. The dinner does not end up the way anyone would have thought. Mrs. Wolowitz has suffered a gout attack and thus can't prepare dinner, leaving that task primarily to Raj with the assistance of his two sous chefs, Amy and Bernadette. Mike ends up bonding with an unexpected guest, which places Howard in an awkward position. And earlier in the day, Penny learns some surprising news about her life which requires some decisive and immediate action. Beyond the slight strain that this issue places between Penny and Leonard, Penny decides to invite another guest to dinner which ends up being another major focus of the evening.
