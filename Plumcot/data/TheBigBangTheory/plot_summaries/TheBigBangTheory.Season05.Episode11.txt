Leonard confronts the man who bullied him in high school, while Penny realizes she did her fair share of tormenting in the past.
Out of the blue, Leonard receives a message through his Facebook page from Jimmy Speckerman, a high school acquaintance who bullied him all throughout school. Jimmy wants to get together with Leonard for drinks. Leonard, who has always hated Jimmy because of that torment through high school, is at a loss of what to do. Finally he decides to face his demons and agree to meet Jimmy to confront him and make him apologize for all the bad things he did. Sheldon, Howard and Raj go along for support, but will four nerds be able able to stand up to a physically big bully? Or does Jimmy have a truly admirable reason for wanting to meet? In discussing Leonard's issue, Penny and Bernadette come to the conclusion that Penny was a bully in high school. Although they all agree that Penny is a nice person now, they make Penny come to the realization that she has to do something significant to atone for her past mean acts. Has the years since high school made either Jimmy or Penny really come to an understanding of the errors of their bullying ways and/or what atonement really means?
