Leonard has an idea for a new smartphone app and asks the guys for help, however Sheldon tries to take over the project, and Leonard fires him.
Leonard comes up with an idea to develop a smart phone app that would use handwriting recognition software to help in solving their differential equations problems. Although the app's use would be limited to about a hundred people worldwide, he wants to go ahead, and asks Sheldon, Howard and Raj to join him in the project. They all agree. Leonard, as the one who came up with the idea, has a relatively clear vision of how he wants to proceed. However, Sheldon believes his way is best and wants to be among things CEO and CFO of the project, and to have it named after him. When Sheldon's controlling ways become too much for Leonard to handle, Leonard fires him from the project team. Sheldon tries whatever he can to make life difficult for the other three to complete the project, and even believes he may have lost Leonard as a friend for good. Penny takes pity on a moping Sheldon, but comes to regret it. She has to figure out a way to foist Sheldon back onto Leonard.
Leonard's idea for a smartphone app derails his friendship with Sheldon.
