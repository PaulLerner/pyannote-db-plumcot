After celebrating the completion of the top-secret Air Force project, Leonard, Sheldon and Howard get an unwelcome surprise; Amy receives an offer for a summer position at Princeton as a visiting researcher.
Leonard, Sheldon and Howard, along with their closest friends and loved ones, are celebrating the near completion of the first phase of the military project, the three researchers excited about getting started on the second phase. Their excitement is brought to an abrupt end when they speak to Colonel Williams both about the year they've put into the first phase and about the details about the second phase. They have to figure out a way to deal with the emotional roller coaster. As such, Amy has troubles telling Sheldon, who she not only hopes loves her but believes relies on her, that she has been offered an important research fellowship for the summer at Princeton. She wants to go, her only hesitation being Sheldon. The question then becomes if Sheldon will be a supportive boyfriend or think only of himself. Meanwhile, Bernadette believes she and Howard have to set ground rules about his usual behavior around her whenever he has just completed a project. And Raj has found an affordable apartment of his own. Leonard and Penny can't help but show their true feelings about Raj moving out.
