Howard and Bernadette have a hard time leaving Halley in daycare when Bernadette returns to work. Bert introduces the gang to his new girlfriend.
Bert announces that he has met who he believes is his soul mate, a woman named Rebecca. The gang invites Bert and Rebecca to dinner at Leonard and Penny's so that they can all get to know this important person in Bert's life. Upon meeting her, they all slowly come to the belief that she is a gold-digger, she only after his money. Beyond what Bert decides to do with the information, the gang discusses what are acceptable and unacceptable reasons for wanting to be with another person as a mate. Meanwhile, it's getting closer to the day that Bernadette will be returning to work, when Halley will be placed in baby day care. Despite Bernadette's apprehension about leaving Halley, one comforting factor is that the day care is at Cal-Tech where Howard has easy access. Only the first day of leaving Halley at day care will show if the collective of Bernadette, Howard and even Stuart are ready to leave her with someone other than the three of them. And Sheldon and Amy host a special edition of "Fun with Flags". They believe that one good turn deserves another.
