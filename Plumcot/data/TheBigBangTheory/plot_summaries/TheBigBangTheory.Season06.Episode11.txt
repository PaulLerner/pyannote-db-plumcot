The girls take Raj out to a nightclub to find him a date. A game of Dungeons and Dragons rekindle old memories of Santa for Sheldon.
Much to Penny, Bernadette and Amy's chagrin, Leonard organizes a boys only Saturday night get together for himself, Sheldon, Howard, Raj and Stuart to play a holiday themed version of Dungeons and Dragons. The game is ultimately affected by a careless move by Raj for his love of Santa, and a calculated move by Sheldon in his disdain for the holidays. In retaliation for Leonard organizing this night, Penny organizes her own Saturday girls night out with her, Bernadette and Amy in their most provocative of clubbing outfits. Their club night out is affected by an unexpected fourth guest, who ends up being their focus for the night, and information about who in relation to the three comes to light.
