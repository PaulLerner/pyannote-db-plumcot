Penny plans revenge when Sheldon bans her from his and Leonard's apartment, while Howard and Raj use the latest technology to try to find the house being used in "America's Next Top Model."
After Penny exposes the guys to it on television, they, excluding Sheldon, have a new passion in life: America's Next Top Model (2003). Specifically, Howard and Raj are trying to determine exactly where the house the models are living in is located, so that the two can go there each week to prey on the insecurities of the latest model kicked off the show. No expense is too small to achieve their goal. Meanwhile, Penny decides to take a stance against Sheldon's "three strikes, you're out" policy, she who has reached Sheldon's third strike when she takes that stance. Despite Leonard's advice to Penny to knuckle under to Sheldon like they all do, Penny decides to play games of oneupmanship with Sheldon to the end.
Penny defies one of Sheldon's rules (the third by his count) that gets her banned from the apartment. This sparks an all-out war between the two culminating with Leonard intervening by providing Penny with "Sheldon's kryptonite." Meanwhile, Howard and Raj discover the the house from "America's Next Top Model" is somewhere in L.A. and determine to find it.
