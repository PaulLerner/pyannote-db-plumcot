The guys camp out all night waiting to see an extended cut of Indiana Jones, while Amy joins in on girls' night with Penny and Bernadette.
Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj and Amy are planning to go a see a special screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) with 21-seconds of previously unseen footage which, from what Leonard hears, solves some major controversies about the 21-second shorter version. Penny - after just having watched the movie for the first time in her life - has no interest in seeing it again with the 21-seconds, so she and Bernadette decide to have a girls night. Since she's a girl, Amy decides to crash the girls' party instead of going with the guys, which places the girls night in a whole different dimension, until they decide to play Truth or Dare. Meanwhile, Sheldon wants to leave to get to the cinema at five o'clock for the midnight screening, instead of having a leisurely dinner beforehand at the Cheesecake Factory. When they arrive at the cinema when Leonard, Howard and Raj want to get there, Sheldon gives them a big "I told you so" when they find the line-up is enormous. Sheldon does whatever he can to see the movie or else. His goal is even more focused when his arch nemesis Wil Wheaton receives special treatment to get into the screening.
