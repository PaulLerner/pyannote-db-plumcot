Sheldon gets upset about his career, the destruction of the comic book store and Leonard and Penny's future living arrangements. Howard and Bernadette struggle to keep hold of a caregiver for Mrs. Wolowitz.
Leonard and Penny's good news that they are engaged and Raj's that he has had sex with Emily are tempered by Howard and Bernadette's problem of not being able to keep any professional help to take care of his mother, and Sheldon's that the university will not let him change his area of research from string theory to inflationary cosmology, as string theory was the reason they hired him and the area for which he has received all his grants. What's worse for Sheldon, who cannot handle change that is not initiated by him, is that Leonard and Penny contemplate a living situation that may not include him, while Amy tries to capitalize on that fact for her own benefit. And a place that Sheldon considers a sanctuary is temporarily out of commission, which may be indirectly a benefit for Howard and Bernadette. With all these changes in his life, Sheldon may have some tough choices to make, all of which, in his mind, are less desirable that what had been his life up to this point.
