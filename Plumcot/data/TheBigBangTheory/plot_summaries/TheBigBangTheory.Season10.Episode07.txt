Amy doesn't tell Sheldon her apartment has been repaired. Leonard finds out Penny is slowly moving all of his collectible toys into storage.
Sheldon and Amy seem to have found a comfortable emotional place in living together, they even hosting their latest webcast of "Fun with Flags" in their current abode of what was Penny's old apartment. However, what Amy has not told Sheldon is that her apartment renovations were completed earlier than expected - finished two weeks ago - meaning that she could long ago have moved home. The only person among her friends she has divulged the information to is Bernadette, who in turn has told Penny and Leonard. This relationship secret, which now sits with four of them, is only the tip of the iceberg in relationship secrets where one or two people within the group know a secret about someone else, with all these secrets potentially coming to light, each with their own consequences, all them having some connection to trust, or lack thereof, within the relationship. Regardless, Sheldon will eventually have to go through the evaluation process of his and Amy's experiment of living together, and what the next steps will be, that evaluation which may not be easy for him as he realizes that in choosing any option, he will be giving up something else, possibly forever.
