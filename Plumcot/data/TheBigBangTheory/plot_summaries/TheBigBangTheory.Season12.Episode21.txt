Kripke has proof that Dr. Pemberton plagiarized his thesis in college, and Sheldon and Amy aren't sure if they should turn him in. Wolowitz learns that Bernadette wasn't the only waitress at the Cheesecake Factory who had a crush on him.
Kripke has proof that Dr. Pemberton plagiarized his thesis in college, and Sheldon and Amy aren't sure if they should turn him in or not. Also, Wolowitz is happily surprised to learn that Bernadette wasn't the only waitress at the Cheesecake Factory who had a crush on him back in the day.
In begrudgingly being cordial to Drs. Campbell and Pemberton for their collective benefit, Amy and Sheldon not only discover that Barry Kripke went to school with Pemberton, who he hates even more than Sheldon, but that he can dig up some conclusive incriminating information that would not only knock Pemberton out of the running for Nobel, but ruin his career in its entirety. Although they want to win the prize, Amy and Sheldon are conflicted about whether to expose Pemberton or if in doing so they are as morally corrupt as Pemberton and Campbell. Three things happen in the process of asking their friends for advice. One of those things is that Bernadette confesses to Howard that there was a dim bulb waitress at the Cheesecake Factory who had a thing for Howard, Bernadette who lied to her about Howard to get the initial in with him, and that waitress who still works there. Howard has to decide if his vanity will overtake his love for Bernadette in whether he will take steps to figure out who that waitress is.
