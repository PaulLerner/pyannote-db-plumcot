Penny tries to help Sheldon when he reconsiders his "relationship" with String Theory. During a dinner with Howard and Bernadette, Raj discovers Howard once embarrassed himself on a date with Emily.
Leonard, Howard and Raj are all excited by what the primordial gravity wave discovery means for the scientific community. Sheldon, on the other hand, is not excited. Leonard figures out the reason for Sheldon's indifference: he's jealous, especially as his own life work in trying to prove string theory is no closer to being accomplished than when he started twenty years ago. After a comment by Kripke, Sheldon begins to wonder if string theory can ever be proved, and thus if he is wasting his time working on it. Sheldon decides to take Penny's advice on the matter, with a little help from Cosmopolitan magazine thrown in. Meanwhile, Raj is now exclusively dating Emily after a comment he makes to Lucy. Howard and Bernadette, and Raj and Emily decide to go on a double date. When Howard sees who Emily is at that double date, he is hoping she will not remember their one and only former disastrous meeting.
