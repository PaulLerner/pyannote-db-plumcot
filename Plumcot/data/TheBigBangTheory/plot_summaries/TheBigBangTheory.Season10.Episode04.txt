When Amy must vacate her apartment for repairs, living arrangements are made with Leonard, Sheldon, and Penny. Howard and Bernadette don't want to know the sex of their baby, but Raj finds out.
A burst water pipe leaves Amy's apartment uninhabitable for five weeks. Penny and Leonard offer Leonard's bedroom as a place to stay for that time, while Penny and Leonard would stay in Penny's apartment, effectively meaning that Amy and Sheldon would be living together. However after speaking to Sheldon about the matter, the collective decide that Penny and Leonard will stay in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, while Sheldon and Amy will move into Penny's apartment, and treat it as a five week science experiment - Penny's apartment being the control away from Sheldon's comforts - to see if he would like to live with Amy after the five weeks is over. The experiment would allow him to evaluate the situation from a scientific perspective, seeing what worked and what didn't. As they will be sharing a bed, Amy and Sheldon decide to take coitus off the table to remove sexual tension as an evaluating factor. But the sex or lack thereof may be just one of many issues which could kibosh the experiment much sooner than the five weeks. However long, Leonard and Penny are determined to make the most of their Sheldon-free time. Meanwhile, Raj has been a constant presence at Bernadette and Howard's visits to the OB/GYN. The latest appointment includes the ultrasound, the sex of the baby which Bernadette and Howard have decided they don't want to know until the birth. However, Raj discovers the baby's sex. After getting over their anger at Raj knowing but they not, Bernadette and Howard reevaluate their decision in not knowing the baby's sex in light of Raj knowing.
