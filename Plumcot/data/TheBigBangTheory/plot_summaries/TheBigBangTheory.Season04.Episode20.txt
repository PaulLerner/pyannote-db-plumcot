Sheldon and Amy secretly experiment on the gang by spreading rumors when they hear that Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
Starting with Penny to Amy, a rumor quickly spreads amongst Leonard, Sheldon, Raj and Priya that Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard. This rumor is especially of interest to Raj since despite being Howard's best friend, he has always been in love with Bernadette himself. Additional news comes to light directly from Howard, who is planning on asking Bernadette to marry him. Based on the rumor, the rest of gang believe that Howard is in for a major let-down, much to Raj's excitement. But will Howard go through with his plan and if he does, will the rumor prove to be true? Meanwhile, Amy and Sheldon, watching the speed with which the rumor has spread, propose another social science experiment of starting two rumors - one of a salacious nature, and one more mundane - to see how quickly both spread amongst the group.
