Sheldon has to choose between joining Amy at her aunt's birthday party or playing videogames all weekend with the guys.
Raj comes up with the idea of going down memory lane by the guys having a weekend long gaming marathon like they used to do, this time playing the new game, Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011). Despite Howard, Leonard and Sheldon being in relationships, they all agree. However, the three respective females in their lives may have some say about what happens on the weekend. Leonard hopes that Penny will care and have something to say about not spending the weekend with him, which means that their relationship is progressing back into true boyfriend/girlfriend status. Howard may not be able to choose between spending the weekend gaming or spending it with Bernadette. But Sheldon, who previously agreed to go to Amy's aunt's 93rd birthday celebration, has quite an easy decision between spending the weekend with the guys or with Amy and her aunt: he chooses the guys. A hurt Amy has to decide what to do in light of Sheldon's obvious disregard for her feelings. But someone other than Amy may be even more hurt by how the weekend progresses.
