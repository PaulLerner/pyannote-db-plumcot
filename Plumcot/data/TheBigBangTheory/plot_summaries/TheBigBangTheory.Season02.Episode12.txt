Howard becomes depressed after Penny makes a cruel statement about his love life, while the rest of the guys prepare for a grudge killer robot duel against an obnoxious colleague at the university.
After Howard makes the latest in a long string of inappropriate comments to Penny in what he considers their courting ritual, Penny in return tells Howard in no uncertain terms that they are not dating nor ever will date. She makes a hurtful comment back to him. Depressed by Penny's comment, Howard retreats, not wanting to see or speak to anyone. This is bad timing for Leonard, Sheldon and Raj, who along with Howard, are entered into a killer robot competition. Being the engineer, Howard is the chief designer and builder of their entry, named MONTE (the mobile omnidirectional neutralization & termination eradicator). The stakes are even higher with a pre-competition "robot to the death" challenge by fellow nerd, Barry Kripke. Leonard pleads with Penny to apologize to Howard to get him out of his funk.
With the Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational coming up, the guys gloat over their entry, The Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization & Termination Eradicator, otherwise known as M.O.N.T.E. However, their chance of victory hits a snag on two fronts. First, Howard falls into a deep depression when Penny hurts his feelings. Second, Kripke has built The Kripke Killer, a robot ten-times more destructive than theirs.
