Contemplating what it would mean to all women if she were to win a Nobel Prize causes Amy to have a meltdown. Koothrappali and Wolowitz try to relive the good old days after Wolowitz buys a scooter that looks like the one he had years ago.
The concept of what it would mean for women everywhere if Amy were to win a Nobel Prize causes Amy to have a meltdown. Also, Koothrappali and Wolowitz try to relive the good old days after Wolowitz buys a scooter that looks like the one he had years ago.
Following Amy's outburst in front of the Nobel Laureates, the outburst directed at Drs. Campbell and Pemberton, a nervous Amy along with Sheldon are both summoned to appear in front of Mrs. Davis with HR and President Siebert, such a summoning and expected official chastising which Amy has never experienced. Indeed, Mrs. Davis and President Siebert, although approaching the matter from different perspectives, strip both Amy and Sheldon of any public engagements in the march toward Nobel while President Siebert takes the lead in doing damage control. This situation leads to both Amy and Sheldon being totally stressed, Leonard and Penny who try to help figure out how to help them relieve that stress. In this situation, it may be Amy who has the tougher road in fixating on the fact that if they do win the prize, she would be only the fourth woman to win the prize in Physics and thus would be a role model especially for all the aspiring future female scientists. Meanwhile, Howard and Raj stumble across a scooter that looks much like the one Howard used to own and was forced to give up by Bernadette. In Howard contemplating buying another scooter without telling Bernadette, the dynamic of their relationship may become the bigger issue.
