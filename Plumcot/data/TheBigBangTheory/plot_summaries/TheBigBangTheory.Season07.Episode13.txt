Sheldon tries to relax after he is forced to take a vacation. Leonard struggles to be supportive of Penny after she quits her job. Amy receives unwanted attention from a co-worker. Bernadette seeks Stuart's help in replacing one of Howard's comic books.
Following her recent acting disappointment, Penny decides she needs to take decisive action to make her career happen by devoting her time one hundred percent into the endeavor, which means quitting her waitressing job. Although he wants to support Penny outwardly in whatever she decides, Leonard does not support this move. He has to decide whether he will tell her the truth or lie about his feelings. Sheldon, who is affected by the goings-on between Leonard and Penny, is however more perturbed by a mandatory request by the college: that he take his vacation time. Meanwhile, Amy, with a little help from Howard and Raj, comes to the realization that one of her colleagues, Bert from the Geology Department, has a crush on her. Regardless of her dating status, she isn't interested in Bert, but she doesn't know how to show or tell him that she's not interested without hurting his feelings. And Bernadette is trying to find a replacement for a rare comic book of Howard's that she accidentally ruined. As Stuart doesn't have a copy of it at his store, she has to decide whether to be loyal to Stuart, or to buy the one available copy in town from Stuart's much hated rival, Jesse.
