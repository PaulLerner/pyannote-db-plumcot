After being forced to deal with a sick Sheldon, the rest of the gang try to treat themselves to a Sheldon-free weekend.
Leonard, Penny, Howard, Bernadette, Raj and Emily are all mad at Sheldon because while they all tried to help and comfort him when he had the flu, he treated them all insensitively. Not knowing what he did wrong, Sheldon doesn't understand why they aren't all happy that he is now well. Still angered because of Sheldon's attitude, the six believe they need some away time from him and decide to rent a party bus for a trip to Las Vegas without him. When Sheldon finds out, he wants to go on the trip despite not liking Vegas, yet he still doesn't understand why they haven't invited him. In Skyping to Amy who is still in Detroit on her conference, Sheldon may begin truly to understand from her that he needs to show some true empathy in apologizing to their friends. Although he believes he has worked out scientifically how to be truly empathetic and mean it, he has to convince all six of them that he is being genuine in his apology for them to forgive him and perhaps let him join the party, those six "I forgive you"s which may be a tall order. The situation gets even more complicated with a seventh person thrown into the mix.
After Sheldon recovers from being sick he is hoping that the guys will be jubilant that he is well. But they just give him the cold shoulder, it seems like when he was sick they all tried to help but all he did was act as he usually does, and he's oblivious to it. And when they decide to go Las Vegas, they don't invite him. And he feels insulted but he talks to Amy who makes him see how wrong he was and he tries to apologize to Leonard hoping that it will be enough for him to join them but Leonard says he needs to . apologize to everyone and when he tries to apologize to Raj and Emily it causes a rift between them.
