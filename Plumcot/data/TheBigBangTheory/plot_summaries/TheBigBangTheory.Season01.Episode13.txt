Sheldon becomes so intent on demonstrating his intellectual superiority over the other guys that they kick him off the Physics Bowl team and replace him with his nemesis, Leslie.
With the perennial winning team not participating this year, Leonard, Howard and Raj feel that their foursome are the sure winners of this year's edition of the university's physics bowl. They have to talk a reluctant Sheldon into entering with them, which they do manage to do. They regret doing so after Sheldon takes control of everything and as such has taken any fun out of the process. After the threesome kick Sheldon off their team, Sheldon vows revenge by forming his own team. Despite Leonard's discomfort with the idea, they decide to ask Leslie Winkle to be Sheldon's replacement, she who declines until she learns that they are planning on destroying Sheldon in the process. During their match, Sheldon, who believes he is basically fielding a one man team (his teammates are a janitor, the lunch floor monitor and her son), has to decide what is the most important goal.
Howard gets word that the top team of the university's annual physics bowl is out of the running. So, Howard, Leonard, Raj and an initially reluctant Sheldon decide to form a team (Ultimately called "The Perpetual Motion Squad"). Yet, the team dynamic is threatened when Sheldon begins to dominate the others because he feels that he is superior to everyone else and can win the competition without them. They throw Sheldon off the team but, out of spite, he forms his own (called "The Army Ants"), made up of members of the custodial staff, while the guys fill their slot with Leslie Winkle, who is only joining for the opportunity to beat Sheldon.
