Sheldon introduces Penny to online gaming, however she refuses to quit after becoming addicted.
Penny is having an emotional meltdown about her stay in southern California. She hasn't had an acting job in two years, she hasn't had a raise at the restaurant during that time, and she hasn't had sex in six months. In her frustration, she accidentally swallowed a fly and got her car key stuck in her apartment door lock. Not being able to get into her apartment until the locksmith shows up, she waits with Sheldon in his apartment, where he is playing Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures (2008) on-line. Sheldon lets her try the game, and she enjoys it so much, she gets hooked. He's created an on-line video gaming monster, she who is playing 24/7 and who looks to Sheldon - 24/7 - for advice on every move. As the guys and Leslie postulate what is the underlying cause for Penny's addiction, they come to a conclusion of what Penny needs to get her out of this funk, and the guys do whatever they can to help her get it.
Penny experiences a no good horrible very bad day that forces her to conclude that her life is a failure. While locked out of her apartment, she waits for the locksmith in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment and becomes curious about "Age of Conan," the game that Sheldon is currently playing. Sheldon teaches her how to play, but she soon becomes addicted, bothering Sheldon at all hours of the day and night with annoying questions about the game. To get her away from the game, Sheldon takes measures to set her up with someone but is goes nowhere. Finally she sees the light when she accepts and invitation from Howard.
