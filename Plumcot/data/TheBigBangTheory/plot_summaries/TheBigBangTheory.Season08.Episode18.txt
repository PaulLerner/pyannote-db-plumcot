Tension arises when a magazine fails to mention Leonard in an article about the paper he co-wrote with Sheldon, and a blackout at Mrs. Wolowitz's home leads to a final family dinner in her honor.
After interviewing Sheldon, Scientific American writes a glowing article about Leonard and Sheldon's latest theory without mentioning Leonard by name, only referring to him as "Dr. Cooper's team". Leonard ends up being upset but not mad at the situation until Sheldon, trying to make things right in his own eyes, finds out what caused the error. Meanwhile, Raj offers to help Howard, Bernadette and Stuart clean out Howard's mother's house, Stuart who Howard is letting stay there a little while longer. Just as Howard, Bernadette and Raj get to the house, Stuart tells them the power has been out since the middle of the night. What Howard ends up being upset about is that the food in the freezer - the last food Debbie ever cooked - has thawed and thus cannot be refrozen and thus saved. As there is enough to feed an army, Howard invites all their friends over for one last meal courtesy of Mrs. Wolowitz. Debbie's spirit pervades the meal in more ways than one, courtesy of Leonard and Sheldon's feud and Bernadette's resulting action.
