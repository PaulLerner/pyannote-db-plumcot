Penny has a night of angry, drunken sex with Leonard, much to his confusion. Meanwhile, Howard and Raj search for Sheldon's perfect match online.
Penny and Leonard are still at the stage of their "post-coitus" relationship where they feel awkward doing friend type things together. Regardless, when the guys experiment with bouncing lasers off the moon, Leonard decides to invite Penny to watch. With her is her latest date, Zack, a less than bright guy. This encounter with Leonard and Zack together demonstrates to Penny that she can't go back to dating the type of guys she used to date: good looking but dumb. In a drunken stupor later, Penny takes some action to reclaim what she's missed no longer dating Leonard. Leonard in turn, takes a cue from Penny's actions. Meanwhile, Howard and Raj believe the answer to Leonard's Penny conundrum is to find another woman for him. After Leonard rejects Howard's idea of using on-line matchmaking services, Raj thinks an interesting experiment would be to see if such a service would produce anyone for Sheldon. Howard and Raj's experiment does produce a match for Sheldon. Will he agree to meet her and if so will she be his perfect match?
