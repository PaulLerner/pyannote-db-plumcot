As Leonard and Penny attempt to hold another wedding ceremony everyone can attend, they have to deal with Penny's family arriving and Leonard's father spending the night with Sheldon's mother.
It's the day of Leonard and Penny's formal wedding ceremony, but things have the potential to go horribly wrong because of all the interrelationships between the attendees. Beverly and Mary, and Beverly and Alfred already have issues with each other and thus want to spend as little time with the other as possible. Beverly is threatening not to show as she feels humiliated on the assumption that Alfred and Mary slept together. Sheldon is angry at Alfred for supposedly defiling his mother. Leonard is angry at Sheldon for hating Alfred for supposedly defiling Mary. Penny's mother Susan is angry at Penny for divulging their family's dirty secrets to Leonard. Susan is also angry at Penny's brother Randall for his drug conviction leading to Susan believing Leonard's family will believe they white trash. Susan and Wyatt are not seeing eye to eye on how they should approach either Leonard's family or the wedding. As the ceremony approaches, the unpredictability of the situation may prove to be interesting. Meanwhile, both Howard and Raj are paranoid that the government is after them, all stemming from Howard's guidance system. Their paranoia is ratcheted up a notch when the military in the form of Colonel Richard Williams wants to meet with Howard but won't say exactly why.
