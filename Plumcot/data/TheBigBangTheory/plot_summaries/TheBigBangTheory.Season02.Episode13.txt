Sheldon tries to make friends with Kripke in the hope that it will get him access to a coveted computer at the university.
Despite being unlikeable, Barry Kripke has someone who wants to be his friend: Sheldon. The only reason Sheldon wants to be his friend is to have access to the open science grid computer which Barry controls. Sheldon isn't having any luck befriending Barry in his usual friend making way, so he, approaching this task from his usual intellectual manner, asks his current friends to complete a questionnaire on why they are his friends. Still approaching the task on an intellectual level, Sheldon decides to use traditional friend making approaches, such as going out for food, for a hot beverage or to participate in a common interest. Sheldon has to find the right meeting point that offends his sensibilities the least. But does Sheldon have room in his life for one more friend, especially of the Barry variety?
