Sheldon takes the guys to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to meet a reclusive scientist; Penny and Bernadette improvise Amy's bachelorette party.
The guys and the girls are having their own individual gatherings this weekend. Penny is organizing Amy's bachelorette party. Amy is expecting it to be a wild and crazy time both because it is a bachelorette party and because Penny, the party animal of the group, is organizing it. What ends up happening is Amy's dream crazy time, at least in her own belief. Meanwhile, Sheldon is spending the weekend with topologist Dr. Robert Wolcott in his remote cabin. Despite being brilliant or because of it, Dr. Wolcott was thought to have gone crazy leading to his paranoid attitude in living off the grid. Sheldon and Dr. Wolcott have been corresponding, with Sheldon believing that Dr. Wolcott may have some insight into his work in string theory. Because of Dr. Wolcott's reputation, the girls want the guys to stay with Sheldon for the weekend just in case Dr. Wolcott does end up being not just crazy but psychotic. What Leonard, Howard and Raj find is that Dr. Wolcott is indeed a bit off-kilter, but as a scientist is brilliant, he who attributes much of his brilliance to his isolation. Meeting Dr. Wolcott may give Sheldon some ideas of his own about how he'd like to live regardless of the fact of soon being a married man.
