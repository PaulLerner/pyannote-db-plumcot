Sheldon's mother is called to intervene when he delves into numerous obsessions after being fired for being disrespectful to his new boss.
Sheldon isn't looking forward to the faculty mixer where he will meet his new boss, Dr. Eric Gablehauser, who Sheldon doesn't respect. Due to an inappropriate comment to Gablehauser, Sheldon promptly gets fired. Sheldon has no interest in getting his job back. With his new found free time, Sheldon works on a series of rather meaningless experiments at home, which drive Leonard and Penny crazy. Feeling at the end of his rope in dealing with a crazed Sheldon, Leonard calls in the one person who he thinks can get Sheldon out of his funk: his mother. Mary Cooper, a religious southerner, deals with her son in her own special way, which may have a side benefit to herself.
Sheldon grudgingly goes to a mixer at work where he is to meet his new boss, Dr. Eric Gablehauser, whom he thinks hasn't done any real work in 25 years. When he calls Gablehauser an idiot (among other things) he find himself out of work. Undaunted, Sheldon sets out on a series of silly hobbies to take his mind off of it. Weeks later, a frustrated Leonard calls his mother who flies in from Texas to talk her son into apologizing to his new boss.
