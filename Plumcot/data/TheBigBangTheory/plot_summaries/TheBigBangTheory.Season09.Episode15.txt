Each couple has its own Valentine's Day plan, which don't turn out quite the way each intends. Leonard and Penny have dinner reservations. It isn't the one hour wait they have at the restaurant despite their reservation that bothers them the most, but rather a comment made by Glenn the Maitre D' to Penny which makes them feel old for the first time. Raj plans on spending the day with Emily, with who he wants to break up as he constantly thinks about Claire. His friends tell him that since he's talked about it for so long that he should just do it and get it over with. What Raj ends up doing in the matter makes for interesting companions for him for Valentine's Day. Sheldon and Amy are celebrating the day by hosting the first ever live streaming of Fun with Flags. Being live, the show takes interesting turns, especially in that they are taking calls from viewers. And Howard and Bernadette plan on breaking in their new hot tub for the first time. Just before they are ready to get in, they spot an animal in it they believe is a rat. What the animal ends up being foreshadows something that is happening in their lives.
