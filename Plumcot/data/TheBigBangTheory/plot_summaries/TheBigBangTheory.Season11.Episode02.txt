Leonard angers the University and the Physics Community when he gives an embarrassing radio interview. Bernadette and Amy compare their successes at work.
On the university's want for more funding for the Physics Department, they've asked Leonard to appear on Ira Flatow's show on NPR to give the department some profile. The profile Leonard does give, however, is an unflattering one to the department, the university and physics in general. As such following the radio show, his job is in jeopardy, that is unless he signs a retraction to his comments on the show. He has to decide what to do as although he does realize in hindsight how unflattering his comments were, he still stands behind what he said. His comments also have an unintended consequence on Sheldon, Howard and Raj. Meanwhile, Bernadette and Amy lament that they can't share their professional successes with their significant others, who are more than willing to toot their own horns with any and every little success they achieve. This lamentation comes on the heels of Amy getting much new and expensive lab equipment, while she knows the financial difficulties the Physics Department is undergoing, which means that Sheldon has had no such new goodies of late. The alternative that Bernadette and Amy come up with to celebrate their respective successes doesn't quite turn out the way they envisioned.
