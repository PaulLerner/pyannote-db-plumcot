Howard is teaching Sheldon Mandarin Chinese because Sheldon wants to complain to the head of a Chinese restaurant about their switching tangerine chicken for orange chicken. At this point, Penny storms in, yells at her boyfriend outside below while throwing his ipod out the window, and storms back out. Leonard tries to check in on her but is told to go away. What Penny was shouting about was her ex blogging about their sex lives. Howard quickly tries to find it online but is unsuccessful. When Leonard tries to reach Penny again she motions him in and allows Leonard to see what's on the web. It tells of all the places she and her guy made out including the Subway sandwich shop. Leonard tells Penny the guy was just expressing his love for her publicly so she goes back out to apologize. Moments later, Penny storms back in Leonard's apartment as she faults him for her witnessing her ex with another woman. Says Raj to Leonard: "Incredible. You screwed up the screw up." When Leonard confronts her again, Penny says she's through with men with perfect bodies, good hair, and money and just wants someone who cares for her. Leonard volunteers himself as a date which Penny accepts. Except the two are now having doubts about the night so they both go to Sheldon for advice. Sheldon proposes the Schrodinger's Cat Theory which confuses Penny but makes sense for Leonard. When Leonard meets Penny at her apartment, they kiss and rush off to a Chinese restaurant but abruptly leave when they find Sheldon there complaining about mucus to the owner.-- Originally submitted by user TavM
