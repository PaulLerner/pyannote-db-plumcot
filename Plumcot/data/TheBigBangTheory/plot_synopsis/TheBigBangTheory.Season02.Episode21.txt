"Are you from the Star Wars universe?" Yes."Were you in the original trilogy?" Yes."Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?" I HOPE NOT!Clearly, you don't need lots of money and knowledge of the different X-Men universes to have fun with the guys. Howard seems to be doing well against Leonard's 20 questions, although clearly Leonard is NOT Princess Leia. Raj's turn:"Were you in all six Star Wars movies?" Yes."Are you a droid?" Yes."Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?" YES! C-3PO it is.Sheldon is in full denial about it (his reaction, well, you'll have to see it for yourself). Meanwhile, Howard's phone is blinding him with science. Leslie Winkle is on the line, and she has reached the "friends with benefits" line. While Howard takes the call, Sheldon questions that phrase. He didn't realize people could offer their friends health insurance. Leonard explains to Sheldon it means you maintain a friendship with someone you had sex with but are still free to date anyone else. ("Sorry, I can't imagine any of that.") Howard doesn't have to imagine any of that, either. Leslie just dumped him. ("Howard, mama is a rolling stone.") Nobody realized he had such an emotional attachment to her."Of course I had feelings for her. I saw her naked, for God's sake!"Everybody wants to comfort him, but surprisingly, it's Sheldon that has the following idea."You know, I'm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems....and replace them with new problems, such as alcoholism, gambling addiction, and sexually-transmitted diseases." (First Sheldon rant I ever got written on the first try!)RAJ: "Is it me, or is that Sheldon's way of saying VEGAS BABY!" (Really, it's like trying to play golf without referencing "Caddyshack." You just can't do it.)Leonard is inspired; he wants to be a "RIGHT NOW!" person. He wants to be up five hunny by midnight. Daddy's gonna give him the Rain Man suite! (Damn Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau anyhow!) He just has to go refill a prescription first. Howard is convinced: Vegas, baby! As far as his mother knows: SeaWorld, baby! As for Sheldon, he'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in his auditory canal.As it turns out, the idea of VEGAS BABY! (errgh!) is even great for Sheldon. His good mood creeps Penny out as they go up the stairs, but tonight he is free to eat Kandai Paneer. It is Indian food (which Raj loathes), containing copious amounts of peanuts (which would reduce Wolowitz to a 97-pound wheezing blister) and includes paneer, a farmer's cheese (which would cause Leonard to make any room uninhabitable within 5 minutes). He is going to relish in the repast in his Fortress of Solitude. ("That's Superman's ice-thingy, right?") But Sheldon is in such as good mood, he even finds Penny's tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming. Well, that is until he can't find his keys. ("What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice-thingy?")About 350 miles to the northeast, Leonard and Raj are preparing for their night in VEGAS BABY! (sorry) Raj is macking on the toiletries in the hotel, but Leonard needs to borrow some aftershave. Fortunately for Leonard, Howard studied at the Brian Fantana School of Spritzing. Howard has about 20 different colognes, musks, forest scents, botanicals, and even pheremonal sprays. (What, no Sex Panther? Amateur!) But Raj and Leonard ARE impressed by Howard's supply of Gold Circle condoms. ("Yes we can!") There will be plenty for Raj, as Howard can't get away from looking at Leslie's Facebook page, which is already changed to update their relationship, or lack thereof. He can't believe it; he wants it to be known that he dumped her!RAJ: "But she did dump you."HOWARD: "Grow up Raj, there's no place for truth on the Internet." (Oh, for those of you wondering, I'm 6 foot 2, 190 pounds, brown hair/blue eyes, athletic build, and just made $2 million short-selling AIG stock.)Raj and Leonard go downstairs without Howard, but Raj needs a plan in case one of them gets lucky. Leonard agrees if he finds a woman, he'll take her to his stately manor in Gotham City, and if Raj hooks up, he'll find a bunk for the night on the moon.At Penny's, she tries to find the emergency key; while Sheldon laments that they have a bowl for emergency keys. That bowl would have come in handy, as Penny used the keys to borrow some milk from the guys' apartment and left the key there. ("Leonard thought I was crazy for saying that carton was lighter!") Of course, his keys are in that same bowl right now. Penny says he can eat dinner there while waiting for the building superintendent, but Sheldon's off his rocker."Eat my dinner? In your apartment? Sure, why not! And after we're done, we can all go pilin' in my pickup truck and go skinny-dippin' down in the crick! 'Cause today's the day to stop makin' sense!" (helps to use a hillbilly voice)Leonard and Raj are enjoying themselves with some video slots, free drinks, and all-you-can-eat shrimp at a VEGAS BABY! bar, while Howard keeps Twittering about his lot in life. Raj needs to down some liquid courage (OK, I got that from the HBO series about the Bunny Ranch. So sue me!) as a woman named Mikayla asks him if he wants to "party." Raj is more than a little interested, but Leonard needs to tell him something. Since it is expected that Mikayla will not be torturing Raj like she did some of the escapees on "Prison Break," one would assume that Leonard is trying to tell Raj that Mikayla is a prostitute. Naturally, Raj doesn't believe it, but Leonard wonders how many gorgeous women have ever walked up to Raj in a bar and asked him to party.RAJ: "Maybe I can save her."LEONARD: "Maybe. But I'm guessing it'll cost you $500 an hour to TRY." So much for Mikayla.Howard is not doing well, judging by his Twitters. "I am at the bottom of a black hole, staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope." Taking him to see Blue Man Group doesn't sound like a viable option, but Raj has an inspiration: Mikayla. Leonard is adamantly against it...until Howard Twitters that he is about to open a $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.Sheldon and Penny attempt small talk at her apartment...and fail. (Actually, it was even worse than I just described it.)Leonard and Raj track down Mikayla. Since they want this to be a surprise for Howard, they ask her if she can make it seem like she's really interested in him and not really a prostitute.MIKAYLA: "Oh, you want the Girlfriend Experience."RAJ: "If it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish Girlfriend Experience?"Sheldon and Penny's night isn't getting better, certainly not with 20 Questions. Sheldon tries a different tact: "Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?" That quickly spices up the evening. Sheldon explains he's heard that phrase recently. What he can't understand is that it seems like a practical thing to have sex without getting emotionally attached, yet Howard ended up crying like a little girl.PENNY: "Well, some people can't handle that kind of relationship."SHELDON: "Can you?"PENNY: "Excuse me??"SHELDON: "Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?"Penny is clearly uncomfortable with Sheldon's line of questioning, but he protests that he can't tell if she's uncomfortable with the question, as he is bad with reading facial expressions, body lan...""I'M UNCOMFORTABLE, SHELDON!!!!!" (Thank you.)Howard is convinced to come downstairs, but he is wholly unimpressed with the selection of shrimp. Cue Mikayla..."Boy, would it kill them to put out a nice brisket?" Hook, line, and sinker! ("I'm Howard Wolowitz." "Hi, I'm Esther Rosenblatt.")Penny gives Sheldon some blankets and a pillow for sleeping on the couch, but he's in full-protest mode already, saying he can't sleep on the couch and will NOT be reenacting E.M. Snickering's beloved children's book "The Tall Man for Cornwall." At wit's end, Penny will give him her bed if he "shuts his hole" for the next 8 hours.Meanwhile, Howard is learning Mikayla's...I mean, Esther's...turn-ons, which include reading in front of a fire, long walks on the beach, and getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger. However, her "Oy gevalt, you're hot" was probably a bit over the top, as he goes to conference with Leonard and Raj. It's pretty obvious she's a hooker, and he's not happy they set him up. But, since they already gave her the money...THANK YOU!Sheldon still can't sleep, which of course means Penny won't be sleeping. He asks her to sing "Soft Kitty" for him. She protests it is for when he's sick, but he considers being homesick a type of being sick. Since it's that or they stay up and talk..."Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty...um...""Sleepy kitty. Start over.""Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."But a tender moment: "Penny, thank you for letting me sleep over.""Awww, you're welcome sweetie."3

1"I'm sleepy now, you can get out."Leonard returns home, and Sheldon is more than happy to tell him that, thanks to Penny, he now has a much better understanding of "friends with benefits." Vegas, baby, Vegas.
