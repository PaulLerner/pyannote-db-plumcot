man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 That’s it. Get it to the top.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Steady. Steady.
brother_ray Up she goes.
brother_ray Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?
brother_ray Here you are, son.
brother_ray Oh, gentlemen, please.
brother_ray In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
sandor_clegane Just one.
brother_ray Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
sandor_clegane He was a woman.
brother_ray I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
sandor_clegane I’m used to it.
brother_ray When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.
brother_ray I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?
sandor_clegane Hate.
brother_ray No, there’s a reason you’re still here.
sandor_clegane Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill.
brother_ray No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet.
sandor_clegane I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.
brother_ray Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods.
sandor_clegane You’re in the wrong line of work.
brother_ray Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane.
sandor_clegane You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
brother_ray I’ve heard stories.
sandor_clegane If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
brother_ray They have.
high_sparrow Your Grace. What are we reading today?
margaery_tyrell The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.
high_sparrow Ah, “As water rounds the stones, smoothing- -”
margaery_tyrell “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”
high_sparrow You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom.
margaery_tyrell For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.
high_sparrow They are hard to love.
high_sparrow The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume.
high_sparrow Can I ask you about a personal matter?
margaery_tyrell Of course.
high_sparrow The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed.
margaery_tyrell No.
high_sparrow You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.
margaery_tyrell It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
high_sparrow Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.
margaery_tyrell Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
high_sparrow Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
margaery_tyrell My grandmother?
high_sparrow Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.
olenna_tyrell Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
margaery_tyrell Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
olenna_tyrell Oh, this is madness!
olenna_tyrell You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...
margaery_tyrell Grandmother.
olenna_tyrell ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
margaery_tyrell Grandmother, please.
olenna_tyrell What have they done to you?
margaery_tyrell You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.
olenna_tyrell We marched for you.
margaery_tyrell The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy.
olenna_tyrell And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
margaery_tyrell Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title...
olenna_tyrell Have you lost your mind?
margaery_tyrell ...and live his life as a penitent.
olenna_tyrell He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.
margaery_tyrell He can begin again.
olenna_tyrell As a mindless fanatic.
margaery_tyrell As a free man.
olenna_tyrell You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
margaery_tyrell I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
margaery_tyrell But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.
olenna_tyrell I will never leave you. Never.
margaery_tyrell You must.
margaery_tyrell Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
margaery_tyrell The Mother watches over us all.
olenna_tyrell I’ll see you soon, my dear.
margaery_tyrell Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.
margaery_tyrell Shall we pray?
dim_dalba We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find.
tormund_giantsbane If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.
dim_dalba Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk.
jon_snow That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive.
tormund_giantsbane The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.
wun_wun Snow.
jon_snow Are you sure they’ll come?
tormund_giantsbane We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it.
cersei_lannister I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
olenna_tyrell That is hardly your concern.
cersei_lannister Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
olenna_tyrell Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
cersei_lannister You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
olenna_tyrell Good.
cersei_lannister I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
olenna_tyrell I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it.
cersei_lannister You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
olenna_tyrell I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too.
cersei_lannister Never. I’ll never leave my son.
olenna_tyrell What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Pick the pace up. Keep going.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Keep it moving!
bronn Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.
jaime_lannister Someone certainly does.
bronn Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword.
jaime_lannister You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
bronn Aye, knights don’t get paid.
jaime_lannister You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
bronn That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
jaime_lannister I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
bronn You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
jaime_lannister And you’ll get all three. A Lannister always- -
bronn Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
lothar_frey Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him.
lothar_frey This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
black_walder_rivers You think I won’t do it, old man?
black_walder_rivers I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
brynden_tully Go on, then. Cut his throat.
jaime_lannister Lothar, is it?
lothar_frey Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
jaime_lannister ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.
bronn Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
jaime_lannister Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
black_walder_rivers Whoa, whoa.
lothar_frey Walder.
black_walder_rivers Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
jaime_lannister Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?
black_walder_rivers I don’t give a rat’s- -
jaime_lannister I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
lothar_frey Apologies, Ser Jaime.
lothar_frey Do as he says.
jaime_lannister The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.
bronn Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
black_walder_rivers Those are our siege towers- -
jaime_lannister As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home.
jaime_lannister Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
bronn A parley or a fight?
jaime_lannister He’s an old man.
bronn You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.
jon_snow Lady Mormont.
lyanna_mormont Welcome to Bear Island.
sansa_stark I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too.
lyanna_mormont I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.
jon_snow I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -
lyanna_mormont I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
jon_snow Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
lyanna_mormont I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
jon_snow Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance.
lyanna_mormont As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports.
sansa_stark I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.
lyanna_mormont If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.
jon_snow Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -
lyanna_mormont I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
davos_seaworth If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.
lyanna_mormont I don’t know you, Ser…?
davos_seaworth Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.
davos_seaworth You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
lyanna_mormont All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?
davos_seaworth You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war.
lyanna_mormont Go on, Ser Davos.
davos_seaworth Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.
lyanna_mormont Is this true?
jon_snow Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
davos_seaworth As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.
lyanna_mormont House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.
jon_snow Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?
lyanna_mormont 62.
jon_snow 62?
lyanna_mormont We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.
davos_seaworth If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.
brynden_tully Kingslayer.
jaime_lannister Blackfish.
brynden_tully I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
jaime_lannister I don’t have them.
brynden_tully Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
brynden_tully Then why are you here?
jaime_lannister You know why I’m here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You’re trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -
brynden_tully Or you’ll kill Edmure?
brynden_tully My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
jaime_lannister It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
brynden_tully Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
jaime_lannister We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.
brynden_tully Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
jaime_lannister The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
brynden_tully As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
jaime_lannister You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
brynden_tully Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.
jaime_lannister Well, now you have.
brynden_tully Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed.
robett_glover The answer is no.
jon_snow Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
robett_glover I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
jon_snow The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
robett_glover Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
jon_snow House Mormont.
robett_glover And?
jon_snow We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
robett_glover I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
jon_snow The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
robett_glover Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
jon_snow Lord Glover.
robett_glover There’s nothing else to say.
sansa_stark I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
robett_glover Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North.
robett_glover And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
robett_glover I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.
theon_greyjoy Why did we have to come here?
yara_greyjoy Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
theon_greyjoy I don’t want one.
yara_greyjoy Don’t go far, love.
yara_greyjoy I’ll find you in a bit.
yara_greyjoy Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?
yara_greyjoy I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?
theon_greyjoy You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
yara_greyjoy Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat.
theon_greyjoy He’ll find us.
yara_greyjoy It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
theon_greyjoy I don’t want any.
yara_greyjoy I don’t care what you want. Drink.
yara_greyjoy Drink it all.
yara_greyjoy You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years.
theon_greyjoy Some bad years?
yara_greyjoy But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
yara_greyjoy Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.
yara_greyjoy You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you.
theon_greyjoy If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.
yara_greyjoy Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink.
yara_greyjoy Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands.
yara_greyjoy Are you with me? Are you really with me?
yara_greyjoy Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
davos_seaworth Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
sansa_stark And that’s a good thing?
davos_seaworth He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
jon_snow We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
davos_seaworth Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.
jon_snow We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
davos_seaworth 2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -
sansa_stark 62 Mormonts.
davos_seaworth It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.
davos_seaworth For fuck’s sake.
sansa_stark So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
jon_snow Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
sansa_stark Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?
sansa_stark It’s not enough. We need more men.
jon_snow There’s no time.
sansa_stark If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -
jon_snow We fight with the army we have.
davos_seaworth Friends, this is not worth fighting over!
davos_seaworth This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Who the fuck are you?
davos_seaworth Hold on.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Yeah, who the fuck are you?
brother_ray I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.
brother_ray That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep.
brother_ray All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
brother_ray Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.
brother_ray It’s never too late to come back.
brother_ray And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
brother_ray Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?
lem_lemoncloak What are you doing here?
brother_ray Well, we’re talking about life. You?
lem_lemoncloak Protecting the people.
brother_ray Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?
lem_lemoncloak Do you have any horses?
brother_ray No horses. No gold. No steel.
lem_lemoncloak Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.
brother_ray I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.
lem_lemoncloak Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
sandor_clegane “Seven save you, friends.”
brother_ray I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
sandor_clegane They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
brother_ray Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them.
sandor_clegane Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women.
brother_ray What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
brother_ray It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight.
sandor_clegane You do.
brother_ray I’m done with fighting.
sandor_clegane Even if it’s to protect yourself?
brother_ray Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
sandor_clegane You don’t cure it by dying, either.
brother_ray You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
sandor_clegane It’s gonna be a cold night. We’ll need firewood.
brother_ray I’ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 He’s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay. I’m inclined to believe him. I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
arya_stark You’re Westerosi.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 What do you care?
arya_stark I want to book passage home.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 You? Can’t afford it.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Where’d you steal this from?
arya_stark Why do you care?
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
arya_stark I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.
arya_stark See you at sunrise.
waman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode07 Sweet girl.
