northman_rider This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane
hot_pie Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand
northman_rider He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead
northman_rider He was my brother once Back when he had a whole hand What were you doing with him
jon_snow The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning
northman_rider Why
jon_snow He wants me to lead one day
northman_rider But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall
jon_snow If I'm a traitor, then you are, too
northman_rider Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow
jon_snow I want to be free
northman_rider No, I don't think so I think what you want most of all is to be a hero I'll ask you one last time  why do you want to join us
jon_snow We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north I saw
northman_rider You saw what
jon_snow I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods I saw what took it
northman_rider You're telling me you saw one of them And why would that make you desert your brothers
jon_snow Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them I want to fight for the side that fights for the living Did I come to the right place
northman_rider We'll need to find you a new cloak
irri What if you took off that bit there
marillion Don't you want to leave something to the imagination
irri Trouble is, I've never had much imagination
marillion I want you to take it off

gerold_hightower Ser Bronn Ser Bronn

gerold_hightower Apologies, ser

gerold_hightower He said it was a matter of life and death
rickard_stark Pod
illyrio_mopatis Cersei It's your sister The queen
rickard_stark What are they doing here
illyrio_mopatis Protecting me, I assume Will you let me in
rickard_stark No, I don't think so
illyrio_mopatis If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me
rickard_stark They stay outside
illyrio_mopatis I'm not afraid of you, little brother
rickard_stark Why are you here
illyrio_mopatis I wanted to see your face They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that
rickard_stark The man who cut me lost more than his nose
illyrio_mopatis I should hope so The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own Thanks to Father
rickard_stark Thanks to Father Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me
illyrio_mopatis No Curious Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand But then I don't suppose you need much room
rickard_stark Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees
illyrio_mopatis You're meeting Father today
rickard_stark How do you know that
illyrio_mopatis Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two Father told me What do you want from him
rickard_stark What do I want from him He's my father Do I need to want something I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came
illyrio_mopatis You're going to make me cry
rickard_stark Why do you care what I want from him
illyrio_mopatis Because you've slandered me to Father before
rickard_stark Slandered When
illyrio_mopatis You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock
rickard_stark You did have your guards beat her A girl of nine, I believe
illyrio_mopatis I was nine, too
rickard_stark She lost an eye, if I remember correctly
illyrio_mopatis If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again
rickard_stark It's not slander if it's true
illyrio_mopatis And what's this truth you plan on telling him today
rickard_stark Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father
illyrio_mopatis Because you're a liar I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey
rickard_stark Any lies in particular
illyrio_mopatis You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are
rickard_stark Still makes me more clever than you
irri Oh, look at these two shining warriors Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares
meryn_trant Ser Meryn Trant
irri Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
meryn_trant You're no knight
irri Pod
gerold_hightower Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself
meryn_trant You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more
irri That's exactly who I am And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion
meryn_trant You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand
irri As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me
rickard_stark A number of people in this city want to kill me You're here to protect me
irri I've been doing that for a while now
rickard_stark Do you grow bored protecting me
irri I grow poor protecting you
rickard_stark Poor Poor Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch
irri Briefly
rickard_stark I'm sure you filled your pockets
irri And now my pockets are empty You've given me a taste for the finer things And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more
rickard_stark I thought we were friends
irri We are But I'm a sellsword I sell my sword I don't loan it out to friends as a favor
rickard_stark How much
irri Double
rickard_stark Double
irri I'm a knight now Knights are worth double
rickard_stark I don't even know how much I'm paying you now
irri Which means you can afford it
old_woman Here Here! Help me!
tortured_slave Who are you
old_woman I was in the battle at Blackwater I was a captain and a knight
tortured_slave Aye, ser, and serving which king
old_woman The one true king of Westeros   Stannis Baratheon
guymon I thought you were dead Everyone thought you were dead And your son
guymon He may have swam ashore as you did
old_woman No, the wildfire took him I saw it
guymon I'm so sorry, my friend I, too, have lost a son There is nothing worse in this world But, Davos, you were a good father
old_woman If I was a good father, he'd still be here Stannis lives
guymon He licks his wounds at Dragonstone
old_woman Will you take me there
guymon There is nothing for me at Dragonstone
old_woman This war is not over
guymon Not for you, maybe But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over
old_woman We're both sworn to King Stannis
guymon I am sworn to no man I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory I delivered the ships
old_woman Stannis never gives up Never Now he will regroup 
guymon He's a broken man His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay They say he sees no one  not his generals, not even his wife Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
old_woman What
guymon They built a great fire when Stannis returned All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness They say she sang to them as they burned
guymon I'm a pirate
old_woman You're a smuggler
guymon Servants of darkness I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
old_woman Take me back there, please
guymon You cannot turn Stannis against her
old_woman Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out
guymon You could try If you fail, they will burn you If you succeed, they'll burn you And you've only just come back to life Stay alive a little longer, my friend
old_woman You call me friend You drank with me on my wedding day
guymon And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors
old_woman I have to stop her Please, do this for me
guymon When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
roose_bolton We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal
brothel_child_1 There won't be a siege The Mountain can't defend a ruin
roose_bolton I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend
brothel_child_1 The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross I'd love a fight The men would love a fight I don't think we're going to get one
rickard_karstark 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep
roose_bolton The debt will be repaid, my friend For them and for your sons
rickard_karstark Will it They rot in the ground while their killer runs free
roose_bolton The Kingslayer won't remain free for long My best hunters are after him
brothel_child_1 Robb A Mallister
maester_caleotte Ser Jeremy My father's bannerman
brothel_child_1 Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
ironborn_2 Talisa She's your mother
brothel_child_1 She freed Jaime Lannister The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
dothraki_woman_having_sex Water Water
ironborn_2 This needs to be cleaned and closed
brothel_child_1 What's your name, friend
dothraki_woman_having_sex Qyburn
ironborn_2 You're lucky to be alive
dothraki_woman_having_sex Lucky
rickard_stark The badge looks good on you Almost as good as it looked on me Are you enjoying your new position
eddard_stark Am I enjoying it
rickard_stark I was very happy as Hand of the King
eddard_stark Yes I heard how happy you were  You brought a whore into my bed
rickard_stark It wasn't your bed at the time
eddard_stark I sent you here to advise the king I gave you real power and authority You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
rickard_stark Occasionally I drank with the harlots
eddard_stark What do you want, Tyrion
rickard_stark Why does everyone assume I want something Can't I simply visit with my beloved father My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
eddard_stark Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
rickard_stark I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls I bled in the mud for our family And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell But what do I want A little bloody gratitude would be a start
eddard_stark Jugglers and singers require applause You are a Lannister Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield Hmm Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion So tell me what you want
rickard_stark I want what is mine by right Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock I am your son and lawful heir
eddard_stark You want Casterly Rock
rickard_stark It is mine by right
eddard_stark We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock
rickard_stark Why
eddard_stark Why You ask that You, who killed your mother to come into the world You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse Go, now Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock Go
eddard_stark Oh, one more thing The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang
morag Dorne It's going to Dorne
beric_dondarrion Why Dorne
morag It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange But it's not coming back The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve He's going to stay in Dorne Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm
beric_dondarrion I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm
morag Don't ruin the game
beric_dondarrion I told you, I don't want to play
morag What about that one there
beric_dondarrion That one It's going to Volantis
morag Why
beric_dondarrion Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one
morag That's not how the game works You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
beric_dondarrion Why should I make up a story when I know the truth
morag Because the truth is always either terrible or boring
petyr_baelish Lovely day for it Watching the ships
morag Lord Baelish
petyr_baelish Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment
petyr_baelish I saw your mother not long ago She's very eager to see you And your sister
morag Arya's alive You said you'd take me home
petyr_baelish You said King's Landing was your home You are the property of the crown Stealing you would be treason If you were to tell just one person 
morag I won't tell anyone
petyr_baelish How do I know
morag Because I'm a terrible liar You said so yourself Please, Lord Baelish Tell me what to do Tell me when
petyr_baelish I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice
the_night_king You're her handmaiden
beric_dondarrion Yes And you're his
the_night_king I help manage his affairs
beric_dondarrion He's an important person
the_night_king So is she I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset We've both done rather well, you and I
beric_dondarrion Yes
the_night_king Given where we started
beric_dondarrion And where is that
the_night_king It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out Watch out for her
beric_dondarrion I always do
the_night_king Watch out for her with him
rast They're growing fast
ghita Not fast enough I can't wait that long I need an army
rast We'll be in Astapor by nightfall Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world
ghita The greatest slave-soldiers in the world The distinction means a good deal to some people
rast Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne
ghita It's too beautiful a day to argue
rast You're right Another lovely day on the high seas
ghita Don't mock them They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship They followed me across the poison water If they'll do it, others will And with a true khalasar 
rast The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong And not before
old_woman Your Grace
ash I heard you were dead
old_woman Not yet
ash I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace
ash We are alone
old_woman Your Grace, you are the rightful king Not only by blood You're an honorable man, a just man And there is still a war to fight
ash I am fighting
old_woman By burning prisoners alive
braavosi_captain How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos
old_woman I do not judge people for the gods they worship If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone
braavosi_captain I'm not your enemy
old_woman You are my enemy
braavosi_captain Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay Did I set your ships ablaze I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands I could have saved those men You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind Do you hear them screaming All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them
braavosi_captain Don't despair, Ser Davos What I told your son is true
braavosi_captain Death by fire is the purest death
old_woman This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons
ash Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
old_woman Your Grace!
great_master_3 Come on
braavosi_captain You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos
old_woman She will destroy us all!
braavosi_captain I will pray for you
old_woman Your Grace!
great_master_3 Guard Halt Down
gaurd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Guard #2 Halt Down
glover_general Why have we stopped
great_master_3 It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace
glover_general Joffrey What is she doing Who gave her permission
dothraki_man_having_sex My lady We should have guards, my lady
captured_wight Why
captured_wight Pardon me
dothraki_man_having_sex Stop, my lady You'll ruin your dress
captured_wight I have others
great_master_3 Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace
glover_general No
high_septon He was a soldier He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay He never came back
captured_wight And your mother
high_septon She died when she had me
captured_wight Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them
captured_wight Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father
high_septon He wasn't a knight He was just a soldier
captured_wight And what do knights swear to do Protect the weak and uphold the good Your father did that Be proud of him
captured_wight Was your father a soldier, too
captured_wight You should be proud, too Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city They saved us all From now on, we're going to take care of you All of you
#NONEXT The streets, a little later
captured_wight Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them Directly to me
captured_wight Your Grace
hallyne Your Grace
glover_general Please, sit Sit I do apologize, my lady Small council meetings At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time
glover_general That's a lovely gown, my lady
illyrio_mopatis Yes, it suits you perfectly I imagine you might be rather cold
captured_wight The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace
glover_general Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady
captured_wight I am touched by your concern, Your Grace Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm Doesn't it, Loras
hallyne Yes
captured_wight Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork I've never seen anything like it
illyrio_mopatis You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen Perhaps before Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
captured_wight Yes I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about
hallyne Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden
captured_wight The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
illyrio_mopatis Cersei An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them The king barely escaped with his life
glover_general My mother's always had a penchant for drama Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older Our lives were never truly in danger
illyrio_mopatis You're right, of course But you are your father's son We can't all have a king's bravery
captured_wight Hunger turns men into beasts I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach Wheat, barley, apples We've had a blessed harvest And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need
glover_general Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before I'm sure she knows what she's doing
illyrio_mopatis I'm sure she does
great_master_4 The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
great_master_4 They will stand until they drop
great_master_4 Such is their obedience
daenerys_targaryen They may suit my needs Tell me of their training
great_master_4 The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down She wished to know how they are trained
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell her what she would know and be quick about it
great_master_4 They begin their training at five Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
great_master_4 Their discipline and loyalty are absolute They fear nothing
rast Even the bravest men fear death
great_master_4 The knight says even brave men fear death
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell the old man he smells of piss
great_master_4 Truly, master
kraznys_mo_nakloz No, not truly Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing
great_master_4 Missandei My master says the Unsullied are not men Death means nothing to them
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch
great_master_4 He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace
ghita Tell the good master there is no need
kraznys_mo_nakloz She's worried about their nipples Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls
great_master_4 My master points out that men don't need nipples
kraznys_mo_nakloz Here, I'm done with you
stannis_baratheon This one is pleased to have served you
great_master_4 To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them
ghita You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin
great_master_4 She is offended She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby
kraznys_mo_nakloz What a soft mewling fool this one is
great_master_4 My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother
ghita How many do you have to sell
great_master_4 8000
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow
great_master_4 Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry Many other buyers are interested
ghita 8,000 dead babies
rast The Unsullied are a means to an end
ghita Once I own them, these men 
rast They're not men Not anymore
ghita Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be
rast Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you
rast You'll be fair to them You won't mutilate them to make a point
rast You won't order them to murder babies You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered A great injustice has been done to them Closing your eyes will not undo it
ghita The warlocks
ghita I owe you my life, ser
barristan_selmy The honor is mine, my queen
ghita You know this man
rast I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard
barristan_selmy King Robert is dead I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness I was sworn to protect your family I failed them
