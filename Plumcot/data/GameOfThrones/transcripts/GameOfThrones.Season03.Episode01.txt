man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Fall back!
samwell_tarlysamwell_tarly Brother?
jeor_mormont Did you send the ravens?
jeor_mormont Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?
jeor_mormont That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.
ygritte First time you've seen a giant, JON SNOW?
jon_snowygritte Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
girl#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Look over there!
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
girl#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow! Look over here! Look!
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Ah, look, crow coming!
boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
ygritte You're wearing the wrong color.
jon_snow Mance was a ranger.
ygritte In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
jon_snow When I'm free, will I be free to go?
boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Crow!
ygritte Sure, you will.
boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Oh!
ygritte And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.
jon_snow What happened to their fathers?
ygritte Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't...
tormund_giantsbane I smell a crow.
lord_of_bones We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
tormund_giantsbane What do we want with a baby crow?
ygritte This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
tormund_giantsbane That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
jon_snow My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
tormund_giantsbane Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?
jon_snow Jon Snow.
jon_snow Your Grace.
tormund_giantsbane Your Grace?
mance_rayder Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
mance_rayder So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.
mance_rayder The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?
tormund_giantsbane Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
mance_rayder This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
tormund_giantsbane Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
mance_rayder He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
mance_rayder He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
jon_snow The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
mance_rayder Why?
jon_snow He wants me to lead one day.
mance_rayder But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.
jon_snow If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.
mance_rayder Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
jon_snow I want to be free.
mance_rayder No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?
jon_snow We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
mance_rayder You saw what?
jon_snow I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
mance_rayder You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
jon_snow Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?
mance_rayder We'll need to find you a new cloak.
bronn What if you took off that bit there?
whore#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
bronn Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.
whore#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 I want you to take it off.
whore#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Mouth.
podrick_payne Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
bronn I didn't hear that.
podrick_payne Apologies, ser.
bronn Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
podrick_payne Lord Tyrion sent me.
bronn I will murder you, boy.
podrick_payne He said it was a matter of life and death.
tyrion_lannister Pod?
cersei_lannister Cersei It's your sister. The queen.
tyrion_lannister What are they doing here?
cersei_lannister Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?
tyrion_lannister No, I don't think so.
cersei_lannister If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?
tyrion_lannister They stay outside.
cersei_lannister I'm not afraid of you, little brother.
tyrion_lannister Why are you here?
cersei_lannister I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.
tyrion_lannister The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
cersei_lannister I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.
tyrion_lannister Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.
cersei_lannister No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
tyrion_lannister Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
cersei_lannister You're meeting Father today?
tyrion_lannister How do you know that?
cersei_lannister Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
tyrion_lannister What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
cersei_lannister You're going to make me cry.
tyrion_lannister Why do you care what I want from him?
cersei_lannister Because you've slandered me to Father before.
tyrion_lannister Slandered? When?
cersei_lannister You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
tyrion_lannister You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.
cersei_lannister I was nine, too.
tyrion_lannister She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
cersei_lannister If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
tyrion_lannister It's not slander if it's true.
cersei_lannister And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
tyrion_lannister Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
cersei_lannister Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
tyrion_lannister Any lies in particular?
cersei_lannister You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.
tyrion_lannister Still makes me more clever than you.
bronn Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares.
meryn_trant Ser Meryn Trant.
bronn Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
meryn_trant You're no knight.
bronn Pod.
podrick_payne Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
meryn_trant You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.
bronn That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.
meryn_trant You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.
bronn As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.
tyrion_lannister A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
bronn I've been doing that for a while now.
tyrion_lannister Do you grow bored protecting me?
bronn I grow poor protecting you.
tyrion_lannister Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.
bronn Briefly.
tyrion_lannister I'm sure you filled your pockets.
bronn And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.
tyrion_lannister I thought we were friends.
bronn We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
tyrion_lannister How much?
bronn Double.
tyrion_lannister Double?
bronn I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
tyrion_lannister I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
bronn Which means you can afford it.
davos_seaworth Here. Here! Help me!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Who are you?
davos_seaworth I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Aye, ser, and serving which king?
davos_seaworth The one true king of Westeros ... Stannis Baratheon.
salladhor_saan I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
salladhor_saan He may have swam ashore as you did.
davos_seaworth No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.
salladhor_saan I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father.
davos_seaworth If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?
salladhor_saan He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
davos_seaworth Will you take me there?
salladhor_saan There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
davos_seaworth This war is not over.
salladhor_saan Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
davos_seaworth We're both sworn to King Stannis.
salladhor_saan I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
davos_seaworth Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
salladhor_saan He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
davos_seaworth What?
salladhor_saan They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
salladhor_saan I'm a pirate.
davos_seaworth You're a smuggler.
salladhor_saan Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
davos_seaworth Take me back there, please.
salladhor_saan You cannot turn Stannis against her.
davos_seaworth Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
salladhor_saan You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
davos_seaworth You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
salladhor_saan And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.
davos_seaworth I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.
salladhor_saan When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.
roose_bolton We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.
robb_stark There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
roose_bolton I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
robb_stark The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
rickard_karstark 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
roose_bolton The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons.
rickard_karstark Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
roose_bolton The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
robb_stark Robb A Mallister?
catelyn_stark Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
robb_stark Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
talisa_stark Talisa She's your mother.
robb_stark She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
qyburn Water. Water.
talisa_stark This needs to be cleaned and closed.
robb_stark What's your name, friend?
qyburn Qyburn.
talisa_stark You're lucky to be alive.
qyburn Lucky?
tyrion_lannister The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
tywin_lannister Am I enjoying it?
tyrion_lannister I was very happy as Hand of the King.
tywin_lannister You brought a whore into my bed.
tyrion_lannister It wasn't your bed at the time.
tywin_lannister I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
tyrion_lannister Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
tywin_lannister What do you want, Tyrion?
tyrion_lannister Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
tywin_lannister Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
tyrion_lannister I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
tywin_lannister Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.
tyrion_lannister I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.
tywin_lannister You want Casterly Rock?
tyrion_lannister It is mine by right.
tywin_lannister We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
tyrion_lannister Why?
tywin_lannister Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.
tywin_lannister Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.
sansa_stark Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
shae Why Dorne?
sansa_stark It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
shae I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
sansa_stark Don't ruin the game.
shae I told you, I don't want to play.
sansa_stark What about that one there?
shae That one? It's going to Volantis.
sansa_stark Why?
shae Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
sansa_stark That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
shae Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
sansa_stark Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
petyr_baelish Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
sansa_stark Lord Baelish.
petyr_baelish Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
petyr_baelish I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
sansa_stark Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
petyr_baelish You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
sansa_stark I won't tell anyone.
petyr_baelish How do I know?
sansa_stark Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.
petyr_baelish I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
ros You're her handmaiden?
shae Yes. And you're his...?
ros I help manage his affairs.
shae He's an important person.
ros So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I.
shae Yes.
ros Given where we started.
shae And where is that?
ros It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
shae I always do.
ros Watch out for her with him.
jorah_mormont They're growing fast.
daenerys_targaryen Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
jorah_mormont We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
daenerys_targaryen The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
jorah_mormont Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
daenerys_targaryen It's too beautiful a day to argue.
jorah_mormont You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
daenerys_targaryen Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ...
jorah_mormont The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before.
davos_seaworth Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon I heard you were dead.
davos_seaworth Not yet.
stannis_baratheon I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon We are alone.
davos_seaworth Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.
stannis_baratheon I am fighting.
davos_seaworth By burning prisoners alive?
melisandre How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
davos_seaworth I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
melisandre I'm not your enemy.
davos_seaworth You are my enemy.
melisandre Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
davos_seaworthmelisandre Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true.
melisandre Death by fire is the purest death.
davos_seaworth This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
stannis_baratheon Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
davos_seaworth Your Grace!
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Come on.
melisandre You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
davos_seaworth She will destroy us all!
melisandre I will pray for you.
davos_seaworth Your Grace!
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Halt. Down.
guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Halt. Down.
joffrey_baratheon Why have we stopped?
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Joffrey What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
maid#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 My lady. We should have guards, my lady.
margaery_tyrell Why?
margaery_tyrell Pardon me.
maid#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.
margaery_tyrell I have others.
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
joffrey_baratheon No.
child#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
margaery_tyrell And your mother?
child#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 She died when she had me.
margaery_tyrell Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.
margaery_tyrell Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.
child#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode01 He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
margaery_tyrell And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
margaery_tyrell Was your father a soldier, too?
margaery_tyrell You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you.
margaery_tyrell Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me.
margaery_tyrell Your Grace.
loras_tyrell Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?
joffrey_baratheon That's a lovely gown, my lady.
cersei_lannister Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold.
margaery_tyrell The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
margaery_tyrell I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?
loras_tyrell Yes.
margaery_tyrell Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.
cersei_lannister You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
margaery_tyrell Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
loras_tyrell Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
margaery_tyrell The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
cersei_lannister Cersei An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life.
joffrey_baratheon My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
cersei_lannister You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.
margaery_tyrell Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
joffrey_baratheon Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
cersei_lannister I'm sure she does.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz They will stand until they drop.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz Such is their obedience.
daenerys_targaryen They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
missandei The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained.
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
missandei They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
jorah_mormont Even the bravest men fear death.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz The knight says even brave men fear death.
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell the old man he smells of piss.
missandei Truly, master?
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
missandei He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen Tell the good master there is no need.
kraznys_mo_nakloz She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
missandei My master points out that men don't need nipples.
kraznys_mo_nakloz Here, I'm done with you.
unsullied This one is pleased to have served you.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
daenerys_targaryen You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
missandei She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
missandei#Trans#kraznys_mo_nakloz My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.
daenerys_targaryen How many do you have to sell?
missandei 8000
kraznys_mo_nakloz Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
missandei Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
daenerys_targaryen 8,000 dead babies.
jorah_mormont The Unsullied are a means to an end.
daenerys_targaryen Once I own them, these men ...
jorah_mormont They're not men. Not anymore.
daenerys_targaryen Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
jorah_mormont Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
jorah_mormont You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
jorah_mormont You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
daenerys_targaryen The warlocks.
daenerys_targaryen I owe you my life, ser.
barristan_selmy The honor is mine, my queen.
daenerys_targaryen You know this man?
jorah_mormont I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
barristan_selmy King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them.
