jon_snow Are you all right?
jon_snow Ever been north before?
gendry Never seen snow before.
tormund_giantsbane Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.
jon_snow You've never been down south.
tormund_giantsbane I've been to Winterfell.
jon_snow That's the north.
gendry How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
tormund_giantsbane You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.
jon_snow There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
tormund_giantsbane We have to make due with what we've got.
tormund_giantsbane This one is maybe not so smart.
jon_snow Davos says he is a strong fighter.
tormund_giantsbane Good. That's more important than being smart.
tormund_giantsbane Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?
jon_snow She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
tormund_giantsbane You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?
thoros_of_myr Are you still mad at us, boy?
gendry You sold me to a witch.
thoros_of_myr Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.
beric_dondarrion We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.
gendry I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --
sandor_clegane Sounds all right so far.
gendry -- and put leeches on me.
sandor_clegane Was she naked too?
thoros_of_myr She needed your blood.
gendry Yes. Thank you. I know that.
sandor_clegane It could have been worse.
gendry She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
sandor_clegane But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?
gendry I'm not whinging.
sandor_clegane Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
sandor_clegane This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.
thoros_of_myr Good lad.
jon_snow The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
jorah_mormont He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
jon_snow I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
jorah_mormont I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.
jon_snow I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
jorah_mormont Your father wanted to execute me.
jon_snow I heard.
jorah_mormont He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
jon_snow I'm glad he didn't capture you.
jorah_mormont Me too.
jon_snow Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.
jon_snow Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
jon_snow But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
jorah_mormont He gave it to you.
jon_snow I'm not his son.
jorah_mormont I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
jorah_mormont I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
arya_stark Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
sansa_stark I remember.
arya_stark One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.
arya_stark I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
sansa_stark What?
arya_stark That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. "Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --
sansa_stark You don't have to read it. I remember.
arya_stark "Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
sansa_stark They forced me to do it.
arya_stark Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
sansa_stark You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
arya_stark So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
sansa_stark They told me it was the only way to save father.
arya_stark And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
sansa_stark You were there?
arya_stark I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
sansa_stark And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
arya_stark I wanted to.
sansa_stark But you didn't. Just like me.
arya_stark I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
sansa_stark You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?
arya_stark I was training.
sansa_stark Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.
arya_stark Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.
sansa_stark You never would have survived what I survived.
arya_stark I guess we'll never know.
sansa_stark What are you doing to do with that letter.
arya_stark I don't know yet.
sansa_stark Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
arya_stark You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.
sansa_stark Arya --
arya_stark Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
sansa_stark Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --
arya_stark The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, "But I was just a child"?
sansa_stark You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
arya_stark Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
tormund_giantsbane You're one big ugly dog.
sandor_clegane Fuck off.
tormund_giantsbane They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
sandor_clegane I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
sandor_clegane Gingers I hate.
tormund_giantsbane Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.
sandor_clegane Don't point your fucking finger at me.
tormund_giantsbane Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
sandor_clegane I didn't trip. I was pushed.
tormund_giantsbane Ever since you've been mean.
sandor_clegane Will you fuck off?
tormund_giantsbane I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.
sandor_clegane Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?
tormund_giantsbane Dick?
sandor_clegane Cock.
tormund_giantsbane Ah. Dick. I like it.
sandor_clegane I bet you do.
tormund_giantsbane Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.
sandor_clegane Brienne of Tarth.
tormund_giantsbane You know her?
sandor_clegane You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
tormund_giantsbane Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.
sandor_clegane How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
tormund_giantsbane You do know her.
sandor_clegane We've met.
tormund_giantsbane I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.
sandor_clegane How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
tormund_giantsbane I'm good at killing people.
beric_dondarrion You don't much look like him.
jon_snow Who's that?
beric_dondarrion Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.
jon_snow You knew him?
beric_dondarrion Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.
jon_snow I serve the north.
beric_dondarrion The north didn't raise you from the dead.
jon_snow The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
beric_dondarrion He wants you alive.
jon_snow Why?
beric_dondarrion I don't know.
jon_snow That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.
beric_dondarrion I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
jon_snow So what are you fighting for?
beric_dondarrion Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.
jon_snow But we all die.
beric_dondarrion The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
jon_snow "I am the shield that guards the realms of men."
beric_dondarrion Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.
jon_snow Aye. Maybe that's enough.
sandor_clegane That's what I saw in the fire.
sandor_clegane A mountain like an arrowhead.
thoros_of_myr Are you sure?
sandor_clegane We're getting close.
daenerys_targaryen Do you know what I like about you?
tyrion_lannister I honestly don't.
daenerys_targaryen You're not a hero.
tyrion_lannister Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
tyrion_lannister I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
daenerys_targaryen I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.
tyrion_lannister It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.
daenerys_targaryen Jon Snow's not in love with me.
tyrion_lannister Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.
