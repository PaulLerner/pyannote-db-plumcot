davos_seaworth Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--
stannis_baratheon We've been here since midday.
davos_seaworth Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--
tycho Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit.
tycho What can we do for you, Lord stannis?
davos_seaworth This is stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
tycho The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
stannis_baratheon He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
tycho Yes, we have heard this story.
stannis_baratheon It's not a story. It's the truth.
tycho The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
stannis_baratheon Gold you loaned him.
tycho And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
stannis_baratheon More than any man living.
tycho Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right." Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
stannis_baratheon 4,000.
tycho And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
davos_seaworth 32.
tycho And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
stannis_baratheon None.
tycho You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
davos_seaworth My lord.
tycho I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
davos_seaworth Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
davos_seaworth This is the payment that was demanded by King stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
tycho The war is over.
davos_seaworth As long as stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?
tycho Ser Davos...
davos_seaworth Humor me.
tycho  Tywin Lannister.
davos_seaworth How old is  Tywin Lannister?
tycho 67.
stannis_baratheon 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When  Tywin's gone, who do you back?
tycho That is a problem for another time.
davos_seaworth Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
sallador_saan  The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt." The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!"
sallador_saan  After the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed." The next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!" The crew goes silent.
sallador_saan  They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows...
women "Bring me my brown pants!"
davos_seaworth You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
sallador_saan  Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
davos_seaworth Only half rotted.
sallador_saan  Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--
lhara I am Lhara.
sallador_saan  She's an artist, this one, truly.
davos_seaworth No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
sallador_saan  We?
davos_seaworth You, me-- we.
sallador_saan  Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
davos_seaworth You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
davos_seaworth There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
sallador_saan  You're not my friend, my friend.
davos_seaworth I'll see you at sunrise.
yara_greyjoy "I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North."
myranda Yes!
yara_greyjoy They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.
myranda Yes! Yes!
yara_greyjoy As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.
first_mate Go left.
yara_greyjoy  Theon Greyjoy.
bolton_guard I don't know--
yara_greyjoy I'm here for  Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
bolton_guard He's not in the dungeons.
bolton_guard Last cage on the right.
yara_greyjoy Thank you.
yara_greyjoy This way!
yara_greyjoy We're going home.
theon_greyjoyNo!
yara_greyjoy It's all right. It's me, Yara.
theon_greyjoy You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
yara_greyjoy I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
theon_greyjoy Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
first_mate They're here.
yara_greyjoy If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.
theon_greyjoy No, you can't! You can't!
yara_greyjoy You're  Theon Greyjoy.
theon_greyjoy No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!
ramsay_bolton This is turning into a lovely evening.
theon_greyjoy I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
yara_greyjoy Aah! Theon!
yara_greyjoy Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
ramsay_bolton You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
ramsay_bolton how fast can you run?
yara_greyjoy Make for the ship, now.
ironborn But your brother.
yara_greyjoy My brother is dead.
ramsay_bolton I have a treat for you. A reward.
theon_greyjoy Reward?
ramsay_bolton Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal.
theon_greyjoy I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--
ramsay_bolton Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now.
ramsay_bolton The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.
ramsay_bolton Do you love me, Reek?
theon_greyjoy Yes, of course, my lord.
ramsay_bolton Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back.
theon_greyjoyBut how can--
ramsay_bolton I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
theon_greyjoy Pretend to be who?
ramsay_bolton Theon Greyjoy.
daenerys_targaryen You stand before daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.
missandei The Queen says you may approach and speak.
goatherd .
missandei He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
daenerys_targaryen I thank him for his prayers.
goatherd .
missandei It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock.
goatherd .
missandei He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
daenerys_targaryen Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,
daenerys_targaryen but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
goatherd .
daenerys_targaryen Send the next one in.
manservant The noble hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
daenerys_targaryen The noble hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Queen daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
daenerys_targaryen I thank you.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
daenerys_targaryen Then it is my honor to receive you.
hizdahr_zo_loraq My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included.
daenerys_targaryen For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.
hizdahr_zo_loraq You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
daenerys_targaryen Your father crucified innocent children.
hizdahr_zo_loraq My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
daenerys_targaryen I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.
hizdahr_zo_loraq What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
daenerys_targaryen And what traditions do you speak of?
hizdahr_zo_loraq The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
daenerys_targaryen And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
hizdahr_zo_loraq Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
daenerys_targaryen Bury your father, hizdahr zo Loraq.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Thank you, my queen.
daenerys_targaryen How many more?
missandei There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen 212?
daenerys_targaryen Send the next one in.
oberyn_martell These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?
mace_tyrell Lord tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
mace_tyrell Lord tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--
tywin_lannister The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
lord_varys Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
cersei_lannister A coward and a traitor.
lord_varys My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
grand_maester_pycelle Disgraceful.
tywin_lannister What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
lord_varys 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
tywin_lannister Make it 100. What else?
lord_varys More whispers from the east, my lord.
tywin_lannister The Targaryen girl?
lord_varys Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
cersei_lannister Conquered with what?
lord_varys She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.
cersei_lannister Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.
grand_maester_pycelle Mormont is spying on her for us.
lord_varys No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
cersei_lannister He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
tywin_lannister Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
cersei_lannister Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
lord_varys A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
oberyn_martell Lord varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
tywin_lannister Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
grand_maester_pycelle How, my lord? By force?
tywin_lannister Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
lord_varys Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
tywin_lannister Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.
lord_varys Prince Oberyn.
oberyn_martell Lord Varys...
lord_varys Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
oberyn_martell And yet everyone does.
lord_varys You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
oberyn_martell Five years.
lord_varys May I ask why?
oberyn_martell 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
lord_varys Most of us aren't princes.
oberyn_martell You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
lord_varys I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
oberyn_martell I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
lord_varys It's a long story.
oberyn_martell One you don't like telling people.
lord_varys People I trust.
oberyn_martell My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
oberyn_martell You did like boys before?
oberyn_martell Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
lord_varys Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.
oberyn_martell What then?
lord_varys Nothing.
oberyn_martell Everybody is interested in something.
lord_varys Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
oberyn_martell Such as?
tyrion_lannister Let me guess, I've been pardoned.
tyrion_lannister Really?
jaime_lannister Father's orders.
tyrion_lannister Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
man Kingslayer!
tommen_baratheon I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. tywin_lannister of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused.
tywin_lannister tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?
tyrion_lannister No.
tywin_lannister Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
tyrion_lannister Not that I know of.
tywin_lannister How would you say he died, then?
tyrion_lannister Choked on his pigeon pie.
tywin_lannister So you would blame the bakers?
tyrion_lannister Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
tywin_lannister The crown may call its first witness.
meryn_trant Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
tyrion_lannister Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
tywin_lannister Silence.
tyrion_lannister Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
tywin_lannister Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
grand_maester_pycelle Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--
oberyn_martell I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.
grand_maester_pycelle Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.
tywin_lannister By whom?
grand_maester_pycelle By the accused, tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
tywin_lannister Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?
grand_maester_pycelle Without question.
grand_maester_pycelle This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
tywin_lannister Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
pyelle It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
cersei_lannister "I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid."
mace_tyrell Your own brother said this to you?
cersei_lannister Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
oberyn_martell tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid." What debt?
cersei_lannister I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
tywin_lannister Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
mace_tyrell Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
lord_varys I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
mace_tyrell And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
lord_varys Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
tywin_lannister You're excused, Lord Varys.
tyrion_lannister Father, may I ask the witness one question?
tywin_lannister One.
tyrion_lannister You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
lord_varys Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
tywin_lannister We will adjourn for now.
tywin_lannister Toll the bells in an hour's time.
guard Clear the court!
jaime_lannister You'd condemn your own son to death?
tywin_lannister I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
jaime_lannister This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
tywin_lannister I know nothing of the sort.
jaime_lannister You've always hated Tyrion.
tywin_lannister He killed his king.
jaime_lannister As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
tywin_lannister It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
jaime_lannister Justice?
tywin_lannister I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
jaime_lannister He'll be executed.
tywin_lannister No, he'll be punished accordingly.
jaime_lannister Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
tywin_lannister I'm well aware of your oath.
jaime_lannister What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
tywin_lannister What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
jaime_lannister It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
tywin_lannister Done.
tywin_lannister When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
jaime_lannister You have my word.
tywin_lannister And you have mine.
tyrion_lannister Not going well, is it?
jaime_lannister You're going to be found guilty.
tyrion_lannister Oh, you think so?
jaime_lannister When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
tyriom Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
jaime_lannister Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
ytrion How do you know?
jaime_lannister Do you trust me?
jaime_lannister Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
tywin_lannister The crown may call its next witness.
tywin_lannister State your name.
shae Shae.
tywin_lannister Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
shae I swear it.
tywin_lannister Do you know this man?
shae Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
tywin_lannister How do you know him?
shae I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
tywin_lannister This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
shae I know that he's guilty.
shae He and Sansa planned it together.
tywin_lannister Silence! Continue.
shae She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord.
shae He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
oberyn_martell How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
shae I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
mace_tyrell I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
shae His whore.
tywin_lannister How did you come to be in his service?
shae He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. "You belong to me now," he said. "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."
tywin_lannister Silence. Silence!
oberyn_martell And did you?
shae Did I what?
oberyn_martell Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
shae I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine."
tyrion_lannister Shae. Please don't.
shae I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
tyrion_lannister Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.
tywin_lannister You wish to confess?
tyrion_lannister I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let stannis kill you all.
tywin_lannister Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
tyrion_lannister Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
tywin_lannister You admit you poisoned the king?
tyrion_lannister No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.
tywin_lannister You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
tyrion_lannister Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.
tywin_lannister Have you nothing to say in your defense?
tyrion_lannister Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
tyrion_lannister Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.
tyrion_lannister I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
tywin_lannister Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
tyrion_lannister I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
