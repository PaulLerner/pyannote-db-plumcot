GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your Grace, if you’d like to sit, I’m sure that…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We’ve been here since midday.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Easterners have a different sense of time.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Welcome to the Iron Bank.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Please, sit.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He shares no blood with me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He is a bastard born of incest.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As was his brother before him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We have heard this story.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s not a story.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The king’s grandfather tells a different story.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Gold you loaned him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown More than any man living.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like “usurper” and “madman” and “blood right.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Here, our books are filled with numbers.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We prefer the stories they tell.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown More plain.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Less open to interpretation.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ,.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And how many ships do you have?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Uh…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Thirtytwo.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your , men on your ships?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown None.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But we thank you for paying us the honour of your visit.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You would not be either here.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t do the thieving.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown That would be the pirates.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I consider it an honest accounting.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s an honest man and he’s your best chance to get back the money you’ve sunk into Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Which is a lot.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Wars are expensive.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The war is over.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Who’s the real power in King’s Landing?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Ser Davos…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Humour me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tywin Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How old is Tywin Lannister?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Sixtyseven.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And when he dies, who’s in command?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A halfgrown boy, the product of incest?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown When Tywin’s gone, who do you back?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown That is a problem for another time.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I think it’s a problem for now.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown There’s only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Stannis.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s got the birthright.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s in his prime.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s a tried and tested battle commander.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And he doesn’t just talk about paying people back, he does it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The captain shouts to his first mate, “Bring me my red shirt.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A few days later, the lookout screams, “Two pirate ships!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” The crew is shivering like scared mice.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But the courageous captain hollers, “Bring me my red shirt!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” After the battle, the first mate asks, “Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” The captain replies, “So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” The next morning the lookout screams, “Ten pirate ships!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We are surrounded!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” The crew goes silent.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Calm as ever, the captain bellows…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “Bring me my brown pants!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” You think they ever met a pirate who didn’t tell them that joke?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Davos.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Only half rotted.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Join us, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This is Lhara.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And this is…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I am Lhara.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She’s an artist, this one, truly.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No time, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We sail at sunrise.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You, me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Once I thought this man loved me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Now I know he despises me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You won’t be alone.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And you won’t be poor.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown There’s a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I gave it to your wife.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’re not my friend, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ll see you at sunrise.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North “and back to those shitstained rocks you call home.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “On the first night of the full moon, “I will hunt down every islander still on our lands “and flay them living, “the way I flayed the ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “In the box you’ll find a special gift.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “Theon’s favourite toy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “He cried when I took it away from him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Signed, “Ramsay Snow, “natural born son of Roose Bolton, “Lord of the Dreadfort “and Warden of the North.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Yes!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your prince!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Everything they’ve done to him, they’ve also done to you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word “ironborn” means nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Go left.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I don’t know…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m here for Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Take me to the dungeons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s not in the dungeons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Last cage on the right.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This way!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We’re going home.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s all right.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s me, Yara.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You can’t trick me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tell him you couldn’t trick me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m not tricking you, Theon.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m saving you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Not Theon!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My name is Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They’re here.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown lf they catch us in here, we’re trapped.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Help me with him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No, you can’t!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’re Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No, I don’t believe her!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I know who I am!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Loyal Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Good Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ve always been Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This is turning into a lovely evening.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Loyal Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Theon!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’ve got bigger balls than he ever did.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But with those big balls of yours, how fast can you run?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Make for the ship, now.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But your brother?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My brother is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I have a treat for you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A reward.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Reward?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes, Reek.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And you didn’t let them.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You remained loyal.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t want them to take me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was so scared.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t want them…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes, Reek.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s a bath.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown For you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Remove those rags.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Now.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The britches, too, Reek.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Take them off.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you love me, Reek?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes, of course, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Because I need you to do something for me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Something very important.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown There’s a castle.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Some bad men hold this castle.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I need your help to take this castle back.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But how can…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I need you to play a role.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown To pretend to be someone you’re not.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Pretend to be who?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Don’t be afraid, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The Queen says you may approach and speak.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He is a goatherd.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I thank him for his prayers.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It was your dragons, he says.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They came this morning for his flock.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I cannot bring back his goats…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown …
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Send the next one in.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Queen Daenerys.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Then it is my honour to receive you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My father, one of Meereen’s most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This pyramid included.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown For that, he has my gratitude.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I should be honoured to meet him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You have, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You crucified him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I pray you’ll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your father crucified innocent children.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My father spoke out against crucifying those children.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’d be wise to remember that.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What’s done is done.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And what traditions do you speak of?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Of funeral rite.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My father and noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They were rotting in the sun as well.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Let me take his body down.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Thank you, my queen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How many more?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown There are supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Send the next one in.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown These meetings aren’t always going to be this early, are they?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was up late last night.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown So, does this mean I am a master of something now?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Coins, ships?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lord Tywin, it’s a great honour to have been granted a seat on this council.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The trial begins this afternoon.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We only have the morning for affairs of state.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown So, shall we begin?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A coward and a traitor.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I believe the phrase “fuck the king” was uttered.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Disgraceful.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Ten silver stags seems a generous bounty.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Make it .
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What else?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown More whispers from the east, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The Targaryen girl?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Conquered with what?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Some , strong.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She has a company of sellswords, the Second Sons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She has two knights advising her, Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And she has three dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Baby dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Larger every year, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Mormont is spying on her for us.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No longer.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He appears to be fully devoted to her.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’s an old man.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He wasn’t fit to protect my son.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Joffrey didn’t die on his watch.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Don’t tell me you’re worried about a child halfway across the world.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A child with two seasoned warriors counselling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lord Varys is right.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown They are very impressive on the battlefield.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Less so in the bedroom.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Dragons haven’t won a war in years.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Armies win them all the time.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She must be dealt with.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown By force?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Eventually, if it comes to that.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Fetch my quill and paper.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Prince Oberyn.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Only Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m not actually a nobleman.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No one is under obligation to call me lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And yet everyone does.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Did you spend much time in Essos?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Five years.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown May I ask why?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ‘Tis a big and beautiful world.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I don’t want to be most of us.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Most of us aren’t princes.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You are from Essos.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Where?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lys?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I have an ear for accents.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ve lost my accent entirely.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I have an ear for that as well.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How did you get here?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s a long story.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown One you don’t like telling people.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown People I trust.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You should come to the brothel and meet her.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We have some lovely boys on retainer, but…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You did like boys before?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Really?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Girls?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I hope you won’t be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Not at all.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But I was never interested in girls, either.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What then?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Everybody is interested in something.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Not me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown When I see what desire does to people, what it’s done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Such as?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Let me guess, I’ve been pardoned.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Really?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Father’s orders.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Well, we mustn’t disappoint Father.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Kingslayer!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And if found guilty, may the gods punish the accused.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Did you kill King Joffrey?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Not that I know of.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How would you say he died, then?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Choked on his pigeon pie.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown So you would blame the bakers?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Or the pigeons.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Just leave me out of it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The crown may call its first witness.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Once we’d got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It wasn’t the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he’d meet the same fate.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And when I spoke in the king’s defence, he threatened to have me killed.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Oh, why don’t you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Silence.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Silence!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You will not speak unless called upon.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’re dismissed, Ser Meryn.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “Basilisk venom, “widow’s blood, “wolfsbane, “essence of nightshade, “sweetsleep, “tears of Lys, “demon’s dance…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” “…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown blindeye…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You have a lot of poison in your store.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Had, Prince Oberyn.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown My stores were plundered.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown By whom?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey’s corpse.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Was it without question poison that killed him?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Without question.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king’s fool.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Residue of the most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It was.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The strangler.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown CERSEl “I will hurt you for this.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “A day will come when you think you are safe and happy “and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth “and you will know the debt is paid.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Your own brother said this to you?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tyrion said, “And you will know the debt is paid.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” What debt?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I discovered he’d been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behaviour belongs.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He wasn’t pleased.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m afraid I do, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He said, “Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “Monsters are dangerous “and just now kings are dying like flies.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” And he said this to you at a meeting of the Small Council?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown After we received word of Robb Stark’s death.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He didn’t seem gladdened by the news.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’re excused, Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Father, may I ask the witness one question?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown One.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown We will adjourn for now.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Toll the bells in an hour’s time.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Clear the court!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’d condemn your own son to death?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ve condemned no one.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The trial is not over.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This isn’t a trial.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’s a farce.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I know nothing of the sort.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’ve always hated Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He killed his king.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown As did I.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown To bring him your head.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It won’t be murder.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It’ll be justice.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Justice?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’ll be executed.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No, he’ll be punished accordingly.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Once you said, “Family is what lives on.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “All that lives on.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” You told me about a dynasty that would last , years.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m well aware.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What happens to your name?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Who carries the lion banner into future battles?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Your nephews?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Lancel Lannister?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Others whose names I don’t even remember?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson’s killer?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown It survives through me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ll leave the Kingsguard.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Done.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown When the testimony’s concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’ll plead for mercy.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ll allow him to join the Night’s Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown In three days’ time, he’ll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’ll remove your white cloak immediately.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You will leave King’s Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And you’ll never turn your back on your family again.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You have my word.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And you have mine.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Not going well, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You’re going to be found guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Oh, you think so?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And when you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Father’s agreed to it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’ll spare your life and allow you to join the Night’s Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Father is not Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He’ll keep his word.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How do you know?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you trust me?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Keep your mouth shut.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No more outbursts.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This will all be over soon.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown The crown may call its next witness.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown State your name.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Shae.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I swear it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you know this man?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tyrion Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How do you know him?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown What do you know of this?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I know that he’s guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He and Sansa planned it together.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Silence!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Continue.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown She blamed their deaths on the king.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tyrion was happy to help.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He hated Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He hated the queen.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He hated you, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He stole poison from the Grand Maester’s chamber to put in Joffrey’s wine.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How could you possibly know all this?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Why would he reveal such plans to his wife’s maid?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I wasn’t just her maid.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was his whore.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I beg your pardon?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You said you were his…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown His whore.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown How did you come to be in his service?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He stole me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was with another man, a knight in your lordship’s army.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He broke the knight’s arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “You belong to me now,” he said.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown “I want you to fuck me like it’s my last night in this world.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Silence!
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And did you?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Did I what?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Fuck him like it was his last night in this world?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I did everything he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Whatever he told me to do to him.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Whatever he felt like doing to me.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I kissed him where he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I licked him where he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I let him put himself where he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I was his property.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown He ordered me to call him “my lion,” so I did.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I took his face in my hands and said, “I am yours and you are mine.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown ” Shae.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Please don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I am a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Remember?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown That was before he married Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown After that, all he wanted was her.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown But she wouldn’t let him into her bed.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Father, I wish to confess.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I wish to confess.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You wish to confess?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I saved you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I should have let Stannis kill you all.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Do you wish to confess?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Yes, Father.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Is that what you want to hear?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You admit you poisoned the king?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown No, of that I’m innocent.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’m guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I am guilty of being a dwarf.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Oh, yes, I am.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I’ve been on trial for that my entire life.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Have you nothing to say in your defence?
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Nothing but this…
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I did not do it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than , lying whores.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I wish I was the monster you think I am.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Ser Meryn.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I will not give my life for Joffrey’s murder.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown And I know I’ll get no justice here.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown So I will let the gods decide my fate.
GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode06 #unknown I demand a trial by combat.
