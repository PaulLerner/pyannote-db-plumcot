[jaime_lannister] You could have killed me.
[bronn] What the fuck were you doing back there?
[jaime_lannister] Ending the war by killing her.
[bronn] You saw the dragon between you and her?
[bronn] And?
[bronn] Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you.
[jaime_lannister] That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --
[bronn] You're fucked.
[jaime_lannister] Don't you mean we're fucked?
[bronn] No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.
[jaime_lannister] I have to tell Cersei.
[bronn] Best well jump back in that river.
[daenerys_targaryen] I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --
[daenerys_targaryen] -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.
[daenerys_targaryen] Step forward, My Lord.
[daenerys_targaryen] You will not kneel?
[randyll_tarly] I already have a queen.
[tyrion_lannister] My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.
[randyll_tarly] There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.
[daenerys_targaryen] You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
[tyrion_lannister] Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.
[randyll_tarly] You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.
[dickon_tarly] You will have to kill me too.
[randyll_tarly] Step back and shut your mouth.
[daenerys_targaryen] Who are you?
[randyll_tarly] A stupid boy.
[dickon_tarly] I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.
[tyrion_lannister] You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
[dickon_tarly] I will not.
[tyrion_lannister] Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.
[daenerys_targaryen] I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
[tyrion_lannister] Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --
[daenerys_targaryen] I'm not beheading anyone.
[tyrion_lannister] Your Grace --
[daenerys_targaryen] Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.
[daenerys_targaryen] Dracarys.
[qyburn] My Lord.
[cersei_lannister] How many men did we lose?
[jaime_lannister] We haven't done a full counting.
[cersei_lannister] It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.
[cersei_lannister] They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.
[jaime_lannister] I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win.
[cersei_lannister] So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?
[cersei_lannister] Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
[jaime_lannister] He didn't.
[cersei_lannister] You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.
[jaime_lannister] I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
[cersei_lannister] After all this time it still amazes me --
[jaime_lannister] It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
[cersei_lannister] And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
[jaime_lannister] After.
[cersei_lannister] And you believed her?
[jaime_lannister] If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
[cersei_lannister] I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
[jaime_lannister] She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.
[cersei_lannister] So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
[daenerys_targaryen] They're beautiful, aren't they?
[jon_snow] That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.
[daenerys_targaryen] They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.
[jon_snow] You weren't gone long.
[daenerys_targaryen] No.
[jon_snow] And?
[daenerys_targaryen] And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
[daenerys_targaryen] You're not sure how you feel about that?
[jon_snow] No, I'm not.
[daenerys_targaryen] How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
[jon_snow] Thousands.
[daenerys_targaryen] We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
[jon_snow] Ser Davos gets carried away.
[daenerys_targaryen] So it was a figure of speech?
[meereen_guard] This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi.
[daenerys_targaryen] He is my friend.
[jorah_mormont] Your Grace.
[daenerys_targaryen] Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.
[jon_snow] I served with your father. He was a great man.
[daenerys_targaryen] You look strong. You found a cure?
[jorah_mormont] I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.
[daenerys_targaryen] It would be my honor.
[bran_stark] Ravens. We need to send ravens.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.
[marwyn] I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
[marwyn] It is a bit much. Still we ought to --
[samwell_tarly] Brandon Stark --
[samwell_tarly] -- the crippled boy.
[marwyn] Do you know him?
[samwell_tarly] I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
[marwyn] And?
[samwell_tarly] Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
[marwyn] I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
[samwell_tarly] Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.
[marwyn] It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
[samwell_tarly] Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it.
[marwyn] We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
[samwell_tarly] Archmaester --
[marwyn] That will be all, Tarley.
[maester_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
[maester_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
[marwyn] I'm afraid so.
[maester_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Horrible business.
[marwyn] I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.
[marwyn] Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
[tyrion_lannister] All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
[lord_varys] Not burn him alive alongside his son.
[tyrion_lannister] I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.
[lord_varys] That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
[lord_varys] It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, "I'm not the one doing it." As the pitch of their screams rose higher, "I'm not the one doing it." When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, "I'm not the one doing it."
[tyrion_lannister] Daenerys is not her father.
[lord_varys] And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
[tyrion_lannister] Who is that for?
[lord_varys] Jon Snow.
[tyrion_lannister] Did you read it?
[lord_varys] It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
[tyrion_lannister] What's it say?
[lord_varys] Nothing good.
[jon_snow] I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
[daenerys_targaryen] I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
[jon_snow] Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
[lord_varys] The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
[jon_snow] I need to go home.
[daenerys_targaryen] You said you don't have enough men.
[jon_snow] We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
[daenerys_targaryen] And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
[tyrion_lannister] Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
[jon_snow] I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
[tyrion_lannister] So bring the dead to her.
[daenerys_targaryen] I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
[tyrion_lannister] We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
[davos_seaworth] Is that possible?
[jon_snow] The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
[tyrion_lannister] Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
[lord_varys] Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
[tyrion_lannister] The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
[daenerys_targaryen] And how would you get into King's Landing.
[davos_seaworth] I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.
[daenerys_targaryen] Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.
[lord_varys] Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
[jorah_mormont] With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
[jorah_mormont] You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
[jon_snow] The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
[davos_seaworth] They won't follow Ser Jorah.
[jon_snow] They won't have to.
[davos_seaworth] You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
[jon_snow] I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
[daenerys_targaryen] I haven't given you permission to leave.
[jon_snow] With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.
[robett_glover] The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.
[yohn_royce] The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.
[sansa_stark] You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best.
[sansa_stark] I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
[arya_stark] He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
[sansa_stark] Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud.
[arya_stark] These are mother and father's chambers.
[sansa_stark] And?
[arya_stark] Nothing.
[sansa_stark] Don't do that.
[arya_stark] What?
[sansa_stark] Say what you mean.
[arya_stark] You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
[sansa_stark] Are you angry with me?
[arya_stark] They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
[sansa_stark] I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.
[arya_stark] Their opinions are important to you?
[sansa_stark] Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army.
[arya_stark] Not if they lose their heads first.
[sansa_stark] Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.
[arya_stark] And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.
[sansa_stark] How can you even think such a horrible thing?
[arya_stark] You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.
[sansa_stark] I have work to do.
[arya_stark] My lady.
[tyrion_lannister] Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
[davos_seaworth] Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
[davos_seaworth] There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
[tyrion_lannister] You're not staying here?
[davos_seaworth] I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
[tyrion_lannister] What if someone takes the boat?
[davos_seaworth] Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
[jaime_lannister] We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
[bronn] All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
[jaime_lannister] I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
[bronn] And here I am ready to train.
[jaime_lannister] Why down here?
[bronn] I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
[jaime_lannister] Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
[bronn] Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.
[bronn] I'll leave you to it.
[tyrion_lannister] I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
[tyrion_lannister] You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.
[jaime_lannister] Don't talk about our father.
[tyrion_lannister] Listen to me --
[jaime_lannister] I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
[tyrion_lannister] It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
[tyrion_lannister] He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --
[jaime_lannister] What do you want?
[tyrion_lannister] Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
[jaime_lannister] You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
[tyrion_lannister] I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
[davos_seaworth] I wasn't sure I'd find you.
[davos_seaworth] I thought you might still be rowing.
[davos_seaworth] I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.
[gendry] Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
[davos_seaworth] I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
[davos_seaworth] Anybody give you any trouble?
[gendry] Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
[davos_seaworth] Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
[gendry] You came to get me. You want me to come with you.
[davos_seaworth] I think you need to understand --
[gendry] I'm ready. Let's go.
[davos_seaworth] You should know what you're heading into.
[gendry] Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.
[gendry] I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.
[davos_seaworth] You might want to bring one of those swords.
[gendry] I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --
[gendry] -- this I know.
[davos_seaworth] Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
[gendry] Who should I say I am?
[davos_seaworth] I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] You there.
[davos_seaworth] No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Is that your boat?
[davos_seaworth] It is.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] The docks are that way.
[gendry] That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
[davos_seaworth] Still five gold dragons?
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Are you joking?
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] You must be even older than you look. 15.
[davos_seaworth] 15?
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Apiece.
[davos_seaworth] I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] What's in the boat?
[davos_seaworth] Not more gold.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Wine?
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Mmm.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] I like wine.
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Or hams.
[davos_seaworth] Come and have a look.
[davos_seaworth] Fermented crab.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] What?
[davos_seaworth] Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.
[davos_seaworth] I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Oi, Dwarf!
[davos_seaworth] I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] That dwarf --
[guard_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Where did you get that scar?
[tyrion_lannister] Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
[davos_seaworth] Perhaps there's some arrangement?
[guard_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode05] Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
[davos_seaworth] This is Gendry.
[tyrion_lannister] He'll do.
[cersei_lannister] That won't be necessary.
[qyburn] Ser Jaime.
[jaime_lannister] Why was QYBURN here?
[cersei_lannister] He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
[jaime_lannister] I met with Tyrion.
[cersei_lannister] What did our brother have to say?
[jaime_lannister] Daenerys wants to meet.
[cersei_lannister] To discuss a surrender?
[jaime_lannister] To discuss an armistice.
[cersei_lannister] She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
[jaime_lannister] Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
[cersei_lannister] Are you going to punish him?
[jaime_lannister] Tyrion?
[cersei_lannister] Bronn.
[cersei_lannister] He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
[jaime_lannister] You let it happen. Why?
[cersei_lannister] I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.
[jaime_lannister] Who will you say is the father?
[cersei_lannister] You.
[jaime_lannister] People won't like that.
[cersei_lannister] Do you remember what father used to say about people?
[jaime_lannister] The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
[cersei_lannister] Never betray me again.
[davos_seaworth] We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
[gendry] I understand.
[davos_seaworth] He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
[gendry] You don't have to worry.
[davos_seaworth] You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.
[gendry] Understood.
[davos_seaworth] Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
[jon_snow] You survived King's Landing.
[davos_seaworth] Yet again.
[jon_snow] Your Grace, this is --
[gendry] It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.
[davos_seaworth] He was meant to keep that to himself.
[gendry] Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?
[jon_snow] I saw your father once at Winterfell.
[gendry] I met yours in my shop.
[jon_snow] You're a lot leaner.
[gendry] You're a lot shorter.
[jon_snow] I grew up on stories about them.
[gendry] All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you.
[davos_seaworth] Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
[gendry] No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.
[jon_snow] Do you know how to use one?
[jon_snow] Well, that's a problem.
[gendry] I prefer a hammer.
[davos_seaworth] He can handle himself.
[jon_snow] We could use the help.
[davos_seaworth] As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.
[gendry] I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.
[davos_seaworth] Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
[tyrion_lannister] You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.
[tyrion_lannister] This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
[jorah_mormont] It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
[tyrion_lannister] Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
[daenerys_targaryen] We should be better at saying farewell by now.
[jorah_mormont] Your Grace, I --
[jon_snow] If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
[daenerys_targaryen] But I've grown used to him.
[jon_snow] I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.
[jon_snow] Heave!
[gilly] Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
[baby_sam] No.
[gilly] 15,782.
[gilly] Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
[samwell_tarly] None anymore.
[gilly] That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does "annulment" mean?
[samwell_tarly] It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
[gilly] Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --
[samwell_tarly] These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits.
[gilly] Steps. That number was steps.
[gilly] Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.
[samwell_tarly] I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
[maester_wolkan] I found it, my Lord.
[maester_wolkan] It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
[petyr_baelish] Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
[maester_wolkan] Yes, my Lord.
[petyr_baelish] Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
[tormund_giantsbane] Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
[davos_seaworth] I've been failing at that job of late.
[tormund_giantsbane] How many queens are there now?
[jon_snow] Two.
[tormund_giantsbane] And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
[jon_snow] Both.
[tormund_giantsbane] How many men did you bring?
[jon_snow] Not enough.
[tormund_giantsbane] The big woman?
[jorah_mormont] We were hoping some of your men could help.
[davos_seaworth] I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
[tormund_giantsbane] You are.
[tormund_giantsbane] You really want to go out there again?
[tormund_giantsbane] You're not the only ones.
[tormund_giantsbane] My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.
[jon_snow] You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
[tormund_giantsbane] They want to go beyond the Wall too.
[beric_dondarrion] We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming.
[gendry] Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.
[gendry] They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
[jorah_mormont] Thoros?
[jorah_mormont] I hardly recognized you.
[thoros_of_myr] Ser Jorah Mormont --
[thoros_of_myr] They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.
[tormund_giantsbane] You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?
[jorah_mormont] He was my father.
[tormund_giantsbane] He hunted us like animals.
[jorah_mormont] You returned the favor, as I recall.
[beric_dondarrion] Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
[davos_seaworth] Our reasons aren't your reasons.
[beric_dondarrion] It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
[beric_dondarrion] There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
[sandor_clegane] For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?
[jorah_mormont] Don't you want to know what we're doing?
[thoros_of_myr] Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
[jon_snow] He's right. We're all on the same side.
[gendry] How can we be?
[jon_snow] We're all breathing.
