arya_stark What are they doing with the bodies?
the_waif Get back to work.
arya_stark No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it.
the_waif You will know why.
arya_stark When?
the_waif When it’s time. Not before. Get back to work.
arya_stark When do I get to play the game?
the_waif Game?
arya_stark The game. The game of faces.
the_waif You tried already. You failed.
arya_stark I didn’t even know I was playing.
the_waif Who are you?
arya_stark No one.
the_waif Get back to work.
arya_stark Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here?
the_waif I’m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since.
the_waif Was that true or a lie?
arya_stark What?
the_waif Did you believe every word I said?
the_waif Get back to work.
jaqen_hghar Who are you?
jaqen_hghar Who are you?
arya_stark Arya.
jaqen_hghar And where did you come from?
arya_stark Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
jaqen_hghar A lie.
arya_stark After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
jaqen_hghar A lie.
arya_stark I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
jaqen_hghar A lie.
arya_stark A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.
arya_stark I hated him.
arya_stark I hated him!
arya_stark That’s not a lie!
jaqen_hghar The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?
arya_stark Yes.
arya_stark I’m not playing this stupid game anymore!
jaqen_hghar We never stop playing.
tyrion_lannister So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots.
jorah_mormont I can.
tyrion_lannister You’re not hungry?
jorah_mormont Of course I’m hungry.
tyrion_lannister You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.
jorah_mormont I am not your travelling companion.
tyrion_lannister We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
jorah_mormont Do you ever shut up?
tyrion_lannister I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
jorah_mormont Why?
tyrion_lannister Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
jorah_mormont I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
tyrion_lannister I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
tyrion_lannister As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.
jorah_mormont What do you know about my father?
tyrion_lannister I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”
tyrion_lannister You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
jorah_mormont How?
tyrion_lannister I only know what I heard
jorah_mormont How?
tyrion_lannister He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
jorah_mormont We better keep moving.
winter_town_man Valar morghulis.
arya_stark Valar dohaeris.
winter_town_man I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
girl#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode06 It hurts.
arya_stark I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.
arya_stark I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink.
jaqen_hghar Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?
jaqen_hghar No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.
tyrion_lannister Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion.
jorah_mormont Do you believe in anything?
tyrion_lannister I believe in many things.
jorah_mormont In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?
tyrion_lannister No.
jorah_mormont Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
tyrion_lannister No.
jorah_mormont It's hard to be a cynic after that.
tyrion_lannister Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
jorah_mormont No it doesn’t.
tyrion_lannister The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?
jorah_mormont First we have to conquer the world.
tyrion_lannister We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?
jorah_mormont Then she rules.
tyrion_lannister So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
jorah_mormont She is the rightful heir.
tyrion_lannister Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?
jorah_mormont Shh! It’s a slave ship
tyrion_lannister Why is it anchored?
jorah_mormont They probably came ashore for--
malko --water.
malko Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
slaver#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode06 Salt mines.
malko That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.
slaver#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode06 What about the dwarf?
malko Worthless. Cut his throat.
tyrion_lannister Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this!
malko And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
tyrion_lannister Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?
slaver#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode06 It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
tyrion_lannister Guess again.
malko The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.
jorah_mormont Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
malko We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.
tyrion_lannister The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.
tyrion_lannister Him.
malko Him? He’s got to be 60 years old.
tyrion_lannister Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!
malko Is that true?
tyrion_lannister He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.
tyrion_lannister The Kingslayer!
malko Jousting. You’re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
jorah_mormont I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
malko Liar.
jorah_mormont It’s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver’s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I’ll prove my worth.
lancel_lannister Lord Baelish.
petyr_baelish Yes? Lancel Lannister.
lancel_lannister Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.
petyr_baelish That’s quite a family to abandon.
lancel_lannister The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.
petyr_baelish Well done.
petyr_baelish I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I’ll be delayed?
lancel_lannister Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You’ll find that there’s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King’s Landing.
petyr_baelish We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.
petyr_baelish Do you think it’s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?
cersei_lannister The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
petyr_baelish Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
cersei_lannister The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion?
petyr_baelish House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
cersei_lannister House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.
petyr_baelish One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
cersei_lannister Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
petyr_baelish Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
cersei_lannister She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.
petyr_baelish I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
cersei_lannister If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
petyr_baelish Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
cersei_lannister Good. If there’s nothing else.
petyr_baelish There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.
cersei_lannister That’s not possible.
petyr_baelish My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.
cersei_lannister Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
petyr_baelish Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
cersei_lannister We were fools to trust a turncloak.
petyr_baelish Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
cersei_lannister I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
petyr_baelish I would counsel patience, your grace.
cersei_lannister Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.
petyr_baelish Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.
cersei_lannister Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.
petyr_baelish That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.
cersei_lannister My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
petyr_baelish Ser Jaime, then.
cersei_lannister Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
petyr_baelish Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.
cersei_lannister Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.
petyr_baelish You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?
cersei_lannister And if you succeed?
petyr_baelish Name me Warden of the North.
cersei_lannister I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
petyr_baelish I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
cersei_lannister And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.
petyr_baelish As I said. I live to serve.
trystane_martell I’m going to ask him tomorrow.
myrcella_baratheon What if he says no?
trystane_martell He won’t. You’ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
myrcella_baratheon Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you…
myrcella_baratheon We can’t. Not yet.
trystane_martell Why not?
myrcella_baratheon You know why not. Someone will see.
trystane_martell You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
myrcella_baratheon How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
trystane_martell I like the way your eyes go squinty when you’re jealous.
myrcella_baratheon They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.
doran_martell They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
areo_hotah Yes, my prince.
doran_martell You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
areo_hotah I remember how.
bronn The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman’s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
jaime_lannister Alright, thats enough.
bronn I’m coming to the best part.
jaime_lannister We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
bronn This song really is all about the ending.
jaime_lannister It can wait. Up there.
jaime_lannister That’s the Water Gardens.
bronn Once we got the princess, then what?
jaime_lannister I like to improvise.
bronn That explains the golden hand.
ellaria_sand Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.
sand_snakes For Oberyn.
bronn Well, she’s made herself at home.
jaime_lannister Myrcella.
myrcella_baratheon Uncle Jaime? I don’t understand, what are you doing here?
jaime_lannister Let’s speak in private.
trystane_martell I am Trystane Martell.
myrcella_baratheon Trystane is my intended.
jaime_lannister Excellent. Good to meet you.
trystane_martell We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime.
bronn Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son?
bronn Let’s not do something stupid.
myrcella_baratheon No!
bronn That was something stupid.
jaime_lannister We have to go, Myrcella, now.
myrcella_baratheon You hurt him!
jaime_lannister You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--
bronn Oh for fuck’s sake.
obara_sand You’re coming with me.
myrcella_baratheon I don’t want to!
obara_sand I wasn’t asking, princess.
areo_hotah Drop you weapons!
obara_sand I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
areo_hotah Drop your weapons!
areo_hotah When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.
bronn You fight pretty good for a little girl.
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode06 Halt!
olenna_tyrell Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.
olenna_tyrell Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Everyone knew about him and Renly.
olenna_tyrell Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
margaery_tyrell_mummer But he was the king’s brother.
olenna_tyrell And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Cersei is behind this.
olenna_tyrell Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.
olenna_tyrell Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.
cersei_lannister You must be exhausted.
olenna_tyrell Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything.
cersei_lannister Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.
olenna_tyrell And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
cersei_lannister Beg your pardon.
olenna_tyrell I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
cersei_lannister If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
olenna_tyrell You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
cersei_lannister I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
olenna_tyrell Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?
cersei_lannister I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
olenna_tyrell Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
cersei_lannister As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--
olenna_tyrell What veil?
cersei_lannister The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
olenna_tyrell I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
cersei_lannister House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.
high_sparrow You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
hizdahr_zo_loraq I don’t pay attention to rumors.
high_sparrow You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in
hizdahr_zo_loraq He was my friend. He was my king.
high_sparrow Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.
hizdahr_zo_loraq I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
high_sparrow Wearing Renly’s armor.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Why does it matter what I wore?
high_sparrow Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Of course I deny them.
high_sparrow You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Never.
high_sparrow Nor any other man.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Never.
high_sparrow That will be all Ser Loras.
olenna_tyrell Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
high_sparrow Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
margaery_tyrell_mummer You call me forward?
high_sparrow Yes. We have some questions for you.
margaery_tyrell_mummer I am the queen.
high_sparrow You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.
high_sparrow How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
margaery_tyrell_mummer They are lies.
high_sparrow All of them?
margaery_tyrell_mummer All of them.
high_sparrow Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?
margaery_tyrell_mummer Yes, I swear it.
high_sparrow Thank you, your grace.
high_sparrow Do you know this man?
olyvar Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.
high_sparrow How did you come to meet?
olyvar I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
high_sparrow And what occurred in his chamber?
olyvar We engaged in intimate relations.
high_sparrow You laid with him?
olyvar That night and many others.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Liar! He’s a liar!
high_sparrow Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
olyvar Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised.
cersei_lannister This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
olyvar He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Liar!
olenna_tyrell What are you doing? Let us pass.
high_sparrow The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
margaery_tyrell_mummer What?
high_sparrow Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Tommen! Tommen!
margaery_tyrell_mummer You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!
sansa_stark What do you want?
myranda Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?
myranda You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.
sansa_stark What others?
myranda I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
sansa_stark What others?
myranda Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.
sansa_stark Hunt?
myranda Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?
sansa_stark What was your name again?
myranda Myranda.
sansa_stark And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me.
myranda Are you done with your bath, my lady?
sansa_stark Go. I can finish on my own.
sansa_stark Yes?
theon_greyjoy I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?
sansa_stark No.
theon_greyjoy Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.
sansa_stark I’m not touching you.
theon_greyjoy Please. He’ll punish me.
sansa_stark Do you think I care what he does to you.
roose_bolton Who comes before the Old Gods this night?
theon_greyjoy Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?
ramsay_bolton Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?
theon_greyjoy Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father’s ward.
roose_bolton Lady Sansa, will you take this man?
sansa_stark I take this man.
ramsay_bolton Are you pleased my lady?
ramsay_bolton Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you’re still a virgin.
sansa_stark Yes.
ramsay_bolton Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?
sansa_stark Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.
ramsay_bolton You’re not lying to me?
sansa_stark No, my lord.
ramsay_bolton Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?
sansa_stark Yes sir.
ramsay_bolton Good. Now take off your clothes.
ramsay_bolton Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.
ramsay_bolton Reek? I told you to watch.
ramsay_bolton You’ve known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.
