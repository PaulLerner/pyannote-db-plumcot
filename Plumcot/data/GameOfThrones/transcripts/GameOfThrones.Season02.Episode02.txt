jaqen_hghar Boy.
jaqen_hghar Lovely boy.
arya_stark What do you want?
jaqen_hghar A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
arya_stark I have friends.
rorge Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
jaqen_hghar A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. . You're called Arry. . This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.
rorge Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!
arya_stark You should have asked nicely.
rorge Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
jaqen_hghar The boy has more courage than sense.
rorge Come here!
gendry Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
rorge Come here!
arya_stark They don't scare me.
gendry Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
arya_stark What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
gendry What are you doing?
arya_stark They're looking for me.
goldcloak You're in command here?
yoren You're a long way from home.
goldcloak I asked you a question.
yoren Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.
goldcloak I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
yoren Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
yoren It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
yoren We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
goldcloak We're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
lord_varys My lord.
shae You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.
lord_varys We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
tyrion_lannister It was quite a battle.
lord_varys I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
shae And I tell him the story of how we meet.
lord_varys To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
tyrion_lannister . Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
shae I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
lord_varys How can you tell?
shae I can always tell.
tyrion_lannister Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
lord_varys I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
tyrion_lannister Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.
lord_varys How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.
tyrion_lannister I don't like threats.
lord_varys Who threatened you?
tyrion_lannister I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
lord_varys Ned Stark was a man of honor.
tyrion_lannister And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
lord_varys You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
cersei_lannister “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
tyrion_lannister You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.
cersei_lannister You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
alton_lannister I will, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
alton_lannister I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.
alton_lannister I will, Your Grace.
tyrion_lannister Safe travels, cousin.
tyrion_lannister You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
cersei_lannister If that's everything?
grand_maester_pycelle . A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
lord_varys Trouble with the wildlings?
petyr_baelish That's why they're called wildlings.
lord_varys Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
cersei_lannister Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.
tyrion_lannister Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
cersei_lannister Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
tyrion_lannister Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.
grand_maester_pycelle The northerners are a superstitious people.
tyrion_lannister According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie.
lord_varys How do you kill a dead man?
tyrion_lannister Apparently you burn him.
cersei_lannister One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
tyrion_lannister I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
cersei_lannister I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
eddison_tollett Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.
grenn We fart when we die?
eddison_tollett My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
samwell_tarly Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?
eddison_tollett We were having a serious discussion.
grenn Would you look at that.
samwell_tarly Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
grenn I prefer watching them come towards me.
samwell_tarly I'm sure that's nice too.
grenn Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed.
samwell_tarly You were with her? How many times?
grenn Well, as many times as I could.
samwell_tarly Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
eddison_tollett We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.
samwell_tarly No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?
gilly You shouldn't touch me.
samwell_tarly Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. .
gilly You're very brave.
jon_snow What’re you doing?
samwell_tarly This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.
jon_snow Hello, Gilly. What’re you doing?
gilly Sam said you could help.
jon_snow I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -
samwell_tarly She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave.
jon_snow What? .
samwell_tarly I know it sounds a bit mad.
jon_snow No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
samwell_tarly The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -
jon_snow Sam we can't take her -
gilly Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.
jon_snow It's just not possible.
gilly I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…
jon_snow If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.
samwell_tarly Why did you do that?
jon_snow Do what, ask her a question?
samwell_tarly You were cruel.
jon_snow Cruel?! Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
samwell_tarly I didn't touch her!
jon_snow No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
samwell_tarly I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.
jon_snow We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
samwell_tarly I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
jon_snow I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.
jorah_mormont Khaleesi.
jorah_mormont You don't need to see this.
daenerys_targaryen He is blood of my blood.
daenerys_targaryen Who did this?
jorah_mormont Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.
daenerys_targaryen They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
irri No! They killed his soul!
daenerys_targaryen Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
irri They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
daenerys_targaryen Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
daenerys_targaryen And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Is it as you remember my lord?
theon_greyjoy . Looks smaller.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.
theon_greyjoy . They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Who will?
theon_greyjoy Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I love the cold and wet.
theon_greyjoy They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Then you'll be king before long.
theon_greyjoy . Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
theon_greyjoy . I don't blame him.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-
theon_greyjoy Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
theon_greyjoy Your place is on this ship.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
theon_greyjoy I haven't paid you.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.
petyr_baelish One moment, my friend. A moment.
petyr_baelish Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
ros I’m sorry, my lord.
petyr_baelish Shhh. Did he hurt you?
ros No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen.
petyr_baelish Who?
ros She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.
petyr_baelish Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
ros Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.
petyr_baelish You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy? . That makes me happy.
podrick_payne More wine?
janos_slynt Damn it, boy!
podrick_payne Apologies, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
janos_slynt . Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
tyrion_lannister Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
janos_slynt Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?
tyrion_lannister You know your wines, my lord.
janos_slynt That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
janos_slynt Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
tyrion_lannister Wars have been started for less.
tyrion_lannister I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
janos_slynt Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.
tyrion_lannister Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
janos_slynt Orders are orders.
tyrion_lannister Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
janos_slynt I never said they were the queen's orders.
tyrion_lannister No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.
janos_slynt You know your sister better than I do.
tyrion_lannister You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
janos_slynt I don't listen to filth.
tyrion_lannister That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
janos_slynt Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. .
tyrion_lannister I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me. When your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?
janos_slynt I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
tyrion_lannister The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
janos_slynt Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
tyrion_lannister I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.
janos_slynt You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.
tyrion_lannister Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
tyrion_lannister I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
janos_slynt What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
tyrion_lannister The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
janos_slynt We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
tyrion_lannister No, we shan't.
tyrion_lannister There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.
bronn The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
janos_slynt These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
tyrion_lannister His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
bronn Boys?
janos_slynt I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
tyrion_lannister To the new Commander.
tyrion_lannister If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?
bronn Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
lommy_greenhands If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.
hot_pie I'm not afraid of no battles.
arya_stark If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
hot_pie I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
arya_stark Liar.
hot_pie I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
lommy_greenhands Two men fighting isn't a battle.
hot_pie They had armor on.
arya_stark So?
hot_pie So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
lommy_greenhands No, it isn't.
hot_pie What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
arya_stark . Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
hot_pie It's when they've got armor on.
gendry Now who told you that.
hot_pie A knight?
gendry How'd you know he was a knight?
hot_pie Well, cause he got armor on.
gendry You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
hot_pie How'd you know?
gendry ‘Cause I sold armor.
arya_stark What do the gold cloaks want with you?
gendry No idea.
arya_stark You're a liar.
gendry . You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
arya_stark Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
gendry . No good's ever come of their questions.
arya_stark No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
gendry How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
arya_stark Who asked questions?
gendry The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.
arya_stark Lord Stark.
gendry See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
arya_stark What did they ask about?
gendry My mom.
arya_stark Who's your mom?
gendry Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
arya_stark And who was your father?
gendry He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?
arya_stark I'm not a girl!
gendry . Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
arya_stark Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.
gendry That's true. You're still a girl.
arya_stark I am not!
gendry Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.
arya_stark I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know. No one can know.
gendry They won't. Not from me.
arya_stark My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
gendry He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
arya_stark He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
gendry So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
arya_stark No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -
gendry You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.
arya_stark Do not call me milady.
gendry As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 What you carrying?
theon_greyjoy Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
theon_greyjoy I need to get to Pyke.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I'll find you a horse.
yara_greyjoy I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
theon_greyjoy I bet you can.
yara_greyjoy You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
theon_greyjoy None like you.
yara_greyjoy You don't know what I'm like.
theon_greyjoy You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
yara_greyjoy You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
theon_greyjoy Have my things sent up to the castle.
theon_greyjoy You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.
yara_greyjoy Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
theon_greyjoy Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
yara_greyjoy You'll never be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
theon_greyjoy I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.
yara_greyjoy Is that an offer from my future king?
theon_greyjoy An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.
yara_greyjoy I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
theon_greyjoy Father.
balon_greyjoy Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?
theon_greyjoy A man. Your blood and your heir.
balon_greyjoy We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
theon_greyjoy Lord Stark is gone.
balon_greyjoy And how do you feel about that?
theon_greyjoy What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
balon_greyjoy Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
theon_greyjoy If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
balon_greyjoy It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
theon_greyjoy Gold.
balon_greyjoy I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
theon_greyjoy . My blood is salt and iron.
balon_greyjoy Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.
theon_greyjoy The offer he makes, is one I proposed.
balon_greyjoy He heeds your counsel?
theon_greyjoy I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.
balon_greyjoy No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?
theon_greyjoy I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
balon_greyjoy I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
theon_greyjoy I will lead the attack myself.
balon_greyjoy Oh, you will?
theon_greyjoy I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
theon_greyjoy I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
yara_greyjoy Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
balon_greyjoy . My dear.
theon_greyjoy Yara?
yara_greyjoy So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
theon_greyjoy She can't lead an attack!
balon_greyjoy And why not?
theon_greyjoy You're a woman!
yara_greyjoy You're the one in skirts.
balon_greyjoy This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.
goupe#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 . What's dead may never die.
balon_greyjoy . No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
theon_greyjoy You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
balon_greyjoy Who said anything about the Lannisters?
davos_seaworth You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
salladhor_saan All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?
davos_seaworth Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
salladhor_saan And yet, they both have larger armies.
davos_seaworth Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
salladhor_saan What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
matthos_seaworth Mind your words, pirate. .
davos_seaworth Matthos.
salladhor_saan You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
davos_seaworth Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.
salladhor_saan That's a promise that always comes true.
davos_seaworth As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong
salladhor_saan Only the clever ones.
davos_seaworth You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
salladhor_saan Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
davos_seaworth It is. .
salladhor_saan One thing, I want the queen.
davos_seaworth The queen?
salladhor_saan Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.
matthos_seaworth This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
salladhor_saan I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.
matthos_seaworth As if she would just let you!
salladhor_saan You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
matthos_seaworth Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.
salladhor_saan I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.
salladhor_saan I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
davos_seaworth He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
matthos_seaworth You believe your king can win?
davos_seaworth He is the one true king.
salladhor_saan You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.
davos_seaworth Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
matthos_seaworth When will the King have a sail?
davos_seaworth As soon as his God wills it.
matthos_seaworth He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read.
davos_seaworth Oh you and your mother.
matthos_seaworth It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
davos_seaworth I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!
matthos_seaworth But you always came home.
davos_seaworth I wasn't praying.
matthos_seaworth . But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.
davos_seaworth You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.
matthos_seaworth . Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
davos_seaworth Don't tell him that.
servant#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 More, my Lord?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Yes.
howland#NONEXT So your mother went to see King Renly?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 So it would seem. Soon enough, there will be more Kings then Kingdoms.
howland#NONEXT If your brother allied with Renly Baratheon with the Reach allied with him, we would be unstoppable.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Somehow I doubt Renly Baratheon will be okay with The North being a free and independent Kingdom.
howland#NONEXT Worst case scenario, we can declare for Renly. Renly is better than Joffrey. Even if the man is... queer.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 We've made something for ourselves that night. The Kingdom of the North. We will not give it up for Renly Baratheon.
howland#NONEXT You've heard of him, haven't you? What he does?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I've heard rumors. If Renly favors the company of boys, so be it. If he doesn't have an heir, Stannis will inherit the Throne.
howland#NONEXT Perhaps Stannis has a chance at the Throne.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 He'll try to fight for the Throne. But he won't win. Renly has the Reach at his side, and if my Mother does well, he'll have us. What does Stannis have? A red woman whispering in his hear?
howland#NONEXT A red woman? What?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I've heard he has a red priestess giving him counsel. I've never met a red priestess. But I've heard the one that's in Stannis' company is quite beautiful.
howland#NONEXT You have a thing for fanatics?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 I have a thing for any woman who has a great body and a pretty face. What they involve themselves in does not concern me... unless it is extremely foul.
howland#NONEXT Listen, I wanted to ask you something...
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 What is it?
howland#NONEXT I've heard men talk about you... some men around here hate you.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 Story of my life.
howland#NONEXT What the fuck they hate you for? What have you done? The word about you has always been strange.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 The same reason my father didn't want me inheriting his titles if I ever came to be the Lord of Winterfell.
howland#NONEXT You going to tell me or are you gonna be fucking mysterious?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 A story for another time.
howland#NONEXT Why?
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode02 It's not your fucking concern, that's why.
cersei_lannister Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
tyrion_lannister I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
cersei_lannister You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
tyrion_lannister Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?
cersei_lannister Ha, the people. You think I care?
tyrion_lannister You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it.
tyrion_lannister It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.
cersei_lannister He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.
tyrion_lannister I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.
cersei_lannister I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me.
tyrion_lannister . As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.
cersei_lannister You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.
tyrion_lannister She was my mother too.
cersei_lannister Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. .
davos_seaworth Your Grace.
matthos_seaworth Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon How did it fare with your pirate?
davos_seaworth Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
stannis_baratheon In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
davos_seaworth Does seem the wiser choice.
stannis_baratheon It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
davos_seaworth Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.
stannis_baratheon Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.
davos_seaworth At once, Your Grace.
melisandre The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.
davos_seaworth Come.
stannis_baratheon What did you say to him?
melisandre I told him death by fire is the purest death.
stannis_baratheon Why?
melisandre Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
stannis_baratheon Yeah.
melisandre These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
stannis_baratheon Tell your lord to burn them then.
melisandre I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
stannis_baratheon My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
melisandre You must have faith.
stannis_baratheon Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.
melisandre Then we must be the ten.
stannis_baratheon I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.
melisandre I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
stannis_baratheon I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.
melisandre You must give... all of yourself.
stannis_baratheon I have a wife. I took a vow.
melisandre She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King.
stannis_baratheon . A son?
