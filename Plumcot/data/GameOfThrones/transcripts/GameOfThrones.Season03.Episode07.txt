GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How far are we?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown About a week, I think.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t know?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When we went to Castle Black, we took the King’s Road.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You and your roads.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that how you lot do your fighting?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Most of the time, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How do the men holding the banners fight?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They don’t, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s a great honour to carry your house sigil.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And the drummers…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that a great honour, too?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Usually it’s the young boys banging the drums.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So, what good are they?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They help the men march.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, it’s…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s the rhythm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What, you need help remembering that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won’t be banging on drums to let them know we’re coming.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No, you’re just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you’re coming.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You know nothing, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’s right, you don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Cut her loose, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Do you see her sulking about it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That’s because she understands the way things are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And are you gonna share it with me, the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown People work together when it suits them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They’re loyal when it suits them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They love each other when it suits them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And they kill each other when it suits them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She knows that, you don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Which is why you’ll never hold on to her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That rain will cost us another day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Frey will wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He knows we’re coming.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “Prickly”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That what you call it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Might be the least pleasant man I’ve ever met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, and that is why…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Apologies, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve spent two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not afraid of wet shits.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He can take it as he likes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s getting the wedding he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s getting a wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It was a king he wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We should all get some sleep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If you don’t put some clothes on, I can’t promise I won’t attack you again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Attack.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Attack.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who are you writing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that Valyrian?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Gaaa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “Gaaa”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Say hello for me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Rytsas.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “Ritsas.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ” That was close enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Does she know her daughter’s a queen?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not yet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That will be a surprise, I expect.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Many surprises for her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you’re over there, looking like that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Will you come with me one day to Volantis?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When all this is over?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I promise.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I know she’d love to meet you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And her grandchild.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What, now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Are you certain?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Are you angry with me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Angry?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re my queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Maybe one of each.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t get greedy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Can you leave the war for one night?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I love you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Do you hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I love you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Most men fuck like dogs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No grace, no skill.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A few dozen thrusts, and done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You need to be patient.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Give her time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your cock shouldn’t go near her till she’s slick as a baby seal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And then you go inside, but slowly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t jam it in like you’re spearing a pig.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Hey, come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think he loves you, is that it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What did he tell you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No, he didn’t tell me anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He barely talks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What, you’re jealous?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Of course I’m jealous.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You should be with one of your own.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And you’re one of my own?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve never heard a kind word from your mouth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You would if you were mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’d tell you that you’re beautiful and fierce and wild.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’d be good to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You love him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ‘Cause he’s pretty?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t touch me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You won’t love him so much when you find out what he really is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown See the southern knights and their painted armour and King’s Landing after dark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All the candles burning in all those windows.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m stupid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Come walk with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’d never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You would have been happy at Highgarden, but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How do I make the best of my circumstances?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I have to marry him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Has he been kind to you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s tried.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t want him, though.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn’t you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Here I am complaining to you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My son will be king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Sons learn from their mothers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I plan to teach mine a great deal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And your son, if I’m not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My son…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown With him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ll have to…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’ll have to…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If it’s the pain you’re worried about…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not afraid of the pain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not after what Joffrey’s done to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What is it, then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s rather goodlooking, even with the scar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Especially with the scar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s a dwarf.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And Loras…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Some women like tall men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Some like short men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Some like hairy men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Some like bald men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Most women don’t know what they like until they’ve tried it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we’re old and grey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tyrion may surprise you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown From what I’ve heard, he’s quite experienced.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And that’s a good thing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It can be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’re very complicated, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Pleasing us takes practice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How do you know all this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Did your mother teach you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, sweet girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My mother taught me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’s a child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’s a foot taller than you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A tall child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s the youngest you’ve ever had?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not that young.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How much older?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Older.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re a lord, she’s a lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And a beauty, at that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t see the problem.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Shae isn’t going to like it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Shae is a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Are you gonna marry her, eh?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I should never have told you about that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You want Shae, keep her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Wed one and bed the other.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’ll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You can rule the North in his name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’ll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You waste time trying to get people to love you, you’ll end up the most popular dead man in town.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You want to fuck that Stark girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You just don’t want to admit it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t pay you to put evil notions in my head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The ones already there don’t need company.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You pay me to kill people who bother you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Evil notions come free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Grandfather.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You wanted to speak to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’d like a report on the meetings of my Small Council.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re welcome to attend the meetings of your Small Council, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Any or all of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve been very busy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Many important matters require a king’s attention.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’ve been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the Small Council chamber.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I have, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown May I ask why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, the Tower of the Hand is where I work.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We could arrange to have you carried.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Where did you hear about this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is it true?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Apparently so.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t you think we ought to do something about it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When I was Hand of the King under your father’s predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The skull of the last of them was right here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It was the size of an apple.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died years ago.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counselling the King on matters about which he knows nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But I haven’t been counselled.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You are being counselled at this very moment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I should be consulted about such things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yunkai.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The Yellow City.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We can defeat them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown On the field, with ease.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But they won’t meet us on the field.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If they’re wise, they’ll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t want half my army killed before I’ve crossed the Narrow Sea.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We don’t need Yunkai, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ,, if not more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Then we have , reasons to take the city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Send a man to the city gates.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honourable house, Master of Men and Speaker to Savages, to offer terms of peace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You may approach.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Sit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Will the noble lord take refreshment?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Many an army has broken against our walls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You shall find no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My Unsullied need practice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I was told to blood them early.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ‘Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor, but the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the Silver Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My ship?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown As I said, we are a generous people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You shall have as many ships as you require.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And what do you ask in return?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All we ask is that you make use of these ships.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Sail them back to Westeros where you belong, and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I have a gift for you as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My life?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And the lives of your wise masters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But I also want something in return.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You will release every slave in Yunkai.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You are mad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We are not Astapor or Qarth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We are Yunkai, and we have powerful friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Perhaps we’ll make a slave of you as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You swore me safe conduct.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I did, but my dragons made no promises.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And you threatened their mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Take the gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You gave it to me, remember?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And I shall put it to good use.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’d be wise to do the same with my gift to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Now get out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The Yunkish are a proud people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They will not bend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And what happens to things that don’t bend?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He said he had powerful friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who was he talking about?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Find out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Chains?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Smithed in Casterly Rock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Golden chains.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You could buy a ship with these.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Do I need a ship?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Am I going somewhere?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Of course you’re not going anywhere.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So, am I invited to your wedding?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I didn’t ask for this marriage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I didn’t want it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’s a beautiful girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You said so yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That doesn’t mean that…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown This is duty, not desire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t have a choice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My father…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Does not rule the world.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What would I do there?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Juggle?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And I’m Shae the funny whore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My feelings for you have not changed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you’re bored?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I swear to you, it will not be like that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What will it be like?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Any children we might have will be well provided for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Children?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think I want children who can never see their father?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Listen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Listen to me, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not your lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’ll always be my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m your whore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What happened?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Wildfire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I should have been here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Do you miss it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown King’s Landing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your father’s house.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Never had a father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Never wanted one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Haven’t you ever wondered where your strength came from?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your talent for fighting?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m lowborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown As low as can be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My mother was a tavern wench.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Mine was a slave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So was I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand, and raised me up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I was born in Flea Bottom.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your blood is noble.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Are you saying my father, he was some lord or…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown There.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your father’s house.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m just a bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown There is power in a king’s blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Come sit by the fire, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not talking, eh?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That’s a first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t talk to traitors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I didn’t like giving up the boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But you did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You took the gold and you gave him up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The Red God is the one true god.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’ve seen his power.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When he commands, we obey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s not my one true god.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who’s yours?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Death.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How many?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No more than .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How far?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Less than a day’s ride south.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What do you say, boys?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Time for a lion hunt?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yeah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But what about Riverrun?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s not south.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s west of here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It will still be west of here two days from now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You swore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown To take you home, and I will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But we need to do this first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So you can steal their gold?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I swear to you, this isn’t…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t care what you swear because you’re a liar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’ll lie to anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown One day you’ll understand, but now…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Anguy, bring her back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Come back, girl!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Kick all you like, wolf girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Won’t do you no good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I thought you were gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tomorrow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Bolton’s travelling tomorrow as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s going to the Twins for Edmure Tully’s wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re to remain here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown With Locke?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I owe you a debt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Now it’s your promise.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You gave your word.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Keep it and consider the debt paid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I will return the Stark girls to their mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I swear it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Goodbye, Ser Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Let me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It will take time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My father will make him grand maester if he grows me a new hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tell Robb Stark I’m sorry I couldn’t make his uncle’s wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The Lannisters send their regards.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Safe journey, Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Nothing to say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I liked you better before.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t remember chopping your balls off, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t you worry about your friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’ll take good care of her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Gentle, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Gentle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Myranda knows what she’s doing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Let her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She trained as a septa, only…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She had other urges.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So did the septons, only they lied about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Where is he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown There’s no one here but you, me, and Violet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t you want us to see it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh, come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Let us see it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Everybody talks about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who sent you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who sent us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We heard so much about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown There it is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Do you think we’re ugly?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He thinks we’re ugly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, he’s been through so much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Look at his poor face.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Help me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If he comes back…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We need to make him feel better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And how can we make him feel better?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I have an idea.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Aw!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’s shy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You know how they are, these religious girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Maybe he doesn’t know how we are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I felt something.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown As good as they say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And why should you get all the fun?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You like her better?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Plenty there for both of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I was here first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Terrible timing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But I was getting jealous.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Should we see this cock everyone’s always going on about?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Everyone knows you love girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I bet you always thought they loved you back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your famous cock must be very precious to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Would you say it’s your most precious part?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Mercy, please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please, mercy!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Mercy!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown This is mercy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not killing you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Just making a few alterations.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please, no!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No, please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re gonna scare it off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not gonna scare it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m gonna kill it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s too far away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that a palace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s a windmill.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Windmill.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Who built it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Some king?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Just the men who used to live here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Winterfell has towers three times that size.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “Oh, I’m Jon Snow and I’m from Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “My daddy was a fancy lord “and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ” If you’re impressed by a windmill, you’d be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s swooning?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Fainting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s fainting?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When a girl sees blood and collapses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not all girls are like you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, girls see more blood than boys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh, a spider!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Save me, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’d like to see you in a silk dress.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Would you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So I could tear it off you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I’ll blacken your eye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Maybe one day I’ll take you to Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Or maybe one day I’ll take you there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown After we’ve taken our land back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Ygritte.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You won’t win.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You know nothing…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Six times in the last thousand years, a KingbeyondtheWall has attacked the kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Six times they failed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And how do you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Every boy in the North knows it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We grow up learning it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Where the battles were fought, the heroes, who died where.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Six times you’ve invaded and six times you’ve failed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The seventh will be the same.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Mance is different.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t have the discipline.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t have the training.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your army is no army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t know how to fight together.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t know that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I know it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown If you attack the Wall, you’ll die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All of you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re mine as I’m yours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And if we die, we die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But first we’ll live.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, first we’ll live.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s he going on about?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That’s where we are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What are you telling him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s all right, Osha.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s not all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think I can’t hear you every day?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Filling his head with black magic.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Talking about visions and threeeyed ravens and worse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Leave him alone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He can speak for himself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t fill his head with anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So, what do you talk about?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s happening to him and what that means.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Go on, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Tell us what it means.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It’s not like that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I wish I could tell him all the answers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It would be much easier.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t want you talking to him any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’re not going to Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What did you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I told you already.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Jon Snow isn’t there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Oh, no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’m not going back there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Your brother is at Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That’s where we’re going.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Look at me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The raven’s been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He wants me to find him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t have my legs any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown This is what I have now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You have a family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them, where you belong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What if I belong in the North?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Is that what he’s telling you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That it’s all for a reason?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All these bad things happened because the Gods got big plans for you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I wish it were true, little lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But the Gods wouldn’t spare a raven’s cold shit for you or me or anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown None of you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown None of you have been up there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I had a man once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A good man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Bruni, his name was.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I was his and he was mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown But one night Bruni disappears.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown People said he left me, but I knew him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’d never leave me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not for long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I knew he’d come back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And he did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He came in through the back of the hut.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Only it wasn’t Bruni.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown His skin was pale like a dead man’s.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown His eyes bluer than clear sky.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t know how I got the knife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And he hardly seemed to notice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I had to burn our hut down with him inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I didn’t ask the Gods what it meant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I didn’t need to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I already knew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown It meant the North was no place for men to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Not any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I promised your maester I’d get you to Castle Black and no further.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How is the pain, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What’s the purpose of an arm with no hand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, we’ve stymied the corruption.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Yes, we’ve stymied the corruption.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re a learned man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All the good it’s done me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You did well sewing up this mess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You’re far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Faint praise, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So, why did the Citadel take your chain?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Did you fondle one boy too many?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown No, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown That’s not my weakness.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What is?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Curiosity.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The only way to treat disease is to understand disease, and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You performed experiments on living men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown On dying men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown With their permission?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Dying paupers, I assume.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Men with no families to complain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown How many men have you killed, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown ?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Countless.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown “Countless” has a nice ring to it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And how many lives have you saved?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Half a million.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The population of King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Did you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Did you get a bird off to Brienne’s father in Tarth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A bird flew off and a bird flew back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Selwyn Tarth offered gold dragons for his daughter’s safe return.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A fair offer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A fair offer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Locke won’t take it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He’s convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown He feels he’s being cheated.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown They’d be fools to kill her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown These men have been at war a long time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Most of them will be dead by winter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She’ll be their entertainment tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Beyond tonight, I don’t think they care very much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We have to return to Harrenhal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve left something behind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Absolutely not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ve got orders from Lord Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And what are those orders?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown To deliver you to your father at King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think you’ll get a reward.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I serve Lord Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Any appreciation your father…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You think you’re getting a reward.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Let me explain something to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown When my father sees me, the first thing he’s going to ask is what happened to my hand, and I’m going to tell him this man chopped it off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I had nothing…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Or I could tell him this man saved my life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We return to Harrenhal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Eyes open, lads.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Be quiet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelt that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair Don’t spare her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Don’t spare her!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, this is one shameful fucking performance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Stop running and fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown A wooden sword?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I thought you’d gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown You gave her a wooden sword!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’ve only got one bear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I’ll pay her bloody ransom.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Just get her out of there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown This makes me happier than all your gold ever could.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Get behind me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown I will not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King’s Landing alive, and that’s what I aim to do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Pull her up!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Hold my legs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Pull him up!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown The bitch stays.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown We’re taking her to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Unless you kill me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown She belongs to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Lord Bolton’s orders.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Well, we must be on our way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode07 #unknown Sorry about the sapphires.
