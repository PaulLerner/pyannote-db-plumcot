wedding_band How do the men holding the banners fight
pit_announcer They don't, really It's a great honor to carry your house sigil
wedding_band And the drummers-- is that a great honor, too
pit_announcer Usually it's the young boys banging the drums
wedding_band So what good are they
pit_announcer They help the men march
wedding_band How
pit_announcer Well, it's-- it's the rhythm
wedding_band Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot You need help remembering that When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming
pit_announcer No No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming
wedding_band You know nothing, Jon Snow
grand_maester_pycelle She's right, you don't
pit_announcer I know you cut me loose on the Wall
grand_maester_pycelle Cut her loose, too Do you see her sulking about it That's because she understands the way things are
pit_announcer And are you gonna share it with me The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird
grand_maester_pycelle People work together when it suits them They're loyal when it suits them They love each other when it suits them And they kill each other when it suits them She knows that, you don't Which is why you'll never hold onto her
vayon_poole That rain will cost us another day

maester_caleotte Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight
qhono He can take it as he likes He's getting the wedding he wanted
maester_caleotte He's getting a wedding It was a king he wanted
brothel_child_1 Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house We should all get some sleep

morag Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark-- all the candles burning in all those windows I'm stupid A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns
captured_wight Come on Come walk with me
captured_wight I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother
captured_wight You would have been happy at Highgarden But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances
morag How do I make the best of my circumstances I have to marry him
captured_wight Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you
morag No
captured_wight Has he been kind to you
morag He's tried
captured_wight You don't want him, though
morag He's a Lannister
captured_wight Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say
morag I'm sorry Here I am complaining to you
captured_wight My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers I plan to teach mine a great deal And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday What
morag My son with him I'll have to-- we'll have to--
captured_wight If it's the pain you're worried about--
morag I'm not afraid of the pain Not after what Joffrey's done to me
captured_wight What is it, then He's rather good-looking even with the scar Especially with the scar
morag He's a dwarf And Loras-- Loras
captured_wight Some women like tall men Some like short men Some like hairy men Some like bald men Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray Tyrion may surprise you From what I've heard, he's quite experienced
morag And that's a good thing
captured_wight It can be We're very complicated, you know Pleasing us takes practice
morag How do you know all this Did your mother teach you
captured_wight Yes, sweet girl My mother taught me
rickard_stark She's a child
irri She's a foot taller than you
rickard_stark A tall child
irri What's the youngest you've ever had
rickard_stark Not that young
irri How much older
rickard_stark Older
irri You're a lord, she's a lady And a beauty at that I don't see the problem
rickard_stark Shae isn't going to like it
irri Shae is a whore Are you gonna marry her Eh How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time
rickard_stark I should never have told you about that
irri You want Shae, keep her Wed one and bed the other All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day You can rule the North in his name You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own
rickard_stark Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them
irri You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town  You want to fuck that Stark girl You just don't want to admit it
rickard_stark I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head The ones already there don't need company
irri You pay me to kill people who bother you Evil notions come free
eddard_stark Your Grace
glover_general Grandfather
eddard_stark You wanted to speak to me
glover_general Yes I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council
eddard_stark You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace Any or all of them
glover_general I've been very busy Many important matters require a king's attention
eddard_stark Of course
glover_general You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber
eddard_stark I have, yes
glover_general May I ask why
eddard_stark The Tower of the Hand is where I work To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively
glover_general So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand
eddard_stark We could arrange to have you carried
glover_general Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons
eddard_stark Where did you hear about this
glover_general Is it true
eddard_stark Apparently so
glover_general Don't you think we ought to do something about it
eddard_stark When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room The skull of the last of them was right here It was the size of an apple
glover_general And the biggest was the size of a carriage
eddard_stark Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us
glover_general But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel
eddard_stark Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing
glover_general But I haven't been counseled
eddard_stark You are being counseled at this very moment
glover_general I should be consulted about such things
eddard_stark From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary Your Grace
rast Yunkai The Yellow City
bear_island_maester The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers We can defeat them
rast On the field, with ease But they won't meet us on the field They have provisions, patience, and strong walls If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man
ghita I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea
rast We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne
ghita How many slaves are there in Yunkai
rast 200,000 if not more
ghita Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city
ghita Send a man to the city gates Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor  GREY WORM
great_master_4 Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace
great_master_4 Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons
ghita You may approach Sit
great_master_4 Will the noble lord take refreshment
razdal_mo_eraz Ancient and glorious is Yunkai Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria Many an army has broken against our walls You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi
ghita Good My Unsullied need practice I was told to blood them early
razdal_mo_eraz If blood is your desire, blood shall flow But why 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people
razdal_mo_eraz The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen
razdal_mo_eraz There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship
ghita My ship
razdal_mo_eraz Yes, khaleesi As I said, we are a generous people You shall have as many ships as you require
ghita And what do you ask in return
razdal_mo_eraz All we ask is that you make use of these ships Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace
ghita I have a gift for you as well Your life
razdal_mo_eraz My life
ghita And the lives of your wise masters But I also want something in return You will release every slave in Yunkai Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy
razdal_mo_eraz You are mad We are not Astapor or Qarth We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you Those who survive, we shall enslave once more Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well
razdal_mo_eraz You swore me safe conduct
ghita I did, but my dragons made no promises And you threatened their mother
razdal_mo_eraz Take the gold
ghita My gold You gave it to me, remember And I shall put it to good use You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you Now get out
bear_island_maester The Yunkish are a proud people They will not bend
ghita And what happens to things that don't bend He said he had powerful friends Who was he talking about
rast I don't know
ghita Find out

beric_dondarrion Children You think I want children who can never see their father Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them
rickard_stark Listen Listen to me, my lady
beric_dondarrion I'm not your lady
rickard_stark You are You'll always be my lady

knight Well, this is one shameful fucking performance Stop running and fight
eyrie_guard A wooden sword
knight I thought you'd gone
eyrie_guard You gave her a wooden sword
knight We've only got one bear
eyrie_guard I'll pay her bloody ransom Gold, sapphires, whatever you want Just get her out of there
knight All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold
knight This makes me happier than all your gold ever could And that makes me happier than all her sapphires So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it
prendahl_na_ghezn Ah!
eyrie_guard Get behind me
prendahl_na_ghezn I will not
knight What the fuck are you doing to my bear
steelshanks_walton Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do
eyrie_guard Pull her up
prendahl_na_ghezn Hold my legs
prendahl_na_ghezn Pull him up!
knight The bitch stays
eyrie_guard We're taking her to King's Landing Unless you kill me
knight She belongs to me Lord Bolton's orders
eyrie_guard What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive
eyrie_guard Well, we must be on our way Sorry about the sapphires
