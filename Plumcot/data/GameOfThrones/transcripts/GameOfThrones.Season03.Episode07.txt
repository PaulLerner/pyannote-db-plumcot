ygritte How far are we?
jon_snow About a week, I think.
ygritte You think? You don't know?
jon_snow When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.
ygritte You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
jon_snow Most of the time, yes.
ygritte How do the men holding the banners fight?
jon_snow They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.
ygritte And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?
jon_snow Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
ygritte So what good are they?
jon_snow They help the men march.
ygritte How?
jon_snow Well, it's- it's the rhythm.
ygritte Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.
jon_snow No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.
ygritte You know nothing, jon Snow.
orell She's right, you don't.
jon_snow I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
orell Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.
jon_snow And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
orell People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her.
brynden_tully That rain will cost us another day.
robb_stark Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
catelyn_stark Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
brynden_tully Prickly?  That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
catelyn_stark Yes, and that is why-
brynden_tully I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
talisa_stark I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits.
catelyn_stark Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
edmure_tully He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
catelyn_stark He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
robb_stark edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
robb_stark If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.
talisa_stark Attack. Attack.
robb_stark Who are you writing?
talisa_stark My mother.
robb_stark Is that Valyrian?
talisa_stark Gaaa.
robb_stark Gaaa?  Say hello for me.
talisa_stark Rytsas.
robb_stark 'Ritsas.'
talisa_stark That was close enough.
robb_stark Does she know her daughter's a queen?
talisa_stark Not yet.
robb_stark That will be a surprise, I expect.
talisa_stark Many surprises for her.
robb_stark How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
talisa_stark Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?
robb_stark I will.
talisa_stark I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
robb_stark What, now? Are you certain?
talisa_stark Are you angry with me?
robb_stark Angry? You're my queen.
talisa_stark And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
robb_stark Maybe one of each.
talisa_stark Don't get greedy.
talisa_stark Can you leave the war for one night?
robb_stark I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
tormund_giantsbane Most men fuck like dogs.
tormund_giantsbane No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.  Come on! Hey, come on.
orell You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
ygritte No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.
orell I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
ygritte What, you're jealous?
orell Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
ygritte And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
orell You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
orell 'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
ygritte Don't touch me.
orell You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
sansa_stark Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
margaery_tyrell Come on. Come walk with me.
margaery_tyrell I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, sansa, and so does my grandmother.
margaery_tyrell You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
sansa_stark How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
margaery_tyrell Has Lord tyrion_lannister mistreated you?
sansa_stark No.
margaery_tyrell Has he been kind to you?
sansa_stark He's tried.
margaery_tyrell You don't want him, though.
sansa_stark He's a Lannister.
margaery_tyrell Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?
sansa_stark I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
margaery_tyrell My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?
sansa_stark My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
margaery_tyrell If it's the pain you're worried about-
sansa_stark I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what joffrey_baratheon's done to me.
margaery_tyrell What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.
sansa_stark He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
margaery_tyrell Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.
sansa_stark And that's a good thing?
margaery_tyrell It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.
sansa_stark How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
margaery_tyrell Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.
tyrion_lannister She's a child.
bronn She's a foot taller than you.
tyrion_lannister A tall child.
bronn What's the youngest you've ever had?
tyrion_lannister Not that young.
bronn How much older?
tyrion_lannister Older.
bronn You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.
tyrion_lannister Shae isn't going to like it.
bronn Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
tyrion_lannister I should never have told you about that.
bronn You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
tyrion_lannister Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
bronn You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.  You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.
tyrion_lannister I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
bronn You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
tywin_lannister Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Grandfather.
tywin_lannister You wanted to speak to me?
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
tywin_lannister You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
tywin_lannister Of course.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
tywin_lannister I have, yes.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy May I ask why?
tywin_lannister The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
tywin_lannister We could arrange to have you carried.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
tywin_lannister Where did you hear about this?
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Is it true?
tywin_lannister Apparently so.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
tywin_lannister When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
tywin_lannister Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
tywin_lannister Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy But I haven't been counseled.
tywin_lannister You are being counseled at this very moment.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy I should be consulted about such things.
tywin_lannister From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.
jorah_mormont Yunkai. The Yellow City.
barristan_selmy The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.
jorah_mormont On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
daenerys_targaryen I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
jorah_mormont We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
daenerys_targaryen How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
jorah_mormont Two hundred thousand if not more.
daenerys_targaryen Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
daenerys_targaryen Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.
missandei Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.
missandei Noble lord, you are in the presence of daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
daenerys_targaryen You may approach. Sit.
missandei Will the noble lord take refreshment?
radzal_mo_eraz Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
radzal_mo_eraz If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
radzal_mo_eraz The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
radzal_mo_eraz There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
daenerys_targaryen My ship?
radzal_mo_eraz Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.
daenerys_targaryen And what do you ask in return?
radzal_mo_eraz All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
daenerys_targaryen I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
radzal_mo_eraz My life?
daenerys_targaryen And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
radzal_mo_eraz You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
radzal_mo_eraz You swore me safe conduct.
daenerys_targaryen I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.
radzal_mo_eraz Take the gold.
daenerys_targaryen My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.
barristan_selmy The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
daenerys_targaryen And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
jorah_mormont I don't know.
daenerys_targaryen Find out.
shae Chains?
tyrion_lannister Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
shae Golden chains.
tyrion_lannister You could buy a ship with these.
shae Do I need a ship?
tyrion_lannister What?
shae Am I going somewhere?
tyrion_lannister Of course you're not going anywhere.
shae So, am I invited to your wedding?
tyrion_lannister I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
shae No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
tyrion_lannister That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.
shae Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
tyrion_lannister I don't have a choice. My father-
shae Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
tyrion_lannister What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
shae And I'm Shae the funny whore.
tyrion_lannister My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry sansa_stark Stark and do my duty by her.
shae While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
tyrion_lannister I swear to you it will not be like that.
shae No? What will it be like?
tyrion_lannister I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.
shae Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
tyrion_lannister Listen. Listen to me, my lady.
shae I'm not your lady.
tyrion_lannister You are. You'll always be my lady.
shae I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
gendry What happened?
melisandre Wildfire. I should have been here.
gendry After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
melisandre Do you miss it?
gendry King's Landing?
melisandre Your father's house.
gendry Never had a father. Never wanted one.
melisandre Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
gendry I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
melisandre Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and bran_starkded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.
gendry I was born in Flea Bottom.
melisandre Your blood is noble.
gendry Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-
melisandre There. Your father's house.
gendry I'm just a bastard.
melisandre The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.
beric_dondarrion Come sit by the fire, child.
thoros Not talking, eh? That's a first.
arya_stark I don't talk to traitors.
beric_dondarrion I didn't like giving up the boy.
arya_stark But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
beric_dondarrion The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey.
arya_stark He's not my one true god.
beric_dondarrion No? Who's yours?
arya_stark Death.
anguy Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
beric_dondarrion How many?
anguy No more than twenty.
beric_dondarrion How far?
anguy Less than a day's ride south.
thoros What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?
men Yeah!
arya_stark But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
thoros It will still be west of here two days from now.
arya_stark You swore.
beric_dondarrion To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first.
arya_stark Why? So you can steal their gold?
beric_dondarrion I swear to you, this isn't-
arya_stark I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
beric_dondarrion One day you'll understand, but now-
beric_dondarrion Anguy, bring her back.
man Come back, girl!
sandor_clegane Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good.
brienne_of_tarth I thought you were gone.
jaime_lannister Tomorrow.
brienne_of_tarth Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
jaime_lannister Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for edmure_tully Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
brienne_of_tarth With Locke?
jaime_lannister I owe you a debt.
brienne_of_tarth When catelyn_stark Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.
jaime_lannister I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
brienne_of_tarth Good-bye, Ser jaime.
qyburn Here. Let me.
qyburn It will take time.
roose_bolton Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
jaime_lannister My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
roose_bolton You will give my regards to Lord tywin, I trust?
jaime_lannister Tell robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
locke Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.
myranda Shh.
violet Gentle, my lord. Gentle.
violet Shh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only  she had other urges.
myranda So did the septons, only they lied about it.
theon_greyjoy Where is he?
violet Who, my lord?
myranda There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.
theon_greyjoy Please.
violet Don't you want us to see it?
myranda Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it.
theon_greyjoy He sent you.
myranda Who sent us?
violet We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
myranda We heard so much about it.
theon_greyjoy Please.
violet Oh! There it is.
violet Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.
myranda Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face.
theon_greyjoy Help me. If he comes back-
violet We need to make him feel better.
myranda And how can we make him feel better?
violet I have an idea.
violet Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls.
myranda Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
myranda Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
violet As good as they say?
myranda Mmm.
violet And why should you get all the fun?
myranda What? You like her better?
violet Plenty there for both of us.
myranda I was here first.
ramsay_bolton I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
ramsay_bolton But I was getting jealous.
ramsay_bolton Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
ramsay_bolton Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
ramsay_bolton Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
theon_greyjoy Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!
ramsay_bolton This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
theon_greyjoy No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!
jon_snow You're gonna scare it off.
ygritte I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
jon_snow It's too far away.
ygritte Is that a palace?
jon_snow It's a windmill.
ygritte Windmill. Who built it? Some king?
jon_snow Just the men who used to live here.
ygritte They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
jon_snow Winterfell has towers three times that size.
ygritte 'I'm jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.'
jon_snow If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
ygritte What's swooning?
jon_snow Fainting.
ygritte What's fainting?
jon_snow When a girl sees blood and collapses.
ygritte Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
jon_snow Well not all girls are like you.
ygritte Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, jon Snow?  Oh, a spider! Save me, jon Snow.
ygritte My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
jon_snow I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
ygritte Would you?
jon_snow So I could tear it off you.
ygritte Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.
jon_snow Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
ygritte Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
jon_snow Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
ygritte You know nothing-
jon_snow Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.
ygritte And how do you know that?
jon_snow Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.
ygritte Mance is different.
jon_snow You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
ygritte You don't know that.
jon_snow I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.
ygritte All of us.
ygritte You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.
jon_snow Yes, first we'll live.
osha What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
hodor Hodor.
jojen_reed That's where we are.
osha What are you telling him?
bran_stark It's all right, Osha.
osha It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day?  Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
meera Leave him alone.
osha He can speak for himself.
jojen_reed I don't fill his head with anything.
osha So what do you talk about?
jojen_reed What's happening to him and what that means.
osha Go on, then. Tell us what it means.
jojen_reed It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
osha I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
jojen_reed We're not going to Castle Black.
osha What did you say?
jojen_reed I told you already. jon_snow Snow isn't there. bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
osha Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me.
bran_stark The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
osha You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
bran_stark What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
osha Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.
bran_stark You don't understand. You don't know.
osha You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long.
osha I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
qyburn How is the pain, my lord?
jaime_lannister What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
qyburn Well, we've stymied the corruption.
jaime_lannister Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.
qyburn All the good it's done me.
jaime_lannister You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
qyburn Faint praise, my lord.
jaime_lannister So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
qyburn No, my lord. That's not my weakness.
jaime_lannister What is?
qyburn Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
jaime_lannister You performed experiments on living men.
qyburn On dying men.
jaime_lannister With their permission?
qyburn My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
jaime_lannister Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
qyburn How many men have you killed, my lord?
jaime_lannister I don't know.
qyburn Fifty? A hundred?
qyburn Countless.
jaime_lannister Countless has a nice ring to it.
qyburn And how many lives have you saved?
jaime_lannister Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to brienne_of_tarth's father in Tarth?
qyburn A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
jaime_lannister A fair offer.
qyburn A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
jaime_lannister Why not?
qyburn He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
qyburn He feels he's being cheated.
jaime_lannister They'd be fools to kill her.
qyburn These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.
jaime_lannister We have to return to Harrenhal.
steelshanks_walton Why?
jaime_lannister I've left something behind.
steelshanks_walton Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
jaime_lannister And what are those orders?
steelshanks_walton To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
jaime_lannister You think you'll get a reward.
steelshanks_walton I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-
jaime_lannister You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
steelshanks_walton I had nothing-
jaime_lannister Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
jaime_lannister Whoa.
steelshanks_walton Eyes open, lads.
jaime_lannister Be quiet.
men The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!
man Don't spare her. Don't spare her!
locke Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight.
jaime_lannister A wooden sword?
locke I thought you'd gone.
jaime_lannister You gave her a wooden sword.
locke We've only got one bear.
jaime_lannister I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.
locke All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
locke This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
brienne_of_tarth Ah!
jaime_lannister Get behind me.
brienne_of_tarth I will not.
locke What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
steelshanks_walton Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
jaime_lannister Pull her up.
brienne_of_tarth Hold my legs.
brienne_of_tarth Pull him up!
locke The bitch stays.
jaime_lannister We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
locke She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
jaime_lannister What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring tywin_lannister Lannister gets his son back alive?
jaime_lannister Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.
