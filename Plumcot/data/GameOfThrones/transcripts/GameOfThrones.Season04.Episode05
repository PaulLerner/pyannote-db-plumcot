high_septon May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Long may he reign!
high_septon Special day.
grand_maester_pycelle Your Grace.
lord_varys Your Grace.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Your Grace.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Your Grace.
margaery_tyrell Your Grace.
cersei_lannister There he is.
margaery_tyrell Long may he reign.
cersei_lannister Long may he reign.
margaery_tyrell He sits the throne like he was born to it.
cersei_lannister Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
margaery_tyrell No, he wasn't.
cersei_lannister You still mourn for Joffrey?
margaery_tyrell He was my husband. My king.
cersei_lannister He would have been your nightmare.
margaery_tyrell Your Grace, I feel...
cersei_lannister You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?
margaery_tyrell No.
cersei_lannister The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
margaery_tyrell It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.
cersei_lannister He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
margaery_tyrell He has you.
cersei_lannister A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?
margaery_tyrell Oh. After all that's happened... it sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.
cersei_lannister Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.
margaery_tyrell We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
cersei_lannister (CHUCKLES)
margaery_tyrell I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
jorah_mormont King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
barristan_selmy And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.
daario_naharis The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
daenerys_targaryen Who told you to take the Navy?
daario_naharis No one.
daenerys_targaryen So why did you do it?
daario_naharis I heard you liked ships.
daenerys_targaryen How many ships?
barristan_selmy 93, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen How many men can they carry?
barristan_selmy 9,300, not counting sailors.
daenerys_targaryen Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
jorah_mormont The Lannisters have more.
barristan_selmy They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. 8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
jorah_mormont It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.
barristan_selmy The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
jorah_mormont The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
jorah_mormont There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."
daenerys_targaryen Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.
daenerys_targaryen It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
jorah_mormont You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
daenerys_targaryen You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
jorah_mormont (CHUCKLES)
daenerys_targaryen How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
jorah_mormont You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
daenerys_targaryen I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
jorah_mormont What, then?
daenerys_targaryen I will do what queens do. I will rule.
petyr_baelish Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
sansa_stark But how would they know?
petyr_baelish You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
sansa_stark Is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.
knight#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
petyr_baelish Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
knight#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Stand to.
knight_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Stand to!
knight_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Stand to!
knight#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode05 Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
robin_arryn Uncle Petyr!
petyr_baelish My lord.
petyr_baelish Oh. I have brought you a gift.
lysa_arryn Lord Baelish.
petyr_baelish My lady.
robin_arryn Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
lysa_arryn A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
sansa_stark It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...
lysa_arryn Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
lysa_arryn My flesh and blood.
sansa_stark It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
lysa_arryn You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
sansa_stark Of course. I understand.
lysa_arryn No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
sansa_stark I would never say a thing.
lysa_arryn The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
robin_arryn Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
sansa_stark They did, and my father's.
robin_arryn They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
sansa_stark Make him fly?
robin_arryn Through the Moon Door.
robin_arryn (GIGGLES)
lysa_arryn And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
sansa_stark They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
lysa_arryn I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
sansa_stark No. - We never...
lysa_arryn Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.
sansa_stark It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
lysa_arryn Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.
petyr_baelish Go. We'll speak soon.
lysa_arryn What took you so long?
petyr_baelish Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
lysa_arryn She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
lysa_arryn Let's get married tonight.
petyr_baelish Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
lysa_arryn There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
petyr_baelish I do think that we could wait until...
lysa_arryn I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?
petyr_baelish Like it was yesterday.
lysa_arryn What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...
petyr_baelish The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
lysa_arryn (nods)
petyr_baelish Tonight it is, then.
lysa_arryn (LAUGHS)
petyr_baelish Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
lysa_arryn I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
tywin_lannister When will the wedding take place in your mind?
cersei_lannister As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
tywin_lannister A fortnight?
cersei_lannister That seems reasonable.
tywin_lannister No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.
cersei_lannister (shakes her head)
tywin_lannister And your wedding to Loras?
cersei_lannister Shortly after Tommen's.
tywin_lannister Shortly?
cersei_lannister A fortnight.
tywin_lannister I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
cersei_lannister We had that in common.
tywin_lannister You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
cersei_lannister Then whom can we trust?
tywin_lannister Ourselves alone.
tywin_lannister The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
cersei_lannister Robert wasn't particularly rich.
tywin_lannister Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
cersei_lannister I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
tywin_lannister Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
cersei_lannister Haven't a clue.
tywin_lannister Go on, your best guess.
cersei_lannister Pounds, tons, ounces?
tywin_lannister Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
cersei_lannister That can't be.
tywin_lannister Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
cersei_lannister Then how do we pay for anything?
tywin_lannister The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
cersei_lannister How much?
tywin_lannister A tremendous amount.
cersei_lannister There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
tywin_lannister The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
cersei_lannister Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
tywin_lannister And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
cersei_lannister It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.
tywin_lannister I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
cersei_lannister I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
cersei_lannister The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
arya_stark Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
sandor_clegane Would you shut up?
arya_stark I can't sleep until I say the names.
sandor_clegane The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
arya_stark Only the ones I'm going to kill.
sandor_clegane (CHUCKLES) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
arya_stark If he were here right now, what would you do?
sandor_clegane I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
arya_stark I'm almost done. Only one name left.
sandor_clegane Go on.
arya_stark The Hound.
sansa_stark Thank you.
lysa_arryn Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
sansa_stark Really?
lysa_arryn Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
sansa_stark My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
lysa_arryn This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?
sansa_stark They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
lysa_arryn Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.
sansa_stark Yes. I'm very lucky.
lysa_arryn He feels responsible for you.
sansa_stark Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
lysa_arryn Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
sansa_stark Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.
lysa_arryn Loved your mother.
sansa_stark No.
lysa_arryn That's what you wanted to say.
sansa_stark He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
lysa_arryn Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?
sansa_stark No.
lysa_arryn He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
sansa_stark No, never.
lysa_arryn Are you pregnant?
sansa_stark What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never...
lysa_arryn I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
sansa_stark Aunt Lysa, no, I...
lysa_arryn Your young, pretty body.
sansa_stark Nothing. I'm a virgin.
lysa_arryn Don't lie to me.
sansa_stark You're hurting me.
lysa_arryn I'll know if you lie.
sansa_stark I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.
lysa_arryn Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
brienne_of_tarth Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
podrick_payne Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.
brienne_of_tarth Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
podrick_payne That's a long way off.
brienne_of_tarth Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.
podrick_payne Never, my lady. I'm your squire.
brienne_of_tarth I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
podrick_payne All knights have squires, my lady.
brienne_of_tarth I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.
podrick_payne I swore an oath, my lady.
brienne_of_tarth I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
podrick_payne I know.
brienne_of_tarth What do you think will happen if you leave?
podrick_payne They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
sandor_clegane The hell you doing?
arya_stark Practicing.
sandor_clegane What, ways to die?
arya_stark No one's going to kill me.
sandor_clegane They will if you Nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
arya_stark It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
sandor_clegane Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
arya_stark The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
sandor_clegane Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.
arya_stark What do you know about anything?
sandor_clegane I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
arya_stark It was not.
sandor_clegane Was? He dead?
arya_stark Yes.
sandor_clegane How?
arya_stark He was killed.
sandor_clegane Who by?
arya_stark Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn...
sandor_clegane Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
arya_stark He was outnumbered.
sandor_clegane Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
arya_stark Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
sandor_clegane The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.
sandor_clegane Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)
oberyn_martell Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
oberyn_martell A poem, actually.
cersei_lannister May I show you the gardens?
oberyn_martell I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
cersei_lannister No, you couldn't.
cersei_lannister I didn't realize you were a poet.
oberyn_martell Not a very good one.
cersei_lannister For your paramour?
oberyn_martell For one of my daughters.
cersei_lannister You have several, don't you?
oberyn_martell Eight.
cersei_lannister Eight? Eight daughters?
oberyn_martell The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
cersei_lannister Beautiful name.
oberyn_martell Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.
cersei_lannister Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?
oberyn_martell Which joke is that?
cersei_lannister You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
oberyn_martell We can avenge them.
cersei_lannister Yes, we can avenge them.
oberyn_martell You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
cersei_lannister I know he did.
oberyn_martell We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
cersei_lannister We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
oberyn_martell The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.
cersei_lannister I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
oberyn_martell You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
cersei_lannister Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.
oberyn_martell Anything at all.
cersei_lannister The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
oberyn_martell I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
cersei_lannister Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
podrick_payne Oh, no, no, no.
podrick_payne No, no, no, no.
podrick_payne Hells. Gods.
brienne_of_tarth Did you remove the skin?
podrick_payne No, my lady.
brienne_of_tarth Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
podrick_payne No, my lady.
brienne_of_tarth Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
podrick_payne No, my lady. That was the cooks.
brienne_of_tarth What are you doing?
podrick_payne I'm helping you with your armor.
brienne_of_tarth I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
brienne_of_tarth What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
podrick_payne I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
brienne_of_tarth Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
podrick_payne I killed a man.
brienne_of_tarth Who?
podrick_payne A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
brienne_of_tarth How did you kill a Kingsguard?
podrick_payne I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
brienne_of_tarth Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.

jojen_reed If you let my sister go, I can help you.
karl_tanner You can help me?
jojen_reed I can.
