GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Depends if he’s had any practice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She loosened you up for us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s going to fall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s going to fall off his horse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Help him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Please, water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Water, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If I die, you won’t be getting…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Can’t say that I’ve ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Far enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Do that again and I’ll take your other hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Come on, you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, Lord Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Come in, come in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I hope we might speak in confidence.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Always in confidence.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown About the events of the Blackwater.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Perhaps this is the wrong time?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, no, it’s a wonderful time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister’s intentions to…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown End your life?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I didn’t inherit Littlefinger’s spies along with his position, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Which is why I’m coming to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I need proof.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Proof?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Will there be a trial?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I need to know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I have no proof, only whispers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Do you want to hear it still?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Do I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I feared the man meant to use me as I’d heard some men used small boys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But what he wanted was far worse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He burned my parts in a brazier.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I still dream of that night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I dream of the voice from the flames.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Was it a god?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A demon?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A conjuror’s trick?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A symbolic revenge of sorts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a degree of influence, which…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You do not possess at the moment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Once I had served the sorcerer’s purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I resolved to live to spite him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I begged.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I became an excellent thief, and soon learned that the contents of a man’s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Influence grows like a weed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world, where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ugh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The sorcerer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Hello, my old friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s been a long time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time, if you have the stomach for it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown When people talk about the Night’s Watch, they never mention the shovelling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Or the shit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They tell you about honour, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shovelling really is most of it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And getting attacked or killed or worse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But when you’re not getting attacked or killed, usually you’re shovelling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ah, look.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown More shit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We need to get out of here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How’d that turn out for us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He had no way of knowing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We do now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We know what’s out there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Craster’s been out here surviving.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So he’s your new protector now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Our good friend Craster?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We’re like the sons he never had.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mormont isn’t gonna save you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown This lummox here isn’t gonna save you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If we want to live, we’ll have to look out for ourselves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You woke him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s beautiful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Shh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s beautiful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Does he have a name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Are you going to give him one?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Gilly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You said to hold it for you until you came back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I wanted you to have it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t want your stupid thimble.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I want to save my baby’s life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Can you do that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Can you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t have time for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t have time for anyone but him because he doesn’t have much time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You have to go after him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You know how.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Brandon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How many times have I told you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No climbing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mother, I need to find it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s calling me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I want you to promise me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No more climbing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Promise me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Promise me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Promise me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mother!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mother!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Promise me, Bran!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Promise me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is he very large?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No larger than usual, apparently.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And yet, they said that he was…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Extraordinary.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The most extraordinary man they’ve ever had.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And they’ve had a lot of men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We’re talking about the same Podrick?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion’s service?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Seems a bit simple?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What did he do to them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t know, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The girls are usually quite descriptive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So what did they say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They said it was hard to describe.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Huh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was too preoccupied to notice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s leaving for the Eyrie soon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m helping him prepare for his journey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Sad, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He hasn’t spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But I don’t think he’s lost interest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What makes you say so?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown His shipboard inventory.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You can read.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Rare for a woman in your profession.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Former profession.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m missing something obvious you’re about to point out?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Two featherbeds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Could he be bringing one of his girls?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s not interested in them, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How do you know?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Because I’m one of his girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Prodigies in odd places indeed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather, his dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It ate her while her son watched.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What’s left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats comfortably.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown There aren’t more than people of any importance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Aerion Brightflame, they called him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And, of course, there’s the Mad King, killed by my uncle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn’t find all this a bit macabre?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, it’s quite all right, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’d love to see their tombs, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s like taking a walk through history.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The tomb’s just up here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown This is so exciting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You were married here, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Must seem like only yesterday.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Seems like a lifetime ago.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Your husband was buried here as well?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm’s End.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Such a tragedy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A fairly predictable tragedy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Hunting and drinking don’t mix.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I should say not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My son’s a hunter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It helps him forget he’s never been within a mile of a real battle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm’s End for the better part of a year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I told him to stay out of Robert’s Rebellion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He had no business fighting an actual warrior.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But they do seem to yearn for it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off, like rain off a wing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And yet the world belongs to them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Gods have seen fit to make it so.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My father didn’t want them here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m glad he did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m sorry, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I couldn’t agree more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Shall we go and see them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ve spoken with them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know how they feel about you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You led the defence of King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They adore you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Open the doors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Bless you, Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Long live Lady Margaery!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Gods bless King Joffrey!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not far, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Your sister is waiting for you there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She sent you to save me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I served them, the men who were torturing you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I did what they told and waited.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why would you risk your life for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I was only a boy when they took you away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I remember the look on my father’s face when he told us, “That’s Balon Greyjoy’s last living son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown ” And those are the words I heard over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Did he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t know, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They never told me much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My sister’s men are loyal to her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We don’t need to hide from them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not all those are your sister’s men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Some of them are loyal to your father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What did he tell you to do?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Raid fishing villages.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He didn’t trust me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Thought I was a Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I could never be a Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He lorded it over you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Didn’t have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown All he had to do was be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Be who he was born to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown His life fit him better than his clothes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s the King in the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And me…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My father gave me a choice and I made it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I could never be a Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But ironborn, that’s what I was born to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I murdered those boys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Stark boys?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Never found them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies, so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Maybe it’s not too late.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My real father lost his head at King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I made a choice, and I chose wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And now I’ve burned everything down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not everything, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She’s up here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yara.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Shh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I brought him back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He killed the others.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, I didn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You can’t!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Please, stop!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Put him back where he belongs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Eat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m dying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You can’t die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You need to live to take revenge.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t care about revenge.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You coward.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A little misfortune and you’re giving up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Misfor…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Misfortune?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You lost your hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My sword hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I was that hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You have a taste, one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them, and you whine and cry and quit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You sound like a bloody woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know what you did for me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You knew that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why did you help me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You wanted to speak to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes, about Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What about him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I wanted to make sure we’re doing everything we can to get him back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You started a war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Whatever you can.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Whatever I can.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re still here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Years and years of lectures on family and legacy…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown All right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Contribute.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Tyrells are a problem.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Tyrells saved your life, your children’s lives.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She knows how to manipulate him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I don’t distrust you because you’re a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I distrust you because you’re not as smart as you think you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Do you like it, Nana?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Another golden rose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How original.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I eat from plates stamped with roses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Roses are boring, dear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown “Growing strong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown ” Ha!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The dullest words of any house.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown “Winter is coming!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown ” Now that’s memorable.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown “We do not sow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown ” Strong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Strong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Those are houses you watch out for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But a golden rose growing strong, that strikes fear in the heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Look, little loves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A spider in the garden.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Run along now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Grow strong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I wanted to personally welcome you to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The city has been made brighter by your presence.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The city is made brighter by my presence?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Are you here to seduce me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A little obvious, perhaps.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, no, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Seduce away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s been so long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Though I rather think it’s all for naught.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A question for the philosophers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But you’ve come mincing all this way for something.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Might I sit?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Come, I’ve heard you’re such a clever man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m curious why you’ve sought me out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’ve taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Have I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why shouldn’t I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She’s an interesting girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is she?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, not particularly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But she’s had an interesting childhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She has, sadly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Come, come.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You surrender rather easily.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Walk with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Which is Sansa Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Neither.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A babe in the woods.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I admired her father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I could not help Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Perhaps I can help his daughter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That’s hardly surprising.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She’s a beautiful girl with a famous name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Indeed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She’d make a lovely match for the right suitor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It almost feels as if you’re about to arrive at the point.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And why have you come to me with this matter?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He has acquired the first two.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How long before he has the army?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Perhaps you’ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And if he marries her, he’ll have the key in his pocket.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Which seems such a shame.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You must despise him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re working so hard to undermine him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Actually, I rather enjoy him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You are too kind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I believe I have a possible solution.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown One doesn’t need to be clever for that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s obvious, isn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I didn’t mean to disturb you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You haven’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We’d like some privacy, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If you wouldn’t mind waiting back inside the keep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Or if you’d be kind enough to give me your names, I’ll ask the King to speak with you himself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What did you pray for?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I can’t tell you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Let’s see, for my family’s health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Boring and traditional, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m sorry, I just can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown When I was , I was all elbows and knees, and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown “Pig Face,” she called me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown “Pig Face”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That’s ridiculous.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It had something to do with my nose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Whenever she passed me in the halls, she’d oink.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So I prayed that she’d catch a horrible skin disease.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Porridge plague?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, you don’t have it in the North?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Your skin starts to look like boiled oats, and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But that’s awful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I believed you!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Porridge plague.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m an idiot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Don’t say that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, you’re not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So what happened to Alanna?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s all terribly frustrating.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m sure she’s jealous of you now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’ll be married here in the capital, and she’ll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you’re queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I want us to be friends, good friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That would make me very happy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You must see Highgarden.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’d love it there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know you would.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You should see the costumes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown People work on them for months.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Uh, I don’t think the Queen would let me leave King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Queen Regent, you mean.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Once I marry Joffrey, I’ll be queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And if you were to marry Loras, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We would be sisters, you and I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Would you like that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown His name was Bannen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was a good man, a good ranger.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He came to us from…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Where did he come from?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Down White Harbor way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He came to us from White Harbor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Never failed in his duty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He kept his vows the best he could.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He rode far, fought fiercely.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We shall never see his like again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And now his watch has ended.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And now his watch has ended.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Didn’t think a broke foot could kill a man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It wasn’t his foot that killed him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That bastard Craster starved him to death.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Craster’s got his daughters to feed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You on his side?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We can’t just show up and steal all his food.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown We’re brothers of the Night’s Watch, not thieves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine, and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s a bloody wildling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You have one son, don’t you, Mormont?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I had my th.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You ever meet a man with sons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And more daughters than I can count.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m glad for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Are you now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Me, I’ll be glad when you and yours have gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They’re as strong as they’re gonna get.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Them that’s dying, why don’t you cut their throats and be done with it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Or leave them if you’ve not the stomach, and I’ll sort them myself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Wait outside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It’s cold outside and there’s nothing to eat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My wives gave you bread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown There’s sawdust in the bread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You don’t like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’d rather eat what you’ve got hidden away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I told you to wait outside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He’s sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I gave you crows enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ve got to feed my women!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You admit you’ve got a hidden larder?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown How else you make it through winter?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Enough!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Out!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I am a godly man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re a stingy bastard!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Bastard?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Out with you, you little thief.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And you!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And you!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You are a bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A daughterfucking, wildling bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The Gods will curse us for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown By all the laws…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown There are no laws beyond the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Show us where he hides the food, or you’ll get the same as him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Unhand her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I shall have your head for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What’s happening?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’m not going out there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No, we have to go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Now!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Follow me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I know the best way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Can I take this hood off yet?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I do apologise, little lady, but it’s better for you if you don’t see where we’re going.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Halt!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Blackstrap rum.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ugh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’d have some.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Let’s go home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What is this place?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You look like a bunch of swineherds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Some of us were swineherds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And some of us tanners and masons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That was before.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re still swineherds and tanners and masons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Beric Dondarrion?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’ve seen better days.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And I won’t see them again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Stark deserters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Baratheon deserters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You lot aren’t fighting in a war, you’re running from it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Last I heard, you were King Joffrey’s guard dog.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But here you are , miles from home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Which of us is running?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Untie these ropes and we’ll find out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert’s name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Ned Stark is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown King Robert is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My brother’s alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’re fighting for ghosts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That’s what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You can’t see us, but we see you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You found god?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is that it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I’ve been reborn in the light of the one true god.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown As have we all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown As would any man who’s seen the things we’ve seen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown If you mean to murder me, then get on with it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You’ll die soon enough, dog.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But it won’t be murder, only justice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And a kinder fate than you deserve.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Lions, you call yourselves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown At the Mummer’s Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I wasn’t at the Mummer’s Ford.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Dump your dead children at some other door.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown House Clegane was built upon dead children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Do you take me for my brother?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is being born Clegane a crime?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Murder is a crime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I never touched the Targaryen babes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You want to cut my throat, get on with it!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But don’t call me murderer and pretend that you’re not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You murdered Mycah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The butcher’s boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown My friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was years old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He was unarmed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And you rode him down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Aye, he was a bleeder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You don’t deny killing this boy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I was Joffrey’s sworn shield.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The boy attacked the prince.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown That’s a lie!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I hit Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Mycah just ran away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Then I should have killed you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Not my place to question princes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You stand accused of murder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Only the Lord of Light may do that now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I sentence you to trial by combat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown So, who will it be?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Or you, archer?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown What are you worth with a sword in your hand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She might be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown But it’s me you’ll fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown The master says they are untested.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown He says you would be wise to blood them early.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown And who knows?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown In years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Thus, all shall prosper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Is it done, then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown They belong to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It is done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown It is done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown She holds the whip.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You hold the whip.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown This bitch has her army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Unsullied!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Forward march!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Halt!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Tell the bitch her beast won’t come.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown A dragon is not a slave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You speak Valyrian?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Valyrian is my mother tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Unsullied!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Strike the chains off every slave you see!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I am your master!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Kill her!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Kill her!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Kill her!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Dracarys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Unsullied!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown You have been slaves all your life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Today you are free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown I give you my word.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown Will you fight for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode04 #unknown As free men?
