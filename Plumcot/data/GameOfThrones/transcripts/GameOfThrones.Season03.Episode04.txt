man How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
locke Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?
brienne_of_tarth He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
jaime_lannister Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.
jaime_lannister If I die, you won't be getting-
locke Oh, enough. Here.
locke Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
brienne_of_tarth Stop!
man Far enough.
locke Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
man Come on, you.
lord_varys Oh, Lord tyrion. Come in, come in.
tyrion_lannister I hope we might speak. In confidence.
lord_varys Oh, always in confidence.
tyrion_lannister About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
lord_varys Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.
tyrion_lannister I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
lord_varys End your life?
tyrion_lannister I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.
lord_varys Proof? Will there be a trial?
tyrion_lannister I need to know.
lord_varys I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?
tyrion_lannister I don't know. Do I?
lord_varys As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.
tyrion_lannister Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-
lord_varys You do not possess at the moment.
lord_varys But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
tyrion_lannister The sorcerer.
lord_varys Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.
grenn When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.
eddison_tollett Or the shit.
grenn They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.
eddison_tollett And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
grenn But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.
eddison_tollett Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.
rast We need to get out of here.
grenn When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
rast The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
eddison_tollett He had no way of knowing.
rast We do now. We know what's out there.
grenn Craster's been out here surviving.
rast So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
eddison_tollett We're like the sons he never had.
rast Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves.
gilly Shh, shh, shh.
gilly You woke him.
samwell_tarly I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
gilly Shh!
samwell_tarly He's beautiful.  Does he have a name?
gilly No.
samwell_tarly Are you going to give him one?
gilly Why?
gilly Here.
samwell_tarly Gilly.
gilly You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
samwell_tarly I wanted you to have it.
gilly I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
gilly I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
jojen_reed You have to go after him.
bran_stark How?
jojen_reed You know how.
catelyn_stark  Brandon.
bran_stark Mother.
catelyn_stark  How many times have I told you? No climbing.
bran_stark Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me.
catelyn_stark  I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
catelyn_stark  Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
bran_stark Mother! Mother!
catelyn_stark  Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!
lord_varys Is he very large?
ros No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-
lord_varys Extraordinary.
ros The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
lord_varys We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord tyrion_lannister's service? Seems a bit simple?
lord_varys What did he do to them?
ros I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive.
lord_varys So what did they say?
ros They said it was hard to describe.
lord_varys Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
ros He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
lord_varys Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa_stark Stark?
ros He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest.
lord_varys What makes you say so?
ros His shipboard inventory.
lord_varys Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
ros Former profession.
lord_varys Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
ros Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
lord_varys Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
ros He's not interested in them, my lord.
lord_varys How do you know?
ros Because I'm one of his girls.
lord_varys Prodigies in odd places indeed.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
cersei_lannister The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats seven hundred comfortably.
olenna_tyrell There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
cersei_lannister There aren't more than seven hundred people of any importance.
olenna_tyrell No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the seven hundred to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
cersei_lannister Are you sure Lady margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
margaery_tyrell Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy The tomb's just up here.
margaery_tyrell This is so exciting.
olenna_tyrell You were married here, Your Grace?
cersei_lannister Yes.
olenna_tyrell Must seem like only yesterday.
cersei_lannister Seems like a lifetime ago.
olenna_tyrell Your husband, was he buried here as well?
cersei_lannister No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
olenna_tyrell Such a tragedy.
cersei_lannister A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
olenna_tyrell I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
cersei_lannister I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
olenna_tyrell All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
olenna_tyrell I told him to stay out of Robert's Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
cersei_lannister And yet the world belongs to them.
olenna_tyrell A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
cersei_lannister The gods have seen fit to make it so.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
margaery_tyrell I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy I couldn't agree more.
margaery_tyrell Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you.
joffrey_baratheon_greyjoy Open the doors.
cersei_lannister joffrey. Wait.

theon_greyjoy How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
ramsay_bolton Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there.
theon_greyjoy She sent you to save me?
ramsay_bolton Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
theon_greyjoy Why would you risk your life for me?
ramsay_bolton I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
theon_greyjoy Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?
ramsay_bolton I- I don't know, my lord. They- they never told me much.
theon_greyjoy My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
ramsay_bolton Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father.
ramsay_bolton What is it?
theon_greyjoy I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
ramsay_bolton What did he tell you to do?
theon_greyjoy Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
ramsay_bolton He lorded it over you?
theon_greyjoy Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
theon_greyjoy And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys.
ramsay_bolton The Stark boys?
theon_greyjoy Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
ramsay_boltonMaybe it's not too late.
theon_greyjoy It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
ramsay_bolton Not everything, my lord. She's up here.
theon_greyjoy Yara.
ramsay_bolton Shh. Wait.
ramsay_bolton I brought him back. He killed the others.
theon_greyjoy What? No, I didn't.
theon_greyjoy You can't! No, please stop! No!
ramsay_bolton Put him back where he belongs.
brienne_of_tarth Eat. What are you doing?
jaime_lannister I'm dying.
brienne_of_tarth You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
jaime_lannister I don't care about revenge.
brienne_of_tarth You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
jaime_lannister Misfor- misfortune?
brienne_of_tarth You lost your hand.
jaime_lannister My sword hand. I was that hand.
brienne_of_tarth You have a taste- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.
brienne_of_tarth I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
tywin_lannister You wanted to speak to me?
cersei_lannister Yes, about jaime_lannister.
tywin_lannister What about him?
cersei_lannister I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
tywin_lannister When catelyn_stark  Stark took tyrion_lannister prisoner, what did I do in response?
cersei_lannister You started a war.
tywin_lannister And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
cersei_lannister Whatever you can.
tywin_lannister Whatever I can.
tywin_lannister You're still here.
cersei_lannister Yes.
tywin_lannister Why?
cersei_lannister Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not jaime_lannister or tyrion_lannister, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
tywin_lannister All right. Contribute.
cersei_lannister The Tyrells are a problem.
tywin_lannister The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
cersei_lannister margaery_tyrell has her claws in joffrey_baratheon. She knows how to manipulate him.
tywin_lannister Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
cersei_lannister Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
tywin_lannister I will.
maid Do you like it, Nana?
olenna_tyrell Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong- ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
olenna_tyrell Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong.
lord_varys My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
olenna_tyrell The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord lord_varys? Are you here to seduce me?
lord_varys A little obvious, perhaps.
olenna_tyrell Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?
lord_varys Might I sit?
olenna_tyrell No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out.
lord_varys You've taken an interest in sansa_stark Stark.
olenna_tyrell Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
lord_varys Is she?
olenna_tyrell No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.
lord_varys She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
olenna_tyrell Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
lord_varys I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
olenna_tyrell Which is sansa_stark Stark?
lord_varys Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
olenna_tyrell Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
lord_varys I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
olenna_tyrell How?
lord_varys You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
olenna_tyrell That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
lord_varys Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
olenna_tyrell It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
lord_varys Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, sansa_stark Stark goes with him.
olenna_tyrell And why have you come to me with this matter?
lord_varys Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?
lord_varys Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, sansa_stark Stark is the key to the North.
olenna_tyrell And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
lord_varys Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
olenna_tyrell You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
lord_varys Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
olenna_tyrell You are a clever man, Lord lord_varys.
lord_varys You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
olenna_tyrell One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?
margaery_tyrell Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
sansa_stark You haven't.
margaery_tyrell We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
margaery_tyrell What did you pray for?
sansa_stark I can't tell you.
margaery_tyrell Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?
sansa_stark I'm sorry, I just can't.
margaery_tyrell My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me.
sansa_stark Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
margaery_tyrell I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
margaery_tyrell So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
sansa_stark Porridge plague?
margaery_tyrell You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
sansa_stark But that's awful.
sansa_stark You're- I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
margaery_tyrell Don't say that. No, you're not.
sansa_stark So what happened to Alanna?
margaery_tyrell Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating.
sansa_stark I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
margaery_tyrell I want us to be friends, good friends.
sansa_stark That would make me very happy.
margaery_tyrell You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
sansa_stark I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
margaery_tyrell The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry joffrey_baratheon, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras... Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?
jeor_mormont His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from- where did he come from?
eddison_tollett Down White Harbor way.
jeor_mormont He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again.
all And now his watch has ended.
jeor_mormont And now his watch has ended.
grenn Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
rast It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death.
samwell_tarly Craster's got his daughters to feed.
rast You on his side?
samwell_tarly We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
rast The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is.
eddison Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
craster You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my ninety-ninth. You ever meet a man with ninety-nine sons?
craster And more daughters than I can count.
jeor_mormont I'm glad for you.
craster Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
jeor_mormont As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
craster Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
karl_tanner Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
jeor_mormont Wait outside.
karl_tanner It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
craster My wives gave you bread.
karl_tanner There's sawdust in the bread.
craster You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
karl_tanner I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
jeor_mormont I told you to wait outside.
rast He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
craster I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
rast So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter?
jeor_mormont Enough! Out!
craster I am a godly man.
rast You're a stingy bastard!
craster Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
karl_tanner You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
jeor_mormont The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws-
karl_tanner There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
jeor_mormont Unhand her.
jeor_mormont I shall have your head for this.
samwell_tarly Quickly. Quickly.
gilly What's happening? I'm not going out there.
samwell_tarly No, we have to go. Now!
gilly Follow me. I know the best way. Come on.
rast Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
arya_stark Can I take this hood off yet?
thoros I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
man Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
man Halt!
arya_stark What is it?
thoros Blackstrap rum.
arya_stark Ugh!
thoros Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
gendry I'd have some.
thoros Let's go home.
gendry What is this place?
thoros Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
sandor_clegane You look like a bunch of swineherds.
anguy Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
sandor_clegane You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
beric_dondarrion No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
sandor_clegane beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
beric_dondarrion And I won't see them again.
sandor_clegane Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
beric_dondarrion Last I heard, you were King joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?
sandor_clegane Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
beric_dondarrion Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
sandor_clegane Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
sandor_clegane You're fighting for ghosts.
beric_dondarrion That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.
sandor_clegane You found god? Is that it?
beric_dondarrion Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
sandor_clegane If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
thoros You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice.
anguy And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
sandor_clegane I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
thoros House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
sandor_clegane Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
anguy Murder is a crime.
sandor_clegane I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
arya_stark You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
sandor_clegane Aye, he was a bleeder.
beric_dondarrion You don't deny killing this boy?
sandor_clegane I was joffrey_baratheon's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
arya_stark That's a lie! I hit joffrey_baratheon. Mycah just ran away.
sandor_clegane Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
beric_dondarrion You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.
sandor_clegane So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
beric_dondarrion Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
missandei The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
missandei And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.
daenerys_targaryen Is it done, then? They belong to me?
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d It is done.
missandei It is done.
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d She holds the whip.
missandei You hold the whip.
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d The bitch has her army.
daenerys_targaryen Unsullied!
daenerys_targaryen Forward march!
daenerys_targaryen Halt!
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
daenerys_targaryen A dragon is not a slave.
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d You speak Valyrian?
daenerys_targaryen I am daenerys_targaryen Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue.
daenerys_targaryen Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d I am your master.
kraznys_mo_nakloz,d Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
daenerys_targaryen Dracarys.
daenerys_targaryen Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?
