tortured_slave How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass
knight Depends if he's had any practice Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer She loosened you up for us
prendahl_na_ghezn He's going to fall He's going to fall off his horse Someone help him
eyrie_guard Water Water Please, water Wa-water Water, please Please Please
eyrie_guard If I die, you won't be getting--
knight Oh, enough Here
knight Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast
prendahl_na_ghezn Stop!
tortured_slave Far enough
knight Do that again and I'll take your other hand
tortured_slave Come on, you
black_lorren Oh, Lord Tyrion Come in, come in
rickard_stark I hope we might speak In confidence
black_lorren Oh, always in confidence
rickard_stark About the events of the Blackwater Perhaps this is the wrong time
black_lorren Oh, no It's a wonderful time
rickard_stark I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to--
black_lorren End your life
rickard_stark I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid Which is why I'm coming to you I need proof
black_lorren Proof Will there be a trial
rickard_stark I need to know
black_lorren I have no proof, only whispers Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut Do you want to hear it still
rickard_stark I don't know Do I
black_lorren As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys But what he wanted was far worse He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while He burned my parts in a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call I still dream of that night Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade I dream of the voice from the flames Was it a god A demon A conjuror's trick I don't know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts
rickard_stark Yes, ahem I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed Which will require a degree of influence, which--
black_lorren You do not possess at the moment
black_lorren But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die I resolved to live to spite him I begged I sold what parts of my body remained to me I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber Influence grows like a weed I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special
rickard_stark The sorcerer
black_lorren Hello, my old friend It's been a long time I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
frey_soldier_2 When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling
khal_qorro Or the shit
frey_soldier_2 They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it
khal_qorro And getting attacked or killed or worse And that
frey_soldier_2 But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling
khal_qorro Oh, look More shit I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day
white_walker We need to get out of here
frey_soldier_2 When the Lord Commander says we go, we go
white_walker The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men How'd that turn out for us
khal_qorro He had no way of knowing
white_walker We do now We know what's out there
frey_soldier_2 Craster's been out here surviving
white_walker So he's your new protector now Our good friend Craster
khal_qorro We're like the sons he never had
white_walker Mormont isn't gonna save you This lummox here isn't gonna save you When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves
tycho_nestoris Shh, shh, shh
tycho_nestoris You woke him
braavosi_theatre_server I'm sorry He's beautiful
tycho_nestoris Shh!
braavosi_theatre_server He's beautiful  Does he have a name
tycho_nestoris No
braavosi_theatre_server Are you going to give him one
tycho_nestoris Why
tycho_nestoris Here
braavosi_theatre_server Gilly
tycho_nestoris You said to hold it for you until you came back You're back
braavosi_theatre_server I wanted you to have it
tycho_nestoris I don't want your stupid thimble I want to save my baby's life Can you do that Can you
tycho_nestoris I don't have time for you I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time
willem_lannister You have to go after him
hugh_of_the_vale How
willem_lannister You know how
maester_caleotte Brandon
hugh_of_the_vale Mother

maester_caleotte Promise me Promise me! Promise me!
hugh_of_the_vale Mother! Mother!
maester_caleotte Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!
black_lorren Is he very large
the_night_king No larger than usual, apparently And yet they said that he was--
black_lorren Extraordinary
the_night_king The most extraordinary man they've ever had And they've had a lot of men
black_lorren We're talking about the same Podrick The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service Seems a bit simple
black_lorren What did he do to them
the_night_king I don't know, my lord The girls are usually quite descriptive
black_lorren So what did they say
the_night_king They said it was hard to describe
black_lorren Huh Prodigies appear in the oddest of places And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income
the_night_king He was too preoccupied to notice He's leaving for the Eyrie soon I'm helping him prepare for his journey
black_lorren Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her Sad, really Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark
the_night_king He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know But I don't think he's lost interest
black_lorren What makes you say so
the_night_king His shipboard inventory
black_lorren Ah You can read Rare for a woman in your profession
the_night_king Former profession
black_lorren Of course I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out
the_night_king Two featherbeds He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
black_lorren Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger Could he be bringing one of his girls
the_night_king He's not interested in them, my lord
black_lorren How do you know
the_night_king Because I'm one of his girls
black_lorren Prodigies in odd places indeed
glover_general Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon It ate her while her son watched What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
illyrio_mopatis The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably
poisoned_frey There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
illyrio_mopatis There aren't more than 700 people of any importance
poisoned_frey No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
glover_general Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen Aerion Brightflame they called him He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
glover_general He was wrong And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried
illyrio_mopatis Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre
captured_wight Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace I'd love to see their tombs, really It's like taking a walk through history
glover_general The tomb's just up here
captured_wight This is so exciting
poisoned_frey You were married here, Your Grace
illyrio_mopatis Yes
poisoned_frey Must seem like only yesterday
illyrio_mopatis Seems like a lifetime ago
poisoned_frey Your husband, was he buried here as well
illyrio_mopatis No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End
poisoned_frey Such a tragedy
illyrio_mopatis A fairly predictable tragedy Hunting and drinking don't mix
poisoned_frey I should say not My son's a hunter It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle
illyrio_mopatis I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year
poisoned_frey All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
poisoned_frey I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion He had no business fighting an actual warrior We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave But they do seem to yearn for it We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing
illyrio_mopatis And yet the world belongs to them
poisoned_frey A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind
illyrio_mopatis The gods have seen fit to make it so
glover_general My father didn't want them here He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise
captured_wight I'm glad he did I'm sorry, Your Grace I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
glover_general I couldn't agree more
captured_wight Shall we go and see them If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold I've spoken with them I know how they feel about you You led the defense of King's Landing They adore you
glover_general Open the doors
illyrio_mopatis Joffrey Wait

theon_greyjoy How far is it to Deepwood Motte
drunk_patron Not far, my lord Your sister is waiting for you there
theon_greyjoy She sent you to save me
drunk_patron Yes I served them, the men who were torturing you I did what they told me and waited for the right moment
theon_greyjoy Why would you risk your life for me
drunk_patron I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord I was only a boy when they took you away My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you
theon_greyjoy Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me Did he
drunk_patron I-- I don't know, my lord They-- they never told me much
theon_greyjoy My sister's men are loyal to her We don't need to hide from them
drunk_patron Not all those are your sister's men Some of them are loyal to your father
drunk_patron What is it
theon_greyjoy I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place
drunk_patron What did he tell you to do
theon_greyjoy Raid fishing villages He didn't trust me Thought I was a Stark Ha I could never be a Stark Robb Stark always reminded me of that
drunk_patron He lorded it over you
theon_greyjoy Didn't have to All he had to do was be Be who he was born to be His life fit him better than his clothes How could someone like that ever be a brother to me He's the King in the North
theon_greyjoy And me my father gave me a choice and I made it I could never be a Stark But ironborn, that's what I was born to be I paid the iron price for Winterfell I murdered those boys
drunk_patron The Stark boys
theon_greyjoy Never found them Just some poor orphans living with a farmer I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud
drunk_patron Maybe it's not too late
theon_greyjoy It is My real father lost his head at King's Landing I made a choice and I chose wrong And now I've burned everything down
drunk_patron Not everything, my lord She's up here
theon_greyjoy Yara
drunk_patron Shh Wait
drunk_patron I brought him back He killed the others
theon_greyjoy What No, I didn't
theon_greyjoy You can't! No, please stop! No!
drunk_patron Put him back where he belongs
prendahl_na_ghezn Eat What are you doing
eyrie_guard I'm dying
prendahl_na_ghezn You can't die You need to live to take revenge
eyrie_guard I don't care about revenge
prendahl_na_ghezn You coward A little misfortune and you're giving up
eyrie_guard Misfor-- misfortune
prendahl_na_ghezn You lost your hand
eyrie_guard My sword hand I was that hand
prendahl_na_ghezn You have a taste-- one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit You sound like a bloody woman
prendahl_na_ghezn I know what you did for me You told them Tarth was full of sapphires It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water You knew that Why did you help me
eddard_stark You wanted to speak to me
illyrio_mopatis Yes, about Jaime
eddard_stark What about him
illyrio_mopatis I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back
eddard_stark When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response
illyrio_mopatis You started a war
eddard_stark And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir
illyrio_mopatis Whatever you can
eddard_stark Whatever I can
eddard_stark You're still here
illyrio_mopatis Yes
eddard_stark Why
illyrio_mopatis Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me Years and years of lectures on family and legacy-- the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations-- did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them Living by them That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children
eddard_stark All right Contribute
illyrio_mopatis The Tyrells are a problem
eddard_stark The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives
illyrio_mopatis Margaery has her claws in Joffrey She knows how to manipulate him
eddard_stark Good I wish you knew how to manipulate him I don't distrust you because you're a woman I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
illyrio_mopatis Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes
eddard_stark I will
dothraki_man_having_sex Do you like it, Nana
poisoned_frey Another golden rose How original I eat from plates stamped with roses I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better Roses are boring, dear 'Growing strong' Ha! The dullest words of any house 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable 'We do not sow' Strong Strong Those are houses you watch out for Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts But a golden rose growing strong--ha, that strikes fear in the heart
poisoned_frey Look, little loves A spider in the garden Run along now Grow strong
black_lorren My lady I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing The city has been made brighter by your presence
poisoned_frey The city is made brighter by my presence Is that your usual line, Lord Varys Are you here to seduce me
black_lorren A little obvious, perhaps
poisoned_frey Oh, no, please Seduce away It's been so long Though I rather think it's all for naught What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit A question for the philosophers But you've come mincing all this way for something So
black_lorren Might I sit
poisoned_frey No Come, I've heard you're such a clever man I'm curious why you've sought me out
black_lorren You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark
poisoned_frey Have I Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you Why shouldn't I take an interest She's an interesting girl
black_lorren Is she
poisoned_frey No, not particularly But she's had an interesting childhood
black_lorren She has, sadly Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being
poisoned_frey Come, come You surrender rather easily Walk with me I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too
black_lorren I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
poisoned_frey Which is Sansa Stark
black_lorren Neither A babe in the woods I admired her father
poisoned_frey Yes Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head
black_lorren I could not help Lord Stark Perhaps I can help his daughter
poisoned_frey How
black_lorren You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her
poisoned_frey That's hardly surprising She's a beautiful girl with a famous name
black_lorren Indeed She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor
poisoned_frey It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point
black_lorren Littlefinger is not long for the capital A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him
poisoned_frey And why have you come to me with this matter
black_lorren Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies He has acquired the first two How long before he has the army
black_lorren Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North
poisoned_frey And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket
black_lorren Which seems such a shame Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride
poisoned_frey You must despise him You're working so hard to undermine him
black_lorren Actually, I rather enjoy him But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
poisoned_frey You are a clever man, Lord Varys
black_lorren You are too kind I believe I have a possible solution
poisoned_frey One doesn't need to be clever for that It's all rather obvious, isn't it
captured_wight Ahem I didn't mean to disturb you
morag You haven't
captured_wight We'd like some privacy, please If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself
captured_wight What did you pray for
morag I can't tell you
captured_wight Why not I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter Boring and traditional, I'm afraid And you
morag I'm sorry, I just can't
captured_wight My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me Pig-face, she called me
morag Pig-face That's ridiculous
captured_wight I think it had something to do with my nose Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink
captured_wight So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease A week after that, she came down with porridge plague
morag Porridge plague
captured_wight You don't have it in the North Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony
morag But that's awful
morag You're-- I believed you! Porridge plague I'm an idiot
captured_wight Don't say that No, you're not
morag So what happened to Alanna
captured_wight Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea It's all terribly frustrating
morag I'm sure she's jealous of you now You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen
captured_wight I want us to be friends, good friends
morag That would make me very happy
captured_wight You must see Highgarden You'd love it there I know you would We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon You should see the costumes People work on them for months
morag I-- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing
captured_wight The Queen Regent, you mean Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen And if you were to marry Loras    Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it We would be sisters, you and I Would you like that
orphan_kid His name was Bannen He was a good man, a good ranger He came to us from-- where did he come from
khal_qorro Down White Harbor way

orphan_kid And now his watch has ended
frey_soldier_2 Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man

white_walker You on his side
braavosi_theatre_server We can't just show up and steal all his food We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves
white_walker The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow He's a bloody wildling is all he is
khal_qorro Never knew Bannen could smell so good
khal_forzho You have one son, don't you, Mormont I had my 99th You ever meet a man with 99 sons
khal_forzho And more daughters than I can count
orphan_kid I'm glad for you
khal_forzho Are you now Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone
orphan_kid As soon as our wounded are strong enough
khal_forzho Ah They're as strong as they're gonna get Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it Hmm Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself
karl_tanner Whose throat you gonna cut, old man
orphan_kid Wait outside
karl_tanner It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat
khal_forzho My wives gave you bread
karl_tanner There's sawdust in the bread
khal_forzho You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow
karl_tanner I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away
orphan_kid I told you to wait outside
white_walker He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die
khal_forzho I gave you crows enough I've got to feed my women!
white_walker So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then How else'd you make it through winter
orphan_kid Enough! Out!
khal_forzho I am a godly man
white_walker You're a stingy bastard!
khal_forzho Bastard Out with you, you little thief And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard
karl_tanner You are a bastard A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard

karl_tanner There are no laws beyond the Wall Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did
orphan_kid Unhand her

tortured_slave Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
tortured_slave Halt!

septa_mordane Blackstrap rum
ollys_mother Ugh!
septa_mordane Not easy finding molasses in wartime
simpson I'd have some
septa_mordane Let's go home
simpson What is this place
septa_mordane Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling
imry_florent You look like a bunch of swineherds
lannister_spearman Some of us were swineherds And some of us tanners and masons That was before
imry_florent You're still swineherds and tanners and masons You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier
meryn_trant No Fighting in a war makes you a soldier
imry_florent Beric Dondarrion You've seen better days
meryn_trant And I won't see them again
imry_florent Stark deserters Baratheon deserters You lot aren't fighting in a war You're running from it
meryn_trant Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog But here you are 1000 miles from home Which of us is running
imry_florent Untie these ropes and we'll find out What are you doing leading a mob of peasants
meryn_trant Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name
imry_florent Ned Stark is dead King Robert is dead My brother's alive
imry_florent You're fighting for ghosts
meryn_trant That's what we are-- ghosts waiting for you in the dark You can't see us, but we see you No matter whose cloak you wear-- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon-- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down
imry_florent You found god Is that it
meryn_trant Aye I've been reborn in the light of the one true god As have we all As would any man who's seen the things we've seen
imry_florent If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it
septa_mordane You'll die soon enough, dog But it won't be murder, only justice
lannister_spearman And a kinder fate than you deserve Lions you call yourselves At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched
imry_florent I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford Dump your dead children at some other door
septa_mordane House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne
imry_florent Do you take me for my brother Is being born Clegane a crime
lannister_spearman Murder is a crime
imry_florent I never touched the Targaryen babes I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not
ollys_mother You murdered Mycah The butchers boy My friend He was 12 years old He was unarmed And you rode him down You slung him over your horse like he was some deer
imry_florent Aye, he was a bleeder
meryn_trant You don't deny killing this boy
imry_florent I was Joffrey's sworn shield The boy attacked the prince
ollys_mother That's a lie! I hit Joffrey Mycah just ran away
imry_florent Then I should have killed you Not my place to question princes
meryn_trant You stand accused of murder But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by combat
imry_florent So, who will it be Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest Or you, archer What are you worth with a sword in your hand Or is the little girl the bravest one here
meryn_trant Aye She might be But it's me you'll fight
great_master_4 The master says they are untested He says you would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price
great_master_4 And who knows In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper
ghita Is it done, then They belong to me
