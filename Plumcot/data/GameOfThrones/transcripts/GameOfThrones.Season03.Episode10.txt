GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Here comes the King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King in the North!

GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Here comes the King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Here comes the King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Here comes the King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have a list.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A list of people you mean to kill?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown For laughing at me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do I look like Joffrey to you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No, death seems a bit extreme.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Fear of death, on the other hand…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You should learn to ignore them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they’ve been laughing at you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m the halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We’re perfect for each other.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So how should we punish them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Whom?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I hear that you’re a pervert.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I am the Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have certain standards to maintain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We could sheep shift Lord Desmond’s bed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown His room will stink, but he won’t know where it’s coming from.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Lady Sansa!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And she was always angry with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why “sheep shift”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s the vulgar word for “dung.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” My lady…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, you asked me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s him!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My lord, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Your father has called a meeting of the Small Council.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Killed a few puppies today?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Show him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Come on, show him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Oh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Apologies, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Old fingers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Roslin caught a fine fat trout.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Signed, “Walder Frey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Robb Stark is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And his bitch mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Write back to Lord Frey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark’s head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A joke.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Joffrey did not mean it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Yes, I did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She is no longer yours to torment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Everyone is mine to torment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’d do well to remember that, you little monster.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Oh, I’m a monster.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Monsters are dangerous, and just now kings are dying like flies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I could have your tongue out for saying that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Let him make his threats.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hmm?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s a bitter little man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Lord Tyrion should apologise immediately.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I am the King!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will punish you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Any man who must say, “I am the King,” is no true king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ll make sure you understand that when I’ve won your war for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My father won the real war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He killed Prince Rhaegar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King is tired.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown See him to his chambers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Come along.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not tired.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We have so much to celebrate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A wedding to plan.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You must rest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not tired!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Come.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Not you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re a fool if you believe he’s the most powerful man in Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A treasonous statement.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Joffrey is King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You really think a crown gives you power?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I think armies give you power.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Mmmhmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Mmmhmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Oh, I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Walder Frey gets all the credit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He never would have risked such an action if he didn’t have certain assurances.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Which he got from me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do you disapprove?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m all for cheating.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown This is war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But to slaughter them at a wedding…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Explain to me why it is more noble to kill , men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So that’s why you did it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown To save lives?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown To end the war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown To protect the family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Go ahead, write one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Northerners will never forget.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Let them remember what happens when they march on the South.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown All the Stark men are dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Winterfell is a ruin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do you think she’ll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will not rape her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Use small words.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not as bright as you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A good man does everything in his power to better his family’s position, regardless of his own selfish desires.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Does that amuse you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No, it’s a very good lesson.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Only it’s easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you’re making all the decisions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Easy for me, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown When have you ever done something that wasn’t in your interest, but solely for the benefit of the family?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The day that you were born.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Instead, I let you live.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And I brought you up as my son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Because you’re a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It’s empty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Let’s find a place to sleep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Don’t, Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Maybe we shouldn’t stay here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’d rather be out there?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There are a lot of stories about this place.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Horrible stories.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I always quite liked the horrible stories.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So did I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who’s he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Just a cook in the Night’s Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He was angry at the King for something, I don’t remember.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown When the King was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the King’s son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That night he served the pie to the King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But no matter what he does, he’s always hungry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If the Gods turned every killer into a giant white rat…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It wasn’t for murder the Gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the King’s son in a pie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He killed a guest beneath his roof.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s something the Gods can’t forgive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “The late Walder Frey,” old Tully called me because I didn’t get my men to the Trident in time for battle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He thought he was witty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Look at us now, Tully.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re dead, your daughter’s dead, your grandson’s dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I’m Lord of Riverrun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Blackfish escaped.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown An old man on the run with no allies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who does he have?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown As you say.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown They all laughed at me, all those high lords.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown They all thought they were better than me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’ll be needing a new young girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Got that to look forward to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And you, the Warden of the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No more Starks to bow and scrape to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He ignored my advice at every turn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If he’d been a trifle less arrogant…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Calling himself the “Young Wolf.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” How’s that for pomposity?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, here’s to the Young Wolf!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Forever young.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Will you move to Winterfell now that the war’s over?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown At some point perhaps.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But Winterfell’s in ruins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What happened up there?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I heard he killed all the ravens.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And after that, nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Oh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ramsay delivered the terms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The ironborn turned on Theon, as we knew they would.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown They handed him over trussed and hooded.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But Ramsay, well…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, the girls weren’t lying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You had a goodsized cock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Pork sausage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You think I’m some sort of savage?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown People talk about phantom limbs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So I’ve always wondered, do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Next time you think about naked girls, will you feel an itch?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I shouldn’t make jokes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But my father taught me to aim for their head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Kill me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sorry, what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Kill me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A little louder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Kill me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re no good to me dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We need you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You don’t look like a Theon Greyjoy any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s a name for a lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But you’re not a lord, are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re just meat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Stinking meat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You reek.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Reek!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s a good name for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What’s your name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What’s your name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Theon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What is your name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Reek.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My name is…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Reek.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Don’t kill me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sam!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sam!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Gilly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Don’t hurt us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Where are you going?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown To Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m a brother of the Night’s Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My brother, he’s in the Night’s…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Who’s your brother?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Doesn’t matter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re Jon’s brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The one who fell from the window.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No, I’m not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And I’ve heard all about Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’d be dead if it wasn’t for Jon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If you’re his brother, you’re my brother, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And anything I can do to help you, I will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Take us north of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why in the world would you want to go…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I don’t want to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How did you get through the Wall?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Does the well lead to an underground river?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Is that how you came here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Come with us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hodor can carry you to the top.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We’ll walk straight to Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Come with us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There’s nothing north but death.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If Jon is alive, then Castle Black’s where he’ll be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It’s the safest place for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There’s nowhere safe any longer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You know that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What I know is what I saw.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And if you saw it, too, you’d run the other way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How do you know all that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Night’s Watch can’t stop them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Kings of Westeros and all their armies can’t stop them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But you’re going to stop them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Please, Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have to go north.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “I give you until the full moon “to order all ironborn scum out of the North “and back to those shitstained rocks you call a home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “On the first night of the full moon, “I will hunt down every islander “still in our lands and flay them living, “the way I flayed the ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “In the box you’ll find a special gift…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Theon’s favourite toy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “He cried when I took it away from him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Leave the North now, or more boxes will follow “with more Theon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Signed, “Ramsay Snow, naturalborn son of Roose Bolton, “Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Get that out of my sight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Theon disobeyed my orders.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The boy is a fool.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He cannot further the Greyjoy line.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Get this away from me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s your son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Son?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s not a man any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s your son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s a Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Watch yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve made my decision.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And I’ve made mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to choose the best killers on the Iron Islands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Get those ropes!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to sail up the Narrow Sea, all the way to the Weeping Water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to march on the Dreadfort.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m going to find my little brother, and I’m going to bring him home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Dragonglass.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We found them at the Fist.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Someone buried them a long time ago.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Someone wanted us to find them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What are they for?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Killing White Walkers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How do you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Walker came for my baby.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And Sam…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But no one’s killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Take it, Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And the archer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I got lucky with one of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There are more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Many more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I wish you’d come with us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I wish I could.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I really do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How are you keeping?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Great.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Never better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It was just a bit of blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I should have known.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Every time a highborn asks my name, it’s trouble.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We’re not really people to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Just ways to get what you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not a highborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She called you “Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” I heard it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A recent state of affairs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sure, you were.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re here to help.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I lived below the Street of Flour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How far below?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How close to the Red Keep were you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon’s Hill, along Tanner’s Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Gin Alley.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The Street of Steel, with your armour and your knights?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You lived in the fancy part of town.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And here we are now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Yeah, we’ve come a long way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We’re all the same, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She went to great pains to point that out to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Never been with a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Never talked to a woman, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And then she comes at you, big words, no clothes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What would you have done?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She does know her way around a man’s head, I’ll give her that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So how’d you become a lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Oh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s a long story.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Better not, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m a bit busy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He rewarded me with a lordship.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You see?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Highborns.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I didn’t want to be a lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I nearly didn’t accept.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why did you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I did it for my son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I didn’t want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I wanted him to have a better life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Does he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How’d he die?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Following me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown When did you come to this strange country?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown When I was .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You were only a child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I stopped being a child when I was nine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My mother made sure of that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’ve been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father’s money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Now it’s just the drinking.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And now I’m his wife’s servant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She is a sweet young thing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown None of this is her fault.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I love that girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I would kill for her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do you think that makes it easier for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown No, I expect not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She’s young and she’s beautiful and highborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We break bread with them, but that doesn’t make us family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We’ve learned their language, but we’ll never be their countrymen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have a name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You have one name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown As do I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Here, only the family name matters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Diamonds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’d tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Get on one of those ships.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Hire servants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Start a new life, a good life, far from here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The mysterious foreign beauty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’ll have suitors lining up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why do you want me to leave?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He has the mind, the will, and the right last name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And you, you are a complication.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I know you love him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And I know it’s true love, not bought by gold and silver.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not asking you to leave him for money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown This will never be your home, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Find a true home somewhere far from here, while there’s still time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Keep up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I don’t think I can, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It’s not easy being drunk all the time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Everyone would do it, if it were easy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Leave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So, enjoying married life?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown An unhappy wife is a wine merchant’s best friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She doesn’t deserve this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Deserve?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Be careful with that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Start trying to work out who deserves what, and before long you’ll spend your days weeping for every person in the world.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There’s nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I won’t be marrying Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You’re not me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You want to make things better for Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Give her a child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown So she can have some happiness in her life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You have children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How happy would you say you are?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Not very.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But if it weren’t for my children, I’d have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown They’re the reason I’m alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Even Joffrey?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Even Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He was all I had once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Before Myrcella was born.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I used to spend hours looking at him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown His wisps of hair.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown His tiny little hands and feet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He was such a jolly little fellow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “We should have known.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Even then we should have known.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” It’s nonsense.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Whenever he was with me, he was happy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey, how it feels to have someone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Someone of your own.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown How long does it go on?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Until we’ve dealt with all our enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m telling you, that’s what she did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sounded like a cow in heat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Aye, not for long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown That’s right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Black Walder shut her up right quick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ll tell you what, though.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The hardest thing was getting that wolf’s head to stay on the body.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You sewed it on?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I bet there were , men claiming they were the one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It was me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And Malcolm and Talbott.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Took the skin right with it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone, give it a nice firm mooring and…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Mind if I keep warm?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Fuck off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But I’m hungry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Does “fuck off” mean something different where you’re from?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve got money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What kind of coin is that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It’s worth a lot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Little shit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Fool!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Where did you get the knife?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown From you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Is that the first man you’ve killed?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The first man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Next time you’re going to do something like that, tell me first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Valar Morghulis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ygritte, you know I didn’t have a choice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You always knew who I was, what I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have to go home now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I know you won’t hurt me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You know nothing, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I do know some things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I know I love you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I know you love me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But I have to go home now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I know how this must look.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What I meant was…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I swear to you, my lord…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’m not a lord, my dear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Not for many, many years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Every man who joins the Night’s Watch renounces all former titles.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Among other things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What is your name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Gilly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown For the gillyflower.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Lovely.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Yes, my…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Maester.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Master.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Maester.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And the child?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She hasn’t chosen a name yet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown His name is Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Tarly, do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s not my child, Maester Aemon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown She’s one of Craster’s wives.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I remember every word of the oath.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Night gathers and my watch begins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “The realms of men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” That means her as well as us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We didn’t build miles of ice walls feet high to keep out men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve seen it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It’s coming for all of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Thank you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Maester.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I can cook and clean and I can…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Miles better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown We had ravens at last count.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Make sure they’re all fed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Every one of them flies tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “To His Grace “King Stannis Baratheon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Invaded…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Invited “to the name day celebration “for Rylene Florent “on the first nigit…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “First night of the full moon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Why is there a “G” in night?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown There just is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Well, your father’s not going to go to that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My books are better than these boring scrolls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You could read about Balerion the Dread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’d like to see that someday.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Aye, old Balerion’s definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene’s got on offer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown But now that I’m your father’s Hand again, I have to keep him informed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The King does not have time for this drudgery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” Noblemen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown “Noblemen of Westeros, “the Night’s Watch “implores…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown ” What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Why are they ringing the bells?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Are we being attacked?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Stay here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Bar the door.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The usurper Robb Stark is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Betrayed by his bannerman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I take no credit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I have faith, and my faith has been rewarded.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I’ve seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I don’t know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman’s sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown It is evil.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And you are not an evil man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Aegon Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will not forget that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will not forgive that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown You do not need to burn the boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown And our King is still no closer to the Iron Throne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown His name is Gendry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown He’s a good lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who happens to be your nephew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown Everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown The boy must die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 #unknown What are you doing?
