frey_man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 Here comes
tyrion_lannister Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
sansa_stark What are you doing?
tyrion_lannister I have a list.
sansa_stark A list of people you mean to kill?
tyrion_lannister For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-
sansa_stark You should learn to ignore them.
tyrion_lannister My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
sansa_stark You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
tyrion_lannister The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
sansa_stark So how should we punish them?
tyrion_lannister Who? Whom?
sansa_stark Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
tyrion_lannister Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
sansa_stark I hear that you're a pervert.
tyrion_lannister I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
sansa_stark We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.
tyrion_lannister Lady Sansa!
sansa_stark My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
tyrion_lannister Why sheep shift?
sansa_stark That's the vulgar word for dung.
tyrion_lannister My lady-
sansa_stark Well, you asked me.
girl Oh! That's him!
podrick_payne My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council.
tyrion_lannister Killed a few puppies today?
joffrey_baratheon Show him. Come on, show him.
grand_maester_pycelle Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers.
tyrion_lannister 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
joffrey_baratheon Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother.  Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa  at my wedding feast.
lord_varys Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
cersei_lannister A joke. Joffrey Baratheon did not mean it.
joffrey_baratheon Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
tyrion_lannister No. She is no longer yours to torment.
joffrey_baratheon Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.
tyrion_lannister Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
joffrey_baratheon I could have your tongue out for saying that.
cersei_lannister Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
grand_maester_pycelle Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
joffrey_baratheon I am the king! I will punish you.
tywin_lannister Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.
joffrey_baratheon My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
tywin_lannister The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
cersei_lannister Come along.
joffrey_baratheon I'm not tired.
cersei_lannister We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
tywin_lannister Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
joffrey_baratheon I'm not tired!
cersei_lannister Come.
tywin_lannister Not you.
tyrion_lannister You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
tywin_lannister You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
tyrion_lannister A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
tywin_lannister You really think a crown gives you power?
tyrion_lannister No. I think armies give you power.
tywin_lannister Mm-hmm.
tyrion_lannister Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
tywin_lannister Mm-hmm.
tyrion_lannister Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.
tywin_lannister Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
tyrion_lannister I'm all for cheating. This is war.
tywin_lannister But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
tyrion_lannister So that's why you did it? To save lives?
tywin_lannister To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
tyrion_lannister The Northerners will never forget.
tywin_lannister Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
tywin_lannister I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
tyrion_lannister Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
tywin_lannister One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
tyrion_lannister I will not rape her.
tywin_lannister Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
tyrion_lannister Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
tywin_lannister The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
tywin_lannister Does that amuse you?
tyrion_lannister No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.
tywin_lannister Easy for me, is it?
tyrion_lannister When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
tywin_lannister The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.
tyrion_lannister sansa.
meera_reed It's empty.
jojen_reed Let's find a place to sleep.
hodor Hodor. Hodor.
bran_stark Don't, Hodor.
bran_stark Maybe we shouldn't stay.
meera_reed You'd rather be out there?
bran_stark There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
jojen_reed I always quite liked the horrible stories.
bran_stark So did I. Once.
bran_stark You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
meera_reed No. Who's he?
bran_stark Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
meera_reed If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-
bran_stark It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
walder_frey 'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun.
roose_bolton The Blackfish escaped.
walder_frey An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
roose_bolton As you say.
walder_frey They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
roose_bolton You'll be needing a new young girl.
walder_frey Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
walder_frey And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
roose_bolton He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-
walder_frey Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
walder_frey Well, here's to the Young Wolf!
roose_bolton Forever young.
walder_frey Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
roose_bolton At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
walder_frey Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.
roose_bolton I sent my bastard ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon Greyjoy.
walder_frey Oh. And?
roose_bolton Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon Greyjoy as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But ramsay- well ramsay has his own way of doing things.
ramsay_bolton Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock.
ramsay_bolton What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
ramsay_bolton People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
ramsay_bolton Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
ramsay_bolton Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
ramsay_bolton But my father taught me to aim for their head.
theon_greyjoy Kill me.
ramsay_bolton Sorry, what?
theon_greyjoy Kill me.
ramsay_bolton A little louder.
theon_greyjoy Kill me!
ramsay_bolton You're no good to me dead. We need you.
ramsay_bolton You don't look like a theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.
ramsay_bolton Stinking meat.
ramsay_bolton You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
theon_greyjoy theon Greyjoy.
ramsay_bolton What's your name?
theon_greyjoy Th- theon Greyjoy.
theon_greyjoy Please.
ramsay_bolton What is your name?!
theon_greyjoy Reek. My name is Reek.
bran_stark Hodor.
samwell_tarly Don't kill me!
meera_reed Who are you?
gilly Sam! Sam!
meera_reed Who are you?!
gilly Gilly. Don't hurt us.
jojen_reed Where are you going?
samwell_tarly To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
bran_stark My brother, he's in the Night's-
jojen_reed Shush.
samwell_tarly Who's your brother?
jojen_reed Doesn't matter.
samwell_tarly You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
bran_stark No, I'm not.
samwell_tarly I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
hodor Hodor.
samwell_tarly I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will.
bran_stark Take us north of the Wall.
samwell_tarly What? Why in the world would you want to go-
bran_stark I don't want to. I have to.
jojen_reed How did you get through the Wall?
meera_reed Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
samwell_tarly Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
gilly Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
samwell_tarly If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you.
jojen_reed There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
samwell_tarly What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.
jojen_reed You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
samwell_tarly How do you know all that?
jojen_reed The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
samwell_tarly But you're going to stop them?
bran_stark Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to.
balon_greyjoy 'balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.
balon_greyjoy On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'
balon_greyjoy 'Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight.
balon_greyjoy Theon  disobeyed my orders.
balon_greyjoy The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me.
yara_greyjoy He's your son.
balon_greyjoy Son? He's not a man anymore.
yara_greyjoy He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
balon_greyjoy Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
yara_greyjoy And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
yara_greyjoy I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.
man Get those ropes!
yara_greyjoy I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
bran_stark What is it?
jojen_reed Dragonglass.
samwell_tarly We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
bran_stark Why? What are they for?
samwell_tarly Killing White Walkers.
meera_reed How do you know that?
gilly The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-
meera_reed But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
samwell_tarly Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
bran_stark Take it, Hodor.
samwell_tarly And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us.
bran_stark I wish I could. I really do.
davos_seaworth How are you keeping?
gendry Great. Never better.
davos_seaworth It was just a bit of blood.
gendry I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.
davos_seaworth I'm not a highborn.
gendry She called you Ser. I heard it.
davos_seaworth A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
gendry Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.
davos_seaworth I lived below the Street of Flour.
gendry How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
davos_seaworth The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
gendry Gin Alley.
davos_seaworth The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
gendry Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me.
davos_seaworth If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
gendry You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?
davos_seaworth She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.
gendry So how'd you become a lord?
davos_seaworth Oh, that's a long story.
gendry Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.
davos_seaworth Many years ago I helped King Stannis Baratheon out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
gendry You see? Highborns.
davos_seaworth I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
gendry Why did you?
davos_seaworth I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
gendry Does he?
davos_seaworth He's dead.
gendry How'd he die?
davos_seaworth Following me.
lord_varys When did you come to this strange country?
shae When I was thirteen.
lord_varys You were only a child.
shae I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
lord_varys You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.
shae And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
lord_varys She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
shae I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
lord_varys No, I expect not.
shae She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
lord_varys We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-
shae I have a name.
lord_varys You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
shae What do you want from me, Lord varys?
lord_varys Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.
shae Why do you want me to leave?
lord_varys Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.
shae Lord varys.
shae If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
tyrion_lannister Keep up.
podrick_payne I don't think I can, my lord.
tyrion_lannister It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
cersei_lannister Leave.
cersei_lannister So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
tyrion_lannister She doesn't deserve this.
cersei_lannister Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
tyrion_lannister There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
tyrion_lannister Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
cersei_lannister I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
tyrion_lannister I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
cersei_lannister You're not me. You want to make things better for sansa? Give her a child.
tyrion_lannister So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
cersei_lannister So she can have some happiness in her life.
tyrion_lannister You have children. How happy would you say you are?
cersei_lannister Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.
tyrion_lannister Even Joffrey Baratheon?
cersei_lannister Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even 
joffrey_baratheon how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own.
tyrion_lannister How long does it go on?
cersei_lannister Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
tyrion_lannister Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
cersei_lannister Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 Aye, not for long.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 You sewed it on?
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 I did.
frey#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 What do you want?
arya_stark Mind if I keep warm?
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 Fuck off.
arya_stark But I'm hungry.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
arya_stark I've got money.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 What kind of coin is that?
arya_stark It's worth a lot.
arya_stark Sorry.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10r Little shit.
frey_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode10 Fool!
sandor_clegane Where did you get the knife?
arya_stark From you.
sandor_clegane Is that the first man you've killed?
arya_stark The first man.
sandor_clegane Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.
arya_stark Valar morghulis.
jon_snow Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.
jon_snow I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
ygritte You know nothing, jon_snow Snow.
jon_snow I do know some things. I know I love you.
jon_snow I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
samwell_tarly I know how this must look. What I meant was-
gilly I swear to you, my lord-
maester_aemon I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?
gilly Gilly.
maester_aemon Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely.
gilly Yes, my-
samwell_tarly Maester.
gilly Master.
samwell_tarly Maester.
maester_aemon And the child?
samwell_tarly She hasn't chosen a name yet.
gilly His name is Sam.
maester_aemon Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
samwell_tarly He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.
maester_aemon Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
gilly Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-
maester_aemon Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
samwell_tarly Miles better.
maester_aemon We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
davos_seaworth 'To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-'
shireen_baratheon Night.
davos_seaworth 'First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
shireen_baratheon I don't know. There just is.
davos_seaworth Well, your father's not going to go to that.
shireen_baratheon My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
davos_seaworth I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
shireen_baratheon 'His fangs were as long as bastard swords.'
davos_seaworth Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'
shireen_baratheon ' Noblemen.'
davos_seaworth 'Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-'
shireen_baratheon What is it?
shireen_baratheon Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
davos_seaworth Stay here. Bar the door.
stannis_baratheon The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
davos_seaworth And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
melisandre I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
davos_seaworth Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.
stannis_baratheon Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
davos_seaworth Aegon Targaryen.
stannis_baratheon And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
davos_seaworth On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.
stannis_baratheon He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
davos_seaworth You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-
melisandre And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
davos_seaworth His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
stannis_baratheon What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
davos_seaworth Everything.
stannis_baratheon The boy must die.
gendry What are you doing?
davos_seaworth You're leaving.
gendry Is this some kind of trick?
davos_seaworth Yes, but not on you.
davos_seaworth Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.
gendry I know not to drink seawater.
davos_seaworth Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
gendry Where should I go?
davos_seaworth You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
gendry The gold cloaks are looking for me.
davos_seaworth They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
gendry No.
davos_seaworth I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
davos_seaworth The other way.
davos_seaworth You ever been in a boat before?
gendry No.
gendry You know how to swim?
gendry No.
davos_seaworth Don't fall out. Go on.
gendry Why are you doing this?
davos_seaworth Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
davos_seaworth When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.
guard Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
samwell_tarly Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us.
pyp I don't think he can see us.
jon_snow Pyp? Sam?
samwell_tarly Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently.
man Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here.
jaime_lannister cersei.
stannis_baratheon You don't deny it?
davos_seaworth No. I let him go.
melisandre Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
davos_seaworth Aye, I do.
melisandre You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
davos_seaworth There has got to be another way.
stannis_baratheon What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
davos_seaworth I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire.
stannis_baratheon Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.
davos_seaworth I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me.
melisandre Take him away.
stannis_baratheon Why am I gonna need you?
melisandre My king.
davos_seaworth It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us.
stannis_baratheon When did you learn to read?
davos_seaworth Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
melisandre This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him.
davos_seaworth You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
stannis_baratheon I've made my decision.
melisandre He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
stannis_baratheon You see, Ser davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now.
barristan_selmy They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready.
daenerys_targaryen Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
jorah_mormont You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
daenerys_targaryen People learn to love their chains.
missandei This is daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom
daenerys_targaryen No.
daenerys_targaryen You do not owe me your freedom.  I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you.
