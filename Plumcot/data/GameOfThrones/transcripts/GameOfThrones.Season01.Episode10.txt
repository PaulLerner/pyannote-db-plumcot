yoren Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.
yoren Keep your mouth shut, boy.
arya_stark l'm not a boy!
yoren You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north.
bran_stark lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
osha Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
bran_stark You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
osha l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
bran_stark You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
bran_stark That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.
osha You see? He's not here.
rickon_stark Here, Shaggydog.
bran_stark Rickon!
osha That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
rickon_stark He doesn't like chains.
bran_stark What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
rickon_stark No, l came to see Father.
bran_stark How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
rickon_stark He was down here. l saw him.
bran_stark Saw him when?
rickon_stark Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.
osha You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –
maester_luwin Bran…
several_stark_bannermen#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 My lady. My lady. My lady.
catelyn_stark Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
catelyn_stark Shh! Shh! Shh!
robb_stark l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
catelyn_stark My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
marillionjoffrey_baratheon Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
marillion l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.
joffrey_baratheon Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?
marillion Your Grace?
joffrey_baratheon Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
marillion Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Good. Tongue it is.
marillion Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
marillion l beg you! Please, no. No!
marillion Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! No!
joffrey_baratheon l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
marillion Your Grace, please!
joffrey_baratheon You look quite nice.
sansa_stark Thank you, my lord.
joffrey_baratheon Your Grace. l'm King now.
marillion Stop! No!
joffrey_baratheon Walk with me. l want to show you something.
sandor_clegane Do as you're bid, child.
joffrey_baratheon And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.
sansa_stark No! Please, no!
joffrey_baratheon This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
sansa_stark You promised to be merciful.
joffrey_baratheon l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
sansa_stark Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –
joffrey_baratheon Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!
joffrey_baratheon Well?
sansa_stark How long do l have to look?
joffrey_baratheon As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
sansa_stark lf it please Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon That's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
sansa_stark Or maybe he'll give me yours.
joffrey_baratheon My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound.
sandor_clegane Here, girl.
joffrey_baratheon Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
sandor_clegane Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.
sandor_clegane You'll be needing that again.
jonos_bracken The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
robb_stark Renly is not the king.
jonos_bracken You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.
robb_stark That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
jonos_bracken Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
lord_galbart_glover Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
greatjon_umber My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!
rickard_karstark l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!
theon_greyjoy Am l your brother, now and always?
robb_stark Now and always.
theon_greyjoy My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
greatjon_umber The King in the North!
all#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
all#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
stark_guard Lady Stark.
catelyn_stark l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
catelyn_stark Leave us.
jaime_lannister You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Oh, l do like a violent woman.
catelyn_stark l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
jaime_lannister Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.
catelyn_stark That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
jaime_lannister But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
catelyn_stark Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
jaime_lannister What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
catelyn_stark Because of men like you.
jaime_lannister There are no men like me. Only me.
catelyn_stark My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
jaime_lannister l pushed him out the window.
catelyn_stark Why?
jaime_lannister I hoped the fall would kill him.
catelyn_stark Why?
jaime_lannister You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
lancel_lannister l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
cersei_lannister Stop talking. Get back into bed.
tywin_lannister They have my son.
tyrion_lannister The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
leo_lefford l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
addam_marbrand ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
kevan_lannister Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
tyrion_lannister There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
kevan_lannister l'm told we still have his sisters.
leo_lefford The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
addam_marbrand Kevan Lannister First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise –
tywin_lannister Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong.
tyrion_lannister Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
tywin_lannister No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
tyrion_lannister And do what?
tywin_lannister Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…
tyrion_lannister Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
tywin_lannister You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?
daenerys_targaryen Ser Jorah?
jorah_mormont Gently, gently.
daenerys_targaryen My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
jorah_mormont The boy did not live.
daenerys_targaryen Tell me.
jorah_mormont What is there to tell?
daenerys_targaryen How did my son die?
jorah_mormont He never lived, my princess. The women say –
daenerys_targaryen What do the women say?
jorah_mormont They say the child was –
mirri_maz_duur Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
daenerys_targaryen Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
mirri_maz_duur As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.
jorah_mormont Time enough for that later –
daenerys_targaryen l want to see him now.
daenerys_targaryen The khalasar is gone.
jorah_mormont A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.
daenerys_targaryen Drogo! Why is he out here alone?
jorah_mormont He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
mirri_maz_duur He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
daenerys_targaryen This is not life. When will he be as he was?
mirri_maz_duur When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
daenerys_targaryen Leave us.
jorah_mormont l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
daenerys_targaryen l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
daenerys_targaryen You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
mirri_maz_duur lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
daenerys_targaryen This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
mirri_maz_duur lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
daenerys_targaryen l spoke for you. l saved you.
mirri_maz_duur Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
daenerys_targaryen Your life.
mirri_maz_duur Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
samwell_tarly You can't!
jon_snow Get out of my way, Sam.
samwell_tarly They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
jon_snow Better than you do.
samwell_tarly What are you going to do?
jon_snow l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
samwell_tarly You can't leave us now. We need you here.
jon_snow Move.
samwell_tarly l won't let you go.
jon_snow Move.
samwell_tarly No.
jon_snow Hyah!
shae Hand of the King?
tyrion_lannister So it would seem.
shae And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
tyrion_lannister No, he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
shae He knew my name?
tyrion_lannister What?
shae He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
tyrion_lannister l believe he used the word "whore".
shae Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
shae I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
tyrion_lannister My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –
shae l know what a Hand needs.
jon_snow Ghost?
samwell_tarly@pypar@grenn Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
grenn Samwell!
pypar ls he dead?
grenn No, he's not dead.
samwell_tarly Did we get him?
grenn Come on, help me get him up.
pypar Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
jon_snow l belong with my brother.
samwell_tarly But we're your brothers now.
grenn They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
jon_snow They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
pypar Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
grenn But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
jon_snow l have to.
grenn You can't. You said the words.
jon_snow I don't care about –
samwell_tarly "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow"
jon_snow To hell with all of you.
pypar "Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
grenn "l am the sword in the darkness – "
samwell_tarly@pypar@grenn "l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”
daenerys_targaryen Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
daenerys_targaryen When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
grand_maester_pycelle Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.
grand_maester_pycelle He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.
ros So what's the thing?
grand_maester_pycelle What thing?
ros About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".
grand_maester_pycelle What? Things? What?
ros When you started, you… Never mind.
grand_maester_pycelle Let me see you out, my dear.
ros lt's all right. No need.
grand_maester_pycelle Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right.
lord_varys When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
petyr_baelish lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
lord_varys A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
petyr_baelish And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
lord_varys l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
petyr_baelish You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
lord_varys Oh, you can do better than that.
petyr_baelish When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.
lord_varys Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
petyr_baelish l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
lord_varys l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
petyr_baelish Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.
lord_varys Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
petyr_baelish But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
lord_varys And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.
petyr_baelish A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
lord_varys So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
petyr_baelish Playing our roles.
lord_varys Serving a new King.
petyr_baelish Long may he reign. My king.
lord_varys My king.
joffrey_baratheon My lords. Shall we begin?
yoren You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
arya_stark Arry.
yoren You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
hot_pie Watch yourself, midget.
lommy_greenhands He's got a sword, this one.
hot_pie What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
lommy_greenhands Maybe he's a little squire.
hot_pie He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
lommy_greenhands Let's have a look.
hot_pie l could use me a sword like that.
lommy_greenhands Take it off him.
hot_pie Give it here, midget.
lommy_greenhands Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
hot_pie l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
arya_stark You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
gendry Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
arya_stark lt was a gift.
gendry lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.
arya_stark Which are you?
gendry Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
yoren Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!
jeor_mormont Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
jon_snow My friends brought me back.
jeor_mormont l didn't say it was your honor.
jon_snow They killed my father.
jeor_mormont And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
jon_snow No.
jeor_mormont When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?
jon_snow No.
jeor_mormont Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
jon_snow Beyond the Wall?
jeor_mormont l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
rakharojorah_mormont Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
daenerys_targaryen They were not given to me to sell.
jorah_mormont Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.
daenerys_targaryen l must. You don't understand.
jorah_mormont Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
daenerys_targaryen ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
daenerys_targaryen Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.
mirri_maz_duur You will not hear me scream.
daenerys_targaryen I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
jorah_mormont Blood of my blood.
