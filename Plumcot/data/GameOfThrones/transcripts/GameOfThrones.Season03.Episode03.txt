qhono If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing--
vayon_poole Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill And don't call him "nephew" He is your king
qhono Robb knows I meant him no disr--
vayon_poole You're lucky I'm not your king I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
qhono My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles No, there's glory enough to go around
brothel_child_1 It's not about glory Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
qhono I seized an opportunity
brothel_child_1 What value was the mill
qhono The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
brothel_child_1 Is he there now Of course not
qhono We took the fight to him He could not withstand us
brothel_child_1 I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head I could have that head on a spike by now Instead, I have a mill
qhono We took hostages Willem Lannister Martyn Lannister
brothel_child_1 Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old
vayon_poole Martyn is 15, I believe
brothel_child_1 Tywin Lannister has my sisters Have I sued for peace
qhono No
brothel_child_1 Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons
qhono No
brothel_child_1 How many men did you lose
qhono But for every man we lost, the Lannisters--
brothel_child_1 We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
qhono I'm sorry I didn't know
brothel_child_1 You would have Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
vayon_poole We seem to be running short of patience here
brothel_child_1 You know who isn't Tywin Lannister
rickard_stark Intimate Lovely table Better chairs than the old small council chamber Conveniently close to your own quarters I like it
eddard_stark What news of Jaime
eddard_stark 20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is
black_lorren We are trying, my lord
eddard_stark Try harder What do we have, then
black_lorren Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name
eddard_stark Well, let him have it The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn
petyr_baelish For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children She has always been positively predisposed toward me
woodcutter A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale
petyr_baelish Titles do seem to breed titles
eddard_stark You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
rickard_stark Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended
eddard_stark Fully agreed Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin
rickard_stark Master of Coin
eddard_stark It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
rickard_stark I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it
illyrio_mopatis I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
woodcutter Hear, hear
tortured_slave He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear and the maiden fair
eyrie_guard I hope you're pleased If you had armed me, they never would have taken us
prendahl_na_ghezn You were armed when we were taken
eyrie_guard I was in chains if you recall Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound
prendahl_na_ghezn All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman' You were slower than I expected And more predictable
eyrie_guard I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
prendahl_na_ghezn And I'm a woman I was still beating you
eyrie_guard You were not beating me
prendahl_na_ghezn Maybe you were as good as people said once Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
eyrie_guard When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped More than once None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman You'd be wise not to resist
prendahl_na_ghezn Would I
eyrie_guard They'll knock your teeth out
prendahl_na_ghezn You think I care about my teeth
eyrie_guard No, I don't think you care about your teeth If you fight them, they will kill you Do you understand I'm the prisoner of value, not you Let them have what they want What does it matter
prendahl_na_ghezn What does it matter
eyrie_guard Close your eyes Pretend they're Renly
prendahl_na_ghezn If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist You'd let them do what they wanted
eyrie_guard If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me But I'm not, thank the gods
simpson If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new
septa_mordane Doesn't have to look pretty It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
ollys_mother Why are you helping him He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend
septa_mordane You're not our prisoner, little lady

lannister_spearman Better than anyone you've ever met
imry_florent A coward's weapon I like to fight up close I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him
lannister_spearman Why So you can kiss him
ollys_mother You remember the last time you were here
imry_florent Looks like every other shit inn on the road
lannister_spearman Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more
lannister_spearman Watch your head Off we go
driver#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 Walk up!
ollys_mother What are you doing We're about to leave  Hot PIE I'm staying
simpson You're what
hot_pie I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants My brother ain't no king I'm not a Stark of Winterhell
ollys_mother Winterfell

ollys_mother Good-bye, Hot Pie
hot_pie Good-bye, Arry
tortured_slave Up you go, little lady
ollys_mother Hey, Hot Pie It's really good
maester_caleotte A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war
vayon_poole It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
maester_caleotte I've missed you, Uncle Father missed you, too, from the day you left Maybe he never said it in so many words--
vayon_poole Maybe Your father was a stubborn old ox I was surprised when he died Didn't think death had the patience
maester_caleotte I'm glad you were with him I wish to the gods I had been Did you make peace in the end
vayon_poole After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name
maester_caleotte Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return I will never see them again
vayon_poole You mustn't think it We don't know the truth They could be in hiding Robb believes they're alive And he must go on believing He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail And you must remain strong for him
martyn_lannister You're Robb Stark's wife
ironborn_2 Hold still
martyn_lannister Is it true what they say about him
ironborn_2 I don't know What do they say about him
martyn_lannister That he can turn into a wolf at night
ironborn_2 True
martyn_lannister And he eats the flesh of his enemies
ironborn_2 True You're a Lannister, aren't you
martyn_lannister Martyn Lannister
ironborn_2 Martyn Lannister You've nothing to fear My husband doesn't eat children Unless it's a full moon It's not a full moon tonight, is it See Nothing to fear

grand_maester_pycelle There was
northman_rider How many men were here
pit_announcer About 300
northman_rider And you know what those men are now
northman_rider We're all the same to them-- meat for their army
pit_announcer Do you think anyone got away
northman_rider It's not impossible You don't go far betting against Mormont But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north And he lost His best fighting men are dead And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home Tormund Climb the Wall Take Orell and 20 good men And take this one He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us And if he's useful, good If not throw him off the Wall See if crows can fly
hot_pie We're finally going to war, old friend
northman_rider Hide near Castle Black When I give the signal, hit them in the night They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side
hot_pie We'll meet again
northman_rider Aye  If you do your job  Ah

ash I'm not so easily killed Men have been trying for years
ash I want you
braavosi_captain Your fires burn low, my king
braavosi_captain There is another way A better way
ash You told me your magic requires a king's blood
braavosi_captain Yes
ash I'm the one true king
braavosi_captain You are But there are others with your blood in their veins You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices The Lord of Light demands it
bear_island_maester The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace
ghita To whom
bear_island_maester To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
ghita Give me your water
rast Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death
ghita Here, drink
bear_island_maester Leave this place, Your Grace Leave tonight, I beg you
rast And what is she to do for soldiers
bear_island_maester We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr
rast Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
ghita The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents
rast How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan
bear_island_maester Three
rast Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands
rast I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi You know what I saw Butchery Babies, children, old men More women raped than you can count There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand But the Unsullied are not men They do not rape They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead
ghita Do you disagree, Ser Barristan
bear_island_maester When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace I bled beside him
rast Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died
ghita Did you know him well, Ser Barristan
bear_island_maester I did, Your Grace Finest man I ever met
ghita I wish I had known him But he was not the last dragon
great_master_4 All Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace
ghita They did not I want to buy them all
great_master_4 She wants to buy them all
shae She can't afford them The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants
great_master_4 There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor Is this what you mean by all
ghita Yes 8,000 And the ones still in training as well
meereenese_homeless_mother If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor
great_master_4 Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor
ghita I will have them all or take none Many will fall in battle I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
shae The slut cannot pay for all of this
great_master_4 Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this
shae Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more
great_master_4 Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous
shae And this is because I like the curve of her ass
great_master_4 The gold you have left is worth 10
shae What is left will buy her 10 I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
great_master_4 But good Master Kraznys will give you 20
shae Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
great_master_4 The Dothraki you have with you--
shae I will give her 3 for those
great_master_4 The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them
shae So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877
great_master_4 Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied
ghita I have dragons I'll give you one
bear_island_maester You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace
rast Khaleesi, please
shae Three dragons
ghita One
shae Two
ghita One
great_master_4 They want the biggest one
ghita Done
shae Done
ghita I'll take you as well, now You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me A token of a bargain well struck
great_master_4 She asks that you give me to her, as a present She asks that you do this now
rast Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army
bear_island_maester Aegon Targaryen proved that
ghita You're both here to advise me I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else Is that understood
ghita Do you have a name
great_master_4 This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace
ghita Do you have a family A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice
great_master_4 No, Your Grace No family living
ghita You belong to me now It is your duty to tell me the truth
great_master_4 Yes, Your Grace Lying is a great offense Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less
ghita I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment Do you know what he said to me 'Let me die'
great_master_4 There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace
ghita Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied About their obedience
great_master_4 All questions have been taken from them They obey, that is all Once they are yours, they are yours They will fall on their swords if you command it
ghita And what about you You know that I'm taking you to war You may go hungry You may fall sick You may be killed
great_master_4 Valar morghulis
ghita Yes, all men must die But we are not men
rickard_stark A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
petyr_baelish I'm surprised you're surprised This is the safest place in the city
rickard_stark Not for bastards
the_night_king That's all of them, my lord
petyr_baelish Thank you, my dear
rickard_stark Pod Pod Take them outside I'll be there in a moment
gerold_hightower Yes, my lord
petyr_baelish I hear you owe that boy a significant debt
rickard_stark Only my life Not all that significant, I'm afraid
petyr_baelish You should have him knighted
rickard_stark If only the Master of Coin had such power
petyr_baelish If only I owe you a significant debt Our redheaded friend You secured her release when the queen detained her
rickard_stark Oh, that Of course A simple misunderstanding
petyr_baelish Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship
rickard_stark We don't I did fuck her once
petyr_baelish I know
rickard_stark But we don't
petyr_baelish I know But how would the queen get that idea
rickard_stark Why don't you ask her Any advice for me on my new position
petyr_baelish Keep a low profile
rickard_stark If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are
petyr_baelish Well, you are richer than I am
rickard_stark Good point
petyr_baelish They're only numbers Numbers on paper Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave Trivial even You want a real challenge Try whores
rickard_stark I've tried quite a few Well, lots of work to do Enjoy the Eyrie
irri Come on, I'm here later Come on
irri Tonight, then Looks like dull reading
rickard_stark You think all reading is dull reading
irri It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know
rickard_stark The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages
irri Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to
rickard_stark Unless he made it all up, yes  Podrick, do keep up
gerold_hightower Yes, my lord
rickard_stark Podrick
gerold_hightower Yes, my lord
rickard_stark After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman
gerold_hightower No, my lord
rickard_stark Wonderful Genna specializes in first-timers
irri She's not bad with second-timers, either
gerold_hightower Uh, my lord
rickard_stark A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say
rickard_stark Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me
jaqens_disguise He's handsome You didn't tell me he was handsome
rickard_stark Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot
gerold_hightower My lord, I don't even
rickard_stark She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord
rickard_stark Be back in time for my supper
irri Pace yourself, lad
rickard_stark For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold
irri Let me guess He's not a magician
rickard_stark No
irri He's stealing it
rickard_stark Worse, he's borrowing it
irri What's wrong with that
rickard_stark We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it The crown owes millions to my father
irri Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt
rickard_stark Forgive a debt, my father For a man of the world, you're strangely naive
irri I've never borrowed money before I'm not clear on the rules
rickard_stark Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest
irri And what if I don't
rickard_stark Well, you have to
irri But what if I don't
rickard_stark This is why I don't lend you money Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about It's the Iron Bank of Braavos We owe them tens of millions If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies One way or another, they always get their gold back
rickard_stark Ah, the return of the conquering hero Does he have a little jaunt in his step
irri The lad's practically skipping
rickard_stark You were gone a long time I trust you got your money's worth Or should I say my money's worth
rickard_stark Oh, it was a gift, Podrick This is more than I give you in a year
irri He's a squire You don't pay him
rickard_stark Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year
gerold_hightower They wouldn't take it, my lord
irri Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin
rickard_stark Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them
irri What did you tell them
gerold_hightower I didn't tell them anything
rickard_stark What did you do to them
gerold_hightower Lots of things
rickard_stark And they seemed to like these things
gerold_hightower Yes, my lord
irri Of course they seemed to like it They're paid to seem to like it
rickard_stark Only they weren't paid
irri What are you saying These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free
rickard_stark Is that what you're telling us  {PODRICK doesn't deny it
rickard_stark Sit down, Podrick
rickard_stark We're going to need details Copious details
