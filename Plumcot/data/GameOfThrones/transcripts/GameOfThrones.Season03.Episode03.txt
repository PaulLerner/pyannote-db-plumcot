GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Why don’t you shut your mouth about that damned mill?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And don’t call him “nephew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ” He is your king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Robb knows I meant him no…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re lucky I’m not your king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wouldn’t let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My blunder sent Tywin’s mad dog back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I think King Robb understands we won’t win this war if he’s the only one winning any battles.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, there’s glory enough to go around.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s not about glory.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I seized an opportunity.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What value was the mill?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is he there now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Of course not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We took the fight to him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He could not withstand us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country, where we could surround him and kill him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I could have that head on a spike by now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Instead, I have a mill.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We took hostages.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Willem Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Martyn Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Willem and Martyn Lannister are years old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Martyn is , I believe.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Have I sued for peace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you think he’ll sue for peace because we have his father’s brother’s greatgrandsons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How many men did you lose?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But for every man we lost, the Lannisters…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I didn’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You would have.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Right here today at this gathering, if you had been patient.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We seem to be running short of patience here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You know who isn’t?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tywin Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Intimate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lovely table.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Better chairs than the old Small Council chamber.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Conveniently close to your own quarters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I like it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What news of Jaime?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown , unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We are trying, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Try harder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What do we have, then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown In Stark’s absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice, not in name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Let him have it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Titles do seem to breed titles.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’ll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish’s absence would present certain problems.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Not a good time to leave the crown’s finances unattended.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Fully agreed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Which is why I’m naming you new Master of Coin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Master of Coin?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It would appear to best suits your talents.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn’t taught me much about managing it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Hear, hear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl on the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair I hope you’re pleased.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If I were armed, they’d never have taken us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You were armed when we were taken.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I was in chains, if you recall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren’t bound.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown All my life I’ve been hearing, “Jaime Lannister, “what a brilliant swordsman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ” You were slower than I expected.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And more predictable.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ve been sitting in a muddy pen, wrapped in chains, for the past year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I was beating you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You were not beating me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Maybe you were as good as people said…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When we make camp tonight, you’ll be raped.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown More than once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’d be wise not to resist.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Would I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’ll knock your teeth out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You think I care?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, I don’t think you care about your teeth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you fight them, they will kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m the prisoner of value, not you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Let them have what they want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What does it matter?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What does it matter?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Close your eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Pretend they’re Renly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you were a woman, you wouldn’t resist?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’d let them do what they wanted?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If I was a woman, I’d make them kill me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But I’m not, thank the Gods.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If I had a proper forge, I’d make it good as new.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Doesn’t have to look pretty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Why are you helping him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He takes us prisoner, now he’s our friend?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re not our prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What am I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Our guest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No one’s put any chains on you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown So I can walk away, then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown These woods aren’t safe for Ned Stark’s daughter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re lucky we found you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You think you’re good with that bow, you little twat?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Better than anyone you’ve met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A coward’s weapon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I like to fight up close.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I like to see a man’s face when I put the steel in him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown So you can kiss him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You remember the last time you were here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Now, apologies, but you’re one ugly fucker and I’d rather not see you no more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Watch your head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Off we go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Walk up!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’re about to leave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m staying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I baked brown bread for the innkeep, she said she never had better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Told Thoros she’s keeping me as payment for all his free meals.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Anyway, it’s not me the Brotherhood wants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My brother ain’t no king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m not a Stark of Winterhell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You sure?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m sure.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, I made you something.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s a wolf.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, it is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That’s the tail?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, be safe.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yeah, you, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Don’t get stabbed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You don’t burn your fingers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Goodbye, Hot Pie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Goodbye, Arry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Up you go, little lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Hey, Hot Pie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s really good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we’re at war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It often comforts me to think that even in war’s darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ve missed you, Uncle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Father missed you, too, from the day you left.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Maybe he never said it in so many words…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Maybe?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Your father was a stubborn old ox.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I was surprised when he died.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Didn’t think death had the patience.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m glad you were with him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wish to the Gods I had been.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Did you make peace in the end?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown After years of fighting, I don’t think he remembered what started it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don’t remember my real name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I’d see him off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown “Wait for me, little Cat,” he’d say.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown “Wait for me, and I’ll come back to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ” And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wonder, how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell, waiting for me to return?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I will never see them again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You mustn’t think it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We don’t know the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They could be in hiding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Robb believes they’re alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And he must go on believing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s got to remain strong if he’s to prevail.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And you must remain strong for him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re Robb Stark’s wife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Hold still.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is it true what they say about him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What do they say about him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That he can turn into a wolf at night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown True.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown True.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re a Lannister, aren’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Martyn Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Martyn Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’ve nothing to fear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My husband doesn’t eat children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Unless it’s a full moon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s not a full moon tonight, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown See?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Nothing to fear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Always the artists.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s only horses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You said there was dead crows.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown There was.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How many men were here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown About .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And you know what those men are now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’re all the same to them, meat for their army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you think anyone got away?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s not impossible.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You don’t go far betting against Mormont.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And he lost.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown His best fighting men are dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And whether he’s Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch or a blueeyed corpse, he’s a long way from home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tormund.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Climb the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Take Orell and good men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And take this one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He knows Castle Black’s defences better than any of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And if he’s useful, good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If not, throw him off the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown See if crows can fly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’re finally going to war, old friend?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Hide near Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When I give the signal, hit them in the night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’ve got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’ll meet again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you do your job.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How will we see your signal?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Send your eagle above the Wall every night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When it’s time, I’m going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Ghost?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What have we here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Frozen crows?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’ve come a long way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Smaller flock than you went north with.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We can talk inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Oh, can we?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They need some water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tether it, and I’ll be inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Keep your eyes where they belong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’re not for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Aye, pig’s got value to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’d have turned you all away if I wasn’t a godly man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You are a godly man?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I got no fear of what’s out there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won’t help you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The only ones left will be those who are right with the Gods.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The real Gods.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Women.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Barely a grunt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And she’s almost as fat as this one here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Now why don’t you dine on him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Carve off what you need as you go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, look at him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s a walking feast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Here we are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Sharpen these for me, would ya?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I see the head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Push.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That’s it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re nearly there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown One more push should do it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Keep quiet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you can’t ride, we don’t stand a chance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I can ride.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re sure?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Ride east.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Follow the rising sun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Your sister’s waiting for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’re not in the Iron Islands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You refuse to tell me where you’re going?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I don’t know yet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The fires will show me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How long will you be gone?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re abandoning me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I will never abandon you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You are the Son of Fire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I am sworn to serve you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Then serve me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When I return, you will understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My enemies think they’ve destroyed me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’re laughing at me, the way Renly laughed at me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I want Joffrey dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I want Robb Stark dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Make me another son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I cannot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You don’t have the strength.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It would kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m not easily killed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Men have tried for years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I want you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Your fires burn low, my king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown There is another way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A better way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You told me your magic requires a king’s blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m the one true king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown There are others with your blood in their veins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The Lord of Light demands it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown To whom?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Give me your water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Here, drink.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Leave this place, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Leave tonight, I beg you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And what is she to do for soldiers?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is it “we” already, Ser Barristan?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That means blood on your hands before the thing is done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Three.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn’t die by the thousands?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I was in King’s Landing after the sack, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You know what I saw?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Butchery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Babies, children, old men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown More women raped than you can count.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown There’s a beast in every man, and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But the Unsullied are not men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They do not rape.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They do not put cities to the sword unless they’re ordered.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If you buy them, the only men they’ll kill are those you want dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You disagree, Ser Barristan?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When your brother led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they’d been bought at an auction.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I fought beside the last dragon on that day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I bled beside him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I did, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Finest man I ever met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I wish I had known him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But he was not the last dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown All?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Did this one’s ears mishear, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They did not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I want to buy them all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She wants to buy them all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She can’t afford them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The slut thinks she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown There are , Unsullied in Astapor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is this what you mean by all?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ,.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And the ones still in training as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Master Greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I will have them all or take none.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Many will fall in battle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The slut cannot pay for all of this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Her ship will buy her Unsullied, no more, Your ship will buy you Unsullied.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown and this because I like the curve of her ass.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Because Master Kraznys is generous.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What is left will buy her .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The gold you have left is worth .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I will give her if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But good Master Kraznys will give you .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Her Dothraki smell of shit, The Dothraki you have with you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown but may be useful as pig feed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I will give her for those.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown So, ask this beggar queen, Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown how will she pay for the remaining ,?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown for the remaining , Unsullied?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I have dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll give you one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Khaleesi, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Three dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown One.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Two.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown One.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They want the biggest one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll take you as well, now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’ll be Master Kraznys’ gift to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A token of a bargain well struck.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She asks that you give me to her, as a present.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She asks that you do this now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Aegon Targaryen proved that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re both here to advise me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you’ll be advising someone else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is that understood?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you have a name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown This one’s name is Missandei, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you have a family?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A mother and a father you’d return to if you had the choice?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No family living.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You belong to me now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It is your duty to tell me the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lying is a great offence.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I offered water to a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you know what he said to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown “Let me die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ” There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown About their obedience?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown All questions have been taken from them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They obey, that is all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Once they are yours, they are yours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They will fall on their swords if you command it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And what about you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You know that I’m taking you to war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You may go hungry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You may fall sick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You may be killed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Valar Morghulis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, all men must die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But we are not men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m surprised you’re surprised.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown This is the safest place in the city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Not for bastards.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown That’s all of them, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Thank you, my dear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Pod.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Pod.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Take them outside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll be there in a moment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Only my life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Not all that significant, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You should have him knighted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If only the Master of Coin had such power.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If only.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I owe you a significant debt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Our redheaded friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You secured her release when the Queen detained her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Oh, that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A simple misunderstanding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I did fuck her once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But we don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown How’d the Queen get that idea?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Why don’t you ask her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Any advice for me on my new position?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Keep a low profile.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I’d be richer than you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, you are richer than I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Good point.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’re only numbers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Numbers on paper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Once you understand that, it’s easy to make them behave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Trivial even.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You want a real challenge?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Try whores.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ve tried quite a few.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, lots of work to do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Enjoy the Eyrie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on, I’m here later.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tonight, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Looks like dull reading.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You think all reading is dull reading.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he’s really up to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Unless he made it all up, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Podrick, do keep up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Podrick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you’ve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Wonderful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Genna specialises in firsttimers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She’s not bad with secondtimers, either.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Uh, my lord…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my wouldbe killer’s face, wouldn’t you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spearhandler herself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She’s here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s handsome.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You didn’t tell me he was handsome.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My lord, I don’t even…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She’s here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow, who’s never once failed to address me as “my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown ” Be back in time for my supper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Pace yourself, lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown For years I’ve heard that Littlefinger is a magician.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Let me guess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s not a magician.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s stealing it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Worse, he’s borrowing it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What’s wrong with that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We can’t afford to pay it back, that’s what’s wrong with it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The crown owes millions to my father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Seeing as it’s his grandson’s ass on the throne, I imagine he’ll forgive that debt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Forgive a debt, my father?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown For a man of the world, you’re strangely naive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ve never borrowed money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m not clear on the rules.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The basic principle is, I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What if I don’t?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Well, you have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But what if I don’t?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown This is why I don’t lend you money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Anyway, it’s not my father I’m worried about.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown It’s the Iron Bank of Braavos.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We owe them tens of millions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown One way or another, they always get their gold back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Ah, the return of the conquering hero.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The lad’s practically skipping.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You were gone a long time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I trust you got your money’s worth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Or should I say my money’s worth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown This is more than I give you in a year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown He’s a squire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You don’t pay him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Oh, then it’s much more than I give you in a year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They wouldn’t take it, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Maybe they’re trying to curry some favour with the new Master of Coin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What did you tell them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I didn’t tell them anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What did you do to them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lots of things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And they seemed to like these things?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Of course they did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They’re paid to seem to like it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Only they weren’t paid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown What are you saying?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Is that what you’re telling us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Sit down, Podrick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown We’re going to need details.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Copious details.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You know how we deal with runaways?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Take off his pants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, no, no!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m gonna fuck you into the dirt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, no, no!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, don’t!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No, please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You little bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re a long way from home, and winter is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’ll take the big bitch first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown When she’s good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Catelyn Stark’s a treasonous cunt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Nobody said shit about you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re only making it worse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Take her over there, where it’s dark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’d like a little privacy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You know who she is, don’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown A big dumb bitch from who cares where.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Never been with a woman that big.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown She’s Brienne of Tarth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Heard of Tarth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I’m gonna cut your throat!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown They call it the Sapphire Isle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Do you know why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Sapphires are gemstones.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The blue ones.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I know what they are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter’s weight in sapphires if she’s returned to him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown But only if she’s alive, her honour unbesmirched.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Bring her back here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Yes, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Get up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Come on, on your feet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Unbesmirched.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Not defiled.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Fancy word for a fancy man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study every morning before I could practise with sword or horse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Two hours every day holed up in the maester’s chambers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I learned a lot of fancy words.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown I bet you did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Your father, he’d pay your weight in gold to get you back?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’ll be a rich man till the end of your days.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown And your sons will be rich men, and their sons after them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown Lands, titles…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’ll have them all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown The North can’t win this war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You’re a smart man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode03 #unknown You understand that.
