robb_stark We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
roose_bolton Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.
robb_stark I doubt it.
roose_bolton Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets. "A flayed man none."
robb_stark My father outlawed flaying in the North.
roose_bolton We're not in the North.
robb_stark We're not torturing them.
roose_bolton The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.

talisa_stark Talisa.
robb_stark Your last name?
talisa_stark You want to know what side my family fights on?
robb_stark You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
talisa_stark That boy lost his foot on your orders.
robb_stark They killed my father.
talisa_stark That boy did?
robb_stark The family he fights for.
talisa_stark Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
robb_stark I have no hatred for the lad.
talisa_stark That should help his foot grow back.
robb_stark You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
talisa_stark You're going to kill Joffrey?
robb_stark If the gods give me strength.
talisa_stark And then what?
robb_stark I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
talisa_stark So who will?
robb_stark I don't know.
talisa_stark You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
robb_stark First we have to win the war.
robb_stark You never told me where you're from.
talisa_stark Volantis.
robb_stark Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
talisa_stark He was unlucky that you were.
joffrey_baratheon You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
sansa_stark Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please
joffrey_baratheon Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
lancel_lannister Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
joffrey_baratheon Killing you would send your brother a message.
sansa_stark (Cries.)
joffrey_baratheon But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
joffrey_baratheon Leave her face. I like her pretty.
joffrey_baratheon Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her.
joffrey_baratheon If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.
tyrion_lannister What is the meaning of this?
tyrion_lannister What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
meryn_trant The kind who serves his king, Imp.
bronn Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.
tyrion_lannister Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
joffrey_baratheon I'm punishing her.
tyrion_lannister For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.
joffrey_baratheon You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
tyrion_lannister The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
meryn_trant No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
tyrion_lannister I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?
tyrion_lannister I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
sansa_stark I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
tyrion_lannister Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
bronn The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
tyrion_lannister You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
bronn There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
joffrey_baratheon What are you doing here, dog?
sandor_clegane Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
joffrey_baratheon And? What is it?

joffrey_baratheon Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.

renly_baratheon Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
petyr_baelish Your Grace.
renly_baratheon Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
petyr_baelish I'm a practical man.
renly_baratheon Just not a loyal one.
petyr_baelish And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
renly_baratheon I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?
renly_baratheon You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
petyr_baelish You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
renly_baratheon Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head.
petyr_baelish I would give priority to my head.
renly_baratheon (snorts)
petyr_baelish I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.
petyr_baelish Your Grace.
margaery_tyrell Lord Baelish.
petyr_baelish All of these tents look the same to me. -Would you be so kind
margaery_tyrell It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.
petyr_baelish "Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.
margaery_tyrell I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.
petyr_baelish If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.
margaery_tyrell The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
petyr_baelish And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?
margaery_tyrell You seem quite interested in our marriage.
petyr_baelish Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.
margaery_tyrell You've never married, have you?
petyr_baelish I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
margaery_tyrell That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

stannis_baratheon Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.
catelyn_stark I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
renly_baratheon Can that truly be you?
stannis_baratheon Who else might it be?
renly_baratheon When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?
stannis_baratheon My own.
renly_baratheon I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?
melisandre The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
renly_baratheon Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
stannis_baratheon Watch yourself, Renly.
renly_baratheon No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.
melisandre You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lord's chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.
renly_baratheon Born amidst salt and smoke? - Is he a ham?
stannis_baratheon That's twice I've warned you.
catelyn_stark Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
stannis_baratheon It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
catelyn_stark We share a common enemy.
stannis_baratheon The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
renly_baratheon The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power.
stannis_baratheon For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.
renly_baratheon Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?
stannis_baratheon You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
renly_baratheon No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
stannis_baratheon We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.

renly_baratheon Would you believe I loved him once?

daenerys_targaryen Horde?
daenerys_targaryen My name is Daenerys
spice_king Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
daenerys_targaryen You know me, my lord?
spice_king Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons.
daenerys_targaryen And what should I call you?
spice_king Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.
daenerys_targaryen The beauty of Quarth is legendary
daenerys_targaryen Qarth.
spice_king Might we see the dragons?
daenerys_targaryen My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored
spice_king Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
daenerys_targaryen I am not a liar.
spice_king Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
daenerys_targaryen Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.
spice_king Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
daenerys_targaryen What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
spice_king We have received you. Here we are, and here you are.
daenerys_targaryen If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
spice_king Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
jorah_mormont Khaleesi, please be careful.
daenerys_targaryen Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.
spice_king Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so
xaro_xhoan_daxos Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
spice_king The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken.
xaro_xhoan_daxos I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.
spice_king The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.

xaro_xhoan_daxos Very well. I invoke soumai.

loras_tyrell As I said several times.
tyrion_lannister And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
loras_tyrell When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
tyrion_lannister Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.

loras_tyrell You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
tyrion_lannister Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
loras_tyrell It's not my fault!
tyrion_lannister Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
loras_tyrell Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.
tyrion_lannister Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
loras_tyrell I only meant I did as I was bid.
tyrion_lannister Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

tyrion_lannister You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.
loras_tyrell Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command.
tyrion_lannister Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.
loras_tyrell But her demands?
tyrion_lannister Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.
loras_tyrell You will?
tyrion_lannister Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.

stannis_baratheon I want you to be a smuggler this time.
davos_seaworth Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?
stannis_baratheon The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
davos_seaworth I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
stannis_baratheon Cleaner ways don't win wars.
melisandre Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
davos_seaworth Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
melisandre You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
davos_seaworth I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.
melisandre If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.
davos_seaworth And which are you?
melisandre Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.
davos_seaworth Well, that must be very nice for you.
melisandre Do you love your wife?
davos_seaworth I do.
melisandre Yet you have known other women.
davos_seaworth Don't talk about my wife.
melisandre I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe.
melisandre And you will.
davos_seaworth Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
melisandre Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.
davos_seaworth These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
melisandre They can't bar our passage.
davos_seaworth Gods protect us.
melisandre There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.
