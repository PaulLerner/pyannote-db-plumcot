young_rodrik_cassel Give him another go, Ned.
bran_stark That’s my father. And my Uncle Benjen.
young_ned Keep your shield up or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
bran_stark They were all so happy.
threeeyed_raven So were you once.
young_ned Stop showing off.
young_benjen_stark Lyanna!
bran_stark My Aunt Lyanna. I’ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.
young_benjen_stark Would you get out of here? We’re sparring.
lyanna_mormont Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?
young_benjen_stark I don’t know.
lyanna_mormont What about him?
young_ned Wylis, come here.
bran_stark Hodor?
young_benjen_stark But he’s got giant’s blood.
young_ned And you’ve got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.
lyanna_mormont Benjen always lifts his chin when he’s about to charge.
young_hodor And lowers it when he’s going to dodge, my lady.
bran_stark Hodor talks?
young_nan You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. It’s no place for you.
young_ned Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, he’d be unstoppable.
young_nan Well, he’s never going to learn to fight because he’s a stable boy. So leave him be.
threeeyed_raven It is time to go.
bran_stark Please, a little longer.
bran_stark You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.
threeeyed_raven It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you’ll drown.
bran_stark I wasn’t drowning. I was home.
bran_stark Wylis.
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark Where’s Meera?
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe outside the cave.
meera_reed It’s not safe anywhere.
bran_stark I saw that Hodor wasn’t always Hodor.
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark His real name is Wylis. And he could talk and fight and -- and then --
bran_stark What’s wrong?
bran_stark The Three-Eyed Raven says there’s a war coming.
meera_reed And we’re going to fight it in there.
child_of_the_forest#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 Brandon Stark needs you.
meera_reed For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.
child_of_the_forest#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 He isn’t going to stay there forever. And out there he needs you.
alliser_thorne It’s time, Ser Davos. Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace. We’ll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs. Nobody needs to die tonight.
davos_seaworth I’ve never been much of a fighter.
davos_seaworth Apologies for what you’re about to see.
alliser_thorne Come on.
alliser_thorne Attack!
alliser_thorne Fight, you cowards!
alliser_thorne You fucking traitor.
eddison_tollett The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander’s heart.
alliser_thorne For thousands of years the Night’s Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings.
tormund_giantsbane Until you.
eddison_tollett Throw them into the cells where they belong.
tormund_giantsbane Took a lot of knives. I’ll have my men get the wood for a fire. Bodies to burn.
storyteller#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.
storyteller#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 All of a sudden she looks my way. Gives me a little smile like, “Well?” So, all right, you know, I’ve never been shy and I’m blessed down south, so I put it right out. She’s never seen anything like it. I mean, she’s used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister’s half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips. Well, you all know me. You know I wouldn’t lie about this.
cersei_lannister Get out of my way.
king’s_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 King’s orders, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister What are the king’s orders?
king’s_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection.
cersei_lannister You’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral?
king’s_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king’s command, I cannot let you pass.
cersei_lannister I would like to speak to my son.
king’s_soldier#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.
tommen_baratheon She grew up.
jaime_lannister Almost.
tommen_baratheon Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother.
jaime_lannister Your mother wouldn’t do that.
tommen_baratheon Yes, she would.
jaime_lannister Are you angry with her?
tommen_baratheon Of course not.
jaime_lannister Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here.
tommen_baratheon They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --
jaime_lannister They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you.
tommen_baratheon Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry. But I can’t.
jaime_lannister Why not?
tommen_baratheon When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?
jaime_lannister We all fail sometimes.
tommen_baratheon The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?
jaime_lannister Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.
high_sparrow Your Grace. Lord Commander.
tommen_baratheon I want to see my wife.
high_sparrow The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy. The king must wait as well.
jaime_lannister Go and see your mother, Tommen.
jaime_lannister You’re a bold man.
high_sparrow On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior.
high_sparrow Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.
jaime_lannister You must long for the next life.
high_sparrow In truth, I fear that, too.
jaime_lannister You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.
high_sparrow Your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin.
jaime_lannister What about my sins?
jaime_lannister I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?
high_sparrow You would spill blood in this holy place?
jaime_lannister Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.
high_sparrow Go on, then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the Mother’s mercy.
jaime_lannister They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.
high_sparrow I don’t. They’d never reach me before you struck.
jaime_lannister I’ve fought against worse odds.
high_sparrow No doubt many of us would fall. But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, we can overthrow an empire.
tommen_baratheon Mother.
cersei_lannister Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
tommen_baratheon Gold.
cersei_lannister Good. It was always her color.
tommen_baratheon I’m sorry for keeping you here. I shouldn’t have, but I was -- I didn’t want to lose you again.
cersei_lannister I understand. I’m glad to see you.
tommen_baratheon I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.
cersei_lannister It’s all right.
tommen_baratheon No, it isn’t.
tommen_baratheon I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me.
cersei_lannister Always.
tyrion_lannister If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time.
tyrion_lannister Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.
lord_varys I do not make dwarf jokes.
tyrion_lannister You think them.
lord_varys So, the fleet. It’s been burned.
grey_worm We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.
tyrion_lannister Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.
lord_varys Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
tyrion_lannister Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
lord_varys The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers.
tyrion_lannister What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
missandei They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
tyrion_lannister Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious.
grey_worm If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?
tyrion_lannister Dragons do not do well in captivity.
missandei How do you know this?
tyrion_lannister That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
tyrion_lannister The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?
missandei Many times.
tyrion_lannister And did they ever harm you?
missandei Never.
tyrion_lannister Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.
lord_varys Do they know that?
tyrion_lannister They will. It’s time they had their supper.
tyrion_lannister I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.
tyrion_lannister When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”
tyrion_lannister Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.
tyrion_lannister But here you are.
tyrion_lannister Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.
the_waif What’s your name?
the_waif What’s your name?
arya_stark No one.
the_waif I don’t believe that.
the_waif You don’t believe that.
jaqen_hghar Who are you?
arya_stark No one.
jaqen_hghar If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.
arya_stark A girl has no name.
jaqen_hghar If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.
arya_stark A girl has no name.
jaqen_hghar If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.
arya_stark A girl has no name.
jaqen_hghar Come.
jaqen_hghar Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.
harald_karstark He came upon the bodies on our way here.
roose_bolton Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
ramsay_bolton They obviously had help.
roose_bolton I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark.
ramsay_bolton We know where she’s going. Her brother’s at Castle Black.
harald_karstark Ned Stark’s last surviving son?
roose_bolton Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.
ramsay_bolton So was I, Father.
harald_karstark Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
ramsay_bolton Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --
roose_bolton Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.
ramsay_bolton We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us.
harald_karstark The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head. It’s time for new blood in the North.
roose_bolton If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.
maester_wolkan My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy. Red-cheeked and healthy.
harald_karstark My congratulations, Lord Bolton.
ramsay_bolton Congratulations, Father. I look forward to meeting my new brother.
roose_bolton You’ll always be my firstborn.
ramsay_bolton Thank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.
ramsay_bolton Maester Wolkan, send ravens to all the Northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead. Poisoned by our enemies.
ramsay_bolton How did he die?
maester_wolkan Poisoned by his enemies.
harald_karstark You're talking to your lord. Use respect.
maester_wolkan Forgive me, my lord.
ramsay_bolton Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
maester_wolkan She’s resting, my lord.
maester_wolkan At once, my lord.
ramsay_bolton There he is.
walda_bolton Isn’t he wonderful?
ramsay_bolton May I hold him?
walda_bolton Of course.
ramsay_bolton Little brother.
walda_bolton Lord Bolton sent for us. Have you seen him?
ramsay_bolton Of course. Follow me, Mother.
walda_bolton Where is Lord Bolton?
ramsay_bolton Down!
walda_bolton It’s all right. Come on, shh.
walda_bolton It’s cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.
walda_bolton Ramsay, where is your father? Ramsay? Where is Lord Bolton?
ramsay_bolton I am Lord Bolton.
walda_bolton Ramsay. Ramsay, please. I’ll leave Winterfell. I’ll go back to the Riverlands. Please. Ramsay. He’s your brother.
ramsay_bolton I prefer being an only child.
brienne_of_tarth I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her.
sansa_stark You don’t know which way she went?
brienne_of_tarth I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.
sansa_stark How did she look?
brienne_of_tarth She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.
sansa_stark No, she wouldn’t be.
brienne_of_tarth What happened at Winterfell?
sansa_stark I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance.
brienne_of_tarth It was a difficult choice, my lady.
brienne_of_tarth We’ve all had to make difficult choices.
theon_greyjoy We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.
sansa_stark We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us.
theon_greyjoy Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
sansa_stark I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
theon_greyjoy And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?
theon_greyjoy And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?
sansa_stark When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.
theon_greyjoy I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.
sansa_stark You’re not coming with us?
theon_greyjoy I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.
theon_greyjoy May I take one of the horses?
sansa_stark Where will you go?
theon_greyjoy Home.
yara_greyjoy The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
balon_greyjoy And the Ironborn who held it?
yara_greyjoy They died fighting to a man.
balon_greyjoy What is dead may never die.
yara_greyjoy What is dead may never die.
yara_greyjoy But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
balon_greyjoy They we will take more.
yara_greyjoy Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
balon_greyjoy Because I order it.
yara_greyjoy We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.
balon_greyjoy Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission.
yara_greyjoy I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
balon_greyjoy Then where is he?
yara_greyjoy Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.
balon_greyjoy And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.
balon_greyjoy Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.
hooded_figure#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 Haven’t I always, brother?
balon_greyjoy I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
euron_greyjoy What is dead may never die.
euron_greyjoy Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
balon_greyjoy You can mock our god without my help.
euron_greyjoy I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.
euron_greyjoy You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.
balon_greyjoy I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
euron_greyjoy They did.
balon_greyjoy And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.
euron_greyjoy I needed silence.
balon_greyjoy What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
euron_greyjoy I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way.
aeron_greyjoy Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode02 What is dead may never die.
yara_greyjoy I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
aeron_greyjoy The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
yara_greyjoy My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
aeron_greyjoy Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.
melisandre Come in.
davos_seaworth I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt.
melisandre You interrupt nothing.
davos_seaworth I assume you know why I’m here.
melisandre I will after you tell me.
davos_seaworth It’s about the Lord Commander.
melisandre The former Lord Commander.
davos_seaworth Does he have to be?
melisandre What are you asking?
davos_seaworth Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
melisandre If you want to help him, leave him be.
davos_seaworth Can it be done?
melisandre There are some with his power.
davos_seaworth How?
melisandre I don’t know.
davos_seaworth Have you seen it done?
melisandre I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn’t have been possible.
davos_seaworth But it was. It could be now.
melisandre Not for me.
davos_seaworth Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
melisandre Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.
melisandre You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
davos_seaworth Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.
davos_seaworth I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
melisandre I never had this gift.
davos_seaworth Have you ever tried?
melisandre Please.
