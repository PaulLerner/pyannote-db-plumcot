tyrion_lannister On a night like this, you came into the world.
lord_varys I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
daenerys_targaryen I wish I could remember it.
daenerys_targaryen I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
tyrion_lannister We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
daenerys_targaryen Good.
daenerys_targaryen Not so many lions.
lord_varys Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...
daenerys_targaryen They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
daenerys_targaryen People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.
daenerys_targaryen If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.
tyrion_lannister Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
daenerys_targaryen No.
tyrion_lannister We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.
daenerys_targaryen I never properly thanked you for that.
lord_varys They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.
daenerys_targaryen You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?
lord_varys I did.
daenerys_targaryen And then you served the man who overthrew him?
lord_varys I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.
daenerys_targaryen But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
lord_varys Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.
daenerys_targaryen So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
tyrion_lannister Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--
daenerys_targaryen Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?
lord_varys Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.
daenerys_targaryen So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
lord_varys Which you turned to your advantage.
daenerys_targaryen Who gave the order to kill me?
lord_varys King Robert.
daenerys_targaryen Who hired the assassins?
daenerys_targaryen Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
lord_varys Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--
daenerys_targaryen To keep yourself alive.
tyrion_lannister Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
daenerys_targaryen Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?
lord_varys The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
daenerys_targaryen Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
lord_varys I swear it, my queen.
daenerys_targaryen And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.
lord_varys I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
grey_worm Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.
melisandre Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.
daenerys_targaryen The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
melisandre I am called Melisandre.
lord_varys She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?
melisandre No, it didn't.
daenerys_targaryen You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
daenerys_targaryen We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
daenerys_targaryen The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?
melisandre Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
daenerys_targaryen What does your Lord expect from me?
melisandre The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
daenerys_targaryen The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
missandei Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.
tyrion_lannister Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?
daenerys_targaryen No, but I like it better.
daenerys_targaryen And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
melisandre Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a roll to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.
tyrion_lannister Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
daenerys_targaryen You know him?
tyrion_lannister I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
lord_varys And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?
melisandre As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
daenerys_targaryen He sounds like quite a man.
melisandre Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
tyrion_lannister I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.
tyrion_lannister If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.
daenerys_targaryen Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
sansa_stark Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
jon_snow Read the last bit.
sansa_stark "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes." What does that mean?
jon_snow It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
sansa_stark Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."
davos_seaworth Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.
jon_snow What?
davos_seaworth Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?
sansa_stark You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
davos_seaworth No, too dangerous.
jon_snow But?
davos_seaworth But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?
cersei_lannister If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.
cersei_lannister You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.
cersei_lannister It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.
randyll_tarly She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?
qyburn We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.
jaime_lannister Lord Tarley.
randyll_tarly Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son.
dickon_tarly Ser, Jaime.
jaime_lannister Rickon, isn't it?
dickon_tarly Dickon.
jaime_lannister That's it.
jaime_lannister Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
randyll_tarly If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.
jaime_lannister Do you ride for Hornhill today?
randyll_tarly I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.
jaime_lannister And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
randyll_tarly It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?
jaime_lannister I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
randyll_tarly Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
jaime_lannister You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.
randyll_tarly I've known Olenna since I was a child.
jaime_lannister She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?
jaime_lannister When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
marwyn The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
jorah_mormont How long?
marwyn It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20.
jorah_mormont But how long 'till...
marwyn Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer.
samwell_tarly Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --
marwyn Does this look like a baby to you?
samwell_tarly No.
marwyn Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
samwell_tarly No.
marwyn Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
marwyn This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
marwyn Come, Samwell.
samwell_tarly Should we send word to your family, Ser...
jorah_mormont Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
samwell_tarly Mormont?
jorah_mormont There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
marwyn Come, Samwell.
qyburn Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?
cersei_lannister No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.
qyburn Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
cersei_lannister They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
qyburn Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible.
qyburn Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed.
qyburn The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever.
yara_greyjoy If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.
tyrion_lannister If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.
ellaria_sand It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.
tyrion_lannister I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
ellaria_sand She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
daenerys_targaryen That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
daenerys_targaryen I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
olenna_tyrell That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.
daenerys_targaryen I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing.
olenna_tyrell Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
daenerys_targaryen We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
tyrion_lannister But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
tyrion_lannister Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.
ellaria_sand And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
tyrion_lannister You are.
tyrion_lannister Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
tyrion_lannister The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
olenna_tyrell So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?
tyrion_lannister The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
daenerys_targaryen Do I have your support?
yara_greyjoy You have mine.
ellaria_sand Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
daenerys_targaryen I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
olenna_tyrell Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?
olenna_tyrell He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.
grey_worm Enter.
missandei You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?
grey_worm I will see you when I return.
missandei But you don't know when that will be.
greyworm No one knows.
missandei I wish you good fortune.
grey_worm Missandei --
grey_worm It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
missandei Why?
grey_worm You know why.
missandei I don't.
grey_worm You are my weakness.
missandei That's what I am? Your weakness?
grey_worm When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.
missandei I believe it.
grey_worm Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.
missandei I do too.
grey_worm No.
missandei I want to see you. Please.
marwyn It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
samwell_tarly Archmaester, I wanted to --
marwyn And this one.
marwyn Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
samwell_tarly I wanted to ask you --
marwyn If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.
marwyn What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?
samwell_tarly Possibly something a bit more poetic?
marwyn We're not poets, Tarley.
samwell_tarly Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.
marwyn This is your moment. Use it wisely.
samwell_tarly I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
marwyn I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
samwell_tarly Oh, you are?
marwyn Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.
samwell_tarly Oh.
marwyn The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
samwell_tarly Hello.
jorah_mormont What are you doing?
samwell_tarly You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
samwell_tarly My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah.
samwell_tarly Drink this.
jorah_mormont What is it?
samwell_tarly Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.
samwell_tarly If you could take off your shirt.
samwell_tarly If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.
jorah_mormont Have you ever done this before?
samwell_tarly No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --
samwell_tarly Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode02 They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode02 Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode02 If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode02 As long as we get back there before they start.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode02 One more round. It's a long ride.
hot_pie Ary!
arya_stark Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?
arya_stark Mmm. This is good.
hot_pie You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
arya_stark I didn't do that.
hot_pie You've been making pies?
arya_stark One or two.
hot_pie I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?
arya_stark Big lady?
hot_pie The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?
arya_stark She found me.
hot_pie What happened to you Ary?
arya_stark You got any ale?
hot_pie Where are you heading?
arya_stark King's Landing.
hot_pie Why?
arya_stark I heard Cersei's queen now.
hot_pie I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.
arya_stark Hmm.
hot_pie I can't believe someone could do that.
arya_stark Cersei would do that.
hot_pie I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
arya_stark Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
hot_pie No. The Boltons are dead.
arya_stark What?
hot_pie Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.
arya_stark You're lying.
hot_pie Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?
arya_stark Thanks for the pie.
hot_pie Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.
arya_stark Thanks.
arya_stark Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed.
hot_pie No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor.
jon_snow Come in.
maester_wolkan A raven, My King, from the Citadel.
jon_snow This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
jon_snow I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
jon_snow He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.
jon_snow Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
jon_snow We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.
jon_snow But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.
sansa_stark Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
jon_snow I know that.
sansa_stark She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.
jon_snow It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.
yohn_royce Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.
robett_glover We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.
lyanna_mormont Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north.
jon_snow You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.
sansa_stark Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
jon_snow Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
sansa_stark You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
jon_snow I'm leaving both in good hands.
sansa_stark Whose?
jon_snow Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.
petyr_baelish I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
petyr_baelish I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.
jon_snow You don't belong down here.
petyr_baelish Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
jon_snow I have nothing to say to you.
petyr_baelish Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.
jon_snow Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
arya_stark Nymeria?
arya_stark Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me.
arya_stark Come with me.
arya_stark That's not you.
nymeria_sand You can't have them all. It's not fair.
obara_sand I'm oldest.
tyene_sand Momma will want Cersei for herself.
obara_sand She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.
nymeria_sand The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.
tyene_sand Father got careless. That's what Momma says.
obara_sand Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma.
tyene_sand Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
ellaria_sand How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?
yara_greyjoy A few times. Never stayed long.
ellaria_sand A boy in every port?
yara_greyjoy A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.
ellaria_sand Could we get some more?
yara_greyjoy I thought it wasn't for you.
ellaria_sand I'm developing a taste for it.
yara_greyjoy He's not your servant.
theon_greyjoy It's fine.
ellaria_sand So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.
yara_greyjoy Once I kill my uncle.
ellaria_sand And what will you be, handsome?
theon_greyjoy Whatever my queen demands.
yara_greyjoy He'll be my advisor, my protector.
ellaria_sand Oh, I see. Your protector.
ellaria_sand So if someone gets too close to you --
yara_greyjoy He might have to intervene.
ellaria_sand -- hold that person back.
yara_greyjoy Until they've made their intentions known.
ellaria_sand Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.
yara_greyjoy Stay here.
yara_greyjoy Euron.
yara_greyjoy Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.
ellaria_sand Kill us! Get it over with!
euron_greyjoy Give your uncle a kiss.
euron_greyjoy Theon!
euron_greyjoy Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her.
