davos_seaworth A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--
stannis_baratheon Horses?
davos_seaworth We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.
stannis_baratheon 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
davos_seaworth The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
stannis_baratheon Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.
davos_seaworth Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.
stannis_baratheon We’re not returning to Castle Black.
davos_seaworth Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…
stannis_baratheon Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
alliser_thorne Open the gates.
jon_snow It was a failure.
samwell_tarly It wasn’t.
jon_snow I went to save them, I failed.
samwell_tarly You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.
jon_snow I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
alliser_thorne You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.
davos_seaworth You sent for me, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.
davos_seaworth Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand.
stannis_baratheon Yes.
davos_seaworth The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.
stannis_baratheon You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command.
davos_seaworth A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
stannis_baratheon And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed.
davos_seaworth Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.
stannis_baratheon My family stays with me.
davos_seaworth At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
stannis_baratheon My family stays with me.
davos_seaworth What’s this one now?
shireen_baratheon "The Dance of Dragons
davos_seaworth Well that sounds like a proper story.
shireen_baratheon Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.
davos_seaworth But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.
shireen_baratheon And burnt him to a crisp.
davos_seaworth Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.
davos_seaworth Do you like it?
shireen_baratheon He’s beautiful.
shireen_baratheon Thank you.
davos_seaworth You’re very welcome.
shireen_baratheon Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?
davos_seaworth Of course I will.
shireen_baratheon But why am I getting a present?
davos_seaworth Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back.
shireen_baratheon You’ll just have to read it yourself.
jaime_lannister Prince Doran.
doran_martell Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.
jaime_lannister Princess Myrcella.
myrcella_baratheon Uncle.
jaime_lannister What a lovely dress.
myrcella_baratheon You don’t like it?
jaime_lannister You must be cold.
myrcella_baratheon Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
jaime_lannister Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
trystane_martell A fleabite.
ellaria_sand What are you doing in Dorne?
jaime_lannister Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.
doran_martell And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
jaime_lannister We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
myrcella_baratheon That necklace was stolen from my room.
jaime_lannister Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
doran_martell We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
ellaria_sand No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.
doran_martell And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
doran_martell King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
jaime_lannister I’m afraid he does.
doran_martell I cannot disobey my King’s command. She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.
jaime_lannister I accept.
doran_martell One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.
jaime_lannister You have my word.
ellaria_sand The word of a Kingslayer.
ellaria_sand No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
doran_martell You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t.
jaime_lannister May I inquire into the fate of my man?
doran_martell Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?
jaime_lannister He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
doran_martell Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
trystane_martell I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
jaime_lannister You’re a good man.
trystane_martell On one condition.
nymeria_sand Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don’t think, I can’t recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn’t it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.
tyene_sand You’re going to miss.
nymeria_sand I never miss.
tyene_sand You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
nymeria_sand Luck.
tyene_sand Now it’s my turn.
nymeria_sand You’re too slow. You’ve always been too slow.
bronn Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
areo_hotah You’ll find out very soon.
tyene_sand Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?
bronn The most beautiful woman in the world.
tyene_sand And that’s the truth!
nymeria_sand Slut.
jaime_lannister Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
doran_martell bronn Only the one.
jaime_lannister I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane.
bronn Prince. Sorry about the other day.
jaime_lannister Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.
bronn I’m glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
jaime_lannister There was one condition.
doran_martell Perhaps some soup instead?
arya_stark Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--
thin_man How much for your little clam?
arya_stark Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!
thin_man Come on.
thin_man Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.
mace_tyrell Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
mace_tyrell Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I’m afraid I don’t partake.
mace_tyrell Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
mace_tyrell Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Most unfortunate for the glovers.
mace_tyrell If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.
mace_tyrell You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
mace_tyrell Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
banker#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I don't have that gift.
mace_tyrell It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”
meryn_trant I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
thin_man It wasn’t bad, though.
meryn_trant The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.
meryn_trant This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.
thin_man You’re buying?
meryn_trant Oh, I’m buying. But I never was good at sharing.
brothel_keeper#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Sell your fish somewhere else.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry. Come here, sweetness.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 They say oyster’s get the juices flowing. We’ll take half a dozen.
arya_stark Three coppers.
jon_snow Here’s a silver because the lady likes you.
meryn_trant Too old.
head_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Brea.
meryn_trant Too old.
head#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.
meryn_trant Too old.
meryn_trant Do you have what I want or not?
head#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Of course. Of course.
thin_man Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.
thin_man Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I’ll have one.
head#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!
meryn_trant Good.
meryn_trant I’ll tell you when we’re done.
meryn_trant You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
head#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Of course.
head#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!
thin_man Valaar morghulis.
jaqen_hghar And?
arya_stark The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
jaqen_hghar Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
arya_stark Tomorrow.
jaqen_hghar Tomorrow.
jaqen_hghar A girl has work to do.
doran_martell Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.
doran_martell I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
ellaria_sand You write like a 7 year old.
jaime_lannister Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
ellaria_sand He didn’t try to make you pay?
ellaria_sand Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
jaime_lannister She will.
ellaria_sand You love her very much, don’t you?
jaime_lannister Of course, she’s my niece.
ellaria_sand I wasn’t talking about her.
ellaria_sand You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.
ellaria_sand I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.
shireen_baratheon Father. Aren’t you cold?
stannis_baratheon No. What are you reading?
shireen_baratheon The Dance of Dragons.
stannis_baratheon What’s it about?
shireen_baratheon It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.
stannis_baratheon “The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
shireen_baratheon That’s just what they call it.
stannis_baratheon Doesn’t make much sense.
shireen_baratheon I think it’s poetic.
stannis_baratheon If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?
shireen_baratheon I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
stannis_baratheon Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.
shireen_baratheon It’s alright, father.
stannis_baratheon You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
shireen_baratheon It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
stannis_baratheon Yes there is.
shireen_baratheon Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter.
stannis_baratheon Forgive me.
shireen_baratheon Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
melisandre It will all be over soon, Princess.
shireen_baratheon Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!
shireen_baratheon Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!
selyse_baratheon It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
melisandre The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.
selyse_baratheon If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…
melisandre Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!
shireen_baratheon Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!
selyse_baratheon I can’t.
stannis_baratheon There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
melisandre Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!
shireen_baratheon Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!
selyse_baratheon No...
daenerys_targaryen Where have you been?
hizdahr_zo_loraq Just making sure everything’s in order.
announcer#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!
pit_announcer My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph
quick#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode09 I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.
strong_fighter I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.
hizdahr_zo_loraq They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
daario_naharis That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money.
tyrion_lannister The smaller man it is.
daenerys_targaryen I’m not putting my money anywhere.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
daario_naharis People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
hizdahr_zo_loraq I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.
daenerys_targaryen Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?
daario_naharis Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.
hizdahr_zo_loraq You don’t approve?
tyrion_lannister There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Fair enough, yet -- it’s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?
tyrion_lannister It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
hizdahr_zo_loraq I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
daenerys_targaryen That is greatness?
hizdahr_zo_loraq That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
tyrion_lannister My father would have liked you.
pit_announcer We ask again
daenerys_targaryen One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
hizdahr_zo_loraq At your command?
daenerys_targaryen If need be.
pit_announcer A Meereenese champion?
hizdahr_zo_loraq How many people will die to make this happen?
daenerys_targaryen If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
daenerys_targaryen Someone else’s reason.
hizdahr_zo_loraq So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do.
tyrion_lannister Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.
pit_announcer ...or a Westerosi Knight?!
jorah_mormont I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Your Grace--
daario_naharis Shut your mouth.
tyrion_lannister You can end this.
hizdahr_zo_loraq She cannot.
tyrion_lannister You can!
daario_naharis Protect your queen!
hizdahr_zo_loraq Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--
tyrion_lannister Stay close!
jorah_mormont This way!
daario_naharis The other side, follow me!
daario_naharis Protect your queen!
daenerys_targaryen Drogon!
daenerys_targaryen Valahd..
