sansa_stark Yes?
young_nan For you, my lady.
sansa_stark How far is Mole’s Town?
petyr_baelish Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.
sansa_stark Unharmed? What are you doing here?
petyr_baelish I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
sansa_stark To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy.
sansa_stark Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?
petyr_baelish I can’t begin to contemplate --
sansa_stark What do you think he did to me?
brienne_of_tarth Lady Sansa asked you a question.
petyr_baelish He beat you.
sansa_stark Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?
petyr_baelish Sansa, I --
sansa_stark What else?
petyr_baelish Did he cut you?
sansa_stark Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
petyr_baelish I didn’t know.
sansa_stark I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
petyr_baelish I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.
sansa_stark The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.
petyr_baelish I’m so sorry.
sansa_stark You said you would protect me.
petyr_baelish And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
sansa_stark I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
petyr_baelish Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.
sansa_stark What if I want you to die here and now?
petyr_baelish Then I will die.
sansa_stark You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
petyr_baelish I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
sansa_stark I have an army.
petyr_baelish Your brother’s army.
petyr_baelish Half-brother.
the_waif You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late.
the_waif You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark.
jaqen_hghar She has a point.
jaqen_hghar None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
arya_stark Who was the first?
jaqen_hghar He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.
arya_stark Where did they go?
jaqen_hghar Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.
arya_stark A girl has no desires.
arya_stark Who?
jaqen_hghar An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.
izembaro Ahh!
izembaro Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.
clarenzo Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die.
izembaro Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
lady_crane I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?
izembaro Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
camello Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?
bobono He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.
camello We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
camello I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.
izembaro I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.
lady_crane Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
camello The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
lady_crane You cannot.
camello I can.
lady_crane You will not.
camello I will.
lady_crane You dare not.
camello I dare yes.
lady_crane The line of succession.
camello What’s that mean?
lady_crane The proper progression.
camello What’s that mean?
lady_crane The lawful ascension.
camello What’s that mean?
camello So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble.
camello But we had a deal all done and dusted.
camello I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.
bianca Save my father.
lady_crane Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
bianca Save him, please.
lady_crane Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
clarenzo Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the —
bianca Father! No! Oh, father.
bobono Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.
bobono You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
bobono So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.
clarenzo It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.
camello Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.
camello Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.
izembaro You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.
bianca I had two lines.
izembaro There are no small parts. You rang very false.
bianca I rang very false?
bobono What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.
bianca You weren’t complaining about me last night.
bobono May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?
lady_crane I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate.
bobono Of course we’re going to be intimate.
lady_crane It’s only a matter of time.
lady_crane To our children.
bobono May they have your talent.
lady_crane And your filthy mind.
arya_stark A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
arya_stark If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
jaqen_hghar A girl is not ready.
arya_stark She’s a good actress.
jaqen_hghar So a man has heard.
arya_stark Seems like a decent woman.
jaqen_hghar Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
arya_stark No. Who wants her dead?
jaqen_hghar That does not matter. The price was paid.
arya_stark The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
jaqen_hghar A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
arya_stark A girl has decided.
jaqen_hghar A servant does not ask questions.
young_nan No! No! No!
bran_stark It was you. You made the White Walkers.
leaf We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
bran_stark From whom?
leaf From you. From men.
aeron_greyjoy We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
yara_greyjoy I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 We’ve never had a queen. Not once.
yara_greyjoy There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
yara_greyjoy We are a sea people.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
yara_greyjoy Our god is a sea god.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
yara_greyjoy When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode04 You shall not be queen!
yara_greyjoy I am not finished!
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode04 Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned.
theon_greyjoy I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
theon_greyjoy And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
theon_greyjoy She is a reaver!
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
theon_greyjoy She is a warrior!
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
theon_greyjoy She is ironborn!
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 Aye!
theon_greyjoy We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
euron_greyjoy I’m Euron Greyjoy.
euron_greyjoy I claim the Salt Throne.
euron_greyjoy Niece.
euron_greyjoy Nephew. Little Theon.
euron_greyjoy Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
euron_greyjoy Explains why you think a woman can be king.
yara_greyjoy When did you return, Uncle?
euron_greyjoy A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
yara_greyjoy I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
euron_greyjoy I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
theon_greyjoy That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.
euron_greyjoy Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
euron_greyjoy Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
theon_greyjoy You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
euron_greyjoy And how will she do that?
yara_greyjoy I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
euron_greyjoy Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.
yara_greyjoy You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
euron_greyjoy I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
aeron_greyjoy May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
aeron_greyjoy Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
aeron_greyjoy Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
aeron_greyjoy What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.
aeron_greyjoy What is dead may never die.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode05 What is dead may never die.
euron_greyjoy Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.
aeron_greyjoy They stole our best ships.
euron_greyjoy Won’t be enough to save them.
euron_greyjoy Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
daenerys_targaryen I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.
jorah_mormont You must send me away.
daenerys_targaryen Is there a cure?
jorah_mormont I don’t know.
daenerys_targaryen How long does it take?
jorah_mormont I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
daenerys_targaryen I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
jorah_mormont Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.
daenerys_targaryen You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
daenerys_targaryen Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.
lord_varys In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
grey_worm None.
lord_varys And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
grey_worm Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.
lord_varys So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
grey_worm For now.
lord_varys For now is the best we get in our profession.
tyrion_lannister It’s not enough.
lord_varys Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start.
tyrion_lannister It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.
missandei The people know who brought them freedom.
tyrion_lannister Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.
lord_varys Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
tyrion_lannister Who said anything about “him”?
young_nan You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.
tyrion_lannister Welcome to Meereen.
tyrion_lannister That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.
tyrion_lannister Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
tyrion_lannister The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
kinvara You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
kinvara Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
tyrion_lannister Yes.
kinvara She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
tyrion_lannister She did indeed.
kinvara Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.
tyrion_lannister Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
kinvara You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.
tyrion_lannister I’d settle for obeyed.
kinvara I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
tyrion_lannister That sounds most excellent --
lord_varys A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.
tyrion_lannister We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
lord_varys I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
kinvara Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
lord_varys And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
tyrion_lannister My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
kinvara Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?
kinvara Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
kinvara We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.
bran_stark What?
bran_stark He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!
threeeyed_raven He touched you.
bran_stark I don’t know. He was close, but --
threeeyed_raven He touched you.
threeeyed_raven He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
bran_stark But he can’t get in.
threeeyed_raven He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.
meera_reed Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
threeeyed_raven The time has come.
bran_stark The time for what?
threeeyed_raven For you to become me.
bran_stark But am I ready?
threeeyed_raven No.
jon_snow We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.
davos_seaworth Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.
davos_seaworth The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there.
sansa_stark The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
davos_seaworth I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either.
sansa_stark How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?
davos_seaworth Precious little, my lady.
sansa_stark My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.
davos_seaworth They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win.
jon_snow There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.
sansa_stark The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door.
davos_seaworth I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
sansa_stark No, but I do.
sansa_stark Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.
davos_seaworth I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
sansa_stark My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
jon_snow How do you know that?
sansa_stark Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
davos_seaworth That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.
brienne_of_tarth I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady.
sansa_stark You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
brienne_of_tarth We can send the Blackfish a raven.
sansa_stark Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
sansa_stark Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
sansa_stark What is it?
brienne_of_tarth I don’t like leaving you here alone.
sansa_stark With Jon?
brienne_of_tarth Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --
sansa_stark Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him.
brienne_of_tarth Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
jon_snow New dress?
sansa_stark I made it myself. Do you like it?
jon_snow Year, it’s -- I like the wolf bit.
sansa_stark Good, because I made this for you.
sansa_stark I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
jon_snow Thank you, Sansa.
sansa_stark You’re welcome.
jon_snow Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.
dolorous_edd I’ll do my best.
