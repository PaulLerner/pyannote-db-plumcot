bran_stark Meera. They found us.
meera_reed I’m so sorry.
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Come with me, now.
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 The dead don’t rest.
gilly It’s so green.
baby_sam Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else.
gilly You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
gilly That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
baby_sam I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point.
baby_sam And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
gilly That Little Sam is your baby.
baby_sam Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?
gilly What did you tell your family about me?
baby_sam I told them I met you in the North.
gilly Did you tell them how far north?
baby_sam Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment.
gilly You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
baby_sam The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
gilly I think we’re here.
melessa_tarly Sam. Oh, Sam.
baby_sam Oh, hello, Mother.
melessa_tarly I never thought I’d see you again. You look wonderful.
baby_sam Oh.
baby_sam Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now.
talla_tarly Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -
melessa_tarly That’s enough, Talla.
baby_sam Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.
melessa_tarly Oh, my. You are lovely.
gilly I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
baby_sam Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.
melessa_tarly Hello, little one. It’s me, your grandmother.
melessa_tarly May I hold him?
gilly Yes, of course.
melessa_tarly You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father.
baby_sam Where is Father? And Dickon?
melessa_tarly They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
talla_tarly Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
tommen_baratheon Is there no other way?
high_sparrow You’re afraid for her?
tommen_baratheon Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
high_sparrow She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
tommen_baratheon She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
high_sparrow And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
tommen_baratheon Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
margaery_tyrell No, Your Grace.
tommen_baratheon I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
margaery_tyrell We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
tommen_baratheon Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there’s no other way.
margaery_tyrell Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?
tommen_baratheon Yes, a few times. Have you?
margaery_tyrell Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?
margaery_tyrell You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
tommen_baratheon No. No, you don’t. You- - you could never. You’re right, he’s not. He’s a lot more- -
margaery_tyrell He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
tommen_baratheon What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
tommen_baratheon I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
margaery_tyrell Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.
tommen_baratheon I don’t understand.
margaery_tyrell It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
tommen_baratheon What about Loras?
margaery_tyrell I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.
gilly It’s hard to walk in this.
baby_sam It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
baby_sam This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?
dickon_tarly Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s.
baby_sam Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.
dickon_tarly Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
baby_sam Oh, that’s a fair distance.
dickon_tarly So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
baby_sam Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.
dickon_tarly Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
baby_sam Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it’s my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She’s- - she’s quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.
melessa_tarly I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.
talla_tarly Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
randyll_tarly That’s enough of that.
melessa_tarly Samwell, would you care for more bread?
baby_sam Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.
randyll_tarly Not fat enough already?
baby_sam I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
randyll_tarly I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
baby_sam Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.
randyll_tarly I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
randyll_tarly Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
melessa_tarly Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor.
gilly He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
dickon_tarly There’s no such thing.
gilly I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
randyll_tarly Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
gilly The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
randyll_tarly Where?
baby_sam Gilly.
gilly North of the Wall.
randyll_tarly North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
randyll_tarly It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.
melessa_tarly Come, my dear. Talla.
melessa_tarly I’ve lost my appetite.
randyll_tarly He dishonors us.
melessa_tarly You dishonor yourself.
randyll_tarly Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
baby_sam I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
gilly I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
baby_sam First light.
baby_sam Say good-bye to him for me.
gilly You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are.
baby_sam Good-bye, Gilly.
gilly Sam?
baby_sam We’re leaving.
gilly What?
baby_sam Get your things.
gilly I don’t have any things.
gilly What are you doing?
baby_sam We belong together. All of us.
gilly What about your mother and sister?
baby_sam Oh, they’ll understand.
gilly Your sister’s dress.
baby_sam She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.
gilly Sam. That’s your father’s sword.
baby_sam It’s my family’s sword.
gilly Sam. Won’t he come for it?
baby_sam He can bloody well try.
clarenzo The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
clarenzo And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
clarenzo I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?
bobono Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.
bobono The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
clarenzo Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.
clarenzo I limp. And it was he…
clarenzo ...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
lady_crane My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.
lady_crane Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.
lady_crane Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.
bobono What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell.
bobono It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
izembaro You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.
izembaro No worse child ever stained this land.
izembaro Curse the day I named you.
bobono My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
bobono Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
bobono Don’t fear the winter.
bobono Fear me!
izembaro Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.
izembaro I give you Bobono.
izembaro I give you Camello.
izembaro And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.
camello Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear.
izembaro That crowd was shit.
lady_crane Girl.
lady_crane What are you doing back here?
arya_stark Nothing.
lady_crane I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
arya_stark Three times.
lady_crane Did you pay?
arya_stark No.
lady_crane I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
arya_stark You’re very good.
lady_crane My final speech is shit.
lady_crane But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good.
arya_stark So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
lady_crane How would you change it?
arya_stark The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
lady_crane What’s your name?
arya_stark Mercy.
lady_crane You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.
lady_crane Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
arya_stark I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
bianca Lady Crane, they loved you.
lady_crane They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
izembaro No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals.
izembaro But they loved her. They all love her.
camello Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.
lady_crane I do what I can with what I’m given.
izembaro With what you’re given?
lady_crane Well, I was thinking- -
izembaro Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?
izembaro Full to the tits with ideas.
lady_crane I didn’t mean- -
izembaro You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing.
izembaro You have no right to an opinion.
arya_stark Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
jaqen_hghar And?
the_waif As I expected.
jaqen_hghar A shame. A girl had many gifts.
the_waif You promised me.
jaqen_hghar Don’t let her suffer.
mace_tyrell My lord.
jaime_lannister My lord.
mace_tyrell My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!
captain#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Forward, march!
high_sparrow Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.
captain#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Company, halt! Face front! Turn!
high_sparrow Lord Tyrell.
high_sparrow Ser Jaime.
jaime_lannister Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.
high_sparrow I don’t have the authority to give them to you. And you don’t have the authority to take them.
captain#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Lock spears!
jaime_lannister I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.
high_sparrow The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.
jaime_lannister You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
high_sparrow To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
captain#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Order up!
high_sparrow Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
high_sparrow Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
waman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!
tommen_baratheon The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
mace_tyrell What’s happening?
olenna_tyrell He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening.
tommen_baratheon When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
jaime_lannister I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.
tommen_baratheon I have to answer to the gods.
jaime_lannister Not when you’re sitting in that chair.
tommen_baratheon The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.
jaime_lannister Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?
tommen_baratheon You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
walder_frey You’ve lost it?
black_walder_rivers Yes, father.
walder_frey It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.
lothar_frey He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
walder_frey You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun.
black_walder_rivers I don’t think it’s fair to blame us- -
walder_frey For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.
black_walder_rivers We don’t have the men.
walder_frey We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
black_walder_rivers The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
lothar_frey The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.
black_walder_rivers Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
walder_frey If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us.
walder_frey I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.
lothar_frey He’ll never yield, Father.
walder_frey Oh, he’ll yield.
walder_frey You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.
walder_frey Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home.
jaime_lannister I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
cersei_lannister BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
jaime_lannister I’m not going to the Riverlands.
cersei_lannister What, then?
jaime_lannister I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
cersei_lannister You can’t.
jaime_lannister He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
cersei_lannister We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can.
jaime_lannister You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
cersei_lannister It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them.
cersei_lannister They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.
cersei_lannister We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.
meera_reed Why did you help us?
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
meera_reed The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 Now he lives again.
rider#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season06.Episode06 When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.
bran_stark Who are you?
bran_stark Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
benjen_stark I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
bran_stark How?
benjen_stark The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
bran_stark Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
benjen_stark You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
bran_stark I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.
benjen_stark You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
benjen_stark Drink.
benjen_stark One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.
daario_naharis Everything all right?
daenerys_targaryen How many days’ ride to Meereen?
daario_naharis A week at best.
daenerys_targaryen How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
daario_naharis Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.
daenerys_targaryen And who has that many?
daario_naharis Nobody.
daenerys_targaryen Nobody yet.
daario_naharis So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
daenerys_targaryen I take what is mine.
daario_naharis You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
daenerys_targaryen What was I made for?
daario_naharis You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.
daenerys_targaryen Wait here.
daario_naharis I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
daenerys_targaryen Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
daenerys_targaryen I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
daenerys_targaryen Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
daenerys_targaryen Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?
daenerys_targaryen Are you with me?
daenerys_targaryen Now and always?
