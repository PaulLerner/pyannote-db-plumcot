matthos_seaworth  That's it. The tide's against us.
davos_seaworth  Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.
matthos_seaworth  You're coming home.
davos_seaworth  King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
matthos_seaworth  This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.
davos_seaworth  Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.
matthos_seaworth  Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.
davos_seaworth  Gods be good.
matthos_seaworth  God. Father
davos_seaworth  But not over them?
matthos_seaworth  Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
davos_seaworth  Well, first, we have to put it there.
matthos_seaworth  Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.
davos_seaworth  Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.
matthos_seaworth  I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.
shae  Are you afraid, my lion
tyrion_lannister  If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.
shae  I won't let them hurt you.
tyrion_lannister  I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
shae  It is now.
tyrion_lannister  You can't fuck your way out of everything.
shae  I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
grand_maester_pycelle  As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.
cersei_lannister  Your words are always wise and measured.
grand_maester_pycelle  If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King
cersei_lannister  You brought me something?
grand_maester_pycelle  Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however
cersei_lannister  I know what ten drops will bring.
grand_maester_pycelle  Your Grace, if I may ask
cersei_lannister  You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
grand_maester_pycelle  Yes. A siege is very
cersei_lannister  Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester There are so many.
grand_maester_pycelle  Your Grace.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  (singing) And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o'er his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls And not a soul to hear -
bronn  To the boys!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09 singing_lannister_soldier  Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
bronn  Drunk Lannisters.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  You've got a pretty voice.
bronn  Thank you very much.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  And I like your nose. How many times you break it?
bronn  Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Oh.
bronn  It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
bronn  Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time
bronn  Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.
prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Poor nose.
bronn  Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
bronn  Welcome, friends. This round's on me.
bronn  (whispering) I don't think he likes me.
sandor_clegane  You think you're a hard man? I know it.
bronn  It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
sandor_clegane  Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.
sandor_clegane  Only smaller.
bronn  And quicker. Eh?
sandor_clegane  Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
bronn  Aye I expect he will someday.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Here we are.
bronn  One more drink before the war? Shall we?
lord_varys  I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.
tyrion_lannister  A wedding.
lord_varys  Exactly. Podrick, is that it?
tyrion_lannister  "Is that it?" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.
lord_varys  I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
tyrion_lannister  I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
lord_varys  Do you trust him?
tyrion_lannister  Oddly enough, I do.
lord_varys  Good.
lord_varys  The map you asked for.
tyrion_lannister  There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.
lord_varys  Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
tyrion_lannister  I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
lord_varys  That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.
tyrion_lannister  Well, I'm not.
lord_varys  For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess
tyrion_lannister  What of it?
lord_varys  You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?
tyrion_lannister  Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?
lord_varys  I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
tyrion_lannister  Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.
lord_varys  And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.
tyrion_lannister  No, I don't believe you have.
lord_varys  One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.
matthos_seaworth  They're welcoming the new king.
davos_seaworth  I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
matthos_seaworth  Drums!
tyrion_lannister  Remember, wait till the ships
bronn  The ships are in the bay.
tyrion_lannister  They must be far enough in
bronn  I know what "in" means. Do you know how to use that?
tyrion_lannister  I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother
bronn  I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
bronn  Don't get killed.
tyrion_lannister  Nor you, my friend.
bronn  Oh, are we friends now?
tyrion_lannister  Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
bronn  Enhances it, really.
tyrion_lannister  Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.
bronn  Been spending time with fancy folks.
tyrion_lannister  Lady Sansa and Sheila.
shae  Shae.
tyrion_lannister  Shae, yes. Surely my sister
sansa_stark  She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
joffrey_baratheon  Sansa.
tyrion_lannister  Always been a great romantic, my nephew
joffrey_baratheon  Sansa, come here.
sansa_stark  I will pray for your safe return, my lord.
tyrion_lannister  Will you?
sansa_stark  Just as I pray for the king
tyrion_lannister  Stay safe, my lady.
shae  And you, my lion
joffrey_baratheon  Your king You should see him off with a kiss.
joffrey_baratheon  My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it.
joffrey_baratheon  You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.
sansa_stark  Will you slay him yourself?
joffrey_baratheon  If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
sansa_stark  So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
joffrey_baratheon  A king
sansa_stark  I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.
joffrey_baratheon  Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.
shae  Some of those boys will never come back.
sansa_stark  Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
shae  Shh. Come, my lady.
lancel_lannister  Where's our fleet?
tyrion_lannister  On the way.
joffrey_baratheon  Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
joffrey_baratheon  Hound, tell the Hand that his king
sandor_clegane  The king
tyrion_lannister  Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the kingthat the Hand The Hand
joffrey_baratheon  If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.
tyrion_lannister  That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
davos_seaworth  Where are their ships?
matthos_seaworth  It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
davos_seaworth  Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
matthos_seaworth  If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.
davos_seaworth  Maybe.
sansa_stark  I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
shae  Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
sansa_stark  I doubt it.
shae  Maybe she's jealous of you.
sansa_stark  Why would she be jealous?
cersei_lannister  Sansa.
cersei_lannister  I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?
sansa_stark  Yes.
cersei_lannister  Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
shae  I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here?
cersei_lannister  Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.
sansa_stark  But we have guards to defend us.
cersei_lannister  Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
cersei_lannister  The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
cersei_lannister  The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
sansa_stark  You said he was here to protect us.
cersei_lannister  He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
joffrey_baratheon  There they are.
tyrion_lannister  Archers to their marks.
singing_lannister_soldier  Archers, to your marks!
singing_lannister_soldier  Archers! Nock your arrows!
soldier_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Nock arrows!
tyrion_lannister  Hold fast.
singing_lannister_soldier  Hold fast!
joffrey_baratheon  What are you doing? We need to attack them.
tyrion_lannister  Hold fast.
singing_lannister_soldier  Boulders ready!
soldier_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Hold fast!
joffrey_baratheon  There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?
matthos_seaworth  There's only one ship.
davos_seaworth  Archers, stand to! Man the below! - Nock.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Nock and set!
davos_seaworth  Draw! Hold.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Hold.
davos_seaworth  (confused) There's no one on board.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  More rocks coming up!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Hold.
davos_seaworth  Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
davos_seaworth  Matthos! Get down!
stannis_baratheon  Prepare to land.
singing_lannister_soldier  Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon  The dwarf has played his little trick.
singing_lannister_soldier  The wildfire.
stannis_baratheon  He can only play it once.
singing_lannister_soldier  We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers Hundreds will die.
stannis_baratheon  Thousands.
stannis_baratheon  Come with me and take this city!
cersei_lannister  Sansa, come here, little dove.
sansa_stark  My queen What are you doing? Praying.
cersei_lannister  You're perfect, aren't you?
sansa_stark  Praying.
cersei_lannister  What are you praying for?
sansa_stark  For the gods to have mercy on us all.
cersei_lannister  Oh. On all of us?
sansa_stark  Yes, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  Even me?
sansa_stark  Of course, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  Even Joffrey?
sansa_stark  Joffrey is my
cersei_lannister  Oh, shut up, you little fool Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father My mother I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother I was four.
sansa_stark  Your father
cersei_lannister  He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.
cersei_lannister  One for her.
cersei_lannister  Here. Sit. Drink.
cersei_lannister  Not like that. Drink, girl
cersei_lannister  I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
sansa_stark  They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
cersei_lannister  It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.
sansa_stark  And if the city should fall?
cersei_lannister  You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.
cersei_lannister  Have I shocked you, little dove The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.
cersei_lannister  Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!
tyrion_lannister  He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.
joffrey_baratheon  They're coming. They're coming ashore.
tyrion_lannister  Rain fire on them.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Archers!
joffrey_baratheon  There are too many.
tyrion_lannister  Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.
podrick_payne  Yes, my lord.
sandor_clegane  Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too.
sandor_clegane  Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Pull, pull! Go!
singing_lannister_soldier  Nock! Draw!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Draw! Draw!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Kill the Lannisters!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Loose! - Loose!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Form the line!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!
stannis_baratheon  To the Mud Gate, go now!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!
sandor_clegane  Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse. He and LANCEL engage with the sieging forces. They each cut down a number of Baratheon men before LANCEL is struck in the chest by an arrow. He stumbles and screams. Panting, he retreats.
cersei_lannister  When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.
sansa_stark  You were Robert's queen.
cersei_lannister  And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
cersei_lannister  Pretty.
cersei_lannister  That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.
cersei_lannister  Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
shae  A few weeks, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  When did you leave Lorath?
cersei_lannister  I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
shae  (smiles)
cersei_lannister  But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
shae  Ten years ago, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?
shae  Shae, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister  Tell us a story, Shae.
shae  When I was 13, I
lancel_lannister  Your Grace!
cersei_lannister  What news?
lancel_lannister  The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.
cersei_lannister  Where is Joffrey?
lancel_lannister  On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
cersei_lannister  Bring him back inside at once.
lancel_lannister  Your Grace
cersei_lannister  What?
lancel_lannister  The king
cersei_lannister  Bring him back to his chambers now.
lancel_lannister  Not here?
cersei_lannister  With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
lancel_lannister  No, but I
cersei_lannister  Now!
cersei_lannister  When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Help me!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Fall back! Fall back!
stannis_baratheon  Get the ladders up!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!
sandor_clegane  Someone bring me a drink.
sandor_clegane  Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
tyrion_lannister  Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
sandor_clegane  Eat shit, dwarf.
tyrion_lannister  You're on the wrong side of the wall.
sandor_clegane  I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
joffrey_baratheon  Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.
tyrion_lannister  You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king
sandor_clegane  Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Loose!
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Put your backs into it!
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  All right, get up!

men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Heave! Heave!
lancel_lannister  Your Grace, the queen
tyrion_lannister  If you won't defend your own city, why should they?
joffrey_baratheon  What would you have me do?
tyrion_lannister  Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
joffrey_baratheon  What did my mother
lancel_lannister  She did not say, Your Grace.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  All men to the battlements!
joffrey_baratheon  Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncleand represent the king
mandon_moore  (nods)
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Stand fast!
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  No! Get up, you fool.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  We need more arrows!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Who are we fighting for?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Who leads us?
tyrion_lannister  I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Yes.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  What are you talking about?
tyrion_lannister  Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.
tyrion_lannister  There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Heave! Heave!
tyrion_lannister  Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Heave! Heave! Heave!
tyrion_lannister  Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
lancel_lannister  The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.
cersei_lannister  Where is my son
lancel_lannister  I want to escort him back to the battle.
cersei_lannister  Why do I care what you want? Bring me
lancel_lannister  Now listen to me
sansa_stark  Don't be afraid. The queen This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...
alltogether#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Save our sons from war, we pray
shae  You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
sansa_stark  Come with me.
shae  I need to say goodbye to someone.
sansa_stark  The queen
shae  No one is raping me.
shae  Go. Run.
sandor_clegane  The lady is starting to panic.
sansa_stark  What are you doing here?
sandor_clegane  Not here for long. I'm going.
sansa_stark  Where?
sandor_clegane  Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be.
sansa_stark  What about the king
sandor_clegane  He can die just fine on his own.
sandor_clegane  I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.
sandor_clegane  I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?
sansa_stark  I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
sandor_clegane  Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father Your brother Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.
sansa_stark  You won't hurt me.
sandor_clegane  No, little bird
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Heave!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!
tyrion_lannister  Attack!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Roll it over!
alltogether#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode09  Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
tyrion_lannister  Oh, fuck me.
cersei_lannister  Shh! Be calm, my sweet.
tommen_baratheon  They're still fighting.
cersei_lannister  No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
tommen_baratheon  The Kingswood?
cersei_lannister  Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.
tommen_baratheon  Like what?
cersei_lannister  Like stags.
tommen_baratheon  Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.
cersei_lannister  And wolves.
podrick_payne  My lord.
cersei_lannister  He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, "You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid.
cersei_lannister  "For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head.
cersei_lannister  " And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"
cersei_lannister  "Yes," said his mother. "You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
cersei_lannister  " I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
