GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord, cast your light upon us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord of Light, defend us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Show us the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Strike this man down if he is guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Give strength to his sword if he is true.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord of Light, give us wisdom, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown For the night is dark and full of terrors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Get back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Kill him!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Bring him back from death and darkness.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Restore his flame.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown For the night is dark and full of terrors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord, cast…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Arya, don’t!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Bring him back from death and darkness…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Let go of me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Let me go!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher’s boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Burn in hell!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But not today.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tell me what you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There are four to a patrol, two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How often do these patrols go out?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It varies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’d like to know that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There are castles guarding the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How many are manned?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Three.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You sure of that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Which three?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aye, Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Everyone knows Castle Black.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Which others?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown EastwatchbytheSea and the Shadow Tower.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How many men remain in Castle Black?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A thousand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Liar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What happens to your eagle after I kill you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut, or does he just flop dead to the ground?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s no crow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Just ’cause you want him inside, you don’t make him one of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m not afraid of you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I like you, boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But if you lie to me, I’ll pull your guts out through your throat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A thousand men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’ll find out soon enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t need you to protect me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Of course you do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Who vouched for you with Mance?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It seems you owe me a debt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Give it back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Well, I stole it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If you want it, come steal it back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ygritte!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ygritte!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ygritte!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Seven hells.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ygritte!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is Orell right?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Are you still a crow?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s time you proved yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ygritte.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You swore some vows.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want you to break ’em.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want you to see me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown All of me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We shouldn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We should.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why are you still dressed?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You know nothing, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That thing you did with your mouth…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You seemed to like it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aye, I liked it some.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Who taught you that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There’s been no one else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Only you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A maid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You were a maid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I was a man of the Night’s Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How about you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Were you a maid?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What do you think?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Who was he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Just a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He came trading with his brothers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He had red hair like me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Kissed by fire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He was weak.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not like you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That was the first one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then there was this Thenn boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Spoke no Common, but, Gods, he was built like a mammoth…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yeah, thanks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I think I’ve heard enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’d best get back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tormund…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m not done with you yet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How long’s it been since you had a bath?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Let’s not go back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Let’s stay here a while longer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not ever.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want my gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It says clearly on that note, you’ll be paid when the war is over.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Piss on that!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re nothing but thieves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’re outlaws.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Outlaws steal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re lucky we didn’t kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Come try it, archer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll shove those arrows up your ass.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You can’t let him go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s a murderer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not in the eyes of God.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You can’t!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Enough!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The judgement isn’t ours to make.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Lord of Light isn’t done with you yet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Riders coming through!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Down!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown On your knees.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Pick him up, Locke.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ve lost a hand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No, my lord, he has it here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Take this away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Send it to his father?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Cut her free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Apologies, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re under my protection now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thank you, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Find suitable rooms for our guests.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’ll speak later.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is there word from the capital?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You haven’t heard?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Stormed the gates with thousands of men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And your sister…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How can I put this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your sister…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is alive and well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your father’s forces prevailed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ser Jaime isn’t well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Take him to Qyburn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Will I die?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The corruption has spread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I fear it must be cut away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then you’ll die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re no maester.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Where’s your chain?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Citadel stripped me of it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They found some of my experiments too bold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t need my right hand to kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown With any luck, that will suffice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll need milk of the poppy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No milk of the poppy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There will be pain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll scream.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Quite a bit of pain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll scream loudly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord Baelish.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Of course, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I believe that House Tyrell don’t hold the crown’s best interests at heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I see.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My father’s a practical man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He appreciates facts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Myself, I often find them a hindrance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I shall do my best.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I assure you that it will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Gods, boy, that’s enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’re not in a tavern.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Pardon, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No need to speak.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Are there any figs?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Fetch some.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I always take figs midafternoon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They help move the bowels.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown To what do I owe this summons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thank you for seeing me, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s the royal wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m told you had a hand in planning it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Naturally.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s shaping up to be a very involved affair.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The word “extravagant” has been used.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What good is the word “extravagant” if it can’t be used to describe a royal wedding?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I understand that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown As of now, it’s a huge expense.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And we’re at war, Lady Olenna.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Oh, I’d nearly forgotten.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And maintaining supply lines…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can’t think how it slipped my mind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What is it, , infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown , mounted lances.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown , in support.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Provisions, so this city might survive the winter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A million bushels of wheat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown , head of cattle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown , sheep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You don’t have to lecture me about wartime expenses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m quite familiar with them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And we are grateful for your contributions, which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown As is a royal wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The people are hungry for more than just food.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They crave distractions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And if we don’t provide them, they’ll create their own.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A royal wedding is much safer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Wouldn’t you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I would.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Where did you go for them, Volantis?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My lady…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Oh, very well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I won’t have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’ll pay for half, and the celebrations will go on as planned.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is that sufficient?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Quite.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Very good, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That’s settled.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Good day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Give me that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Just mending Lord Beric’s armour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m going to stay and smith for the Brotherhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Have you lost your mind?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown When the Lannisters find this place, you think they’ll spare the smiths?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They’ll cave your head in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You don’t have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They need good men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Robb needs good men, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’re leaving tomorrow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And then you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Serve him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve served men my entire life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I served Master Mott at King’s Landing, and he sold me to the Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I’d get tortured or killed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m done serving.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He may be their leader, but they chose him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown These men are brothers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They’re a family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve never had a family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can be your family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You wouldn’t be my family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’d be “my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” Willem.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Willem!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is this a rescue?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lannister filth!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Take him!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Please, I didn’t do anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m just a squire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Please…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Bring them in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is that all of them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not murder, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Vengeance.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Vengeance?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Those boys didn’t kill your sons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I saw Harrion die on the battlefield, and Torrhen…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Was strangled by the Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They were his kin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They were boys!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Look at them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tell your mother to look at them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She killed them as much as I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My mother had nothing to do with this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This was your treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s treason to free your enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown In war, you kill your enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Did your father not teach you that, boy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Leave him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Leave me to the King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That’s how he deals with treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Our King in the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Hang the rest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mercy!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I didn’t kill anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I only watched for the guards.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This one was only the watcher.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Hang him last, so he can watch the others die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Please!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Please, no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They made me do it!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They made me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They made me!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Word of this can’t leave Riverrun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They were Tywin Lannister’s nephews.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Lannisters pay their debts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They never stop talking about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Would you make me a liar as well?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It wouldn’t be lying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m not fighting for justice if I don’t serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He has to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Karstarks are Northmen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They won’t forgive the killing of their lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your mother’s right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You tended to their wounds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You brought them supper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Now they’re dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You need Karstark men to end it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Spare his life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Keep him as a hostage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A hostage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tell the Karstarks that as long as they’re loyal, he will not be harmed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I fought the Mad King for your father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I fought Joffrey for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We are kin, Stark and Karstark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That didn’t stop you from betraying me, and it won’t save you now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t want it to save me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Kneel, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here, in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Would you speak a final word?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Kill me and be cursed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You are no king of mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Cersei.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ilyn Payne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ser Meryn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Hound.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What are you going to do with me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown At first light we’ll ride for Riverrun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your brother’s there now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’ll make a contribution to our cause, and you can go home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m a hostage and you’re selling me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Don’t think of it that way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But it is that way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And it isn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown More is than isn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown So, why don’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We need the gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Do I frighten you, child?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re angry with me, and I don’t blame you, but letting him go was the right thing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I have more reason to want him hanged.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I thought he killed you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But how…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thoros, how many times have you brought me back?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s the Lord of Light who brings you back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m just the lucky drunk who says the words.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How many times?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Five, I think.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No, this makes six.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Six.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There was the first time.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Mountain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Show her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lance right through the chest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then I was stabbed in the belly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then it was an arrow in the back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And that axe in the side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Both.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Fuckers couldn’t decide.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And the Hound makes six.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Second time I’ve been killed by a Clegane.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’d think you’d learn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s not getting any easier, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Every time I come back, I’m a bit less.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Pieces of you get chipped away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Could you bring back a man without a head?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not six times.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Just once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t think it works that way, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He was a good man, Ned Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s at rest now, somewhere.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I would never wish my life upon him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I would.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lord, cast your light upon me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Protect me in the darkness.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Burn away my sins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Help me serve you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Use me as you will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown For the night is dark and full of terrors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I meant to come sooner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The battle…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I know of your troubles, my King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yes, of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You mustn’t despair.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your claim is true.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You will be victorious.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I believed that once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You are the One God’s champion and the finest man I’ve ever known.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Selyse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve broken a sacred vow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve sinned.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve wronged you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I have shamed you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re doing God’s work.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You don’t understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Red Woman…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Lady Melisandre…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I know, Stannis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown When she told me, I wept with joy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Oh, my sweet boys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Petyr, Tommard, Edric.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I thank God every day for bringing Melisandre to us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She gave you a son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I gave you nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That’s not true.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown So, you’ve come to see her as well?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There is no need.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You must keep away from such distractions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’s my daughter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I want to see her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You are a king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You don’t need my permission.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The sea I know, I know Oh, oh, oh The birds have scales And the fish take wing I know, I know Oh, oh, oh Shireen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Father!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ve grown since I last saw you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mother said you fought in a battle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Did you win?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He fought bravely.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He hasn’t come to visit me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He said he’d bring me back a present from the capital.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He won’t be visiting, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Look.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He made this for me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But don’t tell Mother I have it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s a secret.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mother doesn’t like the Onion Knight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ser Davos is a traitor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Best forget him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not so hard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll scrub the skin off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What are you doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I need a bath.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Help me out of these rags.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Now get out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There’s another tub.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This one suits me fine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Don’t worry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m not interested.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If I faint, pull me out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why should I care how you die?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You swore a solemn vow, remember?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re supposed to get me to King’s Landing in one piece.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not going so well, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No wonder Renly died, with you guarding him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That was unworthy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Forgive me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You protected me better than most…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Don’t you mock me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m apologising.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m sick of fighting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Let’s call a truce.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You need trust to have a truce.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I trust you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There it is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There’s the look.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve seen it for years, on face after face.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You all despise me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Oathbreaker.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A man without honour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ve heard of wildfire?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Mad King was obsessed with it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He burned lords he didn’t like.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He burned anyone who was against him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Before long, half the country was against him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aerys saw traitors everywhere, so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city, beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Under houses, stables, taverns.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Even beneath the Red Keep itself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Finally, the day of reckoning came.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But my father arrived first, with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I knew my father better than that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s never been one to pick the losing side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I told the Mad King as much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I urged him to surrender peacefully.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But the King didn’t listen to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He didn’t listen to Varys, who tried to warn him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “You can trust the Lannisters,” he said.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” So, we opened the gates, and my father sacked the city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Once again, I came to the King, begging him to surrender.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He told me to bring him my father’s head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Then he turned to his pyromancer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “Burn them all,” he said.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “Burn them in their homes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Burn them in their beds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Would you have kept your oath then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown First, I killed the pyromancer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And then, when the King turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “Burn them all,” he kept saying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “Burn them all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” I don’t think he expected to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I slit his throat to make sure that didn’t happen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That’s where Ned Stark found me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If this is true…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why didn’t you tell anyone?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why didn’t you tell Lord Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You think the honourable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown By what right does the wolf judge the lion?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown By what right?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Help!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Help!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Kingslayer!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My name is Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Onion Knight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Ser Onion Knight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Princess?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Gods, what are you doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Shh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll wake Bert.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Bert?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s the fat one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s on guard duty tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Go back to your room.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re not supposed to be here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If your father knew…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He said you were a traitor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I am, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I’m paying the price.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t care.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You must get bored down here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I brought you something to read.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s about Aegon and his dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aegon used to live here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Did you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And the Targaryens built this castle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown So they did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You can hide the book under your cloak.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s a good one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll bring you more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thank you, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m sure it’s a fine book, but it’s wasted on me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Take it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I have more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My lady, I can’t read the words.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You can’t?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll teach you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll come when Bert’s on duty and teach you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s easy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’ll be fun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What will they do, lock us in cells?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I wouldn’t know where to start.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown At the beginning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This word is “Aegon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” When you see “A,” “E,” and “G” together like that, it sounds like “egg.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” And the title of the whole book is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It was a bitch of a siege.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You were first through the breach at Pyke?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The second.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Thoros of Myr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Bloody madman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Robert knighted you after the battle?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Proudest moment of my life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown One knee in the dust, the King’s sword on my shoulder, listening to the words, “In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown ” All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown In full plate metal for hours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the King’s boots.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Robert would have laughed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He was a good man, a great warrior.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And a terrible king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You swore an oath.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And a man of honour keeps his vows, even if he’s serving a drunk or a lunatic.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Just once in my life before it’s over, I want to know what it’s like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Do you believe in her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown With all my heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown These are the ones?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yes, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The officers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You did not choose this life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But you are free men now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And free men make their own choices.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Remove your helmet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This one has the honour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What is your name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Grey Worm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Grey Worm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Names that remind them what they are…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Vermin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown From this day forward, you will choose your own names.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Throw away your slave name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown A name that gives you pride.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown “Grey Worm” gives me pride.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It is a lucky name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The name this one was born with was cursed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown King Robert wanted her dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Of course he wanted her dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’s a Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The last Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I suppose no one on the Small Council could speak sense to him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I didn’t sit on the Small Council.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Doesn’t the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert’s friends during his rebellion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He didn’t want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Can’t say I minded much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I always hated the politics.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yeah, I imagine I would, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Mmmhmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Still, she’ll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’ll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Which men do you have in mind?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Forgive me for what I’m about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It suffered for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I sold men into slavery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Our cause?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the Khaleesi against King Robert’s assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We both want her to rule.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Am I wrong?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You only joined us a few days ago.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can’t speak to your intentions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If we’re truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re not Lord Commander here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re just another exile.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And I take my orders from the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Come to bed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You were right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Karstarks are gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Almost half our forces.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Only wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Don’t let him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What can I do?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Attack King’s Landing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There’s nothing he’d like better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’d crush us in a day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We could ride north.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Take your land back from the Greyjoys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Wait out the winter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Winter could last five years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they’ll never ride south again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Now we’re like a band of bickering children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Give them a new purpose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t even know where Winterfell is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And we’re here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown King’s Landing…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can’t force them to meet us in the field and I can’t attack them where they’re strongest, but I can attack them where they’re not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And Casterly Rock can’t run away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m going to take their home away from them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Can you do it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn’t already sided with the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Walder Frey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s such a splendid fighter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Do you have any idea when we might…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It should grow quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Joffrey won’t let me leave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown He’s got too many reasons to keep me here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And only one to let you go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Because it will please me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Squire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Well fought, ser.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That was no fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I don’t know you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Olyver, if it please you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown How did you know?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Know what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That I wanted to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My lord…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll have you know I’m to be married soon, and even my intended hasn’t the slightest notion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown They rarely do, in my experience.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You have a good deal of experience, do you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown With the husbands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That didn’t take long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Well, it took long enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Who’s the lucky girl?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she’s mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve always wanted a ship.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Now I want a dozen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Strange, isn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What is?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It doesn’t matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your hair is different.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Lady Margaery wears it that way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Many ladies wear it this way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I have good news.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ll be leaving the city soon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You still want me to come with you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s not a question of what I want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It’s what you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You want to go home, don’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown More than anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown But maybe it would be better to wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’ve been thinking how dangerous it would be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not just for me, but for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ve been so kind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’d feel terrible if anything happened to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can’t tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I hope you know that I’m your friend, Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your true friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I do, Lord Baelish.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Petyr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Petyr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We’ll speak again when I return.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re late.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What’s she doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Our business concerns her, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Sit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I’ve saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Never mind that now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We have something important to discuss.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I’m Master of Coin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Saving money is important.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Stop that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re making me uncomfortable.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Very well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’s a lovely girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Missing some of Loras’ favourite bits, but I’m sure they’ll make do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Your jokes are not appreciated.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown It wasn’t my best, but…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I bring them into the royal fold, and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Sansa is the key to the North?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I seem to remember she has an older brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Karstarks have marched home.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Young Wolf has lost half his army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown His days are numbered.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell, and I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Do you really think it’s wise to refuse them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There’s nothing to refuse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This is a plot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Plots are not public knowledge.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And the Tyrells won’t carry this one out until after Joffrey’s wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And how do we do that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Wonderful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yes, it is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You can’t mean it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I can and I do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Joffrey’s made this poor girl’s life miserable since the day he took her father’s head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Now she’s finally free of him, and you give her to me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown That’s cruel, even for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Do you intend on mistreating her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The girl’s happiness is not my concern, nor yours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’s a child!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She’s flowered, I assure you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown She and I have discussed it at length.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown There, you see?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Surely you’re capable of that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And if I refuse?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You wanted to be rewarded for your valour in battle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown And it is past time you were wed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I was wed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Or don’t you remember?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Only too well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You should be thanking the Gods for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown This is more than you deserve.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tyrion will do as he’s bid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown As will you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown What do you mean?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ll marry Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I will not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown The boy is heir to Highgarden.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown No, I won’t do it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Yes, you will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re still fertile.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You need to marry again and breed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’re my daughter!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You will do as I command, and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumours about you once and for all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Father, don’t make me do it again, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown Not another word.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown My children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode05 #unknown You’ve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
