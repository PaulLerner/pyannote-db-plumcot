prendahl_na_ghezn Thank you, my lord  Roose BOLTON Find suitable rooms for our guests We'll speak later
eyrie_guard Lord Bolton
eyrie_guard Is there word from the capital  Roose BOLTON You haven't heard Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing Sailed into Blackwater Bay Stormed the gates with thousands of men And your sister How can I put this Your sister is alive and well Your father's forces prevailed
camello Ser Jaime isn't well Take him to Qyburn
eyrie_guard Will I die
dothraki_woman_having_sex No The corruption has spread I fear it must be cut away The safest course would be to take the whole arm off
eyrie_guard Then you'll die You're no maester Where's your chain
dothraki_woman_having_sex The Citadel stripped me of it They found some of my experiments too bold I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow
eyrie_guard I don't need my right hand to kill you
dothraki_woman_having_sex I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine
eyrie_guard Mmm
dothraki_woman_having_sex With any luck, that will suffice You'll need milk of the poppy
eyrie_guard No milk of the poppy
dothraki_woman_having_sex There will be pain
eyrie_guard I'll scream
dothraki_woman_having_sex Quite a bit of pain
eyrie_guard I'll scream loudly
illyrio_mopatis Lord Baelish
petyr_baelish Your Grace
illyrio_mopatis I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
petyr_baelish Of course, Your Grace
illyrio_mopatis I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart
petyr_baelish I see And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin
illyrio_mopatis My father's a practical man He appreciates facts
petyr_baelish Myself, I often find them a hindrance
illyrio_mopatis And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital
petyr_baelish I shall do my best
illyrio_mopatis Thank you And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark
petyr_baelish I assure you that it will
poisoned_frey Gods, boy, that's enough We're not in a tavern
gerold_hightower Pardon, my lady
poisoned_frey No need to speak Are there any figs Fetch some I always take figs midafternoon They help move the bowels To what do I owe this summons
rickard_stark Thank you for seeing me, my lady I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters
poisoned_frey I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters
rickard_stark It's the royal wedding I'm told you had a hand in planning it
poisoned_frey Naturally
rickard_stark It's shaping up to be a very involved affair The word extravagant has been used
poisoned_frey What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding
rickard_stark I understand that
poisoned_frey Good
rickard_stark But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown As of now, it's a huge expense
poisoned_frey And
rickard_stark And we're at war, Lady Olenna
poisoned_frey Oh, I'd nearly forgotten
rickard_stark Yes, and maintaining supply lines--
poisoned_frey I can't think how it slipped my mind What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied 2,000 in support Provisions so this city might survive the winter A million bushels of wheat Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye 20,000 head of cattle 50,000 sheep You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses I'm quite familiar with them
rickard_stark And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm
poisoned_frey As is a royal wedding The people are hungry for more than just food They crave distractions And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces A royal wedding is much safer Wouldn't you say
rickard_stark I would
poisoned_frey And traditionally paid for by the royal family
poisoned_frey I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper Where did you go for them, Volantis
rickard_stark My lady--
poisoned_frey Oh, very well I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned Is that sufficient
rickard_stark Quite sufficient Thank you
poisoned_frey Very good, then That's settled Good day
rickard_stark Give me that
ollys_mother What are you doing
simpson Just mending Lord Beric's armor
ollys_mother Why
simpson I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood
ollys_mother Have you lost your mind When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths They'll cave your head in with your own helmet
simpson The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood
ollys_mother You don't have to do this
simpson I want to They need good men
ollys_mother Robb needs good men, too We're leaving tomorrow And then you--
simpson What Serve him I've served men my entire life I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed I'm done serving
ollys_mother You just said you were serving Lord Beric
simpson He may be their leader, but they chose him These men are brothers They're a family I've never had a family
ollys_mother I can be your family
simpson You wouldn't be my family You'd be 'my lady
martyn_lannister 'Willem Willem!
little_bird Is this a rescue Rickard KARSTARK Lannister filth! Take him!
brothel_child_1 Bring them in
brothel_child_1 Is that all of them It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires
rickard_karstark Not murder, Your Grace Vengeance
brothel_child_1 Vengeance Those boys didn't kill your sons I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen--
rickard_karstark Was strangled by the Kingslayer They were his kin
brothel_child_1 They were boys! Look at them
rickard_karstark Tell your mother to look at them She killed them as much as I
brothel_child_1 My mother had nothing to do with this This was your treason
rickard_karstark It's treason to free your enemies In war, you kill your enemies Did your father not teach you that, boy
brothel_child_1 Leave him
rickard_karstark Aye Leave me to the king He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free That's how he deals with treason Our King in the North Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North
brothel_child_1 Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon Hang the rest
tortured_slave Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone I only watched for the guards
brothel_child_1 This one was only the watcher Hang him last so he can watch the others die
tortured_slave Please! Please, no They made me do it! They made me! They made me!
qhono Word of this can't leave Riverrun They were Tywin Lannister's nephews The Lannisters pay their debts They never stop talking about it
brothel_child_1 Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer
qhono It wouldn't be lying We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done
brothel_child_1 I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn He has to die
maester_caleotte The Karstarks are Northmen They won't forgive the killing of their lord
ironborn_2 Your mother's right If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you
brothel_child_1 You tended to their wounds You brought them supper Now they're dead
ironborn_2 And more boys will keep dying until this war is over You need Karstark men to end it
maester_caleotte Spare his life Keep him as a hostage
qhono A hostage Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed
rickard_karstark The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy I fought the Mad King for your father I fought Joffrey for you We are kin-- Stark and Karstark
brothel_child_1 That didn't stop you from betraying me And it won't save you now
rickard_karstark I don't want it to save me I want it to haunt you to the end of your days
brothel_child_1 Kneel, my lord
brothel_child_1 Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die Would you speak a final word
rickard_karstark Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine
ollys_mother Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne Ser Meryn The Hound What are you going to do with me
septa_mordane At first light we'll ride for Riverrun Your brother's there now He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home
ollys_mother I'm a hostage and you're selling me
septa_mordane Don't think of it that way
ollys_mother But it is that way
septa_mordane It is And it isn't
ollys_mother More is than isn't
septa_mordane Beric admired your father a great deal, you know He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether
ollys_mother So why don't you
septa_mordane We need the gold
meryn_trant Do I frighten you, child
ollys_mother No
meryn_trant You're angry with me And I don't blame you But letting him go was the right thing I have more reason than most to want him hanged
ollys_mother I thought he killed you
meryn_trant He did
ollys_mother But how
meryn_trant Thoros how many times have you brought me BACKTHOROS It's the Lord of Light brings you back I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words
meryn_trant How many times
septa_mordane Five, I think No, this makes six
meryn_trant Six
septa_mordane There was the first time-- the Mountain Show her Lance right through the chest
meryn_trant Then I was stabbed in the belly
septa_mordane Then it was an arrow in the back And that axe in the side
meryn_trant Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye
septa_mordane Both Fuckers couldn't decide
septa_mordane And the Hound makes six
meryn_trant Second time I've been killed by a Clegane
septa_mordane You'd think you'd learn It's not getting any easier, you know
meryn_trant I know Every time I come back, I'm a bit less Pieces of you get chipped away
ollys_mother Could you bring back a man without a head Not six times Just once
septa_mordane I don't think it works that way, child
meryn_trant He was a good man, Ned Stark He's at rest now, somewhere I would never wish my life upon him
ollys_mother I would You're alive

brothel_patron_5 Oh, my sweet boys Petyr, Tommard, Edric I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us She gave you a son I gave you - nothing
ash That's not true

eyrie_guard I need a bath Help me out of these rags
eyrie_guard Now get out
prendahl_na_ghezn There's another tub
eyrie_guard This one suits me fine Don't worry I'm not interested If I faint, pull me out I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub
prendahl_na_ghezn Why should I care how you die
eyrie_guard You swore a solemn vow, remember You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece Not going so well, is it No wonder Renly died with you guarding him
eyrie_guard That was unworthy Forgive me You protected me better than most--
prendahl_na_ghezn Don't you mock me
eyrie_guard I'm apologizing I'm sick of fighting Let's call a truce
prendahl_na_ghezn You need trust to have a truce
eyrie_guard I trust you
eyrie_guard There it is There's the look I've seen it for 17 years on face after face You all despise me Kingslayer Oathbreaker A man without honor You've heard of wildfire
prendahl_na_ghezn Of course
eyrie_guard The Mad King was obsessed with it He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones He burned lords he didn't like He burned Hands who disobeyed him He burned anyone who was against him Before long, half the country was against him Aerys saw traitors everywhere So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city-- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom Under houses, stables, taverns Even beneath the Red Keep itself Finally, the day of reckoning came Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels I knew my father better than that He's never been one to pick the losing side I told the Mad King as much I urged him to surrender peacefully But the king didn't listen to me He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender He told me to bring him my father's head Then he turned to his pyromancer 'Burn them all,' he said 'Burn them in their homes Burn them in their beds' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it Would you have kept your oath then
eyrie_guard First, I killed the pyromancer And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back 'Burn them all,' he kept saying 'Burn them all' I don't think he expected to die He-- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen That's where Ned Stark found me
prendahl_na_ghezn If this is true why didn't you tell anyone Why didn't you tell Lord Stark
eyrie_guard Stark You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me By what right does the wolf judge the lion By what right

rast It was a bitch of a siege
bear_island_maester Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke
rast The second Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his
bear_island_maester Thoros of Myr Bloody madman Robert knighted you after the battle
rast Proudest moment of my life One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss
rast In full plate metal for 16 hours Never occurred to me till the fighting was over I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots
bear_island_maester Robert would have laughed He was a good man, a great warrior And a terrible king I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings
rast You swore an oath
bear_island_maester Yes And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in Do you believe in her
rast With all my heart

rast King Robert wanted her dead
bear_island_maester Of course he wanted her dead She's a Targaryen The last Targaryen
rast I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him
bear_island_maester I didn't sit on the small council
rast No Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally--
bear_island_maester Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion
bear_island_maester He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King Can't say I minded much I always hated the politics
rast Yeah, I imagine I would, too Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over
bear_island_maester Mm-hmm
rast Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms
bear_island_maester She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience
rast Which men do you have in mind
bear_island_maester Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years
rast It suffered for a reason I sold men into slavery
bear_island_maester I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
rast Our cause Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man
bear_island_maester We both want her to rule Am I wrong
rast You only joined us a few days ago I can't speak to your intentions
bear_island_maester If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride

ironborn_2 Come to bed
brothel_child_1 You were right
brothel_child_1 The Karstarks are gone Almost half our forces Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel Nothing Only wait
ironborn_2 Don't let him
brothel_child_1 What can I do Attack King's Landing There's nothing he'd like better He'd crush us in a day
ironborn_2 We could ride north Take your land back from the Greyjoys Wait out the winter
brothel_child_1 Winter could last five years Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission Now we're like a band of bickering children
ironborn_2 Give them a new purpose
brothel_child_1 What
ironborn_2 Oh, I don't know I don't even know where Winterfell is
brothel_child_1 Here And we're here King's Landing--
ironborn_2 What is it
brothel_child_1 I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not
brothel_child_1 And Casterly Rock can't run away I'm going to take their home away from them
ironborn_2 Can you do it
brothel_child_1 I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry-- Walder Frey
morag He's such a splendid fighter Do you have any idea when we might

petyr_baelish If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay
petyr_baelish We'll speak again when I return
eddard_stark You're late
rickard_stark What's she doing here
eddard_stark Our business concerns her, too Sit
rickard_stark You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding
eddard_stark Never mind that now We have something important to discuss
rickard_stark I'm Master of Coin Saving money is important
rickard_stark Stop that You're making me uncomfortable
eddard_stark Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras
rickard_stark Very well She's a lovely girl Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do
eddard_stark Your jokes are not appreciated
rickard_stark It wasn't my best, but--
eddard_stark I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me
rickard_stark Sansa is the key to the North I seem to remember she has an older brother
eddard_stark The Karstarks have marched home The young wolf has lost half his army His days are numbered Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells
rickard_stark The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war Do you really think it's wise to refuse them
eddard_stark There's nothing to refuse This is a plot Plots are not public knowledge And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding We need to act first and kill this union in its crib
rickard_stark And how do we do that
eddard_stark We find Sansa Stark a different husband
rickard_stark Wonderful
illyrio_mopatis Yes, it is
rickard_stark You can't mean it
eddard_stark I can and I do
rickard_stark Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me That's cruel even for you
eddard_stark Do you intend on mistreating her The girl's happiness is not my concern, - nor should it be yours
rickard_stark She's a child!
illyrio_mopatis She's flowered, I assure you She and I have discussed it at length
eddard_stark There, you see You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her Surely you're capable of that
rickard_stark And if I refuse
eddard_stark You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for And it is past time you were wed
rickard_stark I was wed Or don't you remember
eddard_stark Only too well
illyrio_mopatis You should be thanking the gods for this This is more than you deserve
eddard_stark Tyrion will do as he's bid As will you
illyrio_mopatis What do you mean
eddard_stark You'll marry Ser Loras
illyrio_mopatis I will not
eddard_stark The boy is heir to Highgarden Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach
illyrio_mopatis No, I won't do it
eddard_stark Yes, you will You're still fertile You need to marry again and breed
illyrio_mopatis I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare
eddard_stark You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all
illyrio_mopatis Father, don't make me do it again, please
eddard_stark Not another word My children You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long
