craster Out, all of you. This bastard
jeor_mormont Wait outside.
jon_snow Lord Commander
jeor_mormont Now!
samwell_tarly Lord Commander
jeor_mormont Leave us.
jeor_mormont What did you do?
jon_snow I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
jeor_mormont What business is that of yours?
jon_snow No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys.
jon_snow You know.
jeor_mormont Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
jon_snow Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
jeor_mormont Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle
jon_snow I saw it. I saw something take that child.
jeor_mormont Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.
jeor_mormont Don't lose it again.
samwell_tarly Gilly.
gilly You're leaving.
samwell_tarly I I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother
gilly I can't take it.
samwell_tarly Please. I want you to. My mother She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
gilly You You shouldn't give it away.
samwell_tarly I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me. Till I come back.
hodor Hodor
maester_luwin Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.
bran_stark Every night it's the same. I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
maester_luwin That's exactly what they are, Bran, - stories.
bran_stark So she was lying? They don't exist?
maester_luwin Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
bran_stark No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father And Rickon had the same dream.
maester_luwin What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
maester_luwin This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.
maester_luwin All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Loras! Highgarden!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones#Season02.Episode03 Get him!
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones#Season02.Episode03 Oh!
loras_tyrell Yield! I yield.
renly_baratheon Well fought. Approach.
renly_baratheon Rise. Remove your helm.
renly_baratheon You are all your father I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Now, now, my love. My brother
renly_baratheon That he did, my queen But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.
brienne_of_tarth Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.
renly_baratheon What?
brienne_of_tarth I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
renly_baratheon Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
colen_of_greenpools Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord
catelyn_stark Lordof Winterfell and King
renly_baratheon Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?
margaery_tyrell_mummer You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.
catelyn_stark You are most kind. My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
catelyn_stark It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord. Your Grace.
brienne_of_tarth And you should kneel when you approach the King
renly_baratheon There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
loras_tyrell Has your son
catelyn_stark I do not sit on my son And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
loras_tyrell If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother
catelyn_stark My son
renly_baratheon Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.
biter Your Grace.
renly_baratheon Gerard. How's your foot?
biter Better, Your Grace. They don't know their own size is all.
renly_baratheon Good man.
renly_baratheon I have 100,000 men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
catelyn_stark And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.
renly_baratheon Why?
catelyn_stark Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
renly_baratheon Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.
brienne_of_tarth At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?
renly_baratheon That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
brienne_of_tarth If you'll follow me, my lady.
catelyn_stark You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
brienne_of_tarth I fought for my king Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.
theon_greyjoy What are you doing here?
yara_greyjoy I live here. Are you angry with me, brother
theon_greyjoy You lying bitch.
yara_greyjoy It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
theon_greyjoy Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy.
yara_greyjoy You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.
theon_greyjoy Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
balon_greyjoy The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
yara_greyjoy Father.
theon_greyjoy Father.
balon_greyjoy The wolf pup While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall. Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
yara_greyjoy I've always wanted a castle.
theon_greyjoy And what's my role in all this?
balon_greyjoy You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
theon_greyjoy A ship? You give her 30 and I get one?
yara_greyjoy The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
theon_greyjoy I'm to fight fishermen?
yara_greyjoy Be careful of their nets.
theon_greyjoy Father I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.
yara_greyjoy They won't even know we're there - until it's too late.
theon_greyjoy What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.
balon_greyjoy Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
theon_greyjoy I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.
balon_greyjoy What are our words? Our words?
theon_greyjoy We do not sow.
balon_greyjoy We do not sow. We are ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
theon_greyjoy You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?
theon_greyjoy You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
yara_greyjoy You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
theon_greyjoy I have no other family.
yara_greyjoy Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.
shae You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me -
tyrion_lannister Keep your voice down.
shae Why? You think your father
tyrion_lannister I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary.
shae Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
tyrion_lannister But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
shae Scullion? What is a scullion?
tyrion_lannister Kitchen wench.
shae A kitchen wench?
tyrion_lannister Yes, but
shae Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion
tyrion_lannister Your lion We've come to a dangerous place. My sister She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
shae I'm the weakness?
tyrion_lannister It's a compliment, my lady.
shae How is being a weakness a compliment?
tyrion_lannister Language can be a bit tricky here.
shae Oh. I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.
myrcella_baratheon When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
cersei_lannister Soon, darling, when the war is over.
myrcella_baratheon Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.
cersei_lannister The princess
sansa_stark Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King
tommen_baratheon Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
cersei_lannister He might. Would you like that?
tommen_baratheon No. I don't think so.
cersei_lannister Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?
sansa_stark Come in.
sansa_stark Who are you?
shae I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.
sansa_stark I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
shae No.
sansa_stark What are you doing?
shae Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
sansa_stark I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
shae What things?
sansa_stark Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
sansa_stark No.
shae You said to brush
sansa_stark Not now.
shae Your chamber pot is empty.
sansa_stark Clean the table. Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
shae Yes.
sansa_stark For whom?
shae Lady Zuriff.
sansa_stark Lady Zuriff
shae Lady Zuriff.
sansa_stark There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
shae She wasn't in this city.
sansa_stark I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.
shae Do you want me to leave?
sansa_stark Just brush my hair.
tyrion_lannister Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
grand_maester_pycelle I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.
tyrion_lannister Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
grand_maester_pycelle Please. Thank you, my lord.
tyrion_lannister I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
grand_maester_pycelle Why, yes, of course, my lord.
tyrion_lannister These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
grand_maester_pycelle Matrimony, huh? Yes.
tyrion_lannister I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.
grand_maester_pycelle Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.
tyrion_lannister I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
grand_maester_pycelle Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
tyrion_lannister But remember, the Queen mustn't know.
lord_varys Ooh. "The Queen
tyrion_lannister I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
lord_varys Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.
tyrion_lannister Precisely. Theon's father Greyjoycan destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father
tyrion_lannister But remember, you must tell no one.
petyr_baelish Tell no one what?
tyrion_lannister I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
petyr_baelish She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her sona princess
tyrion_lannister For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?
petyr_baelish And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
tyrion_lannister Who better?
petyr_baelish Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?
tyrion_lannister The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King
petyr_baelish Harrenhal is cursed.
tyrion_lannister Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
petyr_baelish With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
tyrion_lannister You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
petyr_baelish So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.
tyrion_lannister I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?
petyr_baelish (Nods.)
tyrion_lannister Good. Oh. And remember
petyr_baelish The Queen
renly_baratheon That must hurt.
renly_baratheon What? What is it?
loras_tyrell A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
renly_baratheon Brienne is a very capable warrior. And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
loras_tyrell Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
renly_baratheon I'll make it up to you.
loras_tyrell No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father
loras_tyrell Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
renly_baratheon And Margaery's a virgin?
loras_tyrell Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
renly_baratheon I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.
margaery_tyrell_mummer As is your right. You are a king
renly_baratheon You look very beautiful.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Thank you, Your Grace.
renly_baratheon It's a lovely gown.
margaery_tyrell_mummer You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.
renly_baratheon You certainly don't need it.
renly_baratheon Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
renly_baratheon Must be the wine.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Here, let me.
renly_baratheon I'm sorry.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Do you want my brother
renly_baratheon What?
margaery_tyrell_mummer He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
renly_baratheon I don't know what you're talking about.
margaery_tyrell_mummer There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
margaery_tyrell_mummer Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a king
cersei_lannister You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
tyrion_lannister Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
cersei_lannister I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
tyrion_lannister Dorne is the safest place for her.
cersei_lannister Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
tyrion_lannister That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son
cersei_lannister She'll be a hostage.
tyrion_lannister A guest.
cersei_lannister You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
tyrion_lannister It's done, Cersei.
cersei_lannister No.
tyrion_lannister You cannot stop it.
cersei_lannister No!
tyrion_lannister Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
cersei_lannister Get out! Get out!
drowned_priest Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
theon_greyjoy I would.
drowned_priest Kneel.
drowned_priest Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
theon_greyjoy What is dead may never die.
drowned_priest What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
petyr_baelish I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy
tyrion_lannister No, afraid not. Sorry about that.
petyr_baelish And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.
tyrion_lannister Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.
petyr_baelish Leave me out of your next deception.
tyrion_lannister That's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.
petyr_baelish Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
tyrion_lannister No, he won't. But his mother How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
tyrion_lannister Find him?
bronn Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.
tyrion_lannister No, you don't.
bronn No, I don't.
grand_maester_pycelle What is the meaning of this? No, please, please.
tyrion_lannister You disappoint me, Grand Maester
grand_maester_pycelle I am your loyal servant.
tyrion_lannister So loyal that you told the Queen
grand_maester_pycelle No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.
tyrion_lannister See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.
grand_maester_pycelle The eunuch
tyrion_lannister Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
grand_maester_pycelle No, no, no.
timett There are no goats, halfman.
tyrion_lannister Well, make do.
tyrion_lannister How long have you been spying for my sister
grand_maester_pycelle All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
tyrion_lannister I don't like his beard.
grand_maester_pycelle What? What?
grand_maester_pycelle No. No.
tyrion_lannister How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?
grand_maester_pycelle Lord Arryn, he knew. He knew the truth about the Queen And he planned to act, to tell King Robert.
tyrion_lannister So you poisoned him?
grand_maester_pycelle No. Never.
tyrion_lannister But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
grand_maester_pycelle Lannister I always served Lannister.
tyrion_lannister Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
grand_maester_pycelle No. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!
tyrion_lannister For your trouble.
lord_varys You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
tyrion_lannister Good. One of my better ideas.
lord_varys And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle. The Small Council grows smaller every day.
tyrion_lannister The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
lord_varys Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?
tyrion_lannister Why, am I about to hear one?
lord_varys Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?
tyrion_lannister Depends on the sellsword.
lord_varys Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
tyrion_lannister He has a sword, the power of life and death.
lord_varys But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner
tyrion_lannister I've decided I don't like riddles.
lord_varys Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
yoren You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.
arya_stark I can't sleep.
arya_stark I don't like the taste.
yoren You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest. What?
arya_stark How do you sleep?
yoren Same as most men, I think.
arya_stark But you've seen things, horrible things.
yoren Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
arya_stark How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head?
yoren You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
arya_stark I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queenand and my sister
yoren You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?
yoren Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.
gendry Get up.
arya_stark Get up.
yoren Keep out of sight, both of you.
arya_stark No, I'm not afraid.
gendry I can fight.
yoren Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back. Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!

amory_lorch Where's the bastard, crow?
yoren Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
amory_lorch Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King.
yoren Now, which king would that be?
amory_lorch This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
yoren I don't think I will.
amory_lorch So be it.
yoren I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.
jaqen_hghar Boy, come here. Boy! - Sweet boy
jaqen_hghar Come back here! Help us, boy
jaqen_hghar Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that.

gold_cloak#unknown#GameOfThrones#Season02.Episode03 Come on.
polliver What do we have here?
arya_stark No!
polliver That's a fine little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
hot_pie I yield! I yield!
amory_lorch Round up any survivors. We'll take them back to Harrenhal.
polliver You heard him. You're coming with us.
hot_pie I yield!
lommy_greenhands Help! Help me!
polliver Something wrong with your leg, boy?
lommy_greenhands Look at it.
polliver Can you walk?
lommy_greenhands No. You got to carry me.
polliver All right.
polliver "Carry him," he says.
amory_lorch We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
arya_stark You want Gendry? You already got him. He loved that helmet.
