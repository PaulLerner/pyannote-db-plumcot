maester_caleotte Are you sure about this
brothel_child_1 No
maester_caleotte It's dangerous
brothel_child_1 If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible  Take his home, take his gold, take his power
maester_caleotte Why are you telling me
brothel_child_1 You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice
brothel_child_1 Now Winterfell is burned to the ground  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone
brothel_child_1 So, Casterly Rock  I'm asking your advice
maester_caleotte We have enough men
brothel_child_1 If Walder Frey cooperates
maester_caleotte If Walder Frey cooperates
maester_caleotte If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea
brothel_child_1 We'll lose the war and die the way father died Or worse
maester_caleotte Show them how it feels to lose what they love
mace_tyrell My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table  I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven
brothel_child_1 We thank you for your hospitality, my lord
brothel_child_1 I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness
mace_tyrell Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace  It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls
mace_tyrell One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are
mace_tyrell This is Arwyn, my daughter  My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra
mace_tyrell My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila
mace_tyrell Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins  You could have had either  Could have had both for all I care
mace_tyrell My granddaughter Marianne  My granddaughter Freya  My granddaughterW-W-Wertha Waldra Waldina
rickard_karstark I'm Merry
mace_tyrell Fine  And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet  Clearly you don't have the patience for all that
brothel_child_1 My ladies  All men should keep their word, kings most of all  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow  The fault is not with you  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends
mace_tyrell Very good
mace_tyrell There she is  Come closer, let me have a look at you
mace_tyrell Still can't see you  Old eyes
mace_tyrell Love  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh  Heh Very honorable, I call it a pretty face  Mmmm, very pretty  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure  Very shapely as well  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place
mace_tyrell I can always see what's going on beneath a dress  Been at this a long time  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is  Doesn't drop an inch
mace_tyrell Your king says he betrayed me for love  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit
mace_tyrell And I can respect that  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men
brothel_child_1 Thank you, my lord
mace_tyrell Well, let's get ready  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us
#NONEXT DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM  They are looking at a map of Yunkai]
ghita Where
mago There
mago There, it's a back gate  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves
rast Your men but not you
mago I have no interest in slaves  A man cannot make love to property
mago This is where we enter the city  Very few guards, they know me  They let me inside
bear_island_maester We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate
mago I kill the guards  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates
mago Then comes the army  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours
rast Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners
mago You have a very suspicious mind  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way
rast You command the Unsullied  What do you think
ghita Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa
grey_worm I trust him
ghita again] You leave tonight
rast Very good  We'll prepare
bear_island_maester Ser Jorah  You can use an extra sword
rast You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan  Your place is by the Queen  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done  No matter the cost, no matter our pride
greizhen_mo_ullhor We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us  It was the first castle on the Wall The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I  Too big, impossible to maintain  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself  No one's used it for centuries, most likely  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do
tycho_nestoris How do you know all that
greizhen_mo_ullhor I read about it in a very old book
tycho_nestoris You know all that from staring at marks on paper
greizhen_mo_ullhor Yes
tycho_nestoris You're like a wizard
tycho_nestoris Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived  Here we are  Alive
sandor_clegane Remember what happens to children who run  I'm your father and I'll do the talking
hog_farmer The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they Cracked three spokes this morning
sandor_clegane Need a hand
hog_farmer Need about eight hands
hog_farmer Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding
hog_farmer Many thanks
ollys_mother Don't! Don't kill him
sandor_clegane Dead rats don't squeak
ollys_mother You're so dangerous, aren't you Saying scary things to little girls Killing little boys and old people  A real hard man you are
sandor_clegane More than anyone you know
ollys_mother You're wrong  I know a killer A real killer
sandor_clegane That so
ollys_mother You'd be like a kitten to him  He'd kill you with his little finger
sandor_clegane That him
ollys_mother No
sandor_clegane Good
ollys_mother Don't kill him!  Please  Please don't
sandor_clegane You're very kind  Someday it'll get you killed
stark_guard Where are we
hugh_of_the_vale The Gift, I think  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support  Maester Luwin taught me that
willem_lannister Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
joss It’s good land and there’s no war up here  Why leave
hugh_of_the_vale Wildlings
hugh_of_the_vale Sorry  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women
cersei_lannister Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
cersei_lannister That’s what Old Nan said
willem_lannister There’s a storm coming
hugh_of_the_vale I don’t see any
joss It’s as good a place to shelter as any
stark_guard We can drink some blood while we wait  I don’t need much
grand_maester_pycelle Only one old man and eight good horses
hot_pie What’s one old man doing with eight horses
pit_announcer He breeds them for the Watch
wedding_band How’s he keep folks from stealing them
pit_announcer The Watch protects him
grand_maester_pycelle Not today they don’t  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there
hot_pie And proper steel
grand_maester_pycelle Let’s carve him up
pit_announcer We just take the horses and go  The old man’s no threat
grand_maester_pycelle I keep telling you
wedding_band He’s an old man  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear
pit_announcer The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers
hot_pie I hope so  Killing crows in their castle is tough  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do
hot_pie Spread out  Surround the hut and move in
pit_announcer Ygritte!
hot_pie Clear the barn!
ollys_mother No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all
sandor_clegane Best part of the animal
sandor_clegane Don’t worry, they’re still there
ollys_mother I know they’re still there
sandor_clegane You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move
ollys_mother I’m not afraid
sandor_clegane Of course you are  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets  No point in trying to hide behind that face  I know fear when I see it  Seen it a lot
ollys_mother I knew fear when I saw it in you  You’re afraid of fire
ollys_mother When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl
ollys_mother And I know why, too  I heard what your brother did to you  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop
sandor_clegane That give you some ideas
ollys_mother Might do
sandor_clegane Go ahead then  You might get away  Might even make it there on your own  They’re just over the river  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck
ollys_mother Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull
hugh_of_the_vale How are we going to get past the Wall  My uncle said it’s 700 feet high
hugh_of_the_vale How did you get past it
stark_guard Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals
hugh_of_the_vale It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals
stark_guard Some climb straight up the ice
hugh_of_the_vale Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
willem_lannister Nineteen castles guard the Wall  Only three are still manned
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
willem_lannister One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through
hugh_of_the_vale My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
joss Well, we’ll have to open them up again
old_man Whoa, whoa, whoa!
joss There’s a rider out there
willem_lannister Just one
joss There’s more
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
stark_guard It’s just thunder, sweet giant
jaremy_rykker Hodor
old_man I yield  I yield
willem_lannister Wildlings
stark_guard Where’s Shaggydog and Summer
hugh_of_the_vale Hunting
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
willem_lannister Shhh, quiet, Hodor
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
willem_lannister Make him shut up  If they hear us…
hugh_of_the_vale Hush, Hodor  No, no more Hodoring
jaremy_rykker Hodor!
hugh_of_the_vale Hodor, calm down
stark_guard You need to keep quiet
willem_lannister They’re gonna hear us
hugh_of_the_vale Hodor, be quiet
hugh_of_the_vale Hodor, calm down  Hodor, be quiet!
joss What did you do
hugh_of_the_vale Nothing  I don’t know
cersei_lannister What’s That
stark_guard That’s a horse dying
wildings_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 Bring them over here
wildings#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 That was the last of them  The rest are dead
grand_maester_pycelle I heard shouting up there
hot_pie Thunder
grand_maester_pycelle I know the difference between shouting and thunder
hot_pie Maybe it's ghosts
hot_pie That won’t help you, grandpa
hot_pie Where you riding
old_man Doesn’t matter now, does it
hot_pie No, it doesn’t matter now
grand_maester_pycelle Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here
hot_pie You understand
old_man Let me stand at least
old_man Let me go with a bit of dignity
grand_maester_pycelle Make the crow kill him   You’re one of us now  Prove it
willem_lannister The wolves are out there
hugh_of_the_vale I can’t do it by choice  I don’t know how  It happens in my dreams
willem_lannister You’re a warg, Bran  It’s in your blood
hugh_of_the_vale I can’t
willem_lannister You just did, with him
willem_lannister A wolf is nothing compared to that
old_man She looks sharp
wedding_band Do it  Do it
grand_maester_pycelle Told ya  He’s still one of them
hot_pie Go on, boy
hot_pie Go on!
grand_maester_pycelle He’s a crow  He’ll always be a crow  And here’s his crow wife guarding him  He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets
hot_pie Kill him!
hot_pie He’s one of them!
wedding_band No!
hot_pie Do you hear me
hot_pie You’re not gonna die for one of them
willem_lannister Do it  They’ll find us if you don’t
pit_announcer You were right the whole time
mago When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land
mago Daario Naharis
mago That one was quick
rast There may be others
mago I doubt it  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them
rast That’s what you call a few guards
musician_4 Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you
qhono You’re a delight to me, my lady
bronn You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
bronn In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity  Look upon each other and say the words
edmure_tully_&_roslin_frey#together Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger  I am hers  and she is mine  from this day until the end of my days
joss Is that safe
stark_guard They’re long gone
hugh_of_the_vale You were right  I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want
willem_lannister Of course you can  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals  But you did a lot more than that  You got inside Hodor’s mind
hugh_of_the_vale They can’t do that north of the Wall
willem_lannister No one can do that  Anywhere
hugh_of_the_vale When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon
cersei_lannister Where
hugh_of_the_vale He was with the wildlings  They tried to kill him but he got away
stark_guard He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then  That’s where we should go
hugh_of_the_vale For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack  If this many wildlings got through-
stark_guard I already told you  I’m not going north of the Wall
hugh_of_the_vale Everything Jojen told me is true  You saw what I did to Hodor  I have to find the three-eyed raven
stark_guard Listen to me, little lord
hugh_of_the_vale Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me  It won’t be safe for Rickon
cersei_lannister Me I’m coming with you
hugh_of_the_vale No  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth  The Umbers are our bannermen  They’ll protect you
cersei_lannister I’m coming with you  I’m your brother  I have to protect you
hugh_of_the_vale Right now, I have to protect you
hugh_of_the_vale Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall  If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell
hugh_of_the_vale Will you know how to find the last Hearth
stark_guard You Southerners build your big castles and you never move  You’re easy to find
cersei_lannister We’re not Southerners
cersei_lannister And I don’t want to leave you
stark_guard Shhh    Come here, little soldier  You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures
hugh_of_the_vale You don’t have to do any of this
stark_guard Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be   Shhh  We’ll be fine, you and me  The Umbers are great warriors  Even I heard about them growing up  They’ll teach you how to swing a sword
cersei_lannister I know how to swing a sword
hugh_of_the_vale You’re leaving now  It’s the middle of the night
stark_guard I learned to walk in darkness
stark_guard Say your good-byes, little man
stark_guard Keep this one safe    He means the world to me
ghita We’ve been waiting a long time   Haven’t we    Well I don’t know, you tell me  How long does it take to sack a city
rast It was just as you said  They did not believe until it was too late  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered
ghita And Daario Naharis
mago The city is yours, my queen
ironborn_2 They’re good, aren’t they
khal_rhalko They ought to be because they cost enough
brynden_tully Look at the crowd there
maester_caleotte He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him
brynden_tully The God’s love to reward a fool
maester_caleotte Uncle
brynden_tully What He’s my nephew, I love him  And he’s a damned fool
maester_caleotte Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton
camello Never do, my lady  Dulls the senses
brynden_tully That’s the point  Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls
camello Aye  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry  So I have a fat, young bride
maester_caleotte I hope she makes you very happy
camello Well, she’s made me very rich
brynden_tully Pardon, my lord, my lady  I need to find a tree to piss on
brothel_child_1 My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton  I should rescue her
ironborn_2 Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met
brothel_child_1 Be kind  She’s finally starting to like you
ironborn_2 And I like her  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand
brothel_child_1 Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake
brothel_child_1 Striking your king is an act of treason
ironborn_2 No, don’t  Don’t insult them
mace_tyrell Your Grace
mace_tyrell The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak  But they are not yet man and wife  A sword needs a sheath  And a wedding needs a bedding   What does my sire say
alltogether#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 To bed! To bed! To bed!
brothel_child_1 If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them
alltogether#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 To bed! To bed! To bed!
qhono Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies  Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again 
alltogether#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 To bed! To bed! To bed!
maester_caleotte Poor girl
camello Every bride suffers the same  I’m sure you endured yours with grace
maester_caleotte Oh, Ned forbade it  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night
ironborn_2 That is a very strange custom
brothel_child_1 I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective
ironborn_2 It seems normal to you
brothel_child_1 It’s tradition   Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage
ironborn_2 No, but there are other ways of providing proof
brothel_child_1 Boy or girl
ironborn_2 I don’t know  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him
brothel_child_1 Oh, do you   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming
ironborn_2 Eddard  Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses
brothel_child_1 I do
sandor_clegane Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
frey_guard Where are you going
sandor_clegane Got salt pork for the feast
frey_guard The feast is over
sandor_clegane It doesn’t sound like it’s over
frey_guard If I tell you it’s over, it’s over   Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here
sandor_clegane Got pig’s feet, too 
frey_guard Are you soft in the head  Turn this cart around!
mace_tyrell Your Grace
mace_tyrell I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties
mace_tyrell I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve  My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift
maester_caleotte Robb!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 Feast over yet, is it
frey_man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode09 Aye, it’s over!
sandor_clegane It’s too late
mace_tyrell The King in the North arises, heh heh
maester_caleotte Lord Walder!  Lord Walder, enough!  Let it end!  Please!  He is my son!   My first son!  Let him go and I swear that we will forget this!  I swear it by the Old Gods and New!  We will take no vengeance
mace_tyrell You already swore me one oath right here in my castle  You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!
maester_caleotte Take me for a hostage but let Robb go!  Robb, get up! Get up and walk out!  Please!  Please!
mace_tyrell And why I would let him do that
maester_caleotte On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat!
mace_tyrell I’ll find another
brothel_child_1 Mother
camello The Lannisters send their regards
