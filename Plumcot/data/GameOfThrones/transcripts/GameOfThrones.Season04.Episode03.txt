cersei_lannister You did this. You did this!
dontos_hollard We have to leave.
cersei_lannister Take him! Take him!
cersei_lannister Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
tywin_lannister Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
cersei_lannister Where is she?!
tywin_lannister No one leaves the capital! No one!
dontos_hollard Get in.
sansa_stark Where are we going?
dontos_hollard Somewhere safe.
dontos_hollard Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.
sansa_stark Lord Baelish?
petyr_baelish Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?
sansa_stark (shakes her head.)
petyr_baelish Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
dontos_hollard Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
petyr_baelish Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.
dontos_hollard I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?
dontos_hollard 10,000.
dontos_hollard Wait!
petyr_baelish Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
sansa_stark I didn't murder anyone.
petyr_baelish I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
sansa_stark Why did you kill him?
petyr_baelish Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
sansa_stark He saved me.
petyr_baelish Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
sansa_stark He was helping me because I saved his life.
petyr_baelish Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.
petyr_baelish I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
sansa_stark We're all liars here.
petyr_baelish Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.
margaery_tyrell So am I the queen?
olenna_tyrell More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
margaery_tyrell Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.
olenna_tyrell The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.
margaery_tyrell What was it like?
olenna_tyrell They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
margaery_tyrell One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
olenna_tyrell Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
margaery_tyrell But I would have been the queen.
olenna_tyrell Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
tywin_lannister Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
tywin_lannister I'm not trying to trick you.
tommen_baratheon It means I'll become king.
tywin_lannister Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?
tommen_baratheon A good king?
tywin_lannister Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?
cersei_lannister This is hardly the place or the time.
tommen_baratheon Holiness?
tywin_lannister Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
tommen_baratheon Justice.
tywin_lannister Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
tommen_baratheon No.
tywin_lannister No.
tommen_baratheon What about strength?
tywin_lannister Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?
tommen_baratheon Wisdom.
tywin_lannister Yes!
tommen_baratheon Wisdom is what makes a good king.
tywin_lannister Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
tommen_baratheon No.
tywin_lannister No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?
tommen_baratheon A king needs a queen.
tywin_lannister Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?
tommen_baratheon Yes.
tywin_lannister Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
tommen_baratheon I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
jaime_lannister How are you?
tommen_baratheon I'm all right.
jaime_lannister You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
jaime_lannister Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
high_septon Yes, my lord. All of you.
cersei_lannister It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...
jaime_lannister I don't know what I saw.
cersei_lannister Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
jaime_lannister Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
cersei_lannister I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.
jaime_lannister You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
cersei_lannister Jaime, not here, please. Please.
cersei_lannister Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
jaime_lannister No.
cersei_lannister Stop it. Stop.
cersei_lannister Stop. Stop. It's not right.
jaime_lannister (GRUNTS)
cersei_lannister It's not right. It's not right.
jaime_lannister I don't care.
cersei_lannister (CRYING) Don't.
jaime_lannister I don't care.
cersei_lannister Don't. Jaime, don't.
jaime_lannister I don't care.
 arya_stark Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
sandor_clegane Near Fairmarket, I think.
arya_stark You think? You don't have a map?
sandor_clegane No, I don't have a map.
arya_stark Maybe we should get one.
sandor_clegane Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
arya_stark How far is it to the Eyrie?
sandor_clegane Far.
arya_stark And you're sure we're going the right way?
sandor_clegane Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.
arya_stark On your way where?
sandor_clegane Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.
arya_stark I'd like to see Braavos one day.
sandor_clegane Why Braavos?
arya_stark I have friends there.
sandor_clegane I doubt it.
farmer_hamlet Seven blessings to you.
sandor_clegane What do you want?
farmer_hamlet What do I want? This is my land.
sandor_clegane If I'm standing on it, it's my land.
arya_stark We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
farmer_hamlet (nods)
arya_stark He's never been the same.
farmer_hamlet Which house did he fight for?
arya_stark The Tullys of Riverrun.
farmer_hamlet There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
farmer_hamlet We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
sandor_clegane You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
arya_stark Father!
farmer_hamlet We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
sandor_clegane And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
arya_stark I'm so sorry.
arya_stark Really good.
farmer_hamlet Did you fight at the Twins?
sandor_clegane Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
farmer_hamlet The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
sandor_clegane Guest right don't mean much anymore.
farmer_hamlet It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.
sandor_clegane You got any ale?
farmer_hamlet Afraid not.
sandor_clegane How can a man not keep ale in his home?
farmer_hamlet You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.
sandor_clegane What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
sandor_clegane (Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
 arya_stark What did you do?!
sandor_clegane Get your horse saddled.
arya_stark You told me you weren't a thief.
sandor_clegane I wasn't.
arya_stark He took us in. He fed us and you...
sandor_clegane Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.
arya_stark You don't know that.
sandor_clegane I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
arya_stark You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
sandor_clegane There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
ranger#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
alliser_thorne There he is, Sam the Slayer.
janos_slynt Going to visit your wildling whore?
samwell_tarly She's not a whore.
janos_slynt No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
 samwell_tarly They all think I'm lying.
gilly About what?
samwell_tarly Killing the white Walker.
gilly You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
samwell_tarly But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
gilly A what?
samwell_tarly Well, a wildling.
gilly My father hated that word.
samwell_tarly It's not a very nice word, I suppose.
gilly I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?
samwell_tarly So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
gilly I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
samwell_tarly I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
gilly Why do you worry about it?
samwell_tarly 100 men, one woman.
gilly They've got other things to think about.
samwell_tarly That's the only thing they think about.
gilly You're being silly.
samwell_tarly I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
gilly What about you?
samwell_tarly What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
gilly Thank you.
samwell_tarly For what?
gilly For worrying about me.
samwell_tarly I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.
gilly So what are you saying?
samwell_tarly Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
gilly Are you bored of me?
samwell_tarly Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
gilly I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
davos_seaworth Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
davos_seaworth Joffrey?
stannis_baratheon The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
davos_seaworth I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...
stannis_baratheon What progress have you made?
davos_seaworth I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
stannis_baratheon House Peasebury.
davos_seaworth House Musgood.
stannis_baratheon House Musgood.
davos_seaworth And House Haigh.
stannis_baratheon House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
davos_seaworth Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.
stannis_baratheon The Golden Company?
davos_seaworth They've never broken a contract.
stannis_baratheon They're sellswords.
davos_seaworth We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.
stannis_baratheon We don't have any gold.
davos_seaworth Not yet.
stannis_baratheon If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -
shireen_baratheon You're late.
davos_seaworth I'm sorry, Princess.
shireen_baratheon I thought you weren't coming.
davos_seaworth The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
shireen_baratheon You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."
davos_seaworth That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.
shireen_baratheon It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
shireen_baratheon You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
davos_seaworth "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."
davos_seaworth Thank you very much.
shireen_baratheon I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
davos_seaworth No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.
shireen_baratheon What's the difference?
davos_seaworth Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.
shireen_baratheon My father says a criminal is a criminal.
davos_seaworth Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
shireen_baratheon You've sailed to Braavos?
davos_seaworth Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...
shireen_baratheon What was that for?
davos_seaworth I need you to write a message.
shireen_baratheon You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
davos_seaworth It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
davos_seaworth To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
shireen_baratheon But that's not you.
davos_seaworth I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
 samwell_tarly He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?
moles_town_whore Precious little thing.
gilly Thank you.
moles_town_whore What's his name?
gilly Sam.
moles_town_whore Lovely. That the daddy?
gilly No.
moles_town_whore Where's the daddy?
gilly He's dead.
moles_town_whore Oh. Where you from?
gilly North of here.
moles_town_whore North of here? You a fucking wildling?
moles_town_madam Only room and board?
samwell_tarly That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
moles_town_madam Could find other work for her, too.
samwell_tarly No other work.
moles_town_madam There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
samwell_tarly No other work.
samwell_tarly I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
gilly You protected me north of the Wall.
samwell_tarly This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.
samwell_tarly You have to trust me. It's for the best.
gilly Best for you.
samwell_tarly Oh, Gilly. Please don't.
oberyn_martell Greedy.
ellaria_sand No?
olyvar I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.
oberyn_martell You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
ellaria_sand That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.
oberyn_martell Your loss.
olyvar You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
olyvar Does that surprise you? Everyone has a preference. Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.
olyvar I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
oberyn_martell What are you, 25?
ellaria_sand Children.
oberyn_martell (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.
olyvar Did you?
ellaria_sand He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
oberyn_martell They will all have to line up behind you.
tywin_lannister Prince Oberyn.
oberyn_martell Lord Tywin.
tywin_lannister May we have the room?
ellaria_sand Call my name if you need me, lover.
oberyn_martell Would you like to sit?
tywin_lannister No, thank you.
oberyn_martell Some wine?
tywin_lannister No, thank you.
oberyn_martell I'm sorry about your grandson.
tywin_lannister Are you?
oberyn_martell I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
tywin_lannister Which way is that?
oberyn_martell Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
tywin_lannister Some believe the king choked.
oberyn_martell Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
tywin_lannister I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
oberyn_martell I did. This is why I know.
tywin_lannister Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning. Rather suspicious.
oberyn_martell Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
tywin_lannister You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
oberyn_martell You think we conspired together?
tywin_lannister What did you discuss?
oberyn_martell The death of my sister.
tywin_lannister For which you blame me.
oberyn_martell She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
tywin_lannister Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?
oberyn_martell You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
tywin_lannister Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
oberyn_martell So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
tywin_lannister Categorically.
oberyn_martell I would like to speak with the Mountain.
tywin_lannister I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
oberyn_martell He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
tywin_lannister I could arrange for this meeting.
oberyn_martell But you want something in return.
tywin_lannister There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.
oberyn_martell Why?
tywin_lannister Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.
oberyn_martell Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
tywin_lannister I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
oberyn_martell I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
tywin_lannister We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist. Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
oberyn_martell You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
tywin_lannister We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
tyrion_lannister Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
podrick_payne I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
tyrion_lannister A noble effort.
podrick_payne They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
tyrion_lannister You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
podrick_payne I've heard nothing, my lord.
tyrion_lannister I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
podrick_payne You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
tyrion_lannister Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
podrick_payne No, my lord. You didn't?
tyrion_lannister No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?
podrick_payne Your father.
tyrion_lannister Of course.
podrick_payne Mace Tyrell.
tyrion_lannister Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
podrick_payne And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
tyrion_lannister Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
podrick_payne I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
tyrion_lannister Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.
podrick_payne My lord, she's gone.
tyrion_lannister Gone?
podrick_payne No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
tyrion_lannister No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.
podrick_payne Yes, my lord?
tyrion_lannister They'll be following you now.
podrick_payne Who will?
tyrion_lannister I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
podrick_payne Any other witnesses, my lord?
tyrion_lannister Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
podrick_payne He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
tyrion_lannister Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
podrick_payne I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.
tyrion_lannister Why not?
podrick_payne They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
tyrion_lannister And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
podrick_payne I'll ask, my lord.
podrick_payne There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.
tyrion_lannister Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
podrick_payne I didn't tell them anything, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Are you going to accept their offer?
podrick_payne My lord.
tyrion_lannister Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.
podrick_payne You've been good to me, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.
podrick_payne I already gave them an answer, my lord.
tyrion_lannister I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.
podrick_payne My lord.
tyrion_lannister Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.
podrick_payne Farewell, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
 olly Mother says it's time to eat.
guymon What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
olly Potatoes.
guymon Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got...
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 The wildlings!
ollys_mother Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!
styr You know how to get to Castle Black?
olly Yes. Yes.
styr Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
othell_yarwyck We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 Aye! Aye!
othell_yarwyck Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 Aye!
alliser_thorne If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.
maester_aemon We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
pypar There's got to be a way to protect them.
alliser_thorne You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?
jon_snow Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.
alliser_thorne We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
pypar Rangers returning.
jon_snow Help him.
eddison_tollett Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
alliser_thorne What took you so long?
grenn We were held up.
alliser_thorne By what?
grenn Chains.
eddison_tollett We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
jon_snow And the mutineers stayed?
eddison_tollett They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
jon_snow We need to ride north and kill them all.
alliser_thorne We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.
jon_snow It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
pypar I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
 daenerys_targaryen Are they attacking?
jorah_mormont A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
champion#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
daenerys_targaryen What is he doing?
barristan_selmy I believe he means to...
missandei He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.
barristan_selmy Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.
jorah_mormont They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
champion#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode03 (CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
daenerys_targaryen I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?
grey_worm (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.
daenerys_targaryen (valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
barristan_selmy Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.
daenerys_targaryen Which is why you must remain by my side.
jorah_mormont I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.
daenerys_targaryen You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.
daario_naharis I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.
daenerys_targaryen Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
missandei He is very brave, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
daenerys_targaryen You sure you don't want a horse?
daario_naharis Why would I want a horse?
daenerys_targaryen Horses are faster than men.
daario_naharis Horses are dumber than men.
daenerys_targaryen (valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
daenerys_targaryen (valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.
daenerys_targaryen Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
daenerys_targaryen Fire!
