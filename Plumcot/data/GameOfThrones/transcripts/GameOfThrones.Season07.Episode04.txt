jaime_lannister Halt that wagon!
bronn You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
jaime_lannister I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
bronn There is no more High Septon.
jaime_lannister No, there isn't, is there?
bronn There is still the question of my prize.
jaime_lannister That's a lot of money I just gave you.
bronn It's not a castle.
bronn How about that one? It's available.
jaime_lannister You don't want Highgarden.
bronn I beg to differ.
jaime_lannister We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.
bronn Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?
jaime_lannister They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
bronn Right. Just not to me.
jaime_lannister Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.
bronn Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.
jaime_lannister Stranger things have happened.
bronn Like what?
randyll_tarly The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.
jaime_lannister The current harvest?
dickon_tarly We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
jaime_lannister Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?
bronn I'm not much for shoveling weight.
jaime_lannister No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.
randyll_tarly My Lord.
dickon_tarly My Lord.
tycho_nestoris I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.
cersei_lannister You're too kind, My Lord.
tycho_nestoris I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --
cersei_lannister Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
tycho_nestoris Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
cersei_lannister We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
tycho_nestoris Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
cersei_lannister My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
tycho_nestoris I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?
cersei_lannister It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.
tycho_nestoris I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
cersei_lannister That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
tycho_nestoris Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.
petyr_baelish This is for you.
petyr_baelish The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.
petyr_baelish The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.
bran_stark Do you know who this belonged to?
petyr_baelish No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.
petyr_baelish To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --
bran_stark Chaos is a ladder.
petyr_baelish I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.
bran_stark I'm not Lord Stark.
meera_reed What's that?
bran_stark Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
meera_reed It's a very good idea.
bran_stark You're leaving?
meera_reed I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore.
bran_stark No, I don't.
meera_reed That's all you've got to say?
bran_stark Thank you.
meera_reed Thank you?
bran_stark For helping me.
meera_reed My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!
bran_stark I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.
meera_reed You died in that cave.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Hey, oh. Where are you going?
arya_stark In there. I live here.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Fuck off.
arya_stark I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Arya Stark is dead.
arya_stark Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 There's no Rodrick here.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Maester's name is Wolkan.
arya_stark Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 He's a thousand miles away.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Mm-hmm.
arya_stark If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark.
arya_stark Which Lady Stark?
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.
arya_stark Tell Sansa her sister is home.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off.
arya_stark I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 You sit there. Right there. Don't move.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 You tell her.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 I'm not.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her.
sansa_stark You don't have to. I know where she is.
arya_stark Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
sansa_stark Yes.
sansa_stark You shouldn't have run from the guards.
arya_stark I didn't run. You need better guards.
arya_stark It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?
sansa_stark He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.
arya_stark That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
sansa_stark Everyone who knew his face is dead.
arya_stark We're not.
arya_stark They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
sansa_stark I wish I had.
arya_stark Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
sansa_stark Your list?
arya_stark Of people I'm going to kill.
sansa_stark How did you get back to Winterfell?
arya_stark It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
sansa_stark Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
arya_stark Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.
sansa_stark No, they're not.
sansa_stark Arya, Bran's home too.
bran_stark You came home.
bran_stark I saw you at the crossroads.
arya_stark You saw me?
bran_stark I see quite a lot now.
sansa_stark Bran has visions.
bran_stark I thought you might go to King's Landing.
arya_stark So did I.
sansa_stark Why would you go back there?
bran_stark Cersei is on her list of names.
sansa_stark Who else is on your list?
arya_stark Most of them are dead already.
arya_stark Where did you get this?
bran_stark Littlefinger gave it to me.
arya_stark Littlefinger, he's here?
sansa_stark He's declared for House Stark.
sansa_stark Why would he give you a dagger?
bran_stark He thought I'd want it.
sansa_stark Why?
bran_stark Because it was meant to kill me.
sansa_stark The cutthroat after your fall?
arya_stark Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
bran_stark Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
sansa_stark He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
bran_stark It doesn't matter.
sansa_stark What do you mean it doesn't matter?
bran_stark I don't want it.
arya_stark Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
bran_stark It's wasted on a cripple.
podrick_payne Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.
brienne_of_tarth I did next to nothing.
podrick_payne You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.
brienne_of_tarth I'm not a --
brienne_of_tarth Thank you, Podrick.
missandei Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.
daenerys_targaryen Soon. They will come back to me.
missandei He better.
daenerys_targaryen What happened?
missandei Many things.
daenerys_targaryen Many things?
jon_snow Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen It's all right.
jon_snow I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
jon_snow So this is it, all we'll ever need.
jon_snow There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.
jon_snow The Children of the Forest made these.
daenerys_targaryen When?
jon_snow A very long time ago.
daenerys_targaryen They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
jon_snow No.
jon_snow They were here together the Children and the First Men.
daenerys_targaryen Doing what? Fighting each other?
daenerys_targaryen They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.
jon_snow Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
daenerys_targaryen And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
jon_snow No, I don't think I can.
daenerys_targaryen I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
jon_snow My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.
daenerys_targaryen They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
daenerys_targaryen What is it?
tyrion_lannister We took Casterly Rock.
daenerys_targaryen That's very good to hear.
daenerys_targaryen Isn't it?
davos_seaworth You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
daenerys_targaryen You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
tyrion_lannister We still have the largest army.
daenerys_targaryen Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
tyrion_lannister Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
daenerys_targaryen The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.
tyrion_lannister If I've underestimated our enemies --
daenerys_targaryen Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.
daenerys_targaryen Enough with the clever plans.
daenerys_targaryen I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
tyrion_lannister We've discussed this.
daenerys_targaryen My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
tyrion_lannister A smart one.
daenerys_targaryen What do you think I should do?
jon_snow I would never presume to --
daenerys_targaryen I'm at war. I'm losing.
daenerys_targaryen What do you think I should do?
jon_snow I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
jon_snow But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.
brienne_of_tarth Don't lunge.
brienne_of_tarth Don't go where your enemy leads you.
brienne_of_tarth Up.
brienne_of_tarth And don't --
arya_stark Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
brienne_of_tarth Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
sansa_stark If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
arya_stark It's been awhile since I've trained.
brienne_of_tarth I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.
arya_stark He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
arya_stark You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?
brienne_of_tarth Move aside, Podrick.
brienne_of_tarth You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small.
arya_stark I won't cut you. Don't worry.
brienne_of_tarth I'll try not to.
brienne_of_tarth Who taught you to do that?
arya_stark No one.
davos_seaworth What do you think of her?
jon_snow Who?
davos_seaworth I believe you know of whom I speak.
jon_snow I think she has a good heart.
davos_seaworth A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
jon_snow There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?
davos_seaworth Fewer.
jon_snow What?
davos_seaworth Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.
missandei Ser Davos, Lord Snow.
davos_seaworth King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?
jon_snow It doesn't matter.
missandei Forgive me, but may I ask a question?
jon_snow Of course.
missandei Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?
jon_snow I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
davos_seaworth Is the custom different in Naarth?
missandei We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
davos_seaworth The sounds liberating.
jon_snow Why did you leave your homeland?
missandei I was stolen away by slavers.
jon_snow I'm sorry.
davos_seaworth If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?
missandei She bought me from my master and set me free.
davos_seaworth That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?
missandei I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.
jon_snow And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
missandei Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
jon_snow You believe that?
missandei I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose.
davos_seaworth You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
jon_snow Is that a Greyjoy ship?
theon_greyjoy Jon. I didn't know you were here.
theon_greyjoy Sansa, is she all right?
jon_snow What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
davos_seaworth We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
theon_greyjoy I should be.
davos_seaworth Your sister?
theon_greyjoy Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
jon_snow The queen is gone.
theon_greyjoy Where did she go?
randyll_tarly All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
jaime_lannister Good.
randyll_tarly We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.
jaime_lannister We are stretched a bit thin.
randyll_tarly With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.
jaime_lannister Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
dickon_tarly Ser Jaime.
jaime_lannister Rickon.
dickon_tarly Dickon.
jaime_lannister I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
jaime_lannister And?
dickon_tarly It was glorious.
bronn Come on. Your father's not here.
dickon_tarly All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.
jaime_lannister They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
dickon_tarly I didn't expect it to smell like that.
bronn Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
bronn Well, I learned it when I was 5.
jaime_lannister What?
bronn Listen.
jaime_lannister Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
jaime_lannister Spears and shields!
bronn In line now!
randyll_tarly Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line.
randyll_tarly Spears armed!
bronn Get back to King's Landing.
jaime_lannister I'm not abandoning my army.
bronn You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us.
jaime_lannister We can hold them off.
daenerys_targaryen Dracarys!
jaime_lannister Hold the line!
jaime_lannister Archers! Archers with me!
jaime_lannister Knock!
captain_of_the_bolton_archers Knock! Draw!
jaime_lannister Loose!
jaime_lannister Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
bronn Go get it then.
jaime_lannister I can't shoot with one hand.
jaime_lannister Come on!
bronn Where are you?
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode04 Your people can't fight.
jaime_lannister Take cover!
bronn Come on you fucker.
daenerys_targaryen Dracarys!
tyrion_lannister Flee, you idiot!
jaime_lannister Come on, boy. Come on!
tyrion_lannister You fucking idiot.
