imry_florent Sulk all you want The truth is, you're lucky You don't want to be alone out here, girl Someone worse than me would find you
ollys_mother There's no one worse than you
imry_florent Ha, you never knew my brother He once killed a man for snoring There's plenty worse than me There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them I saved your sister from some of them
ollys_mother You're lying
imry_florent Ask her, if you ever see her again Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open
ollys_mother Is that the Blackwater
imry_florent The Blackwater  Where do you think I'm taking you
ollys_mother Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen
imry_florent Fuck Joffrey Fuck the queen That's the Red Fork I'm taking you to the Twins
ollys_mother But why
imry_florent Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you
ollys_mother Why would they be at the Twins
imry_florent Those outlaws you love so much never told you  The whole countryside is yapping about it Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding
bear_island_maester Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty They cannot be trusted
rast They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid The Yunkish are paying them well
ghita You know these men
rast Only by the broken swords on their banners They're called the Second Sons A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard"
ghita Is he more titan or bastard
rast He's a dangerous man, khaleesi They all are
ghita How many
bear_island_maester 2,000, Your Grace Armored and mounted
ghita Enough to make a difference
ghita It's hard to collect wages from a corpse I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side
rast I imagine you're right
ghita I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning
rast He may not agree to meet
ghita He will A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl
#NONEXT Dany, Barristan, Mero, Prendahl, Daario, Jorah,Missandei
bear_island_maester Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons-- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and--
mago Daario Naharis
wildling You are the Mother of Dragons  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys
rast Mind your tongue
wildling Why  I didn't mind hers She licked my ass like she was born to do it
wildling You, slave girl, bring wine
ghita We have no slaves here
wildling You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons
ghita Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons
bear_island_maester Under 2,000, Your Grace
ghita We have more, don't we
bear_island_maester 10,000 Unsullied
ghita I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us
mago I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie You have 8,000 Unsullied
ghita You're very young to be a captain
riverlands_traveller He's not a captain He's a lieutenant
ghita Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side
wildling The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won
rast The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run
ghita Or you could fight for me
wildling We've taken the slavers' gold We fight for Yunkai
ghita I would pay you as much and more
riverlands_traveller Our contract is our bond If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again
ghita Ride with me and you'll never need another contract You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms
mago You have no ships You have no siege weapons You have no cavalry
ghita A fortnight ago, I had no army A year ago, I had no dragons You have two days to decide
wildling Show me your cunt I want to see if it's worth fighting for  Grey WORM  My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you
ghita These men are our guests  You seem to be enjoying my wine Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder
wildling Only a flagon And what are my brothers in arms to drink
ghita A barrel, then
wildling Good The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone In the Second Sons, we share everything After the battle, maybe we'll all share you
wildling I'll come looking for you when this is over
ghita Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first
bear_island_maester Gladly, Your Grace
ash Half Robert, half lowborn
braavosi_captain Show the boy to his chambers Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes I'll come visit you soon
ash What do you mean to do with him
braavosi_captain You know what I mean to do with him
ash Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes  If it needs to be done, do it Don't torture the boy
braavosi_captain Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king
ash No
braavosi_captain If the lamb sees the knife, she panics Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor
ash You've slaughtered many lambs
braavosi_captain And none have seen the blade
old_woman 'And tho-- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod-- rode Vhagar-- Vhag--' Fuck me 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog-- enough-- enough to swallow a horse whole
old_woman ' Your Grace
ash They feeding you enough
old_woman Two meals a day Cold for breakfast, hot for supper I cannot complain
ash You don't belong in a place like this
old_woman Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse
ash Yeah
old_woman I'm sorry about your son Didn't get the chance to tell you before Good lad Loyal lad
ash Melisandre's returned
old_woman I didn't know she'd been gone
ash Came back with a bastard boy Robert's bastard boy
old_woman Why
ash She says there's power in king's blood
old_woman She's going to kill him
ash Sacrifice him
old_woman Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice  The boy is your nephew
ash What of it We're at war Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night
old_woman Because he has your blood in his veins
ash So did Renly
old_woman Renly wronged you Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you He raised an army, stole your bannermen This boy has done you no harm He's an innocent
ash How many boys live in Westeros How many girls How many men How many womenThe darkness will devour them all, she says The night that never ends Unless I triumph I never asked for this No more than I asked to be king We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no  Great or small, we must do our duty What's one bastard boy against a kingdom
old_woman Your Grace, why did you come to see me today
ash I came to free you If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again
old_woman I swear it I can't swear never to speak against her
ash You have little regard for your own life
old_woman Quite little, Your Grace Verging on none You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child You won't ever' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night
ash I saw a vision in the flames A great battle in the snow I saw it And you saw whatever she gave birth to I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real
riverlands_traveller Little dragon bitch She talks too much
mago You talk too much
wildling She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock
mago 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock
wildling My cock will find a way Tell him Is there any place that my cock can't reach
mago She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me
wildling Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores
mago I like them very much I just refuse to pay them And I'm no whore, my friend
wildling She sells her sheath and you sell your blade What's the difference
mago I fight for beauty
riverlands_traveller For beauty
wildling We fight for gold
mago The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die-- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you
wildling You'll die young
riverlands_traveller What do we do about the dragon girl  We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield
wildling There won't be a battle And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs We only have to deal with her
riverlands_traveller She's well guarded
wildling Tonight's a new moon One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights
riverlands_traveller Which one of us
wildling Close your eyes, love
wildling Three coins A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos The Braavosi does the deed One for each of us, darling No peeking
mago Do you hear me  Follow my voice I'm right here
mago You have something for me
mago Valar morghulis
rickard_stark Lady Sansa
morag You look very handsome, my lord
rickard_stark Oh, yes The husband of your dreams But you do look glorious Perhaps we could have a moment alone Do you mind Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden
rickard_stark My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this
morag I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord
rickard_stark No, don't You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore You won't be a prisoner after today You'll be my wife I suppose that's a different kind of prison I just wanted to say-- I'm just trying to say very badly-- I just-- just want to say I know how you feel
morag I doubt that very much, my lord
rickard_stark You're right I have no idea how you feel And you have no idea how I feel
rickard_stark But I promise you one thing, my lady I won't ever hurt you Do you drink wine
morag When I have to
rickard_stark Well, today you have to
captured_wight You look radiant, Your Grace
illyrio_mopatis Radiant Why radiant
captured_wight It's the word that came to mind
captured_wight We're going to be sisters soon We should be friends
illyrio_mopatis You're a musical girl, aren't you  I imagine you have a lovely voice
captured_wight A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid
illyrio_mopatis Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'
captured_wight Of course They play it so often here at court
illyrio_mopatis So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere
captured_wight Not as well as you, I'm sure
illyrio_mopatis House Reyne was a powerful family Very wealthy The second wealthiest in Westeros Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now
illyrio_mopatis Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore And finally one day, he rebelled against my father Do you know where House Reyne is now
captured_wight Gone
illyrio_mopatis Gone A gentle word Why not say slaughtered Every man, woman, and child put to the sword
illyrio_mopatis I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock My father let them rot up there all summer It was a long summer 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear'
illyrio_mopatis If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep
morag What are you doing
glover_general Your father's gone As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband
high_septon You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
rickard_stark Could you-
rickard_stark Thank you
high_septon Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever
braavosi_captain Have you ever seen one like it
simpson I've never seen anything like any of this Not in my life
braavosi_captain It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth  When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day And stew is a kind word for it
simpson In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken We knew it wasn't chicken
braavosi_captain Here, taste this
braavosi_captain You think I'm trying to poison you
simpson That's good
simpson That's really good
braavosi_captain Where do you think it's from
simpson I couldn't even guess
braavosi_captain Doesn't matter, does it  It's the real thing or it's not You only need a tongue to tell the difference Go on, have some more You still don't trust it You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take
simpson That thought had crossed my mind, yeah
braavosi_captain There are no mistakes Not for us
simpson I'm a mistake I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern
braavosi_captain Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world We're both a part of His plan He wants this for us No, He demands this of us
simpson I don't understand This-- this doesn't seem very religious
braavosi_captain According to whom  The Silent Sisters With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts What have their gods done for you  Hmm  When you pray to them, what's their answer  A god is real or he's not You only need eyes to see
braavosi_captain Death is coming for everyone and everything A darkness that will swallow the dawn And we can stop it, you and I
braavosi_captain Let me show you what you have inside you Come fight death with me
simpson What are you doing
braavosi_captain You have to trust me
simpson What--  Get it away Get it off me
braavosi_captain Don't fight, don't fight They won't take much
simpson Why are you doing this
braavosi_captain I told you there's power in the blood of kings And you have so much blood
simpson No No, no, no, no! Not there Not there!
braavosi_captain You can blame Ser Davos He didn't believe in the power of king's blood He wanted a demonstration
simpson Please Please, Your Grace My lord!
ash The usurper Robb Stark The usurper Balon Greyjoy The usurper Joffrey Baratheon
poisoned_frey So their son will be your nephew After you're wed to Cersei, of course And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew  Grandson  I'm not sure But your brother will become your father-in-law That much is beyond dispute
morag Will you pardon me, my lord
rickard_stark Of course Of course En--enjoy
illyrio_mopatis Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead
glover_general I've got a lifetime for that
illyrio_mopatis Stay
eddard_stark You seem rather drunk
rickard_stark Rather less than I plan to be Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding
eddard_stark This isn't about your wedding Renly Baratheon had a wedding Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible
rickard_stark And
eddard_stark If you're going to give her one, you need to perform
rickard_stark What did you once call me  A drunken little lust-filled beast
eddard_stark More than once
rickard_stark There you have it Nothing to worry about Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things I am the god of tits and wine I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit
eddard_stark You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty
hallyne Well, my father once told me--
illyrio_mopatis Nobody cares what your father once told you
glover_general Congratulations, my lady
morag Thank you, Your Grace
glover_general Well, you've done it You've married a Lannister Soon you'll have a Lannister baby It's a dream come true for you, isn't it  What a glorious day
morag Yes, Your Grace
glover_general I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out How'd you like that
glover_general You wouldn't That's all right Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down
glover_general Time for the bedding ceremony
rickard_stark There will be no bedding ceremony
glover_general Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle Come, everyone Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed Get rid of her gown She won't be needing it any longer Ladies, attend to my uncle He's not heavy
rickard_stark There will be no bedding ceremony
glover_general There will be if I command it
rickard_stark Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock
glover_general What did you say What did you say
eddard_stark I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king
rickard_stark A bad joke, Your Grace Made out of envy of your own royal manhood Mine is so small My poor wife won't even know I'm there
eddard_stark Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace
rickard_stark I am Guilty But-- but it is my wedding night
rickard_stark My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do Come, wife
rickard_stark I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act Not proud of it But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree  Come, I'll tell you all about it Put you in the mood
morag Is that wise, my lord
rickard_stark Tyrion, Sansa My name is Tyrion
morag Is that wise, Tyrion
rickard_stark Nothing was ever wiser
rickard_stark Astoundingly long
morag What
rickard_stark Neck You have one How old are you exactly
morag 14
rickard_stark Well, talk won't make you any older My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage
rickard_stark Stop I can't I could, I won't
morag But your father--
rickard_stark If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start I won't share your bed Not until you want me to
morag What if I never want you to
rickard_stark And so my watch begins
ghita 19
great_master_4 Yes, Your Grace
ghita How can anyone speak 19 languages
great_master_4 It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well
ghita Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope-- what do you mean reasonably well
great_master_4 Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master So guttural and harsh
ghita Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it It gave him great pride
great_master_4 Athjahakar
ghita Athjahaka
great_master_4 Ath-ja-hakar
ghita Athjahakar
ghita Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice
great_master_4 Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue It is the only proper language for poetry
mago No screaming or she dies
ghita What do you want
mago You
ghita Let her go
mago Don't scream, lovely girl
ghita You were sent here to kill me
ghita So why haven't you
mago I don't want to
ghita What do your captains have to say about that
mago You should ask them
ghita Why
mago We had philosophical differences
ghita Over what
mago Your beauty It meant more to me than it did to them
ghita You're a strange man
mago I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet I only do what I want to do
ghita And this is supposed to impress me
mago Yes
ghita Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades
mago They ordered me to murder you I told them I preferred not to They told me I had no choice I told them I am Daario Naharis I always have a choice They drew their swords and I drew mine
ghita Will you fight for me
ghita Swear to me
mago The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours
rickard_stark You really ought to knock
beric_dondarrion I brought your breakfast
braavosi_theatre_server It's getting dark We could stay here for the night
braavosi_theatre_server How hard can it be to build a fire
tycho_nestoris It doesn't matter Come under the furs We can keep each other warm
braavosi_theatre_server He winked at me before
tycho_nestoris I doubt it
braavosi_theatre_server I saw him wink at me
tycho_nestoris He blinked
braavosi_theatre_server I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink
tycho_nestoris A what
braavosi_theatre_server Well, I mean, there's no real difference
tycho_nestoris A wink is on purpose
braavosi_theatre_server You thought of a name yet It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name
tycho_nestoris Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me
braavosi_theatre_server What No This is just the way I talk
tycho_nestoris I'll build that fire
braavosi_theatre_server Don't you think he should have a name
tycho_nestoris I don't know many boys' names
braavosi_theatre_server Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer
tycho_nestoris Craster
braavosi_theatre_server Uh, yes Maybe that's not--
tycho_nestoris Mormont
braavosi_theatre_server That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name
tycho_nestoris Why is it a last name
braavosi_theatre_server Well, it's a family name For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name You see So my father is also a Tarly
tycho_nestoris His name is Samwell Tarly, too
braavosi_theatre_server No, Randyll Tarly
tycho_nestoris Randyll is a handsome name
braavosi_theatre_server Please don't name him Randyll
tycho_nestoris Is your father cruel like mine
braavosi_theatre_server Different manner of cruel
tycho_nestoris Not Randyll, then
tycho_nestoris Don't Don't go out there
braavosi_theatre_server I'll be back I just want to look
braavosi_theatre_server Go inside Go back inside I'll--
tycho_nestoris It's come for the baby
braavosi_theatre_server Stay back!
braavosi_theatre_server You stay back!
tycho_nestoris No, you can't have him! No!
tycho_nestoris No!
