sandor_clegane I'll give you one try, girl.
sandor_clegane Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard.
sandor_clegane Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you.
arya_stark There's no one worse than you.
sandor_clegane Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them.
arya_stark You're lying.
sandor_clegane Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
arya_stark Is that the Blackwater?
sandor_clegane The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
arya_stark Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
sandor_clegane Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
arya_stark But why?
sandor_clegane Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
arya_stark Why would they be at the Twins?
sandor_clegane Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
barristan_selmy Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
jorah_mormont They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
daenerys_targaryen You know these men?
jorah_mormont Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard."
daenerys_targaryen Is he more titan or bastard?
jorah_mormont He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are.
daenerys_targaryen How many?
barristan_selmy Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted.
daenerys_targaryen Enough to make a difference?
daenerys_targaryen It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
jorah_mormont I imagine you're right.
daenerys_targaryen I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
jorah_mormont He may not agree to meet.
daenerys_targaryen He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
barristan_selmy Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-
daario_naharis daario Naharis
mero You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
jorah_mormont Mind your tongue.
mero Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
mero You, slave girl, bring wine.
daenerys_targaryen We have no slaves here.
mero You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
daenerys_targaryen Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
barristan_selmy Under two thousand, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen We have more, don't we?
barristan_selmy Ten thousand Unsullied.
daenerys_targaryen I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
daario_naharis I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.
daenerys_targaryen You're very young to be a captain.
prendahl He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
daenerys_targaryen Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.
mero The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
jorah_mormont The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
daenerys_targaryen Or you could fight for me.
mero We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
daenerys_targaryen I would pay you as much and more.
prendahl Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
daenerys_targaryen Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
daario_naharis You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
daenerys_targaryen A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.
mero Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.
grey_worm My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
daenerys_targaryen These men are our guests.  You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
mero Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
daenerys_targaryen A barrel, then.
mero Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.
mero I'll come looking for you when this is over.
daenerys_targaryen Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
barristan_selmy Gladly, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Half Robert, half lowborn.
melisandre Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
stannis_baratheon What do you mean to do with him?
melisandre You know what I mean to do with him.
stannis_baratheon Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.
melisandre Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
stannis_baratheon No.
melisandre If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
stannis_baratheon You've slaughtered many lambs?
melisandre And none have seen the blade.
davos_seaworth 'And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole.
davos_seaworth Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon They feeding you enough?
davos_seaworth Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.
stannis_baratheon You don't belong in a place like this.
davos_seaworth Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.
stannis_baratheon Yeah.
davos_seaworth I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
stannis_baratheon Melisandre's returned.
davos_seaworth I didn't know she'd been gone.
stannis_baratheon Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
davos_seaworth Why?
stannis_baratheon She says there's power in king's blood.
davos_seaworth She's going to kill him.
stannis_baratheon Sacrifice him.
davos_seaworth Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.
stannis_baratheon What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
davos_seaworth Because he has your blood in his veins.
stannis_baratheon So did Renly.
davos_seaworth Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.
stannis_baratheon How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?
davos_seaworth Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
stannis_baratheon I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
davos_seaworth I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
stannis_baratheon You have little regard for your own life.
davos_seaworth Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
stannis_baratheon I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
prendahl Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
daario_naharis You talk too much.
mero She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
daario_naharis Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
mero My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
daario_naharis She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
mero daario_naharis Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.
daario_naharis I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend.
mero She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
daario_naharis I fight for beauty.
prendahl For beauty?
mero We fight for gold.
daario_naharis The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
mero You'll die young.
prendahl What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.
mero There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
prendahl She's well guarded.
mero Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
prendahl Which one of us?
mero Close your eyes, love.
mero Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking.
daario_naharis Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.
daario_naharis You have something for me?
daario_naharis Valar morghulis.
tyrion_lannister Lady sansa.
sansa_stark You look very handsome, my lord.
tyrion_lannister Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?
tyrion_lannister My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.
sansa_stark I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
tyrion_lannister No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel.
sansa_stark I doubt that very much, my lord.
tyrion_lannister You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
tyrion_lannister But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?
sansa_stark When I have to.
tyrion_lannister Well, today you have to.
margaery_tyrell You look radiant, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Radiant? Why radiant?
margaery_tyrell It's the word that came to mind.
margaery_tyrell We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
cersei_lannister You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.
margaery_tyrell A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.
cersei_lannister Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?
margaery_tyrell Of course. They play it so often here at court.
cersei_lannister So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
margaery_tyrell Not as well as you, I'm sure.
cersei_lannister House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
cersei_lannister Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?
margaery_tyrell Gone.
cersei_lannister Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
cersei_lannister I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'
cersei_lannister If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.
sansa_stark What are you doing?
joffrey_baratheon Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
high_septon You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
tyrion_lannister Could you-
tyrion_lannister Thank you.
high_septon Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
melisandre Have you ever seen one like it?
gendry I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
melisandre It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.
gendry In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
melisandre Here, taste this.
melisandre You think I'm trying to poison you?
gendry That's good.
gendry That's really good.
melisandre Where do you think it's from?
gendry I couldn't even guess.
melisandre Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.
gendry That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
melisandre There are no mistakes. Not for us.
gendry I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
melisandre Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us.
gendry I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.
melisandre According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.
melisandre Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I.
melisandre Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
gendry What are you doing?
melisandre You have to trust me.
gendry What-?  Get it away. Get it off me.
melisandre Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.
gendry Why are you doing this?
melisandre I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
gendry No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!
melisandre You can blame Ser davos_seaworth. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
gendry Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!
stannis_baratheon The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
olenna_tyrell So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei , of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.
sansa_stark Will you pardon me, my lord?
tyrion_lannister Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
cersei_lannister Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
joffrey_baratheon I've got a lifetime for that.
cersei_lannister Stay.
tywin_lannister You seem rather drunk.
tyrion_lannister Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
tywin_lannister This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
tyrion_lannister And?
tywin_lannister If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.
tyrion_lannister What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
tywin_lannister More than once.
tyrion_lannister There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
tywin_lannister You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
loras_tyrell Well, my father once told me-
cersei_lannister Nobody cares what your father once told you.
joffrey_baratheon Congratulations, my lady.
sansa_stark Thank you, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day.
sansa_stark Yes, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
joffrey_baratheon You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
joffrey_baratheon Time for the bedding ceremony.
tyrion_lannister There will be no bedding ceremony.
joffrey_baratheon Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.
tyrion_lannister There will be no bedding ceremony.
joffrey_baratheon There will be if I command it.
tyrion_lannister Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
joffrey_baratheon What did you say? What did you say?
tywin_lannister I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.
tyrion_lannister A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.
tywin_lannister Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
tyrion_lannister I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
tyrion_lannister My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.
tyrion_lannister I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.
sansa_stark Is that wise, my lord?
tyrion_lannister Tyrion , sansa. My name is Tyrion Lannister.
sansa_stark Is that wise, Tyrion Lannister?
tyrion_lannister Nothing was ever wiser.
tyrion_lannister Astoundingly long.
sansa_stark What?
tyrion_lannister Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
sansa_stark Fourteen.
tyrion_lannister Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
tyrion_lannister Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.
sansa_stark But your father-
tyrion_lannister If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.
sansa_stark What if I never want you to?
tyrion_lannister And so my watch begins.
daenerys_targaryen Ninteen
missandei Yes, Your Grace.
daenerys_targaryen How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
missandei It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
daenerys_targaryen Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?
missandei Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
daenerys_targaryen Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
missandei Athjahakar.
daenerys_targaryen Athjahaka.
missandei Ath-ja-hakar.
daenerys_targaryen Athjahakar.
daenerys_targaryen Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.
missandei Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry.
daario_naharis No screaming or she dies.
daenerys_targaryen What do you want?
daario_naharis You.
daenerys_targaryen Let her go.
daario_naharis Don't scream, lovely girl.
daenerys_targaryen You were sent here to kill me?
daenerys_targaryen So why haven't you?
daario_naharis I don't want to.
daenerys_targaryen What do your captains have to say about that?
daario_naharis You should ask them.
daenerys_targaryen Why?
daario_naharis We had philosophical differences.
daenerys_targaryen Over what?
daario_naharis Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
daenerys_targaryen You're a strange man.
daario_naharis I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
daenerys_targaryen And this is supposed to impress me?
daario_naharis Yes.
daenerys_targaryen Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
daario_naharis They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
daenerys_targaryen Will you fight for me?
daenerys_targaryen Swear to me.
daario_naharis The Second Sons are yours and so is daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
tyrion_lannister You really ought to knock.
shae I brought your breakfast.
samwell_tarly It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
samwell_tarly How hard can it be to build a fire?
gilly It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
samwell_tarly He winked at me before.
gilly I doubt it.
samwell_tarly I saw him wink at me.
gilly He blinked.
samwell_tarly I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
gilly A what?
samwell_tarly Well, I mean, there's no real difference.
gilly A wink is on purpose.
samwell_tarly You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
gilly Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
samwell_tarly What? No. This is just the way I talk.
gilly I'll build that fire.
samwell_tarly Don't you think he should have a name?
gilly I don't know many boys' names.
samwell_tarly Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
gilly Craster.
samwell_tarly Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-
gilly Mormont.
samwell_tarly That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.
gilly Why is it a last name?
samwell_tarly Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.
gilly His name is samwell_tarlywell Tarly, too?
samwell_tarly No, Randyll Tarly.
gilly Randyll is a handsome name.
samwell_tarly Please don't name him Randyll.
gilly Is your father cruel like mine?
samwell_tarly Different manner of cruel.
gilly Not Randyll, then.
gilly Don't. Don't go out there.
samwell_tarly I'll be back. I just want to look.
samwell_tarly Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
gilly It's come for the baby.
samwell_tarly Stay back!
samwell_tarly You stay back!
gilly No, you can't have him! No!
gilly No!
