GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll give you one try, girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Kill me and you’re free.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But if I live, I’ll break both your hands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Go on, hit me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Hit me hard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Sulk all you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The truth is, you’re lucky.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You don’t want to be alone out here, girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Someone worse than me would find you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There’s no one worse than you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You never knew my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He once killed a man for snoring.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There’s plenty worse than me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There’s men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I saved your sister from some of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re lying.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ask her, if you ever see her again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is that the Blackwater?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Blackwater?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Where do you think I’m taking you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Back to King’s Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Fuck Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Fuck the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That’s the Red Fork.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m taking you to the Twins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your mother and brother will be there, and they’ll pay me for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why would they be at the Twins?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Those outlaws you love so much never told you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The whole countryside is yapping about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So quit trying to bash my skull in, and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They cannot be trusted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They can be trusted to kill you if they’re well paid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Yunkish are paying them well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You know these men?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Only by the broken swords on their banners.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They’re called the Second Sons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan’s Bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is he more titan or bastard?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He’s a dangerous man, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They all are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How many?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ,, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Armoured and mounted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Enough to make a difference?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s hard to collect wages from a corpse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I imagine you’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’d like to talk to the Titan’s Bastard about winning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He may not agree to meet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A man who fights for gold can’t afford to lose to a girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons, Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and, um…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Daario Naharis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You are the Mother of Dragons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Mind your tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I didn’t mind hers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You, slave girl, bring wine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We have no slaves here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero’s lap, and I may give you my Second Sons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Under ,, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We have more, don’t we?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown , Unsullied.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have , Unsullied.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re very young to be a captain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He’s not a captain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He’s a lieutenant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Even if your numbers are right, the odds don’t favour your side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Or you could fight for me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We’ve taken the slavers’ gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We fight for Yunkai.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I would pay you as much and more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Our contract is our bond.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ride with me and you’ll never need another contract.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have no ships.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have no siege weapons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have no cavalry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A fortnight ago, I had no army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A year ago, I had no dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have two days to decide.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Show me your cunt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I want to see if it’s worth fighting for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown These men are our guests.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You seem to be enjoying my wine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Perhaps you’d like a flagon to help you ponder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Only a flagon?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A barrel, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Titan’s Bastard does not drink alone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown In the Second Sons, we share everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown After the battle, maybe we’ll all share you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll come looking for you when this is over.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Gladly, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Half Robert, half lowborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Show the boy to his chambers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll come visit you soon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What do you mean to do with him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If it needs to be done, do it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t torture the boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ve slaughtered many lambs?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And none have seen the blade.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown “And though “Visenya “Targaryen “rode “Vhagar “Vhag…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” Fuck me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown “Visenya Targaryen “rode Vhagar, “the smallest of the dragons, “though still “large “enough “to swallow a horse whole.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They feeding you enough?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Two meals a day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I cannot complain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You don’t belong in a place like this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, it’s sad to say, but I’ve seen worse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m sorry about your son.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Didn’t get the chance to tell you before.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Good lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Loyal lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Melisandre’s returned.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I didn’t know she’d been gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Came back with a bastard boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Robert’s bastard boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She says there’s power in king’s blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She’s going to kill him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Sacrifice him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Forgive me, Your Grace, I’m not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The boy is your nephew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What of it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We’re at war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Because he has your blood in his veins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So did Renly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Renly wronged you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He raised an army, stole your bannermen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown This boy has done you no harm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He’s an innocent.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How many boys live in Westeros?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How many girls?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How many men?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How many women?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The darkness will devour them all, she says.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The night that never ends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Unless I triumph.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I never asked for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No more than I asked to be king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Great or small, we must do our duty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What’s one bastard boy against a kingdom?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I came to free you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I swear it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I can’t swear never to speak against her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have little regard for your own life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Quite little, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Verging on none.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I’d counsel restraint.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown When my son was five, he said to me, “I don’t ever want to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” I wanted to say to him, “You won’t, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You won’t ever.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I saw a vision in the flames.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A great battle in the snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I saw it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And you saw whatever she gave birth to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it’s right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That dragon bitch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She talks too much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You talk too much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She won’t talk so much when she’s choking on my cock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown , Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My cock will find a way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Tell him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is there any place that my cock can’t reach?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She’ll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn’t like whores.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I like them very much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I just refuse to pay them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And I’m no whore, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What’s the difference?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I fight for beauty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown For beauty?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We fight for gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die, the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ll die young.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What do we do about the dragon girl?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We can’t beat , Unsullied on the battlefield.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There won’t be a battle, and we don’t have to deal with her eunuchs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We only have to deal with her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She’s wellguarded.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Tonight’s a new moon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Which one of us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Close your eyes, love.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Three coins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Braavosi does the deed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown One for each of us, darling.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No peeking.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Do you hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Follow my voice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m right here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have something for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Valar Morghulis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You look very handsome, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Oh, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The husband of your dreams.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But you do look glorious.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Perhaps we could have a moment alone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Do you mind?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark’s handmaiden?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My lady, I want you to know I didn’t ask for this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No, don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You don’t have to speak to me as a prisoner any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You won’t be a prisoner after today.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ll be my wife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I suppose that’s a different kind of prison.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I just wanted to say…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m just trying to say, very badly…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I just…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Just want to say I know how you feel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I doubt that very much, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I have no idea how you feel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And you have no idea how I feel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But I promise you one thing, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I won’t ever hurt you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Do you drink wine?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown When I have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, today you have to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You look radiant, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Radiant?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why radiant?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s the word that came to mind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We’re going to be sisters soon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We should be friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re a musical girl, aren’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I imagine you have a lovely voice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A better dancer than a singer, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But you know the song The Rains of Castamere?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They play it so often here at court.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not as well as you, I’m sure.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown House Reyne was a powerful family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Very wealthy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The second wealthiest in Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Aren’t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ambitious climbers don’t want to stop on the second highest rung.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If only you could take that final step, you’d see further than all the rest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And finally one day, he rebelled against my father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Do you know where House Reyne is now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A gentle word.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why not say “slaughtered”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My father let them rot up there all summer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It was a long summer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown “And now the rains weep o’er their halls, and not a soul to hear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” If you ever call me “sister” again, I’ll have you strangled in your sleep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your father’s gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Uh…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Could you…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Have you ever seen one like it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ve never seen anything like any of this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not in my life.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s shocking, isn’t it, the first time you encounter real wealth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And stew is a kind word for it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown In Flea Bottom we called them “bowls of brown.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown ” We’d pretend that the meat in them was chicken.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We knew it wasn’t chicken.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Here, taste this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You think I’m trying to poison you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That’s good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That’s really good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Where do you think it’s from?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I couldn’t even guess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Doesn’t matter, does it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s the real thing or it’s not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You only need a tongue to tell the difference.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Go on, have some more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You still don’t trust it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You think this is all a mistake that you have to pay for every bite you take.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There are no mistakes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not for us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m a mistake.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can’t even begin to understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We’re both a part of His plan.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He wants this for us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No, He demands this of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I don’t understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown This…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown This doesn’t seem very religious.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown According to whom?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Silent Sisters?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What have their gods done for you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Mmm?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown When you pray to them, what’s their answer?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A god is real or he’s not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You only need eyes to see.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Death is coming for everyone and everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A darkness that will swallow the dawn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And we can stop it, you and I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Let me show you what you have inside you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Come fight death with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have to trust me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Get it away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Get it off me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t fight, don’t fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They won’t take much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why are you doing this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I told you there’s power in the blood of kings.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And you have so much blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No, no, no, no!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not there!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You can blame Ser Davos.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He didn’t believe in the power of king’s blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He wanted a demonstration.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Please, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My lord!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The usurper Robb Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The usurper Balon Greyjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So their son will be your nephew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown After you’re wed to Cersei, of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And you will be the King’s stepfather and brotherinlaw.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown When you marry the King, Joffrey’s mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras’ nephew?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Grandson?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m not sure.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But your brother will become your fatherinlaw.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That much is beyond dispute.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Will you pardon me, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Enjoy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ve got a lifetime for that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Stay.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You seem rather drunk.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Rather less than I plan to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Isn’t it a man’s duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown This isn’t about your wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Renly Baratheon had a wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If you’re going to give her one, you need to perform.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What did you once call me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A drunken little lustfilled beast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown More than once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There you have it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Nothing to worry about.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I am the god of tits and wine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My father once told me…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Nobody cares what your father once told you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Congratulations, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Thank you, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, you’ve done it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’ve married a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Soon you’ll have a Lannister baby.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s a dream come true for you, isn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What a glorious day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yes, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I suppose it doesn’t really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Maybe I’ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How’d you like that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You wouldn’t?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That’s all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Time for the bedding ceremony.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There will be no bedding ceremony.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Where’s your respect for tradition, Uncle?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Come, everyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Get rid of her gown.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown She won’t be needing it any longer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Ladies, attend to my uncle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He’s not heavy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There will be no bedding ceremony.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown There will be if I command it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Then you’ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What did you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What did you say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A bad joke, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Mine is so small.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My poor wife won’t even know I’m there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Guilty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But it is my wedding night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Come, wife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not proud of it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don’t you agree?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Come, I’ll tell you all about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Put you in the mood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is that wise, my lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Tyrion, Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My name is Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is that wise, Tyrion?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Nothing was ever wiser.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Astoundingly long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Neck.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You have one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How old are you exactly?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, talk won’t make you any older.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Stop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I could, I won’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown But your father…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I won’t share your bed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not until you want me to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What if I never want you to?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And so my watch begins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Nineteen?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yes, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How can anyone speak languages?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What do you mean, “reasonably well”?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So guttural and harsh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It gave him great pride.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Athjahakar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Athjahaka.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Athjahakar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Athjahakar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, I suppose I’m a bit out of practice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It is the only proper language for poetry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No screaming, or she dies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Let her go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t scream, lovely girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You were sent here to kill me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So why haven’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I don’t want to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What do your captains have to say about that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You should ask them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We had philosophical differences.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Over what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Your beauty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It meant more to me than it did to them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You’re a strange man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’m the simplest man you’ll ever meet.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I only do what I want to do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown And this is supposed to impress me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They ordered me to murder you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I told them I preferred not to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They told me I had no choice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I told them I am Daario Naharis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I always have a choice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown They drew their swords and I drew mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Will you fight for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Swear to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You really ought to knock.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I brought your breakfast.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s getting dark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We could stay here for the night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown How hard can it be to build a fire?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It doesn’t matter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Come under the furs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown We can keep each other warm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He winked at me before.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I doubt it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I saw him wink at me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown He blinked.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I suppose it’s a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, I mean, there’s no real difference.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown A wink is on purpose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You thought of a name yet?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown This is just the way I talk.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll build that fire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t you think he should have a name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I don’t know many boys’ names.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Let’s see, there’s Duncan, Kevan, Jon…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Craster.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Uh…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Maybe that’s not…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Mormont.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown That’s a lovely idea, but Mormont’s a last name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Why is it a last name?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Well, it’s a family name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown For instance, I’m Samwell Tarly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You see?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown So my father is also a Tarly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No, Randyll Tarly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Randyll is a handsome name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Please don’t name him Randyll.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Is your father cruel, like mine?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Different manner of cruel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Not Randyll, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Don’t go out there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll be back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I just want to look.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Go inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Go back inside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown I’ll…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown It’s come for the baby.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown Stay back!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown You stay back!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No, you can’t have him!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode08 #unknown No!
