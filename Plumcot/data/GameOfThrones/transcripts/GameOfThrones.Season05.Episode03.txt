despondent_man Valar morghulis.
jaqen_hghar Valar dohaeris.
arya_stark I've been sweeping this floor for days.
jaqen_hghar Good.
arya_stark I didn't come here to sweep floors.
jaqen_hghar No? Why come, then?
arya_stark You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
jaqen_hghar A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. .
arya_stark I want to serve. .
jaqen_hghar A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.
arya_stark Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
jaqen_hghar There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
arya_stark Where are they taking him?
bystanders#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!
margaery_&_tommen_together I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.
tommen_baratheon Did I hurt you?
margaery_tyrell No. You were lovely.
tommen_baratheon It all happened so fast.
margaery_tyrell Yes. .
tommen_baratheon I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded
margaery_tyrell No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.
tommen_baratheon This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.
margaery_tyrell Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?
tommen_baratheon Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
margaery_tyrell No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.
tommen_baratheon King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
margaery_tyrell So strange… Husband.
tommen_baratheon Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died.
margaery_tyrell I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.
tommen_baratheon I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
tommen_baratheon Do you like to sail?
margaery_tyrell . I love to sail.
tommen_baratheon I do, too.
margaery_tyrell I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.
tommen_baratheon I do, too.
margaery_tyrell Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?
tommen_baratheon I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
margaery_tyrell It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
tommen_baratheon Well, but I'm a man now.
margaery_tyrell You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
tommen_baratheon I suppose.
margaery_tyrell I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.
cersei_lannister You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.
tommen_baratheon Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
cersei_lannister There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
tommen_baratheon That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
cersei_lannister . Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
tommen_baratheon The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.
cersei_lannister This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
tommen_baratheon I want you to be happy, mother.
cersei_lannister I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.
tommen_baratheon But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?
margaery_tyrell I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?" . And he said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."
margaery_tyrell Mother! . Welcome.
cersei_lannister Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
margaery_tyrell Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
cersei_lannister No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.
margaery_tyrell You are very sweet.
cersei_lannister Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
margaery_tyrell I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
cersei_lannister Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
margaery_tyrell Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. .
cersei_lannister I'll leave you to it then. .
margaery_tyrell Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?
cersei_lannister There's no need for such formalities.
margaery_tyrell In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.
cersei_lannister Won’t that be a lovely day.
margaery_tyrell Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
cersei_lannister Remember. Anything you need.
roose_bolton We can't hold the North with terror alone.
ramsay_bolton You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
roose_bolton I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.
ramsay_bolton Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.
roose_bolton He left you no choice.
ramsay_bolton I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.
roose_bolton And?
ramsay_bolton The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
roose_bolton . I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
roose_bolton We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
ramsay_bolton Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
roose_bolton I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.
sansa_stark That's Moat Cailin.
petyr_baelish Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.
sansa_stark On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?
petyr_baelish Home.
sansa_stark The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?
petyr_baelish . No.
sansa_stark Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
petyr_baelish He did.
sansa_stark He serves the Lannisters.
petyr_baelish For now.
sansa_stark I won't go.
petyr_baelish Winterfell is your home.
sansa_stark Not anymore.
petyr_baelish Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
sansa_stark I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
petyr_baelish You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -
sansa_stark No!
petyr_baelish Sansa -
sansa_stark No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.
petyr_baelish . I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.
podrick_payne How do we get through there?
brienne_of_tarth We don't. We go around. .
podrick_payne It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
brienne_of_tarth Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
brienne_of_tarth Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
podrick_payne He hates that nickname.
brienne_of_tarth Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?
podrick_payne I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.
brienne_of_tarth He borrowed it?
podrick_payne He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.
brienne_of_tarth As punishment. For both of you.
podrick_payne It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
brienne_of_tarth . Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.
podrick_payne I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
brienne_of_tarth I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
podrick_payne If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
brienne_of_tarth You want to be a knight, Pod?
podrick_payne Yes.
brienne_of_tarth Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.
podrick_payne Thank you.
brienne_of_tarth I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.
podrick_payne I suppose that's more important.
podrick_payne You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?
brienne_of_tarth I was.
podrick_payne Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
brienne_of_tarth He was.
podrick_payne But how did you end up serving Renly?
brienne_of_tarth . When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.
podrick_payne But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
brienne_of_tarth Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.
podrick_payne But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
brienne_of_tarth A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.
stannis_baratheon Lord Commander.
jon_snow . Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon . I'd like to speak alone.
jon_snow Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.
stannis_baratheon Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
jon_snow I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
stannis_baratheon Say the word and you will be.
jon_snow But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
stannis_baratheon I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
jon_snow I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.
stannis_baratheon You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
jon_snow I can imagine no higher praise.
stannis_baratheon I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you.
jon_snow May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?
stannis_baratheon Are you bored of us already?
jon_snow You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
stannis_baratheon I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
jon_snow And the wildlings?
stannis_baratheon They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.
jon_snow Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .
stannis_baratheon You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
stannis_baratheon You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
jon_snow I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
stannis_baratheon Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
davos_seaworth He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.
jon_snow I'm sorry I disappointed him.
davos_seaworth The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
jon_snow As long as he's ruling them.
davos_seaworth He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
jon_snow I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
davos_seaworth Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
olly Night gathers and now my watch begins -
davos_seaworth Not that bit, the bit at the end.
olly I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -
davos_seaworth Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.
jon_snow And what needs to be done?
davos_seaworth As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.
arya_stark What do you want?
the_waif Who are you?
arya_stark What?
the_waif You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?
arya_stark . No one.
arya_stark Ow! Cunt!
the_waif A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?
arya_stark I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -
the_waif Who are you?
arya_stark You're about to find out.
jaqen_hghar What are you doing?
the_waif We were only playing. The game of faces.
jaqen_hghar A girl is not ready.
the_waif Clearly not.
arya_stark . I am ready.
jaqen_hghar For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.
jaqen_hghar Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?
arya_stark What do we do with them after we wash them?
despondent_man Open gates!
roose_bolton Lady Sansa, welcome.
sansa_stark . Lord Bolton.
roose_bolton May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?
ramsay_bolton It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.
dothraki_woman_having_sex I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.
sansa_stark Thank you.
dothraki_woman_having_sex Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers.
jon_snow Sam. . Maester Aemon?
samwell_tarly He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
jon_snow Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.
jon_snow Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.
jon_snow Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
janos_slynt . Greyguard is a ruin.
jon_snow Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -
janos_slynt I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.
samwell_tarly Alright, alright! Enough of that.
jon_snow You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.
janos_slynt . I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!
jon_snow Are you refusing to obey my order?
janos_slynt You can stick your order up your bastard arse.
jon_snow Take Lord Janos outside.
jon_snow Olly, bring me my sword.
janos_slynt You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.
janos_slynt A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!
jon_snow If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.
janos_slynt . I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.
ashter#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Oh, pardon me, little one.

lancel_lannister . You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Repent!

crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Sinner! Sinner!
high_septon Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh…
qyburn It doesn't matter. .
high_septon As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.
cersei_lannister You were assaulted?
high_septon I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.
qyburn I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
mace_tyrell High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.
high_septon I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.
qyburn So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
grand_maester_pycelle A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
cersei_lannister What do you want from us, High Septon?
high_septon Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -
cersei_lannister And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
meryn_trant I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Seven blessings.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Thank you.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Just a little more...
dothraki_woman_having_sex Thank you ever so for the soup!
cersei_lannister A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
high_sparrow High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.
woman_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Seven blessings to you.
high_sparrow Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. .
cersei_lannister Why no shoes?
high_sparrow Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
cersei_lannister Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
high_sparrow Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.
cersei_lannister . Perhaps they're right.
high_sparrow It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.
cersei_lannister An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?
high_sparrow Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.
cersei_lannister The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.
high_sparrow I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
cersei_lannister . My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.
qyburn Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. .
qyburn At once, Your Grace. .
cersei_lannister How's your work coming along?
qyburn Very well.
cersei_lannister You've made progress?
qyburn More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but…
cersei_lannister Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately".
qyburn Shh. Easy, friend.
ramsay_bolton She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
petyr_baelish I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She’s suffered enough.
ramsay_bolton I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
petyr_baelish I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.
ramsay_bolton I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
roose_bolton . And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
ramsay_bolton Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. .
petyr_baelish He seems pleased.
roose_bolton Shouldn't he be?
petyr_baelish . I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.
roose_bolton I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.
petyr_baelish Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
roose_bolton And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.
petyr_baelish The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.
roose_bolton The Queen will be enraged.
petyr_baelish Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.
roose_bolton And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.
petyr_baelish A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.
roose_bolton I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?
petyr_baelish Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
roose_bolton I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
petyr_baelish The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.
roose_bolton I'd like to read the reply.
tyrion_lannister I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
lord_varys Volantis is a large city.
tyrion_lannister I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
lord_varys The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
tyrion_lannister Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
lord_varys I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
tyrion_lannister . I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
lord_varys It's a perfectly good face.
tyrion_lannister I'm losing my mind.
lord_varys If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.
tyrion_lannister Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.
tyrion_lannister Slaves.
lord_varys Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
street_red_priestess_volantis Lord cast your light upon us.
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Lord cast your light upon us.
street_red_priestess_volantis For the night is dark and full of terrors.
lord_varys We should keep moving.
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 For the night is dark and full of terrors.
street_red_priestess_volantis I was once as you are now.
street_red_priestess_volantis Bought and sold, , scourged and branded...
tyrion_lannister The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
street_red_priestess_volantis The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...
tyrion_lannister Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
street_red_priestess_volantis He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!
tyrion_lannister We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
tyrion_lannister . Come on. Let's find a brothel.
despondent_man It’s good luck to rub a dwarf’s head.
tyrion_lannister It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
tyrion_lannister See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.
lord_varys Thank you.
tyrion_lannister Curious... hair. .
despondent_man . The mother of dragons!
tyrion_lannister It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
lord_varys Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
despondent_man What makes you worth that much?
blonde_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 I’m magic. .
despondent_man I bet you bloody are.
tyrion_lannister Well, , she's taken.
lord_varys Where're you going?
tyrion_lannister I need to speak to someone with hair.
tyrion_lannister Hello?
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Hello.
tyrion_lannister You've got no drink.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 You've got no money.
tyrion_lannister Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.
tyrion_lannister That’s because they’ve never met a queen.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 You're just saying that.
tyrion_lannister You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Why?
tyrion_lannister Because you have a skeptical mind.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 . Alright, then. I'm warning you. We’re gonna have to wash you first.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Come on.
tyrion_lannister . I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Of course you can. You're shy.
tyrion_lannister I'm not.
black_haired_prostitute#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode03 Have another drink.
tyrion_lannister Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start.
tyrion_lannister No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.
tyrion_lannister You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
jorah_mormont I'm taking you to the Queen.
