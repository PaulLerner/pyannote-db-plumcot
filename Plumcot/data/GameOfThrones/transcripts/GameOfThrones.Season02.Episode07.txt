theon_greyjoy A cripple
black_lorren The giant must have took him.
theon_greyjoy The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple And Rickon, too? The little one?
black_lorren Gone, along with the wildling woman The one you were fucking.
theon_greyjoy Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
dagmer_cleftjaw (laughs)
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Come on, find the scent. Where they going?
dagmer_cleftjaw Halt!
theon_greyjoy Enjoying your first hunt?
maester_luwin So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.
theon_greyjoy With hunting, there's blood at the end.
maester_luwin They're little boys.
theon_greyjoy I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.
maester_luwin Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
theon_greyjoy They have no value to me missing.
maester_luwin Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
theon_greyjoy Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 We have a scent!
theon_greyjoy The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.
 osha We should have took more food.
bran_stark We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
osha Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
bran_stark And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.
osha The boy can't survive on walnuts.
rickon_stark I'm fine.
osha We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire. Hodor Hodor.
osha Even you, sweet giant.
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
rickon_stark Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
bran_stark We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.
rickon_stark Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
osha You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.
bran_stark They'll be after us with hounds.
osha We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.
ygritte Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
ygritte What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.
jon_snow Let's move.
ygritte It is the first time. How old are you, boy?
jon_snow I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
ygritte You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
jon_snow Don't call them that.
ygritte What, stones? Or bone?
jon_snow Neither. Both.
jon_snow Move!
ygritte I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?
jon_snow There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.
ygritte So the lads just do it with each other?
jon_snow No.
ygritte Never?
jon_snow Never. We swore an oath.
ygritte You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.
jon_snow Would you please shut up?
ygritte Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. - I'm a free woman.
jon_snow You're a free woman? I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.
jon_snow If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.
ygritte And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
jon_snow It was my choice to say the words.
ygritte So you don't like girls?
jon_snow Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them.
jon_snow That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
ygritte So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands
jon_snow Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother
ygritte Yhey're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
jon_snow My father I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.
ygritte So why are you fighting us?
 man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up.
tywin_lannister Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
the_mountain We hanged 20 men last night.
tywin_lannister I don't care if you hanged 100. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
the_mountain We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
tywin_lannister Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.
the_mountain Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane
tywin_lannister Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
tywin_lannister Mmm. Is that mutton?
arya_stark Yes, my lord.
tywin_lannister Don't like mutton.
arya_stark I'll bring something else.
tywin_lannister Leave it. Are you hungry?
arya_stark No.
tywin_lannister Of course you are. Eat.
arya_stark I'll eat in the kitchen later.
tywin_lannister It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer. Sit. Eat.
tywin_lannister You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
arya_stark I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
tywin_lannister Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
arya_stark Have you ever lost before?
tywin_lannister Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
arya_stark (shakes her head)
tywin_lannister But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.
tywin_lannister Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
arya_stark Dragons?
tywin_lannister Yes. Dragons happened.
tywin_lannister Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name
arya_stark Aegon and his sisters.
tywin_lannister Mmm?
arya_stark It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
tywin_lannister Correct. A student of history, are you?
arya_stark Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
tywin_lannister I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
arya_stark Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
tywin_lannister Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?
arya_stark (smiles)
tywin_lannister Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
arya_stark Most girls are idiots.
tywin_lannister You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
arya_stark From my father
tywin_lannister He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
arya_stark Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
tywin_lannister Careful now, girl I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.
tywin_lannister And, girl
tywin_lannister "M'lord.
tywin_lannister " Lowborn girls say "m'lord," not "my lord. " If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
arya_stark My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.
tywin_lannister You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
arya_stark Yes.
tywin_lannister Go on.
sansa_stark I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.
sandor_clegane Brave? A dog
sansa_stark Does it give you joy to scare people?
sandor_clegane No, it gives me joy to kill people.
sansa_stark (gasps)
sandor_clegane Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
sansa_stark It was his duty. He never liked it.
sandor_clegane Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
sansa_stark Why are you always so hateful?
sandor_clegane You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queenand I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king
xaro_xhoan_daxos I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.
daenerys_targaryen You are one of the Thirteen.
xaro_xhoan_daxos If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own.
daenerys_targaryen Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.
daenerys_targaryen There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
xaro_xhoan_daxos I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
daenerys_targaryen But it did happen under your roof.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been
daenerys_targaryen I don't care where you've been.
ygritte You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
jon_snow No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.
ygritte We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
ygritte You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
jon_snow Walk.
ygritte I could teach you how to do it.
jon_snow I know how to do it.
ygritte You know nothing, Jon Snow.
robb_stark And what did she say?
alton_lannister She admired your spirit, Your Grace.
robb_stark And what then?
alton_lannister She
robb_stark If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
alton_lannister She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
robb_stark You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.
rickard_karstark Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
roose_bolton Too many prisoners.
robb_stark Is there room for Ser Alton?
rickard_karstark Does he need to lie down?
robb_stark Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
rickard_karstark Torrhen.
robb_stark That will be all.
talisa_stark Your Grace. A minute of your time?
talisa_stark I've been treating your wounded men.
robb_stark And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
talisa_stark They're not my enemies.
robb_stark That's what I tell my bannermen.
talisa_stark I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses. But some are not. I need silk for stitching. I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
robb_stark If you need help finding these
talisa_stark I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.
robb_stark Continue, my lady.
talisa_stark You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
robb_stark Yes.
talisa_stark The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
robb_stark I expect he will.
talisa_stark If I could write a list.
robb_stark Come with me to the Crag.
talisa_stark I don't think that will be
robb_stark Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.
woaman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Children, come inside, quick. Come on.
child#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Hurry up!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent.
theon_greyjoy Try again.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
maester_luwin We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.
theon_greyjoy I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Prince Theon.
theon_greyjoy Where are they?
winterfell_shepherd Who, m'lord?
theon_greyjoy The Stark boys. Where are they?
winterfell_shepherd I don't know. I seen no one.
theon_greyjoy Think harder.
winterfell_shepherd I swear, m'lord. I don't know.
dagmer_cleftjaw My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for.
dagmer_cleftjaw Send the old man home.
theon_greyjoy (nods)
theon_greyjoy Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
maester_luwin Theon, don't do this.
daenerys_targaryen You came back.
jorah_mormont As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
daenerys_targaryen Irri is dead.
jorah_mormont I know. She was a good
daenerys_targaryen She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
jorah_mormont Doreah?
daenerys_targaryen We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
jorah_mormont I should have been here.
daenerys_targaryen You went to find me a ship.
jorah_mormont My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
daenerys_targaryen "These people"?
jorah_mormont They are not to be trusted.
daenerys_targaryen And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
jorah_mormont Your people are in Westeros.
daenerys_targaryen The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
jorah_mormont They will soon enough.
daenerys_targaryen And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother
daenerys_targaryen You are not your brother
jorah_mormont Trust me, Khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen There it is. "Trust me. " And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.
jorah_mormont You are too young to be so
daenerys_targaryen And you are too familiar.
jorah_mormont Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.
daenerys_targaryen Find my dragons.
ygritte How long till we get back to your crows?
jon_snow We're close.
ygritte What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?
jon_snow We're close.
ygritte What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
jon_snow Nothing happened between you and me.
ygritte "I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, "we were only close together for warmth. "And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. "I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. "And before I knew what was where, his his "Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. "And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! "And he spread me legs and ruined. "The shame of it. "Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. "What will me poor savage father say?"
jon_snow Turn back around.
ygritte "And I thought that we were done, but he said, "'Turn back around." I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just
jon_snow What, right here in the muck?
ygritte I'll keep you warm enough.
ygritte Are you that afraid of it?
jon_snow That's enough.
ygritte It's nice and wet and warm.
jon_snow Enough!
ygritte It don't have teeth.
ygritte All right! All right. Gods, you're dull.
ygritte Should have took me while you had the chance.
sansa_stark No, no!
sansa_stark No. Oh, no.
shae It's all right. Give me that.
sansa_stark If the Queen
shae Help me flip it over.
shae Where are you going?
handmaidenman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 To tell Her Grace.
shae You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
cersei_lannister Your mother You flowered, my dear. No more.
sansa_stark My mother
cersei_lannister In what way?
sansa_stark I thought it would be less Less messy.
cersei_lannister Wait until you birth a child.
cersei_lannister You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
sansa_stark I'm fit to bear children for the king
cersei_lannister A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.
sansa_stark (nods)
cersei_lannister Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
sansa_stark His Grace was not with you?
cersei_lannister Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
cersei_lannister You may never love the king
sansa_stark I love His Grace with all my heart.
cersei_lannister That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.
sansa_stark But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
cersei_lannister You can try, little dove
cersei_lannister Who did you say your mother was again?
alton_lannister Cinda Lannister.
jaime_lannister Is she the fat one?
alton_lannister Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she
jaime_lannister No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.
alton_lannister I squired for you once, you know.
jaime_lannister When?
alton_lannister The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.
jaime_lannister I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
alton_lannister You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
jaime_lannister He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
alton_lannister Bryan.
jaime_lannister Poor lad. That was my brother I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.
alton_lannister That's right. I ran up and volunteered. "Let me, my lord. Let me. " My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.
jaime_lannister You didn't, though.
alton_lannister You really remember?
jaime_lannister You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.
alton_lannister When I think back to that day
stark_guard Shh!
jaime_lannister You were saying?
alton_lannister I Never mind. It's embarrassing.
jaime_lannister More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
alton_lannister I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
jaime_lannister I understand completely.
alton_lannister How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.
jaime_lannister It's just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
alton_lannister Which knight was it?
jaime_lannister Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
alton_lannister What was he like?
jaime_lannister He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.
alton_lannister It's hard to put into words.
jaime_lannister It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
alton_lannister (nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
alton_lannister Did you squire for him again?
jaime_lannister No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.
alton_lannister (smiles)
jaime_lannister It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
alton_lannister And have you thought about
jaime_lannister Of course. Every day.
alton_lannister And?
jaime_lannister Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.
alton_lannister (nods)
jaime_lannister But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.
alton_lannister What is it?
jaime_lannister It's actually quite simple.
alton_lannister Well, let me help you.
jaime_lannister You'll only have to do one thing.
alton_lannister Tell me.
jaime_lannister (whispers)You'll have to die.
quaithe Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
jorah_mormont I didn't come here for lessons.
quaithe No, you came for the dragons.
jorah_mormont You have them? Where are they?
quaithe Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
quaithe You love her.
jorah_mormont Where are the dragons?
quaithe Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
quaithe Will you betray her again?
jorah_mormont Never.
quaithe The thief you seek is with her now.
spice_king I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
xaro_xhoan_daxos No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
daenerys_targaryen Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.
silk_king Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
daenerys_targaryen Without me, the dragons will die.
spice_king It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
pyat_pree You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen How?
pyat_pree I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
daenerys_targaryen You have my dragons?
pyat_pree When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King He procured them for me.
daenerys_targaryen But there is no King
xaro_xhoan_daxos There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.
xaro_xhoan_daxos You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
spice_king Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatando not make you a king
xaro_xhoan_daxos An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
pyat_pree The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.
pyat_pree A mother should be with her children.
pyat_pree Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.

catelyn_stark You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king
rickard_karstark And where is our king
robb_stark You know very well.
rickard_karstark He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him.
catelyn_stark How dare you!
brienne_of_tarth Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
rickard_karstark Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
catelyn_stark I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my sonthe King
rickard_karstark When your son
catelyn_stark Wise men do not make demands of kings.
rickard_karstark Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
jaime_lannister Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but
catelyn_stark Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
jaime_lannister You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
catelyn_stark And gag him!
 tyrion_lannister Since when do you light your own candles?
cersei_lannister Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
cersei_lannister How many times can you read one raven scroll?
tyrion_lannister Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.
cersei_lannister More than we have.
tyrion_lannister Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
cersei_lannister We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.
tyrion_lannister "Rain fire on them from above." You're quoting Father
cersei_lannister Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
cersei_lannister I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
tyrion_lannister He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
cersei_lannister I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
tyrion_lannister I thought the girls might help him.
cersei_lannister Did you?
tyrion_lannister I was wrong. If we can't control him
cersei_lannister Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
tyrion_lannister It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
cersei_lannister I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
tyrion_lannister The boy
cersei_lannister Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.
tyrion_lannister Sins?
cersei_lannister The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? "Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."
tyrion_lannister You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Then why wait?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 We're sworn to the king.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 There's not a king.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 That's treason.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 Back off, you.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode07 No, I won't.
brienne_of_tarth Your son
catelyn_stark So they say.
brienne_of_tarth The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
catelyn_stark Come.
catelyn_stark I need to be alone with him.
stark_guard My lady, our orders
catelyn_stark Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
jaime_lannister Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?
catelyn_stark Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
jaime_lannister Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
catelyn_stark You strangled his son
jaime_lannister Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
catelyn_stark You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
jaime_lannister So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your fatherdespises the king No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?
catelyn_stark She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.
jaime_lannister Kingslayer. What a king Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
catelyn_stark You are a man without honor.
jaime_lannister Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard
catelyn_stark Brienne.
jaime_lannister No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy
catelyn_stark (to BRIENNE) Your sword.
theon_greyjoy I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
maester_luwin What are you doing? What have you done?
theon_greyjoy If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.
maester_luwin No!
