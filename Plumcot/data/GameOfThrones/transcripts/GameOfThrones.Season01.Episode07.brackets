[jaime_lannister] "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
[tywin_lannister] Attacking him was stupid.
[tywin_lannister] Lannisters don't act like fools.
[jaime_lannister] Catelyn Stark took my brother.
[tywin_lannister] Why is he still alive?
[jaime_lannister] Tyrion?
[tywin_lannister] Ned Stark.
[jaime_lannister] One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
[tywin_lannister] Why is he still alive?
[jaime_lannister] It wouldn't have been clean.
[tywin_lannister] Clean...
[tywin_lannister] You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
[jaime_lannister] I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
[tywin_lannister] Now that's what you want people to think of you.
[jaime_lannister] It's the truth.
[tywin_lannister] When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
[jaime_lannister] Of course it bothers me.
[tywin_lannister] The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
[jaime_lannister] I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
[tywin_lannister] He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
[jaime_lannister] So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
[tywin_lannister] No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!
[tywin_lannister] Hmm.
[cersei_lannister] You're in pain.
[eddard_stark] I've had worse, my lady.
[cersei_lannister] Perhaps it's time to go home.
[eddard_stark] The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
[eddard_stark] I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
[cersei_lannister] Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
[eddard_stark] Has he done this before?
[cersei_lannister] Jaime would have killed him.
[cersei_lannister] My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
[eddard_stark] Your brother Or your lover?
[cersei_lannister] The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
[cersei_lannister] Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
[eddard_stark] My son saw you with him.
[cersei_lannister] Do you love your children?
[eddard_stark] With all my heart.
[cersei_lannister] No more than I love mine.
[eddard_stark] And they are all Jaime's.
[cersei_lannister] Thank the Gods.
[eddard_stark] You've always hated him.
[cersei_lannister] Hated him? I worshiped him.
[eddard_stark] When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
[cersei_lannister] And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.
[eddard_stark] I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
[cersei_lannister] Oh, but it was.
[ros] Come here.
[petyr_baelish] No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
[ros] Yes, My Lord.
[petyr_baelish] Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.
[ros] Why don't you join us, My Lord?
[petyr_baelish] I'm saving myself for another.
[ros] What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
[petyr_baelish] A stupid saying.
[ros] She must be very beautiful.
[petyr_baelish] No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.
[ros] I do believe my lord's in love.
[petyr_baelish] For many years. Most of my life really.
[ros] Is she still married to him?
[petyr_baelish] Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
[ros] And what do you want?
[petyr_baelish] Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.
[theon_greyjoy] You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
[osha] Where is it you come from?
[theon_greyjoy] The Iron Islands.
[osha] They far away?
[theon_greyjoy] You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
[osha] Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
[theon_greyjoy] Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
[osha] And what's that?
[theon_greyjoy] Lord.
[osha] Why?
[theon_greyjoy] Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
[osha] What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
[theon_greyjoy] I will be lord after my father.
[osha] So you're not lord now?
[theon_greyjoy] No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?
[osha] I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
[theon_greyjoy] I'm not a Southerner.
[osha] You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
[theon_greyjoy] You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
[osha] Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.
[theon_greyjoy] Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
[maester_luwin] Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
[theon_greyjoy] I thought she was our prisoner.
[maester_luwin] Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
[maester_luwin] Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
[osha] I'm used to worse than him.
[osha] I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
[maester_luwin] Why did you come here?
[osha] Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
[maester_luwin] Why? What are you afraid of?
[osha] There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
[maester_luwin] Owls and Shadowcats and...
[osha] I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
[maester_luwin] The "things" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.
[osha] They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.
[samwell_tarly] I miss girls.
[jon_snow] Why is he alone?
[samwell_tarly] One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...
[jon_snow] There's no rider.
[night_watch_stable_boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07] Whoa, boy, whoa.
[jon_snow] That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
[renly_baratheon] Ned! It's Robert.
[robert_baratheon] I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
[robert_baratheon] My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.
[cersei_lannister] Robert, my sweet...
[robert_baratheon] Out, all of you!
[eddard_stark] You damned fool.
[robert_baratheon] Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
[robert_baratheon] Give it to the council after I'm dead.
[eddard_stark] I will.
[robert_baratheon] And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.
[eddard_stark] I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
[robert_baratheon] My memory.
[eddard_stark] Give him milk of the poppy.
[barristan_selmy] He was reeling from the wine.
[eddard_stark] No man could have protected him from himself.
[lord_varys] I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
[barristan_selmy] His squire, from the king's own skin.
[eddard_stark] His squire? The Lannister boy?
[lord_varys] Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
[eddard_stark] His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
[lord_varys] I'm afraid those birds have flown.
[khal_drogo] The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.
[daenerys_targaryen] According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.
[khal_drogo] The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
[daenerys_targaryen] The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.
[khal_drogo] Not dirt. Lands.
[daenerys_targaryen] Lands, yes...
[khal_drogo] Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
[daenerys_targaryen] It's not a chair. It's a... Throne
[khal_drogo] Throne?
[daenerys_targaryen] A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.
[khal_drogo] A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
[daenerys_targaryen] Can't you help me make him understand?
[jorah_mormont] The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
[daenerys_targaryen] My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
[jorah_mormont] Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
[daenerys_targaryen] And because he had dragons.
[jorah_mormont] Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
[daenerys_targaryen] You don't believe it.
[jorah_mormont] Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.
[daenerys_targaryen] Well, I'll come with you.
[jorah_mormont] No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
[little_bird] Psst, Jorah the Andal.
[wine_merchant] Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
[wine_merchant] A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.
[daenerys_targaryen] My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
[wine_merchant] My Lady, you are from Westeros.
[doreah] You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
[wine_merchant] Princess.
[daenerys_targaryen] Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
[wine_merchant] That? Dornish swill.
[daenerys_targaryen] You honor me, Ser.
[wine_merchant] The honor...the honor is all mine.
[rakharo] Huh-uh, huh-uh.
[wine_merchant] You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
[daenerys_targaryen] I hope to repay your kindness someday.
[jorah_mormont] Rakharo.
[rakharo] Huh.
[jorah_mormont] Put down that cask.
[daenerys_targaryen] Is something wrong?
[jorah_mormont] I have a thirst. Open it.
[wine_merchant] The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
[jorah_mormont] Open it.
[jorah_mormont] Pour.
[wine_merchant] It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
[daenerys_targaryen] Do as he says.
[wine_merchant] As the princess commands.
[wine_merchant] Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.
[jorah_mormont] You first.
[wine_merchant] Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
[daenerys_targaryen] You will drink.
[doreah] Khaleesi! Stop him!
[jorah_mormont] Come.
[jeor_mormont] You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
[samwell_tarly] You're allowed to look happy.
[jon_snow] I want to find my Uncle.
[samwell_tarly] I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.
[samwell_tarly] There's honor in being a steward.
[jeor_mormont] Here you begin anew.
[jon_snow] I do, my lord.
[jeor_mormont] You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
[jon_snow] Yes, my lord.
[jeor_mormont] You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.
[samwell_tarly] my lord, might I go as well?
[jeor_mormont] Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
[samwell_tarly] No, my lord.
[samwell_tarly] The Night's Watch is my house now.
[jeor_mormont] As you wish, lad.
[jaremy_rykker] Rangers with me.
[othell_yarwyck] Builders!
[maester_aemon] Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
[jon_snow] Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
[maester_aemon] Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
[jon_snow] Do you take me for a servant?
[maester_aemon] We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
[jon_snow] May I go?
[maester_aemon] As you wish.
[samwell_tarly] Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?
[jon_snow] I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.
[pypar] Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
[samwell_tarly] I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
[pypar] You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
[samwell_tarly] Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.
[samwell_tarly] Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
[jon_snow] I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.
[samwell_tarly] I always wanted to be a Wizard.
[renly_baratheon] Lord Stark, a moment.
[renly_baratheon] He named you Protector of the Realm.
[renly_baratheon] She won't care.
[eddard_stark] And what should I do with a hundred swords?
[renly_baratheon] Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
[eddard_stark] What about Stannis?
[renly_baratheon] Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
[eddard_stark] Stannis is your older brother.
[renly_baratheon] This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
[eddard_stark] Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
[renly_baratheon] Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.Tell me something Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
[eddard_stark] I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
[eddard_stark] You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
[tomard] Yes, My Lord.
[eddard_stark] Now leave us.
[petyr_baelish] My Lord protector.
[eddard_stark] The King has no true born sons.
[petyr_baelish] So when the King dies...
[eddard_stark] The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
[petyr_baelish] So it would seem. Unless...
[eddard_stark] There is no "unless".
[petyr_baelish] And he cannot take the throne without your help.
[eddard_stark] Do you have a shred of honor?
[petyr_baelish] You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
[eddard_stark] We?
[petyr_baelish] You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.
[eddard_stark] What you suggest is treason.
[petyr_baelish] Only if we lose.
[eddard_stark] Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.Petyr Baelish We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord.
[eddard_stark] No. I won't do it.
[petyr_baelish] So it will be Stannis and war?
[eddard_stark] There is no other choice. He is the heir.
[petyr_baelish] So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.
[eddard_stark] You promised Catelyn you would help me.
[petyr_baelish] Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
[jon_snow_&_samwell_tarly#together] Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
[othell_yarwyck] You knelt as boys.
[nights_watch_officer] Well done. Well done.
[samwell_tarly] What's he got there?
[samwell_tarly] Gods be good!
[daenerys_targaryen] What will they do to him?
[daenerys_targaryen] And when he falls?
[daenerys_targaryen] King Robert still wants me dead.
[daenerys_targaryen] I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.
[daenerys_targaryen] He will not have my son.
[khal_drogo] Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
[khal_drogo] Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.
[messenger#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07] Lord Stark!
[varly] Stop!
[eddard_stark] No, all right.
[messenger#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07] Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.
[eddard_stark] King Joffrey?
[messenger#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07] King Robert is gone.
[petyr_baelish] All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
[eddard_stark] Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
[lord_varys] I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
[janos_slynt] We stand behind you, Lord Stark.
[messenger#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07] All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
[joffrey_baratheon] I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
[eddard_stark] Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
[barristan_selmy] King Robert's seal. Unbroken.
[cersei_lannister] May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?
[barristan_selmy] Those were the King's words.
[cersei_lannister] We have a new King now.
[joffrey_baratheon] Liar!
[cersei_lannister] You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
[eddard_stark] Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.
[cersei_lannister] You think he stands alone?
[joffrey_baratheon] Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
[eddard_stark] Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
[janos_slynt] Men of the Watch!
[eddard_stark] I want no bloodshed.
[petyr_baelish] Now!
[petyr_baelish] I did warn you not to trust me.
