grey_worm My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."
missandei Isles. Summer Isles.
grey_worm Summer Isles. (speaks Valeryian)
missandei (speaks Valeryian) I am from an island called Naath.
grey_worm (speaks Valeryian) When they took you?
missandei "When did they take me?" I was five years old.
grey_worm You remember your home?
missandei I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
grey_worm (Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing.
missandei That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
grey_worm I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
missandei Kill the masters.
grey_worm Kill the masters.
daenerys_targaryen How are the lessons coming?
missandei Very well, Your Grace.
grey_worm Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
daenerys_targaryen You'll have to continue later. It's time.
mossador (speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
elder_meereen_slave (speaking Valyrian.) You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
mossador (speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
mossador (speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
meereen_slave#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 (speaking Valyrian.) I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
elder_meereen_slave (speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way the Masters in power and the slaves dead.
grey_worm (speaking Valyrian.) All men must die.
grey_worm (speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.
elder_meereen_slave (speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
grey_worm (speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.
elder_meereen_slave (speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
meereen_slave#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 (speaking Valyrian.) We have no training, weapons.
grey_worm (speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.
great_master_1 (Curses in Valyrian.)
elder_meereen_slave Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
elder_meereen_slave Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
elder_meereen_slave Mhysa! Mhysa!
daenerys_targaryen Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
jorah_mormont 163, Khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen Yes, that was it.
unsullied_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 (shouts in Valyrian.)
barristan_selmy Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
daenerys_targaryen I will answer injustice with justice.
jaime_lannister What the hell was that?
bronn That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
jaime_lannister You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.
bronn You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
jaime_lannister You talk to my brother this way?
bronn All the time. He got used to it.
jaime_lannister Do you think he did it?
bronn No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?
bronn You haven't been to see him yet, eh?
jaime_lannister We're done for today.
bronn Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
jaime_lannister You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
bronn Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
jaime_lannister To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
tyrion_lannister Is that supposed to make me feel better?
jaime_lannister Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
tyrion_lannister It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?
jaime_lannister How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
tyrion_lannister Her son?
jaime_lannister Don't. You know what's coming?
tyrion_lannister My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
jaime_lannister Now that you mention it, she did ask.
tyrion_lannister So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
jaime_lannister Depends. Did you do it?
tyrion_lannister The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
jaime_lannister Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
tyrion_lannister Well, you could set me free.
jaime_lannister You know I can't.
tyrion_lannister Then there's really nothing else to say.
jaime_lannister What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
tyrion_lannister Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
jaime_lannister Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
tyrion_lannister Except I didn't do it.
jaime_lannister Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.
jaime_lannister Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
tyrion_lannister Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
tyrion_lannister No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.
sansa_stark Where are you taking me?
petyr_baelish I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
sansa_stark Did you kill Joffrey?
petyr_baelish Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
sansa_stark I know it was you.
petyr_baelish And who helped me with this conspiracy?
sansa_stark Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
petyr_baelish Why not?
sansa_stark Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
petyr_baelish Then perhaps it was your husband.
sansa_stark No.
petyr_baelish How do you know?
sansa_stark I just do.
petyr_baelish You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
sansa_stark The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
petyr_baelish A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
sansa_stark I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?
petyr_baelish So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
sansa_stark And what do you want?
petyr_baelish Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?
sansa_stark Who could trust you?
petyr_baelish I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
margaery_tyrell I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
olenna_tyrell The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
margaery_tyrell (laughs)
olenna_tyrell Have you been to see Tommen yet?
margaery_tyrell No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
olenna_tyrell I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
margaery_tyrell (laughs)
olenna_tyrell How absentminded of me.
margaery_tyrell Mm-hmm.
olenna_tyrell The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
margaery_tyrell (laughs)
olenna_tyrell And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
margaery_tyrell Well, he could have done.
olenna_tyrell He could have done,but he didn't.
margaery_tyrell You don't know, Grandmother.
olenna_tyrell But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?
margaery_tyrell What? I don't understand.
olenna_tyrell Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
jon_snow Bring it through! And again.
jon_snow Very nice. Good.
jon_snow A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
jon_snow Let's see what you can do.
jon_snow Olly, you just watch for now.
olly I can fight.
jon_snow Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
olly I was!
grenn I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn.
jon_snow You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.
jon_snow You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
locke He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
alliser_thorne Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
jon_snow Grenn and I were helping them.
alliser_thorne Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
jon_snow Someone has to train them.
alliser_thorne And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
alliser_thorne Get back to work. Now! I said now!
janos_slynt The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
alliser_thorne You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
janos_slynt For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
locke A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.
jon_snow My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
locke Name's Locke.
jon_snow Jon Snow.
jon_snow You fight well.
locke What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
alliser_thorne Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?
locke Guess I was wrong.
jaime_lannister You sent for me, Your Grace?
cersei_lannister Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
jaime_lannister Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
cersei_lannister So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
jaime_lannister I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
cersei_lannister The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
jaime_lannister What?
cersei_lannister I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
jaime_lannister You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
cersei_lannister She hoped or did you promise?
jaime_lannister I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
cersei_lannister So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
jaime_lannister I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
cersei_lannister You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
jaime_lannister Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
cersei_lannister I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
jaime_lannister I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
cersei_lannister And?
jaime_lannister He didn't do it, Cersei.
cersei_lannister You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.
tommen_baratheon Ser Pounce?
tommen_baratheon How did you get past the Kingsguard?
margaery_tyrell Kingsguard.
tommen_baratheon I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
margaery_tyrell I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.
margaery_tyrell Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?
tommen_baratheon Yes. But if my mother found out...
margaery_tyrell It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...
tommen_baratheon Yes? Tell me a secret.
margaery_tyrell Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
tommen_baratheon That's Ser Pounce.
margaery_tyrell Very handsome.
tommen_baratheon Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
margaery_tyrell That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
tommen_baratheon No. I don't think I am.
margaery_tyrell That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
tommen_baratheon We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast.
margaery_tyrell When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.
margaery_tyrell Remember, our little secret.
brienne_of_tarth "Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
jaime_lannister It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
brienne_of_tarth Valyrian steel.
jaime_lannister Mmm. It's yours.
brienne_of_tarth I can't accept this.
jaime_lannister It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.
jaime_lannister I hope I got your measurements right.
brienne_of_tarth I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
jaime_lannister I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
brienne_of_tarth I don't need a squire.
jaime_lannister Of course you do.
brienne_of_tarth He'll slow me down.
jaime_lannister My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
podrick_payne I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well.
jaime_lannister See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
bronn Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
bronn What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.
jaime_lannister They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
brienne_of_tarth Oathkeeper.
jaime_lannister Good-bye, Brienne.
podrick_payne Come on, move.
samwell_tarly I should neverhave taken her away.
jon_snow She wasn't safe here.
samwell_tarly She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.
jon_snow Castle Black could be next.
samwell_tarly I should go back for Gilly.
jon_snow We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
samwell_tarly I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
jon_snow And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
samwell_tarly I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.
jon_snow How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
samwell_tarly I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
jon_snow The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
samwell_tarly Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
locke Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
alliser_thorne Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.
jon_snow Thank you, Ser Alliser.
jon_snow Ahem, brothers.
jon_snow I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?
jon_snow I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
locke Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
alliser_thorne (nods)
jon_snow Thank you, brothers.
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 No, don't. Don't, please.
woman_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
karl_tanner Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
karl_tanner Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?
karl_tanner Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.
karl_tanner Rast.
karl_tanner Go outside and feed the beast.
rast We should kill that thing.
karl_tanner You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
karl_tanner Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?
karl_tanner Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?
karl_tanner I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.
women#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season04.Episode04 A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
karl_tanner What the fuck is that?
sissy Craster's last child. A boy.
karl_tanner What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
karl_tanner Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
sissy He didn't kill them. He offered them.
karl_tanner To who?
sissy To the gods. The white walkers.

karl_tanner Rast is headed that way.
rast Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
rast Fuck!
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark Do you hear that?
meera_reed Is that a baby?
jojen_reed It's coming.
bran_stark I'm going out there.
meera_reed No, we need to stay together.
bran_stark I'm going.
jojen_reed Bran. Bran.
hodor Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
meera_reed Bran, what happened?
bran_stark Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.
meera_reed Who?
bran_stark I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost.
bran_stark They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
meera_reed If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
meera_reed They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go.
bran_stark No.
meera_reed Bran, we need to go now.
bran_stark I'm not leaving without Summer.
meera_reed Can you remember where the cage was?
bran_stark The east side of the keep.
meera_reed If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...
hodor Hodor.
hodor Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
hodor Hodor.
rast If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.
karl_tanner Help him up.
karl_tanner This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
karl_tanner You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?
karl_tanner I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
karl_tanner See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
rast What the fuck's wrong with him?
karl_tanner Come here.
meera_reed (screams) No, please. Please.Please, let me help him.
karl_tanner Who are you?
meera_reed Please.
karl_tanner Who are you?
bran_stark I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
rast It's Jon Snow's brother.
meera_reed It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
karl_tanner And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
meera_reed I'm right here.
