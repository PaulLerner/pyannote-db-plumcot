syrio_forel Yah! Left high, left low.
syrio_forel Right low, lunge right.
steward_of_house_stark If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...
septa_mordane Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
sansa_stark She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
septa_mordane Hush! Go back to your room.
sansa_stark What is it? What's happening?
septa_mordane Do as I told you. Run!
syrio_forel This way! Left, right.
arya_stark You said right, but you went left.
syrio_forel And now you are a dead girl.
arya_stark Only 'cause you lied.
syrio_forel My tongue lied.
arya_stark I was so. I watched, but you...
syrio_forel Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
meryn_trant Arya Stark, come with us.
syrio_forel And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
meryn_trant Mind your place, dancing master.
arya_stark My father wouldn't send you.
arya_stark And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
meryn_trant Take her.
syrio_forel Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
kings_guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 Get out of my way, little man.
syrio_forel I am Syrio Forel.
kings_guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 Foreign bastard.
syrio_forel And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
meryn_trant Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
syrio_forel Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
meryn_trant Bloody oafs.
syrio_forel Be gone now, Arya.
arya_stark Come with me. Run.
syrio_forel The first sword of Braavos does not run.
syrio_forel What do we say to the God of death?
arya_stark Not today.
syrio_forel Go.
arya_stark Not today. Not today.
sansa_stark Stay away from me.
sandor_clegane Who do you think sent me?
arya_stark Needle.
stable_boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 There she is.
arya_stark What do you want?
stable_boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
arya_stark Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
stable_boy#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 She'll reward me, the Queen!
arya_stark Stay away!
lord_varys Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
eddard_stark Varys.
lord_varys I promise you it isn't poisoned.
eddard_stark What about my daughters?
lord_varys The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
eddard_stark And Sansa?
lord_varys Still engaged to Joffrey.
eddard_stark You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
lord_varys And would again, My Lord.
eddard_stark The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
lord_varys Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.
eddard_stark The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
lord_varys The wrong brother sadly.
eddard_stark If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
lord_varys Not today, My Lord.
eddard_stark Tell me something, Varys.
lord_varys The Realm, My Lord.
jeor_mormont It's Othor, without a doubt.
othell_yarwyck The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
jeor_mormont Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
jon_snow Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.
jeor_mormont Mmm.
samwell_tarly The smell.
othell_yarwyck What smell?
samwell_tarly There is none.
jon_snow We should burn them.
othell_yarwyck Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
jeor_mormont I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
othell_yarwyck You heard him.
alliser_thorne Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.
nights_watch_brother#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 Come on, move 'em out.
jeor_mormont Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
jon_snow Is there any word of my father?
jeor_mormont Sit.
jeor_mormont I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
jon_snow My sisters were in King's Landing too.
jeor_mormont I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
lord_varys Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
grand_maester_pycelle King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
sansa_stark He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
cersei_lannister Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
grand_maester_pycelle A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
sansa_stark No, I'm not.
petyr_baelish The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
cersei_lannister Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.
sansa_stark Robb.
cersei_lannister Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
sansa_stark If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...
cersei_lannister You disappoint me, child.
sansa_stark I only meant that...what will happen to him?
cersei_lannister That depends.
sansa_stark On...on what?
cersei_lannister On your brother. And on you.
robb_stark Treason? Sansa wrote this?
maester_luwin It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
robb_stark Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
maester_luwin This is a royal command, My Lord.
robb_stark I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
maester_luwin All of them, My Lord?
robb_stark They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
maester_luwin They have.
maester_luwin Yeah.
theon_greyjoy Are you afraid?
robb_stark I must be.
theon_greyjoy Good.
robb_stark Why is that good?
theon_greyjoy It means you're not stupid.
catelyn_stark You've had this since dawn?
lysa_arryn He sent it to me, not you.
catelyn_stark A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.
lysa_arryn A war? Your son against the Lannisters?
catelyn_stark Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law!
lysa_arryn Family means everything to me.
robin_arryn I'm hungry.
lysa_arryn Hush now, darling. You just ate.
catelyn_stark You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
robin_arryn But I'm hungry!
lysa_arryn Soon, love, soon.
catelyn_stark That is what I ask.
lysa_arryn Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.
catelyn_stark If you fear for the safety of your son...
lysa_arryn Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
catelyn_stark And that is why we have to stop them.
lysa_arryn The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
bronn Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
tyrion_lannister If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
bronn I should just take your food and leave you here.
tyrion_lannister Starve, most likely.
bronn You don't think I'd do it, do you?
tyrion_lannister What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?
bronn Fair enough.
tyrion_lannister Though I would treasure your friendship.
bronn Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
tyrion_lannister Come, share our fire.
shagga When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
tyrion_lannister I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
tyrion_lannister In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
tyrion_lannister No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful.
shagga We have no use for a half man's promises.
tyrion_lannister Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
shagga You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
tyrion_lannister That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
shagga What is "this"?
tyrion_lannister The Vale of Arryn.
alliser_thorne Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
samwell_tarly Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!
alliser_thorne Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard.
jeor_mormont I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
jon_snow Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?
jon_snow Commander?
jon_snow Stay.
jon_snow Hello?
jeor_mormont Snow!?
jon_snow Commander!
jon_snow Move move!
daenerys_targaryen What did they do?
rakharo Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers.
daenerys_targaryen I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
jorah_mormont Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros.
daenerys_targaryen Jorah, make them stop.
jorah_mormont Khaleesi?
daenerys_targaryen You heard me.
jorah_mormont These men have shed blood for their Khal.
rakharo She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor.
jorah_mormont Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
daenerys_targaryen I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
rakharo Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!
jorah_mormont Come.
dothraki_man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
jorah_mormont What do you want done with them?
daenerys_targaryen Bring her to me. And those women there.
jorah_mormont You cannot claim them all, Princess.
daenerys_targaryen I can, and I will.
mago Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
khal_drogo Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
khal_drogo Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils.
daenerys_targaryen Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted.
khal_drogo This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
daenerys_targaryen It pleases me to keep them safe.
qotho Does the horse mate with the lamb?
daenerys_targaryen The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
mago You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
daenerys_targaryen I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
khal_drogo See how fierce she grows?
mago A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
khal_drogo Ohosa. Os.
khal_drogo The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
khal_drogo The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
khal_drogo Until nothing is left of you but bones!
mago First you have to kill me!
daenerys_targaryen My sun and stars is wounded.
khal_drogo A scratch, moon of my life.
daenerys_targaryen Where are the healers?
khal_drogo This is the bite of a fly.
mirri_maz_duur I can help the great rider with his cut.
qotho The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
daenerys_targaryen She is mine let her speak.
mirri_maz_duur Thank you, silver lady.
daenerys_targaryen Who are you?
mirri_maz_duur I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
qotho A witch.
mirri_maz_duur My mother was Godswife here before me.
qotho Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
mirri_maz_duur lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
daenerys_targaryen Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars.
greatjon_umber For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
robb_stark Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
greatjon_umber The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
robb_stark You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
greatjon_umber Oathbreaker, is it?!
greatjon_umber I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
robb_stark My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
greatjon_umber Your meat...is bloody tough.
bran_stark What is it? What's happened?
robb_stark Shh, it's all right.
bran_stark Where are you going?
robb_stark South. For father.
bran_stark But it's the middle of the night.
robb_stark The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
bran_stark They have more men than we do.
robb_stark Aye, they do.
bran_stark Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding.
robb_stark There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
bran_stark I will.
robb_stark I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
bran_stark How long have you been hiding out there?
rickon_stark They've all gone away.
bran_stark They'll be back soon.
rickon_stark No, they won't.
bran_stark Please watch over Robb.
osha You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you.
bran_stark What are you doing here?
osha They're my Gods too.
bran_stark You're not a slave.
bran_stark Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
bran_stark What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
osha You asked them, they're answering you.
bran_stark It's only the wind.
osha Well, there's a big man.
bran_stark Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
osha Giants and worse than giants.
samwell_tarly They were touched by White Walkers.
jon_snow How do you know that?
samwell_tarly I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
jon_snow What else did the book say?
samwell_tarly The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
pypar And when they wake up, what?
samwell_tarly I hope The Wall is high enough.
rodrik_cassel Summer snows, My Lady.
catelyn_stark Robb's brought the North with him.
robb_stark The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
greatjon_umber One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large.
robb_stark Mother!
catelyn_stark You look well.
greatjon_umber Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
theon_greyjoy We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
catelyn_stark I had not thought to be here.
greatjon_umber You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out.
rodrik_cassel Jon.
greatjon_umber You're not wasting away, are you?
catelyn_stark I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
robb_stark There was no one else.
catelyn_stark No one? Who were those men I saw here?
robb_stark None of them are Starks.
catelyn_stark All of them are seasoned in battle.
robb_stark If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
catelyn_stark Oh, would that I could.
robb_stark There was a letter. From Sansa.
catelyn_stark From the Queen, you mean.
robb_stark No.
catelyn_stark How many men do you have?
robb_stark 18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
catelyn_stark you would never be allowed to leave. No.
robb_stark And if I lose?
catelyn_stark Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?
robb_stark They were butchered in their sleep.
catelyn_stark On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder.
robb_stark Well, that makes it simple then.
catelyn_stark I suppose it does.
tyrion_lannister From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
shagga Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
tyrion_lannister And feed it to the goats, yes.
tyrion_lannister Uncle. Father.
tywin_lannister The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
tyrion_lannister Sorry to disappoint you.
tywin_lannister And who are these Companions of yours?
tywin_lannister This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
bronn You wouldn't know him.
tyrion_lannister May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.
tywin_lannister You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
tyrion_lannister We have our differences, Jaime and I.
jaime_lannister He's been covering himself in glory.
kevan_lannister Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
tyrion_lannister And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
tywin_lannister Is our hostage.
tyrion_lannister How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
tywin_lannister Robert Baratheon is dead.
tyrion_lannister My sister rules, you mean.
kevan_lannister Stark's son has called his banners.
tywin_lannister A green boy.
tyrion_lannister Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
lannister_messenger If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
tywin_lannister The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
kevan_lannister At once, My Lord.
tywin_lannister It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
shagga Only if the half man fights with us.
rodrik_cassel The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
greatjon_umber No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
robb_stark To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
theon_greyjoy Lord Frey controls that bridge.
catelyn_stark "The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
theon_greyjoy Robb's right.
greatjon_umber So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
stark_guard Your pardon, my lords.
greatjon_umber Don't worry, lad.
robb_stark Where did you find him?
stark_guard In the brush above the encampment.
robb_stark How high did you get?
lannister_scout 20,000. Maybe more.
robb_stark My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
catelyn_stark Robb.
robb_stark Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.
lannister_scout Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.
greatjon_umber Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
robb_stark You call me boy again.
robb_stark Go on.
greatjon_umber Oi.
grand_maester_pycelle It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...
sansa_stark Ser Aron.
grand_maester_pycelle Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.
sansa_stark Lord Gyles.
grand_maester_pycelle And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.
cersei_lannister Ser Barristan Selmy.
barristan_selmy Your Grace, I am yours to command.
cersei_lannister Rise, Ser Barristan.
barristan_selmy Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
cersei_lannister Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?
joffrey_baratheon You let my father die.
barristan_selmy Your Grace...
cersei_lannister The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
barristan_selmy The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
cersei_lannister Careful, Ser.
lord_varys We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
barristan_selmy A hall to die in and men to bury me.
petyr_baelish A naked Knight, apparently.
barristan_selmy Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
sansa_stark Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Come forward, My Lady.
cersei_lannister Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
sansa_stark I do.
sansa_stark As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
grand_maester_pycelle Treason is a noxious weed.
joffrey_baratheon Let her speak.
sansa_stark Thank you, Your Grace.
petyr_baelish Do you deny your father's crime?
sansa_stark No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.
joffrey_baratheon He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
sansa_stark He was badly hurt.
lord_varys A child's faith Such sweet innocence.
grand_maester_pycelle Treason is treason!
joffrey_baratheon Anything else?
sansa_stark If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon Your sweet words have moved me.
sansa_stark He will.
