theon_greyjoy I've taken your castle.
bran_stark Theon?
theon_greyjoy It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
bran_stark Why?
theon_greyjoy To take the castle.
bran_stark You went with Robb.
theon_greyjoy And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
bran_stark I don't know.
theon_greyjoy Find the halfwit.
dagmer_cleftjaw (nods)
theon_greyjoy My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
bran_stark Why?
theon_greyjoy So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
bran_stark I won't.
theon_greyjoy Yes, you will.
bran_stark I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.
theon_greyjoy The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.
bran_stark Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?
bran_stark I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
theon_greyjoy Louder. Say Prince Theon.
bran_stark I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.
farlen Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.
bran_stark Farlen, you be silent.
theon_greyjoy Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.
bran_stark All of you should do as he commands.
theon_greyjoy My father He claims the North as well by right of conquest. - You are all his subjects.
farlen Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it
ironborn Shut up!
theon_greyjoy If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester
maester_luwin I am.
theon_greyjoy I am the Lord Send the ravens.
maester_luwin My lord.
osha My Lord Greyjoy.
theon_greyjoy I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
osha You were here the day I was taken.
theon_greyjoy I'm the one who took you. What of it?
osha Let me serve you.
theon_greyjoy Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.
osha It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.
theon_greyjoy So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
osha Step aside.
bran_stark Why?
osha It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me.
theon_greyjoy You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time--
black_lorren Greyjoy!
black_lorren We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
theon_greyjoy Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.
rodrik_cassel It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.
theon_greyjoy They are not my people.
rodrik_cassel King Robb thought of you as a brother.
theon_greyjoy My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.
rodrik_cassel Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
theon_greyjoy Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.
rodrik_cassel If he were alive to see this
theon_greyjoy He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
rodrik_cassel I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
theon_greyjoy You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll--
theon_greyjoy Take him to the cells. Lock him up
dagmer_cleftjaw My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
theon_greyjoy I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
dagmer_cleftjaw No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives.
theon_greyjoy Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!
bran_stark No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
theon_greyjoy The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
maester_luwin I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
theon_greyjoy He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.
maester_luwin He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do.
theon_greyjoy You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
dagmer_cleftjaw Come.
bran_stark No! No! Theon!
rodrik_cassel (to THEON) Please
bran_stark Ser Rodrik!
rodrik_cassel He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
bran_stark I'm begging you.
rodrik_cassel Coward.
bran_stark Stop. Stop! Stop right now!
theon_greyjoy You don't give commands anymore, little lord.
bran_stark Please, stop this. Please stop him.
rodrik_cassel Hush now, child I'm off to see your father
bran_stark You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please.
theon_greyjoy Any last words, old man?
rodrik_cassel Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost.
bran_stark Theon, please don't.
rickon_stark Do something!
bran_stark I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!
jon_snow Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!
qhorin_halfhand There goes your pet.
jon_snow He's not a pet.
qhorin_halfhand No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing.
jon_snow Ghost is different.
qhorin_halfhand So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.
jon_snow I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
qhorin_halfhand I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
jon_snow We could do the same.
qhorin_halfhand No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.
jon_snow My father
qhorin_halfhand (laughs)
jon_snow I wasn't joking.
qhorin_halfhand Look around, boy This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?
jon_snow (nods)
qhorin_halfhand No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life.
jon_snow I'll gladly give my life.
qhorin_halfhand I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard Now, do you understand me?
jon_snow I do.
qhorin_halfhand You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.
tywin_lannister Can you read?
amory_lorch My lord?
tywin_lannister Can you read?
tywin_lannister This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
amory_lorch My apologies, my lord. I must have
tywin_lannister Girl It's the one on this
tywin_lannister My cupbearer can read better than you.
tywin_lannister To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
amory_lorch My lord, I
tywin_lannister To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.
tywin_lannister Put the book away, girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 Lord Petyr Baelish.
tywin_lannister Mmm. Give us the room.
tywin_lannister (to Arya) Clear all this.
petyr_baelish Lord Tywin.
tywin_lannister (not amused) Baelish.
tywin_lannister Wine?
petyr_baelish Thank you.
tywin_lannister What news from the capital? I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.
petyr_baelish So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
tywin_lannister Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
petyr_baelish It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
tywin_lannister You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
petyr_baelish After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, - feeding horses and soldiers.
tywin_lannister Yes, yes, yes.
petyr_baelish The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery
tywin_lannister Wants to be queen
petyr_baelish Yes, she does.
tywin_lannister House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson
petyr_baelish They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
tywin_lannister (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
petyr_baelish If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
petyr_baelish They have.
arya_stark Pardon, my lord.
petyr_baelish It's only wine.
tywin_lannister You would ride there yourself?
petyr_baelish Tonight, with your leave.
tywin_lannister I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl
tywin_lannister And what else?
petyr_baelish On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.
tywin_lannister Why?
petyr_baelish He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
tywin_lannister Hmm.
jon_snow A girl.
qhorin_halfhand A wildling.
jon_snow We could question her.
qhorin_halfhand You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
jon_snow What's your name?
ygritte Ygritte.
qhorin_halfhand She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.
ygritte I gave you my name.
jon_snow I'm Jon Snow.
ygritte You ought to burn them you killed.
qhorin_halfhand We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?
ygritte Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
qhorin_halfhand Our boy He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
ygritte The free folk.
qhorin_halfhand How many?
ygritte Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow.
qhorin_halfhand Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king
qhorin_halfhand Do you mean to march on the Wall?
qhorin_halfhand Do you know who I am, girl
ygritte Qhorin Halfhand.
qhorin_halfhand Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?
ygritte They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow.
qhorin_halfhand We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
jon_snow No. No, I'll do it.
qhorin_halfhand Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now.
ygritte You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.
jon_snow I'm as much a crow as they are.
ygritte Will you burn me? After?
jon_snow Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
ygritte Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold.
ygritte Do it. Bastard, do it!
ygritte You can't do it. We both know it.
ygritte The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close.
jon_snow I'll find them.
ygritte Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.
high_septon May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.
cersei_lannister One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.
joffrey_baratheon You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.
sansa_stark I saw you cry.
joffrey_baratheon Did you say something, my lady?
sansa_stark My little brother
joffrey_baratheon So?
sansa_stark It seems a normal thing.
joffrey_baratheon Is your little brother
sansa_stark No.
joffrey_baratheon Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog

man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 Hey.
joffrey_baratheon Traitors! - I'll have all their heads.
tyrion_lannister You blind, bloody fool.
joffrey_baratheon You can't insult me.
tyrion_lannister We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
joffrey_baratheon You can't
tyrion_lannister I can, I am.
joffrey_baratheon They attacked me!
tyrion_lannister They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool. All because of a war you started.
joffrey_baratheon You're talking to a king!
tyrion_lannister And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl
joffrey_baratheon Let them have her.
tyrion_lannister If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 Where are you going?
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here.
tyrion_lannister Take some men and go and find the Stark girl
meryn_trant I take my orders from the king.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 Where? This way.
sansa_stark Please! No! No!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 Please!
sandor_clegane You're all right now, little bird. You're all right.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 We'll get you.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 We'll get you.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 This way.
tyrion_lannister Are you hurt, my lady?
sandor_clegane The little bird's bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.
tyrion_lannister Well done, Clegane
sandor_clegane I didn't do it for you.
daenerys_targaryen He shouldn't make me wait.
xaro_xhoan_daxos The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
daenerys_targaryen I already have a husband.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.
daenerys_targaryen And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
xaro_xhoan_daxos I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.
spice_king The Mother of Dragons!
xaro_xhoan_daxos Ah, here he comes.
spice_king Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.
spice_king Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square.
daenerys_targaryen Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.
spice_king Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?
daenerys_targaryen My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
spice_king I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
daenerys_targaryen I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
spice_king I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.
daenerys_targaryen Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
spice_king Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
daenerys_targaryen My father
spice_king But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take the Iron Throne"?
daenerys_targaryen I didn't come here to argue grammar.
spice_king Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?
daenerys_targaryen Not yet.
spice_king You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
daenerys_targaryen There are many there that support my claim.
spice_king When were you there last?
daenerys_targaryen I left when I was a baby.
spice_king So, in truth, you have no allies.
daenerys_targaryen The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
spice_king Ah. Forgive me, little princess Now if you'll pardon me.
daenerys_targaryen Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.
spice_king A shrewd man.
daenerys_targaryen For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.
daenerys_targaryen Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
spice_king I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess
daenerys_targaryen I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.
spice_king Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.
tywin_lannister Who taught you to read?
arya_stark My father
tywin_lannister Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?
arya_stark A stonemason.
tywin_lannister A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
arya_stark He taught himself.
tywin_lannister Quite a man. What killed him?
arya_stark Loyalty.
tywin_lannister You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?
arya_stark Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.
tywin_lannister No. But you've already begun.
arya_stark Did you know your father, my lord?
tywin_lannister I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
tywin_lannister He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.
arya_stark I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
tywin_lannister Mmm.
amory_lorch Where are you going, girl?
arya_stark The armory, my lord.
amory_lorch Why?
arya_stark Lord Tywin sent me.
amory_lorch What might this be?
arya_stark Lord Tywin gave it to me.
amory_lorch What for?
arya_stark To take to the armory.
amory_lorch Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.
amory_lorch Move! Get out of the way!
arya_stark Amory Lorch.
jaqen_hghar A girl A man will do what must be done.
arya_stark Now!
jaqen_hghar A girlcannot tell a man A man
arya_stark But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
jaqen_hghar (sighs)
tywin_lannister Guard!

quent Your Grace.
robb_stark Quent.
robb_stark Lady Talisa.
talisa_stark Your Grace.
robb_stark I'm not sure I'm a lady.
talisa_stark Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
robb_stark It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.
talisa_stark Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
robb_stark Because it's obvious.
talisa_stark What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?
robb_stark I'd call you a liar.
talisa_stark Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
robb_stark (nods)
talisa_stark I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
robb_stark Better at amputations, I'm afraid.
robb_stark Quite a pretty spot.
talisa_stark Will we be here long?
robb_stark I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
talisa_stark I'm not a spy.
robb_stark Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.
talisa_stark You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. "The young wolf is on the move. " Perhaps you'd join me. If you've got time, of course, for, well
catelyn_stark Robb.
robb_stark Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very helpful.
catelyn_stark Lady Talisa.
talisa_stark Lady Stark.
catelyn_stark Lady Talisa
talisa_stark Maegyr.
catelyn_stark Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.
talisa_stark An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.
robb_stark I've missed you.
catelyn_stark Yes, you look positively forlorn.
robb_stark You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.
catelyn_stark I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
robb_stark I know.
catelyn_stark You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
robb_stark I know.
catelyn_stark A debt that must be paid.
robb_stark I haven't forgotten.
roose_bolton Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.
ygritte Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.
jon_snow We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
ygritte Here? There's no shelter here.
jon_snow There's no shelter anywhere.
ygritte There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire
jon_snow No fire.
ygritte But a fire is
jon_snow No fire.
ygritte Have it your way.
ygritte We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
ygritte Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.
ygritte Think they're out looking for you?
jon_snow Yes.
ygritte Think they'll find you?
jon_snow Yes.
ygritte You're brave. Stupid, but brave.
jon_snow We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
jon_snow Stop moving.
ygritte I'm just trying to get comfortable.
jon_snow Stop it!
jon_snow You're still moving.
ygritte Was I? I didn't notice that time.

robb_stark This cannot be true.
roose_bolton We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true.
robb_stark Why? Why would Theon
roose_bolton Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
robb_stark My brothers?
roose_bolton We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
catelyn_stark I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!
robb_stark I must go north at once.
roose_bolton There's still a war to win, Your Grace.
robb_stark How can I call myself king
roose_bolton You are a king And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
catelyn_stark Let me go and talk to Theon.
robb_stark There will be no talk. He will die for this.
roose_bolton Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy
robb_stark Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.
theon_greyjoy Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
osha I'm no liar.
theon_greyjoy All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
osha I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord.
theon_greyjoy How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
osha There are other ways to serve, my lord.
theon_greyjoy I'm a prince
osha There are other ways to serve, my prince
theon_greyjoy Like what?
osha We know things, the free people.
theon_greyjoy You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
osha Other things.
osha Savage things.
theon_greyjoy Wait outside.
theon_greyjoy I always wondered what you had under there.
osha It comes at a price.
theon_greyjoy I'm not killing you. That's your price.
osha I already had that.
theon_greyjoy What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
osha What all free people want. My freedom.
theon_greyjoy Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.
sansa_stark Ow!
shae Shh. It's not deep.
sansa_stark I thought they were going to kill me.
shae They thought so, too.
sansa_stark He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.
shae Of course he did.
sansa_stark Why? Why would a stranger
shae You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
sansa_stark I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king
shae Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you
sansa_stark But you're not the wrong people.
shae Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 And where are you going?
osha I have something for you from Prince Theon.
guard#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode06 What?
osha Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.
daenerys_targaryen The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
xaro_xhoan_daxos When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets.
xaro_xhoan_daxos Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi.
daenerys_targaryen Where are they? Where are my dragons?
