melisandre The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.
stannis_baratheon We ride for Winterfell.
melisandre And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
baratheon_soldier_2 Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Prepare to form up.
baratheon_soldier_2 Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Tell me.
baratheon_soldier_2 The men. Many deserted before dawn.
stannis_baratheon How many?
baratheon_soldier_2 Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.
soldier_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 Your Grace?
stannis_baratheon Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.
stannis_baratheon Cut her down.
baratheon_soldier_2 Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
stannis_baratheon Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
jon_snow He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.
samwell_tarly So what are you gonna do?
jon_snow I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
samwell_tarly But… the Dragonglass?
jon_snow No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.
samwell_tarly But… you killed a White Walker.
jon_snow With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
samwell_tarly He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
jon_snow Not enough.
samwell_tarly You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
jon_snow Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.
jon_snow What?
samwell_tarly I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this.
jon_snow I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?
samwell_tarly Well, there’s Edd.
samwell_tarly I’ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon’s gone. The Citadel has the world’s greatest library. I’ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.
samwell_tarly If Gilly stays here then she’ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I’ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I’ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I’d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.
samwell_tarly Thank you.
jon_snow You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.
samwell_tarly They’ll bloody try.
jon_snow Sam?
samwell_tarly What?
jon_snow Sam…
jon_snow You’ve just been beaten half to death. How did you--
samwell_tarly Very carefully.
jon_snow I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone.
samwell_tarly I’ll come back.
jon_snow To your return.
samwell_tarly To my return.
podrick_payne My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.
brienne_of_tarth How do you know it’s Stannis?
podrick_payne He’s carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I’ll never forget it.
stannis_baratheon Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
baratheon_soldier_2 There’s not going to be a siege, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Bolton has women fighting for him.
brienne_of_tarth I do not fight for the Boltons. I’m Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
stannis_baratheon I did.
brienne_of_tarth In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?
stannis_baratheon Go on, do your duty.
ramsay_bolton Looks like we’re done here.
survivor#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 I surrender. I surrender!
ramsay_bolton And I accept your surrender.
ramsay_bolton Let’s head back. My wife must be lonely.
myranda My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.
theon_greyjoy Go with her. Please.
sansa_stark I know what Ramsay is. I know what he’ll do to me. If I’m going to die, let it happen while there’s some of me left.
myranda Die? He’s got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?
myranda You’re leaving it to me? Good. Let’s begin.
myranda Stop! Stop!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 Open the gates!
theon_greyjoy He’s coming back.
meryn_trant I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.
arya_stark You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?
arya_stark I can’t hear you.
arya_stark You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark.
arya_stark Do you know who you are?
arya_stark You’re no one. You’re nothing.
jaqen_hghar A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.
the_waif I was right about her.
jaqen_hghar You were.
the_waif You’re not ready. Not at all.
jaqen_hghar That man’s life wasn’t yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.
jaqen_hghar Only death can pay for life.
arya_stark No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die!
the_waif Why are you crying?
arya_stark He was my friend.
the_waif No he wasn’t. Didn’t you listen to him?
jaqen_hghar He was no one.
arya_stark But if you’re… Who’s this?
jaqen_hghar No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.
jaqen_hghar The faces are for no one.
jaqen_hghar You are still someone.
jaqen_hghar And to someone…
jaqen_hghar ...the faces are as good as poison.
arya_stark I can’t see!
arya_stark What’s happening?! What’s happening?!
doran_martell I wish you a safe journey home.
jaime_lannister Thank you.
ellaria_sand Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
bronn Maybe I’ll come visit you sometime.
tyene_sand Maybe I’ll come visit you.
bronn Don’t wait too long. I’ve a noble woman to marry back home.
tyene_sand You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy.
jaime_lannister Whenever you’re ready, My Lord.
jaime_lannister Try not to lose it this time.
myrcella_baratheon I’ll never take it off again.
jaime_lannister I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
myrcella_baratheon Do you think mother will like him.
jaime_lannister If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will.
myrcella_baratheon And you really believe that?
jaime_lannister Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
myrcella_baratheon She likes you.
jaime_lannister I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.
myrcella_baratheon No you don’t.
jaime_lannister What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…
myrcella_baratheon I know what you’re trying to say.
jaime_lannister No. I’m afraid you don’t.
myrcella_baratheon I do.
myrcella_baratheon I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I’m glad. I’m glad that you’re my father.
jaime_lannister Myrcella?
jaime_lannister Myrcella?!
jaime_lannister Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
tyrion_lannister You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.
daario_naharis Does he always talk so much?
grey_worm Jorah the Andal.
jorah_mormont Torgo Nudho.
grey_worm You should not be here.
daario_naharis No, but he is.
grey_worm Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
daario_naharis Our queen would be dead if not for him.
missandei It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… little man.
tyrion_lannister Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
missandei A bit “rusty”.
tyrion_lannister Thank you.
grey_worm I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
daario_naharis You missed a good scrap.
jorah_mormont None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
tyrion_lannister He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go.
jorah_mormont We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
tyrion_lannister And I intend to help her do it.
jorah_mormont You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
tyrion_lannister You betrayed her!
jorah_mormont Careful now.
tyrion_lannister And she exiled you, twice, I believe?
jorah_mormont The second time thanks to you.
tyrion_lannister Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont.
daario_naharis And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her.
tyrion_lannister Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.
jorah_mormont If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
daario_naharis Forgive me, but why would we bring you?
tyrion_lannister Pardon me?
daario_naharis Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
tyrion_lannister Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--
daario_naharis Can you fight?
tyrion_lannister I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
daario_naharis Are you good on a horse?
tyrion_lannister Middling.
daario_naharis So mainly you talk?
tyrion_lannister And drink. I’ve survived so far.
daario_naharis Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.
jorah_mormont He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
daario_naharis They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
grey_worm I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
missandei You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
grey_worm I am.
daario_naharis He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.
missandei It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.
daario_naharis And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.
voice#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 Hello, old friend.
lord_varys I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
tyrion_lannister I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
lord_varys The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.
tyrion_lannister Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?
lord_varys Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
tyrion_lannister If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
lord_varys If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?
tyrion_lannister I did miss you.
lord_varys Oh, I know.
daenerys_targaryen We have to go home.
daenerys_targaryen My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?
daenerys_targaryen How far did you carry me?
daenerys_targaryen Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.
daenerys_targaryen Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.
septa_unella Confess. Confess.
cersei_lannister I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--
high_sparrow You wish to make a confession?
cersei_lannister Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?
high_sparrow Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
cersei_lannister The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.
high_sparrow Name him.
cersei_lannister Lancel Lannister.
high_sparrow Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
cersei_lannister I was lonely and afraid.
high_sparrow You had a husband.
cersei_lannister A husband of whoring every chance he got.
high_sparrow His sins do not pardon your own.
cersei_lannister May the gods forgive me.
high_sparrow Other men?
cersei_lannister No.
high_sparrow No others?
cersei_lannister No.
high_sparrow Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
cersei_lannister I do.
high_sparrow There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
cersei_lannister A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.
high_sparrow Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.
cersei_lannister Trial? I have confessed?
high_sparrow To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
cersei_lannister I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
high_sparrow You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.
cersei_lannister Thank you. Thank you.
high_sparrow The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.
cersei_lannister I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.
high_sparrow Good.
cersei_lannister Am I free to go?
high_sparrow After your atonement.
cersei_lannister My atonement?
high_sparrow A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.
septa_unella Shame. Shame. Shame.
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!
woman#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 I’ve had half as many cocks as the queen!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode10 Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!
qyburn Your Grace. It’s good to have you back. Come. We’ll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
qyburn May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.
qyburn If it please Your Grace, he’s taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace’s enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.
davos_seaworth He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
jon_snow We don’t have enough men to make any difference.
davos_seaworth The wildlings will make a difference!
jon_snow The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--
davos_seaworth You saved their bloody lives. If they’re going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.
jon_snow It’s not their fight!
jon_snow Stannis?
davos_seaworth Shireen? The princess?
olly Lord Commander. It’s one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he’s still alive.
jon_snow Are you sure he’s talking about Benjen?
olly Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.
alliser_thorne Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.
jon_snow He could be lying.
alliser_thorne Could be. There are ways to find out.
jon_snow Where is he?
alliser_thorne Over there.
alliser_thorne For the Watch.
brothel_child_1 For the Watch.
brothel_child_1 For the Watch.
brothel_child_1 For the Watch.
brothel_child_1 For the Watch.
jon_snow Olly…
olly For the Watch.
