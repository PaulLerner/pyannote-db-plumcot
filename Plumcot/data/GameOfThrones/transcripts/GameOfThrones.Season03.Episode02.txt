ironborn_2 My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds
brothel_child_1 Did you ever think you'd marry one

brothel_child_1 Never

maester_caleotte Something else
brothel_child_1 By the time Bolton's bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch And BRAN and RICKON have not been found They may have escaped Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages

eyrie_guard Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests
prendahl_na_ghezn Yes
eyrie_guard So how shall we pass the time
prendahl_na_ghezn By putting one foot in front of the other
eyrie_guard It's going to be a very dull walk
prendahl_na_ghezn I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange Dull is fine
eyrie_guard You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute Trust me on this People have been serving me since I was born You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword
prendahl_na_ghezn If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know She's an honest woman
eyrie_guard All the good it's done her
eyrie_guard How did you come into Lady Stark's service There's something we can talk about
prendahl_na_ghezn Not your concern, Kingslayer
eyrie_guard It had to be recently You weren't with her at Winterfell
prendahl_na_ghezn How would you know
eyrie_guard Because I visited Winterfell I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways
prendahl_na_ghezn Move
eyrie_guard Were you pledged to Stannis
prendahl_na_ghezn Gods, no
eyrie_guard Ah, Renly Really He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal
prendahl_na_ghezn Shut your mouth
eyrie_guard Why I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget Could hardly escape the little tulip Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks I knew him far better than you
prendahl_na_ghezn I knew him as well as anyone As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything He would have been a wonderful king
eyrie_guard Sounds like you quite fancied him
prendahl_na_ghezn I did not fancy him
eyrie_guard Oh, gods, you did
eyrie_guard Did you ever tell him No, of course not You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid
eyrie_guard He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell You're far too much man for him
prendahl_na_ghezn I'm not interested in foul rumors
eyrie_guard Unless they're about me It's all true about Renly His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks They'd have never got him off it
prendahl_na_ghezn Shut your mouth!
eyrie_guard I don't blame him And I don't blame you, either We don't get to choose who we love

prendahl_na_ghezn And you
eyrie_guard He knows who I am
prendahl_na_ghezn He doesn't

illyrio_mopatis Margaery
glover_general She's an ideal match With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century
illyrio_mopatis It is a good match, but what do you think of her She's beautiful and intelligent
glover_general Yes, she is
illyrio_mopatis Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting
glover_general Not to me
illyrio_mopatis I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
glover_general This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had
illyrio_mopatis Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason She dresses like a harlot for a reason She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason

poisoned_frey Kiss me, child
poisoned_frey It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens We're very sorry for your losses
morag And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery He was very gallant
poisoned_frey Gallant, yes And charming and very clean He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
captured_wight Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother Father liked him and so did Loras
poisoned_frey Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your fathead father-
captured_wight Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us
poisoned_frey She might think we have some wits about us One of us, at any rate It was treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders So here we are to see things through What do you say to that, Sansa Shall we have some lemon cakes
morag Lemon cake's my favorite

poisoned_frey Has he ripped out your tongue
morag Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion

morag My father always told the truth
poisoned_frey Yes, he had that reputation And they named him traitor and took his head
morag Joffrey Joffrey did that He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off And he said that was mercy Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
poisoned_frey Go on
morag I-I can't I never meant-my father was a traitor My brother as well I have traitor's blood Please don't make me say anymore

ironborn_2 Did they work
maester_caleotte After a fashion I prayed for my son  Bran to survive his fall
maester_caleotte Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live But it would be a very long night So I sat with him all through the darkness Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering
ironborn_2 Which boy
maester_caleotte Jon Snow When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me So I prayed to the gods, take him away Make him die He got the pox And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived A murderer I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother A woman he didn't even know So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live Let him live and I'll love him I'll be a mother to him I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us
ironborn_2 And he lived
maester_caleotte And he lived And I couldn't keep my promise And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child

glover_general Good Good How are you finding life in the capital It must be quite a change after Renly's camp
captured_wight A welcome one A military encampment is no place for a lady
glover_general And the bedside of a traitor Is that a place for a lady
captured_wight Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all
glover_general What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it
captured_wight The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children
glover_general You failed to do this
captured_wight Why I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace
glover_general You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart
captured_wight No I do beg your pardon The subtleties of politics are often lost on me Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women
glover_general What makes you say this
captured_wight Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils He never wanted to try Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children Maybe the fault was with me
glover_general No, he was a known degenerate
captured_wight It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace
glover_general Mmm I've considered making his perversion punishable by death

hugh_of_the_vale Your father is Howland Reed Yeah
willem_lannister Yeah
hugh_of_the_vale He saved my father's life during the rebellion
willem_lannister Your father told you about the rebellion Mine never did But I saw that, too
hugh_of_the_vale What else have you seen
willem_lannister Only one thing that matters-you
tortured_slave I never liked the skinny ones Like drinking from a puddle Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand
ollys_mother I don't drink ale
septa_mordane There's no story so good a drink won't make it better
tortured_slave Yeah!
septa_mordane You see They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety It's very tedious for all concerned Now, how did three children-
ollys_mother We're not children
septa_mordane How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal
ollys_mother Gendry's a smith He was apprenticed in the armory
septa_mordane A smith, eh Where'd you train
simpson King's Landing Tobho Mott's shop
septa_mordane That criminal He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
simpson That's because he's twice as good
septa_mordane Aha! A smith and a salesman
ollys_mother Gendry stole us weapons
septa_mordane Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see
ollys_mother He knows how to use a sword and so do I
ollys_mother My brothers taught me
tortured_slave Ooh!
septa_mordane To your brothers!
septa_mordane You can finish your meals before you go It may be awhile before you see another
ollys_mother You'll free us
septa_mordane I gave you my word
lannister_spearman Hey, hey
septa_mordane Now that is an uncommonly large person How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person
lannister_spearman One waits for him to drink until he passes out
septa_mordane Poor man You have my sympathy
septa_mordane Aha, not a man at all A Hound!
septa_mordane So good to see you again, Clegane

septa_mordane A pretty prize, lads
tortured_slave Yeah!
imry_florent Girl
imry_florent What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch
eyrie_guard It's a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
prendahl_na_ghezn Silence, Kingslayer
eyrie_guard Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river
prendahl_na_ghezn Good luck
eyrie_guard It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas Which will she choose
eyrie_guard Gambler at heart Wouldn't have guessed
prendahl_na_ghezn Be quick about it
eyrie_guard I need to rest
prendahl_na_ghezn Get up
eyrie_guard I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far What do you call them
prendahl_na_ghezn Get up now
eyrie_guard Corns I never used to get corns Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
eyrie_guard This heel is ruined There's no way-
eyrie_guard I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
eyrie_guard Ooh You move well for a great beast of a woman
eyrie_guard You shouldn't grimace before you lunge It gives away the game
eyrie_guard Bit of a quandary for you If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you
eyrie_guard You're good Graceless, but good
eyrie_guard See If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there
knight Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman
eyrie_guard We enjoy a good fight Gets our juices flowing The Flayed Man of House Bolton A bit gruesome for my taste
knight You sure he's the one
tortured_slave That's him, all right I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding
knight Give the man his silver
eyrie_guard Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want
knight Enough to buy me a new head If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off I'd rather he takes yours
