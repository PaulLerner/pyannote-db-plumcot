GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Don’t think too much, Bran.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Relax your bow arm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And which one of you was a marksman at ?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Father?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You can’t kill it, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Because the raven is you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s all right, Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, it was the threeeyed raven.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I tried to kill it, but I couldn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There was a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t want to hear about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But you asked.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ve got plenty of worries.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We don’t need to pour black magic on top of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I didn’t ask for black magic dreams.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I know you didn’t, little lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We need to move.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We don’t know who might be after us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No one knows we’re alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And who told you that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The threeeyed raven tell you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Some good he is, then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t know what people know and don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I only know the Wall is a long way off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Did you ever think you’d marry one?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I never thought I’d marry anyone at all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Never?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Pardon me, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lord Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Let me guess which is the good news.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I hadn’t seen him in years.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t even know how many.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ll travel to the funeral together.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Something else?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Before Bolton’s bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And Bran and Rickon have not been found.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They may have escaped.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Or Theon may have taken them to the Iron Islands as hostages.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Have you received any demands?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where am I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I want to do this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you know how long it’ll take to get to King’s Landing walking through fields and forests?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How shall we pass the time?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown By putting one foot in front of the other.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s going to be a very dull walk.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m here to take you to King’s Landing and bring back Lady Stark’s daughters in exchange.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Dull is fine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You know, it doesn’t matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humourless mute.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Trust me on this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown People have been serving me since I was born.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A week’s journey with you and she’ll order you to fall on your sword.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I’m sure she’ll let me know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She’s an honest woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown For all the good it’s done her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How did you come into Lady Stark’s service?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There’s something we can talk about.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not your concern, Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It had to be recently.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You weren’t with her at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How would you know?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Because I visited Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Move.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Were you pledged to Stannis?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Gods, no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ah, Renly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Really?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He wasn’t fit to rule over anything more important than a course meal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shut your mouth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don’t forget.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Could hardly escape the little tulip.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I knew him better than you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I knew him as well as anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He would have been a wonderful king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Sounds like you quite fancied him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I did not fancy him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Oh, Gods, you did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Did you ever tell him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, of course not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You weren’t Renly’s type, I’m afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He preferred curlyhaired little girls like Loras Tyrell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re far too much man for him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m not interested in foul rumours.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Unless they’re about me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s all true about Renly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s a shame the throne isn’t made out of cocks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They’d have never got him off it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shut your mouth!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t blame him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And I don’t blame you, either.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We don’t get to choose who we love.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where are you headed, then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown South.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Riverrun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Staying off the King’s Road, are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They get you no matter where you go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You can’t win.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, you really can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Looks like you’re safe enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Meaning no offence, my lady, but I wouldn’t tangle with you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Seven blessings to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He knows who I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He doesn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Maybe you’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What if you’re not?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What if he tells someone?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re not doing it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s an innocent man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown More innocent than Lady Stark’s daughters?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Make it tighter here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It makes you look very strong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No flowers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I said no flowers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown All these are wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Bring others.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Bloody flowers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown On the king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Looks like a Tyrell rose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Should be more than enough fabric.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Tell me what you think of her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Who?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Margaery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She’s an ideal match.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown With the Tyrells beside us, we’ll crush the Northerners.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It is a good match, but what do you think of her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She’s beautiful and intelligent.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, she is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Her concern with the wellbeing of the common people is interesting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I only meant to go out of your way to endanger…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I’ve ever had.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She dresses like a harlot for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s what intelligent women do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What they’re told.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You need to ask yourself…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t need to do anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Much better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I still don’t believe it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He didn’t want anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Littlefinger’s not in love with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Love is not the thing he wants.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s too old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They never see it that way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He didn’t ask you to do something for him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Spy on someone or…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What will you do?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I will make him stop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Send him in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My sister invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown May I escort you to them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You are too kind, Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You probably don’t remember the first time we met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown At the Hand’s tourney, you gave me your favour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A rose, a red rose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Of course I did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s more your colour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You take it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re such a dear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ll take my leave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Thank you, Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Come.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lady Sansa, it is my honour to present my grandmother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Kiss me, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re very sorry for your losses.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly’s death, Lady Margaery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He was very gallant.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And charming and very clean.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Father liked him and so did Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Loras is young and good at knocking men off horses with a stick.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That does not make him wise.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown As to your fathead father…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Grandmother!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What will Sansa think of us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She might think we have some wits about us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown One of us, at any rate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It was treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I warned them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But once the cow’s been milked, there’s no squirting the cream back up her udders.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So here we are to see things through.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What do you say to that, Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shall we have some lemon cakes?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lemon cake’s my favourite.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So we’ve been told.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Here, Sansa, come sit with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m much less boring than these others.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you know my son?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Lord of Highgarden?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I haven’t had the pleasure.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No great pleasure, believe me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A ponderous oaf.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown His father was an oaf as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My husband, the late Lord Luthor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And now my son is doing the same, only this time he’s riding a lion instead of a horse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You, you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Who else would know better?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ve heard some troubling tales.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Is there any truth to them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Has this boy mistreated you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Has he ripped out your tongue?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown King Joffrey, His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But how kind is he?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How clever?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m to be his wife.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I only want to know what that means.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Bring me some cheese.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The cheese will be served when I want it served.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I want it served now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Are you frightened, child?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No need for that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re only women here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Tell us the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No harm will come to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My father always told the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, he had that reputation.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And they named him traitor and took his head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Joffrey did that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father’s head off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And he said that was mercy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Go on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I never meant…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My father was a traitor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My brother as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I have traitor’s blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please don’t make me say any more.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She’s terrified, Grandmother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Look at her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Speak freely, child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s a monster.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s a pity.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please, don’t stop the wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Have no fear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Even so, we thank you for the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Here comes my cheese.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re at war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This march is a distraction.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My grandfather’s funeral is not a distraction.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Then it’s a distraction.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We need his men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Unless he’s been breeding them, he don’t have enough to make a difference.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Have you lost faith in our cause?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If it’s revenge, I still got faith in it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If you no longer believe…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I can believe till it snows in Dorne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Don’t change the fact that we’ve got half the men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You don’t think we can win?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown May I speak my mind, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I think you lost this war the day you married her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Whoa!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Whoa!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re afraid of her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And she knows it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m not afraid of her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown May I help you, Lady Stark?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You can’t help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Only a mother can make them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’ve made them before?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Twice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Did they work?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown After a fashion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he’d live.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But it would be a very long night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So I sat with him all through the darkness.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Listened to his ragged little breaths.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown His coughing, his whimpering.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Which boy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn’t bear to look at him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I didn’t want to see those brown stranger’s eyes staring up at me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So I prayed to the Gods, take him away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Make him die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He got the pox.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A murderer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’d condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A woman he didn’t even know.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So I prayed to all seven Gods, let the boy live.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Let him live and I’ll love him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ll be a mother to him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And he lived.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And he lived.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And I couldn’t keep my promise.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And everything that’s happened since then, all this horror that’s come to my family, it’s all because I couldn’t love a motherless child.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You liked him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I like you, but if you’re playing us false, it won’t be hard for me to kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ve got wildling blood in my veins.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown These are my people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Well, how could you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You want to protect your people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you know what it takes to unite clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They speak seven different languages in my army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Hornfoots hate the iceriver clans.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Everyone hates the cave people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I told them we were all going to die if we don’t get south.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Because that’s the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shouldn’t be long now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What’s wrong with him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s a warg.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s scouting for us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What, you’ve never met a warg?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Orell.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where were you this time?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Fist of the First Men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What did you see?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Dead crows.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What’s the matter, Piggy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You crying ’cause you’re cold?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There’s brothers killed by dead men and you’re still here whimpering.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That seem fair to you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I seen ’em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why don’t you lie down and rest for a while, eh?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You know you want to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Get up, Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Get up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If you stop, you’ll die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown ‘Course if you don’t stop, you’ll probably die, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You don’t care.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown ‘Course we care.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You left me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When the White Walkers came, you left me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Aye, we left you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re fat and you’re slow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We didn’t want to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Help me get him up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Looks like that piggy is done for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Help us get him up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’s slowing us down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Just get him up!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So the rest of us can die?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ll move faster without him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What is this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Get up, Tarly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Is he all right?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Aye, I think so.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We may as well just go without him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Tarly, I forbid you to die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why should the rest of us…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Rast, you’re responsible for him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What am I supposed to do?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Make sure he gets back alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If he doesn’t, you don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Move on!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m not dying for you, Piggy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where’s Rickon and Hodor?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Looking for food.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What’s out there?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not another step, boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Unless you want to drown in your own blood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m unarmed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That was poor planning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My sister carries the weapons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m better with them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Drop the spear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Drop it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You must be Summer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m Jojen Reed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This is my sister, Meera.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ve come a long way to find you, Brandon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And we have much farther to go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m just trying to understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Would you please shut up about it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Jaqen H’ghar offered you three kills.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m not listening.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But just explain it to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He offered to kill any three people you wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown All you had to do was give him the names.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You could have picked King Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shut up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But you could have ended the war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where are we going?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Maybe we passed it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s feet wide.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How could we have passed it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My mother grew up there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My grandfather’s a lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He’ll protect us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Could be a minstrel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shut up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A minstrel’s got gold sometimes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And so he spoke, and so he spoke That lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o’er his hall With no one there to hear What’s lurking behind that wall?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A lion?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A wolf?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Just a dirty little cub, I think.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Loose a few more shafts.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Don’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Put the sword down, girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You go on down the road.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Keep singing so we know where you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Leave us be and I won’t kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Generous.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re a dangerous person.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I like dangerous people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why are your friends so shy?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What friends?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Three young ones on the run carrying castleforged swords.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You escape from Harrenhal?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Thoros of Myr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The fellow with the bow is Anguy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, who do you fight for?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Brotherhood Without Banners.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now come along.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m not going with them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Brotherhood?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s who the Mountain were looking for.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They’ll bring us back and put rats in us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’ve got nothing to fear from us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re trying to save it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ll talk more over brown bread and stew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And then you can go on your way.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Here’s the thing, fat boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When I’m done talking, that arrow’s falling down on your fat head.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So I advise you move, because I’m done talking.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Half the country’s starving and look at this one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Maybe he’s the reason half the country’s starving.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My lion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’ve spoken of this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You cannot come here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But you said I should come to you with any problems.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Did anyone see you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You sure?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My father does not make idle threats.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Having you killed would be the high point of his week.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You have to be absolutely certain.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown All right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What is this problem?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m worried about Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Baelish doesn’t have friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t know her name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Oh, Ros?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The redhead?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How do you know her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I try to know as many people as I can.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You never know which one you’ll need.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown She’s a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, well, we shouldn’t be judgemental about these things.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You fucked her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Oh, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown All right, yes, I fucked her once.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Twice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But since I met you, my lady, I’ve been with no one else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And was she good?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Did you like her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she’d be the one torturing me right now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What did she say about Littlefinger?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That Sansa shouldn’t trust him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We have to protect her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We can’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A great beauty with a very old name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A great beauty?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Oh, a great beauty?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes, she is, objectively, very.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Her face is quite pleasing, to other men and to women, people in general.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But not to me, of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I only have eyes for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You pervert.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You want her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This child?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t even want to talk about her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Only because you’re making me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I didn’t force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This is cruel and unfair.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Cruelly unfair.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Aw!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown “The cruelty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Shae is so cruel to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown ” Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now do you think I’m cruel?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Only if you stop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But you mustn’t come here again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’ve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Dangerous people.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Lady Tyrell, my king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Send her in.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’m leaving on a hunting trip.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s very thoughtful, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I have everything I could want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How are you finding life in the capital?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It must be quite a change after Renly’s camp.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A welcome one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A military encampment is no place for a lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And the bedside of a traitor?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Is that a place for a lady?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The duty of any wife to any husband.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown To provide him with children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You failed to do this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I would not speak ill of the dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor ’cause he had a sword put through his heart?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I do beg your pardon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Renly…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t believe he was interested in the company of women.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What makes you say this?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He had so many excuses, so many latenight war councils.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He never wanted to try.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Except one evening, after he’d had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Something that sounded very painful and couldn’t possibly result in children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Maybe the fault was with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, he was a known degenerate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Mmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ve considered making his perversion punishable by death.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown As is your right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You must do whatever you need to do.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You are the king.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you like it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I just had it made.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s beautiful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Will you show me how it works?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s a new design.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Much easier to load.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There’s no crank.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You use this lever to draw the string.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The bolt goes here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And then you just aim…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Would you take me hunting sometime?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Forgive me, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I know a hunt is no place for a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s not unheard of.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My father would never let me before…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You no longer belong to him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you want to hold it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown May I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Could you do it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Could you kill something?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t know, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Do you think I could?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Would you like to watch me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Tell us the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown About what?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t know what you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I want the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What truth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why’d you take Winterfell?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I took it to…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I took it…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Who gave the orders?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No one.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I took it on my own.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown To take the North while vulnerable.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown And once you took it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hold it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Rule it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s very good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why did you do that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I told you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why did you take Winterfell?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Wait, wait, wait.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I took it because I hated the Starks.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I hated them for holding me prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I wanted to hurt them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ll tell you anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Just take it off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please, just take it off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Your sister sent me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yara?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’ll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, don’t go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, please don’t leave me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please, please don’t go!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Don’t leave me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Please don’t go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Rickon, stay with us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The wolves will protect him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Only when I’m asleep.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s how it begins until you learn to control it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re a warg.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s not just wolves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Sometimes in my dreams there’s a…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A threeeyed raven?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’ve seen it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We saw him together.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You haven’t forgotten?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Does it have anything to do with warging?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown No, the raven is something different, something deeper.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The raven brings the sight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Seeing things that haven’t happened yet?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What’s he telling him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Why don’t you ask?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Isn’t he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where’s the shame in that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Some people will always need help.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That doesn’t mean they’re not worth helping.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When my father died, I dreamt it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You didn’t dream it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You saw it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So did I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You have the sight, too?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown When I told my father about your father, for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Your father is Howland Reed?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He saved my father’s life during the rebellion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Your father told you about the rebellion?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Mine never did.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But I saw that, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What else have you seen?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Only one thing that matters, you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I never liked the skinny ones.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Like drinking from a puddle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not that I’m averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I don’t drink ale.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There’s no story so good a drink won’t make it better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yeah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You see?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown They’ve suffered through my bouts of sobriety.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s very tedious for all concerned.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now, how did three children…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We’re not children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Gendry’s a smith.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He was apprenticed in the armoury.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A smith, eh?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Where’d you train?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Tobho Mott’s shop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That criminal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He charges twice as much as every other armourer in the city.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s because he’s twice as good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ahha!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A smith and a salesman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Gendry stole us weapons.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown My brothers taught me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ooh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown To your brothers!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You can finish your meals before you go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It may be awhile before you see another.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’ll free us?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I gave you my word.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Hey, hey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Now that is an uncommonly large person.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Poor man.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You have my sympathy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Aha!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Not a man at all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A Hound!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown So good to see you again, Clegane.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Thoros?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The fuck you doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Drinking and talking too much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Same as ever.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A pretty prize, lads.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Yeah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s a tough decision.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Silence.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Or I could escape down the river.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Good luck.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It’s wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Which will she choose?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Gambler at heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Wouldn’t have guessed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Be quick about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Oh, I need to rest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Get up.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I have these, on your feet when you walk too far.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown What do you call them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Get up now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Corns.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I never used to get corns.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown This heel is ruined.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown There’s no way…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Ooh!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You move well for a great beast of a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You shouldn’t grimace before you lunge.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown It gives away the game.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Bit of a quandary for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown But if you don’t kill me, I’m going to kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You’re good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Graceless, but good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown See?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Looks like your woman’s getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown We enjoy a good fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Gets our juices flowing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown The Flayed Man of House Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown A bit gruesome for my taste.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown You sure he’s the one?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown That’s him, all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey’s wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Give the man his silver.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown Enough to buy me a new head?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown If the King in the North hears I let the Kingslayer go, he’ll be taking it right off.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode02 #unknown I’d rather he takes yours.
