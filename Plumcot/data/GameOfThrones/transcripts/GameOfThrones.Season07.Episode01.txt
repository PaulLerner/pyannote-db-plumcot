walder_frey You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?
walder_frey Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!
walder_frey I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!
walder_frey Stand together!
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Stand together!
walder_frey Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.
walder_frey Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.
walder_frey Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.
walder_frey No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.
walder_frey Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
arya_stark When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.
eddison_tollett You wildlings?
meera_reed I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark.
eddison_tollett How do I know that's true?
bran_stark You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.
eddison_tollett Okay, come on. Let's get them inside.
jon_snow I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.
robett_glover It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
jon_snow Not just the boys.
jon_snow We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
robett_glover You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?
lyanna_mormont I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.
robett_glover Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--
lyanna_mormont And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
lyanna_mormont We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.
jon_snow While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.
jon_snow But if we're going to survive this winter together...
tormund_giantsbane You want us to man the castles for you?
jon_snow Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
tormund_giantsbane Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
jon_snow If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.
yohn_royce The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
sansa_stark The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.
all_together#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Aye!
jon_snow The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
sansa_stark And then they broke faith.
jon_snow I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
sansa_stark So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
jon_snow The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
sansa_stark They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
jon_snow When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword," and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.
jon_snow Ned Umber.
jon_snow Alys Karstark.
jon_snow For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our air whenever called upon.
jon_snow Stand.
jon_snow Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?
eddard_stark@alys_karstark Now and always!
jon_snow You are my sister, but I am king now.
sansa_stark Will you start wearing a crown?
jon_snow When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.
sansa_stark So I can't question your decisions anymore?
jon_snow Of course you can, but--
sansa_stark Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
jon_snow Do you think I'm Joffrey?
sansa_stark You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
jon_snow Thank you.
sansa_stark You're good at this, you know.
jon_snow At what?
sansa_stark At ruling.
jon_snow No.
sansa_stark You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--
sansa_stark Why are you laughing?
jon_snow What did father used to say? Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.
sansa_stark He never said that to me.
jon_snow No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.
sansa_stark Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.
jon_snow All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.
sansa_stark I'm not trying to undermine you.
sansa_stark You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.
jon_snow And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
sansa_stark Would that be so terrible?
maester_wolkan A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.
jon_snow "Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
sansa_stark What does she want?
jon_snow Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
sansa_stark You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.
jon_snow I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.
sansa_stark We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
jon_snow There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
sansa_stark You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.
jon_snow You almost sound as if you admire her.
sansa_stark I learned a great deal from her.
jaime_lannister What is this?
cersei_lannister Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.
jaime_lannister He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.
cersei_lannister It's ours now, we just have to take it.
cersei_lannister You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
jaime_lannister No, not angry.
cersei_lannister Are you afraid of me?
jaime_lannister Should I be?
cersei_lannister Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?
jaime_lannister Dragonstone.
jaime_lannister They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.
cersei_lannister Enemies to the east.
cersei_lannister Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
cersei_lannister Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.
cersei_lannister Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
jaime_lannister Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.
cersei_lannister Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
jaime_lannister If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.
cersei_lannister I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
jaime_lannister Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.
cersei_lannister I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
jaime_lannister A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
cersei_lannister A dynasty for us, then.
jaime_lannister We never talked about Tommen.
cersei_lannister There's nothing to say.
jaime_lannister Our baby boy killed himself.
cersei_lannister He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?
jaime_lannister Cersei--
cersei_lannister I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.
jaime_lannister Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
cersei_lannister I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
jaime_lannister We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.
cersei_lannister You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
jaime_lannister The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
cersei_lannister Not all of them.
jaime_lannister Well, it looks like all of them.
cersei_lannister I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.
jaime_lannister How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
cersei_lannister So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.
jaime_lannister They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.
cersei_lannister Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
jaime_lannister Oh, what did he come here for, then?
cersei_lannister A queen.
euron_greyjoy The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.
euron_greyjoy It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.
jaime_lannister You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?
jaime_lannister The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.
euron_greyjoy I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.
jaime_lannister The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
euron_greyjoy The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
jaime_lannister And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
euron_greyjoy A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.
cersei_lannister If not the most humble.
euron_greyjoy You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.
cersei_lannister What do you want in return?
euron_greyjoy Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.
cersei_lannister I decline your proposal.
euron_greyjoy Why?
cersei_lannister You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
euron_greyjoy You should try it. Feels wonderful.
euron_greyjoy I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.
marwyn Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.
marwyn Weigh that.
marwyn The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse.
baby_sam Archmaester, I was wondering...
marwyn What's the weight?
baby_sam Um, 147.
baby_sam I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
marwyn I don't remember your proposition.
baby_sam I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.
marwyn That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
baby_sam No.
marwyn Not a very strong proposition, is it?
baby_sam Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.
marwyn Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
baby_sam Sources in the restricted area?
marwyn The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
baby_sam So, you believe me.
marwyn I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
baby_sam That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
marwyn We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. "How will we survive?" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--"The end is near! How will we survive?" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended.
marwyn Be a good lad. Clean this up.
brienne_of_tarth Nope.
brienne_of_tarth Nope.
tormund_giantsbane You're a lucky man.
petyr_baelish I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
sansa_stark What do you want, Lord Baelish?
petyr_baelish I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
sansa_stark I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.
petyr_baelish What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
sansa_stark At the moment, peace and quiet.
sansa_stark No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever.
petyr_baelish My lady.
petyr_baelish My lady.
brienne_of_tarth Why is he still here?
sansa_stark We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us.
brienne_of_tarth He wants something.
sansa_stark I know exactly what he wants.
lannister_map_painter He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
arya_stark That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
lannister_map_painter It's a new one.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
arya_stark I don't want to steal your food.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 You heading south?
arya_stark King's Landing.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Poor girl.
arya_stark Not so bad, is it?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide.
lannister_map_painter Worst place in the world.
arya_stark What are you doing in the Riverlands?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Here you go. Guests first.
arya_stark Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
arya_stark You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 My wife's just had our first baby.
arya_stark Boy or girl?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 I hope it's a girl.
arya_stark Why?
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 Are you old enough to drink?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
arya_stark It's really good.
man_3#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season07.Episode01 So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?
arya_stark I'm going to kill the queen.
thoros_of_myr Bad night to be outdoors.
sandor_clegane You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? "It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."
thoros_of_myr You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?
sandor_clegane Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
thoros_of_myr Why are you always in such a foul mood?
sandor_clegane Experience.
beric_dondarrion This seems like a good place to spend the night.
sandor_clegane These people don't want us here.
beric_dondarrion Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
sandor_clegane I don't like the look of it.
thoros_of_myr For a big, hard man, you scare easy.
sandor_clegane I'll tell you what doesn't scare me--bald cocksuckers like you. You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt.
thoros_of_myr Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
sandor_clegane They don't.
thoros_of_myr See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
beric_dondarrion How do you think it ended for them?
sandor_clegane With death.
beric_dondarrion Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them.
sandor_clegane Doesn't matter now.
beric_dondarrion No, doesn't matter now.
sandor_clegane I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.
beric_dondarrion Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
sandor_clegane And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
sandor_clegane You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad.
beric_dondarrion Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart.
sandor_clegane But there's nothing special about you.
beric_dondarrion You're right about that.
sandor_clegane So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?
beric_dondarrion You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
sandor_clegane And?
beric_dondarrion I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
sandor_clegane Your Lord.
beric_dondarrion I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
sandor_clegane If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?
thoros_of_myr Clegane.
thoros_of_myr Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
sandor_clegane It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
beric_dondarrion Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
sandor_clegane There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive.
sandor_clegane What do you want?
thoros_of_myr Look into the flames.
sandor_clegane I don't want to look in the damn flames.
thoros_of_myr You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
sandor_clegane I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
thoros_of_myr We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
thoros_of_myr What do you see?
sandor_clegane Logs burning.
thoros_of_myr Keep looking. What do you see?
sandor_clegane Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
thoros_of_myr What else?
sandor_clegane It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
sandor_clegane There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
sandor_clegane Thousands of them.
beric_dondarrion Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?
thoros_of_myr What the hell are you doing, Clegane?
sandor_clegane Burying the dead.
thoros_of_myr You knew these people.
sandor_clegane Not really.
sandor_clegane We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you.
baby_sam Mom.
gilly You should really sleep, Sam.
baby_sam The dead don't.
gilly "Legends of the Long Night."
baby_sam The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
gilly What is it?
baby_sam It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
gilly That's dragonglass?
baby_sam A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know.
jorah_mormont Has she come yet?
baby_sam Who?
jorah_mormont The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
baby_sam Haven't heard anything.
daenerys_targaryen Shall we begin?
