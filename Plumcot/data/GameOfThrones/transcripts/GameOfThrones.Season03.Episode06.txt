gilly You've got too much wood in there.
samwell_tarly But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
gilly It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
samwell_tarly Huh. You know your fires.
gilly Someone built your fires for you growing up?
samwell_tarly It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.
gilly I knew you were highborn.
samwell_tarly Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.
gilly What does it do?
samwell_tarly I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?
gilly How much longer?
samwell_tarly Not so far. A few more days.
gilly Is the Wall as big as they say?
samwell_tarly Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
gilly You're playing with me.
samwell_tarly I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.
gilly Do you sing?
samwell_tarly No. No, no, no. Not very well.
gilly Sing me a song.
samwell_tarly Oh, all right. Let's see.
samwell_tarly Oh ahem.  The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife  /And she loves her little children.
osha That's not how you skin a rabbit.
meera_reed  I know how to skin a rabbit.
osha Not by the looks of it.
osha You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
meera_reed  I didn't see any game before I got here.
osha If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.
meera_reed  Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.
osha You learn how to use your fists, though.
meera_reed  Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?
osha I had someone else in mind.
meera_reed  Well, someone else is sitting right here.
bran_stark  You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
osha Some of us are just a little better.
meera_reed  Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
osha You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
bran_stark  Stop it!
hodor Hodor.
bran_stark  You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
osha Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
bran_stark  You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
osha Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
bran_stark  First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace.
meera_reed  Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
osha I said so, didn't I?
bran_stark  Osha!
osha You're a good little hunter.
meera_reed  Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.
osha Don't push me.
meera_reed  Shh. I'm right here with you.
rickon_stark  What's happening?
meera_reed  I'm right here with you.
rickon_stark  What's wrong with him?
meera_reed  The visions take their toll.
bran_stark  He's having one now?
jojen_reed I saw jon Snow.
bran_stark  You saw him? At Castle Black?
jojen_reed He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
tormund_giantsbane Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
orell Your flock gets smaller every year.
jon_snow  You ever climbed it before?
ygritte No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
jon_snow  Aren't you?
ygritte Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.
ygritte I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.
jon_snow  You kill someone for them?
ygritte Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
ygritte He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
jon_snow  Can we not talk about that here?
ygritte 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm jon  Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'
jon_snow  Did I seem scared the other day?
ygritte You were trembling like a leaf.
jon_snow  Only in the beginning.
ygritte Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, jon  Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
jon_snow  What secret?
ygritte Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
ygritte But I'm your woman now, jon  Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.
ygritte It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
jon_snow  I won't.
ygritte 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
tormund_giantsbane Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.
arya_stark Joffrey. cersei_lannister. Ilyn Payne.
anguy You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
arya_stark Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.
anguy Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position.
anguy Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
arya_stark What?
anguy Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
arya_stark But I have to aim.
anguy Never aim.
arya_stark Never aim?
anguy Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
arya_stark There's someone out there.
anguy That's about far enough.
melisandre We come as friends.
anguy Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.
melisandre Valar morghulis.
thoros Valar dohaeris.  I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
melisandre You are Thoros of Myr.
melisandre The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
thoros I failed.
melisandre You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
thoros You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?
thoros My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?
beric_dondarrion Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
thoros Lucky for the ladies.
melisandre How many times has the Lord brought him back?
thoros Six.
melisandre That's not possible.
thoros The Lord has smiled upon me.
melisandre You should not have this power.
thoros I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will.
thoros I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.
melisandre You've been to the other side.
beric_dondarrion The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.
melisandre You have someone He needs.
anguy Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?
gendry Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.
anguy I'll get you the steel.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 Come on.
arya_stark I don't like that woman.
anguy That's 'cause you're a girl.
arya_stark What does that have to do with anything?
beric_dondarrion Forgive me, lad.
arya_stark What are you doing? Let go of him.
arya_stark Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
beric_dondarrion We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
arya_stark Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
arya_stark You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
thoros We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.
gendry You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
melisandre You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
arya_stark You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
melisandre I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.
ygritte You staring at my ass, jon_snow  Snow?
tormund_giantsbane Look out!
ygritte You all right?
tormund_giantsbane Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
ramsay_bolton Sorry. Were you sleeping?
theon_greyjoy Wa-
ramsay_bolton Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
ramsay_bolton So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
theon_greyjoy Please.
ramsay_bolton Please is not a body part.
theon_greyjoy I'll tell you everything, please.
ramsay_bolton But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.
ramsay_bolton Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.
ramsay_bolton You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
theon_greyjoy If I win, you'll let me go?
ramsay_bolton If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.
theon_greyjoy Please.
ramsay_bolton You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
theon_greyjoy The North.
ramsay_bolton Too vague.
theon_greyjoy Deepwood Motte.
ramsay_bolton Terrible guess.
ramsay_bolton Now, where?
theon_greyjoy Last Hearth.
ramsay_bolton Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
theon_greyjoy Karhold!
ramsay_bolton Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
theon_greyjoy No. It was just a guess.
ramsay_bolton Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?
theon_greyjoy Torrhen Karstark.
ramsay_bolton He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
theon_greyjoy He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
theon_greyjoy You swore to tell me if I-
ramsay_bolton You're right.
theon_greyjoy Lord Rickard Karstark is robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed robb. That's why you're torturing me.
ramsay_bolton Yes. You win.
ramsay_bolton Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.
ramsay_bolton I'm afraid I am.
ramsay_bolton Everything I told you is a lie.
ramsay_bolton This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it.
theon_greyjoy Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!
ramsay_bolton I win.
robb_stark Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
black_walder The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come.
lothar_frey Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
robb_stark Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
black_walder As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
edmure_tully I don't think that's-
robb_stark We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
black_walder And there's something else.
robb_stark We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
black_walder Not what, whom.
edmure_tully What?
edmure_tully No.
lothar_frey Our father requires Lord edmure_tully to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.
edmure_tully How old is she?
lothar_frey Nineteen.
edmure_tully Could I see her first?
black_walder You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
brynden_tully Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
lothar_frey Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
black_walder And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
robb_stark He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
edmure_tully Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.
robb_stark He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
edmure_tully I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
brynden_tully Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-
edmure_tully The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
brynden_tully The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
robb_stark It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
edmure_tully He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
catelyn_stark You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
robb_stark I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
brynden_tully You recall that heroic engagement?
edmure_tully I had something less permanent in mind.
robb_stark I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.
edmure_tully I'll marry her.
robb_stark You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.
roose_bolton I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
brienne_of_tarth Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return jaime Lannister to King's Landing.
roose_bolton When King robb_stark left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.
roose_bolton I should send you back to robb_stark Stark.
jaime_lannister You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?
roose_bolton Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
jaime_lannister We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
roose_bolton You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
jaime_lannister It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
roose_bolton King robb_stark is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
jaime_lannister He'll make time for you.
roose_bolton As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
jaime_lannister Shall we drink on it?
roose_bolton I don't partake.
jaime_lannister You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
jaime_lannister Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
roose_bolton Oh, she won't be going with you.
brienne_of_tarth I am charged with bringing Ser jaime to-
roose_bolton You are charged with abetting treason.
jaime_lannister I'm afraid I must insist.
roose_bolton You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
olenna_tyrell Impossible.
tywin_lannister Why?
olenna_tyrell My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
tywin_lannister Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.
olenna_tyrell Old.
tywin_lannister Old?
olenna_tyrell Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
tywin_lannister The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?
olenna_tyrell Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.
tywin_lannister And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
olenna_tyrell Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?
tywin_lannister Of course.
olenna_tyrell And you never-
tywin_lannister No.
olenna_tyrell Not once? Not in any way?
tywin_lannister Never.
olenna_tyrell I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.
tywin_lannister Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
olenna_tyrell I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.
tywin_lannister I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
olenna_tyrell Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.
tywin_lannister I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
olenna_tyrell As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
tywin_lannister Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
olenna_tyrell And if cersei_lannister is too old to give loras_tyrell children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.
tywin_lannister The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
tywin_lannister If you refuse to marry loras_tyrell to cersei_lannister, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.
olenna_tyrell Oh
tywin_lannister The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
olenna_tyrell You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
tywin_lannister I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?
olenna_tyrell It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
orell No!
orell We've gotta cut them loose!
tormund_giantsbane No!
jon_snow  Take my hand!
sansa_stark That's a wonderful pin.
loras_tyrell Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so
sansa_stark I'm very happy about
loras_tyrell Uh, yes. I-I am as well.
sansa_stark I feel like I'm in a dream.
loras_tyrell Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
sansa_stark No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
loras_tyrell It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.
tyrion_lannister I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
cersei_lannister We can have them both killed.
 It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably sansa. Though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
cersei_lannister Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
tyrion_lannister On a boat you built.
cersei_lannister The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
tyrion_lannister I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
cersei_lannister I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
tyrion_lannister Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
tyrion_lannister The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.
cersei_lannister What do you want me to say?
tyrion_lannister I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
cersei_lannister Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
tyrion_lannister Seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin_lannister Lannister.
cersei_lannister Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.
tyrion_lannister You may escape, at least. Once jaime gets back, Ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
cersei_lannister When jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.
tyrion_lannister jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.
cersei_lannister Who's going to tell her?
sansa_stark Do you think people will like it?
shae I don't think they will even notice it.
sansa_stark You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. loras_tyrell likes green and gold brocade.
shae I'm sure he does.
sansa_stark Will they let me invite my family?
shae They haven't asked my opinion.
sansa_stark But do you think they will?
shae No.
maid Lady sansa, Lord tyrion to see you. Should I-
tyrion_lannister I beg your pardon, my lady.
sansa_stark Good afternoon, Lord tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.
tyrion_lannister Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady sansa.
sansa_stark Of course.
tyrion_lannister Alone, if I may.
shae Why do you need to speak to her alone?
sansa_stark Shae. Please excuse her, Lord tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
tyrion_lannister Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
sansa_stark It's all right, really.
tyrion_lannister How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
lord_varys A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
petyr_baelish There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
lord_varys Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
petyr_baelish Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
lord_varys Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?
petyr_baelish You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give sansa_stark Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
lord_varys I did what I did for the good of the realm.
petyr_baelish The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
lord_varys But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
petyr_baelish Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
petyr_baelish Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
petyr_baelish And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
