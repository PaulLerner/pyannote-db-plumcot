tycho_nestoris You've got too much wood in there
braavosi_theatre_server But the more wood, the bigger the fire
tycho_nestoris It needs to breathe Take off that big log
braavosi_theatre_server Huh You know your fires
tycho_nestoris Someone built your fires for you growing up
braavosi_theatre_server It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach And there were servants, of course
tycho_nestoris I knew you were highborn
braavosi_theatre_server Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men Buried treasure Thousands of years old I think
tycho_nestoris What does it do
braavosi_theatre_server I'm not sure that it does anything It's beautiful, though, isn't it
tycho_nestoris How much longer
braavosi_theatre_server Not so far A few more days
tycho_nestoris Is the Wall as big as they say
braavosi_theatre_server Bigger So big you can't even see the top sometimes It's hidden in clouds
tycho_nestoris You're playing with me
braavosi_theatre_server I'm not It's 700 feet high, all made of ice On a warm day you can see it weeping Castle Black is nice enough They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night And Hobb makes venison stew with onions Very tasty Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing Dareon sings best
tycho_nestoris Do you sing
braavosi_theatre_server No No, no, no Not very well
tycho_nestoris Sing me a song
braavosi_theatre_server Oh, all right Let's see
braavosi_theatre_server Oh ahem  The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife  /And she loves her little children
stark_guard That's not how you skin a rabbit
joss I know how to skin a rabbit
stark_guard Not by the looks of it
stark_guard You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game
joss I didn't see any game before I got here
stark_guard If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits
joss Well, I made this bow myself Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall
stark_guard You learn how to use your fists, though
joss Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death
stark_guard I had someone else in mind
joss Well, someone else is sitting right here
hugh_of_the_vale You're both very good at skinning rabbits
stark_guard Some of us are just a little better
joss Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall
stark_guard You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth
hugh_of_the_vale Stop it!
jaremy_rykker Hodor
hugh_of_the_vale You've been fighting since you met Just stop it
stark_guard Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground
hugh_of_the_vale You've been nasty to her every day Of course she's nasty back
stark_guard Me It's my fault First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat
hugh_of_the_vale First time I met you, you held a knife at me We can't fight each other We'll never make it to the Wall I want you both to make peace
joss Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine
stark_guard I said so, didn't I
hugh_of_the_vale Osha!
stark_guard You're a good little hunter
joss Thank you See Not so hard, is it Thank you
stark_guard Don't push me
joss Shh I'm right here with you
cersei_lannister What's happening
joss I'm right here with you
cersei_lannister What's wrong with him
joss The visions take their toll
hugh_of_the_vale He's having one now
willem_lannister I saw Jon Snow
hugh_of_the_vale You saw him At Castle Black
willem_lannister He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies
hot_pie Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall Crows would come out every morning with axes
grand_maester_pycelle Your flock gets smaller every year
pit_announcer You ever climbed it before
wedding_band No But Tormund's done it half a hundred times You're afraid
pit_announcer Aren't you
wedding_band Aye It's a long way up and a long way down But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there Here, sit down
wedding_band I brought a pair for you They're too big for you, but they're good
pit_announcer You kill someone for them
wedding_band Nah I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised
wedding_band He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue
pit_announcer Can we not talk about that here
wedding_band 'Can we not talk about that here I'm Jon Snow I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls'
pit_announcer Did I seem scared the other day
wedding_band You were trembling like a leaf
pit_announcer Only in the beginning
wedding_band Only in the beginning You're a proper lover, Jon Snow And don't worry Your secret's safe with me
pit_announcer What secret
wedding_band Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up You're loyal and you're brave You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent
wedding_band But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow You're going to be loyal to your woman The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down
wedding_band It's you and me that matters to me and you Don't ever betray me
pit_announcer I won't
wedding_band 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck
hot_pie Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step And if you fall, don't scream You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers
ollys_mother Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne
lannister_spearman You're good You're not as good as you think you are
ollys_mother Face, tits, balls-- I hit 'em right where I wanted to
lannister_spearman Aye, but you took your sweet time of it You won't be fighting straw men, little lady Show me your position
lannister_spearman Keep your elbow high You want your back doing the hard labor You're holding Never hold
ollys_mother What
lannister_spearman Your muscles tense up when you hold Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release Never hold
ollys_mother But I have to aim
lannister_spearman Never aim
ollys_mother Never aim
lannister_spearman Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go Trust your eye
ollys_mother There's someone out there
lannister_spearman That's about far enough
braavosi_captain We come as friends
lannister_spearman Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that
braavosi_captain Valar morghulis
septa_mordane Valar dohaeris  I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands
braavosi_captain You are Thoros of Myr
braavosi_captain The High Priest gave you a mission Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light What happened
septa_mordane I failed
braavosi_captain You quit, you mean The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk
septa_mordane You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine Do you speak the common tongue
septa_mordane My friends here don't speak High Valyrian Why are you here, my lady
meryn_trant Forgive my manners I don't see many ladies these days
septa_mordane Lucky for the ladies
braavosi_captain How many times has the Lord brought him back
septa_mordane Six
braavosi_captain That's not possible
septa_mordane The Lord has smiled upon me
braavosi_captain You should not have this power
septa_mordane I have no power I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will
septa_mordane I've always been a terrible priest Drank too much rum Fucked all the whores in King's Landing It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show A spectacle for the locals Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead And they were the only words I knew And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth Our god is the one true god And all men must serve Him
braavosi_captain You've been to the other side
meryn_trant The other side There is no other side I have been to the darkness, my lady He sent you to us for a reason
braavosi_captain You have someone He needs
lannister_spearman Bodkin point Penetrates plate at 200 yards Can you make 'em
simpson Yeah, nothing tricky about it Just need decent steel
lannister_spearman I'll get you the steel
tortured_slave Come on
ollys_mother I don't like that woman
lannister_spearman That's 'cause you're a girl
ollys_mother What does that have to do with anything
meryn_trant Forgive me, lad
ollys_mother What are you doing Let go of him
ollys_mother Tell them to stop Come on He wants to be one of you He wants to join the Brotherhood Stop them!
meryn_trant We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy
ollys_mother Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she
ollys_mother You're not doing this for your god You're doing it for gold
septa_mordane We're doing it for both, girl We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold
simpson You told me this was a Brotherhood You told me I could be one of you
braavosi_captain You are more than they can ever be They're just foot soldiers in the great war You will make kings rise and fall
ollys_mother You're a witch You're going to hurt him
braavosi_captain I see a darkness in you And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me-- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes Eyes you'll shut forever We will meet again
wedding_band You staring at my ass, Jon Snow
hot_pie Look out!
wedding_band You all right
hot_pie Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad

theon_greyjoy I'll tell you everything, please

drunk_patron I win
brothel_child_1 Thank you for riding here so quickly I know travel isn't easy in these times
black_walder The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits But when the King of the North summons us, we come
khal_rhalko Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters
brothel_child_1 Of course He deserves as much I was in the wrong  Black WALDER As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands
qhono I don't think that's--
brothel_child_1 We are fighting for the North Harrenhal is not in the North It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it
black_walder And there's something else
brothel_child_1 We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs
black_walder Not what, whom
qhono What
qhono No
khal_rhalko Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters-- Roslin
qhono How old is she
khal_rhalko 19
qhono Could I see her first
black_walder You want to count her teeth We depart for the Twins in the morning We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end
vayon_poole Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war
khal_rhalko Father is old It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband  Black WALDER And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements
brothel_child_1 He has every right to be Please excuse us while we discuss it
qhono Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were I'm his liege lord
brothel_child_1 He's a proud man and we've wounded him
qhono I didn't wound him My answer is no
vayon_poole Listen to me and listen very carefully You--
qhono The laws of gods and men are very clear No man can compel another man to marry
vayon_poole The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth
brothel_child_1 It's all right You heard him If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead
qhono He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12 He's not gonna stop wanting it now When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing
maester_caleotte You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife
brothel_child_1 I have a war to fight We can't win it without them I have no time to haggle You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill
vayon_poole You recall that heroic engagement
qhono I had something less permanent in mind
brothel_child_1 I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost
qhono I'll marry her
brothel_child_1 You're paying for my sins, Uncle It's not fair or right I'll remember it
roose_bolton I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear
prendahl_na_ghezn Yes Most kind of them You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing  Roose BOLTON When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason
roose_bolton I should send you back to Robb Stark
eyrie_guard You should But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner Why might that be
roose_bolton Wars cost money Many people would pay a great deal for you
eyrie_guard We both know who would pay the most Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
roose_bolton You're right Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies
eyrie_guard It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it
roose_bolton King Robb is keeping your father quite busy He doesn't have time for anything else
eyrie_guard He'll make time for you
roose_bolton As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming
eyrie_guard Shall we drink on it
roose_bolton I don't partake
eyrie_guard You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people
eyrie_guard Very well My lady, may our journey continue without further incident
roose_bolton Oh, she won't be going with you
prendahl_na_ghezn I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to--
roose_bolton You are charged with abetting treason
eyrie_guard I'm afraid I must insist
roose_bolton You're in no place to insist on anything I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position
poisoned_frey Impossible
eddard_stark Why
poisoned_frey My grandson is the pride of Highgarden The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms Your daughter--
eddard_stark Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king
poisoned_frey Old
eddard_stark Old
poisoned_frey Old I'm something of an expert on the subject Her change will be upon her before long I'll spare you the details of what will happen then You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely
eddard_stark The years punish us as well, I promise you that My stomach remains quite strong, however The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities Do you deny them
poisoned_frey Oh, not at all A sword swallower through and through
eddard_stark And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name
poisoned_frey Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys
eddard_stark Of course
poisoned_frey And you never--
eddard_stark No
poisoned_frey Not once Not in any way
eddard_stark Never
poisoned_frey I congratulate you upon your restraint But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets
eddard_stark Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior
poisoned_frey I wouldn't say that True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters-- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out
eddard_stark I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it
poisoned_frey Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation
eddard_stark I don't care what people believe And neither do you
poisoned_frey As an authority on myself, I must disagree
eddard_stark Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt
poisoned_frey And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt It is a chance we simply cannot take
eddard_stark The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable All right I'll remove it for you
eddard_stark If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows He will never marry He will never have children
poisoned_frey Oh
eddard_stark The Tyrell name will fade And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery
poisoned_frey You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you
eddard_stark I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously So, shall I draw up the order Or do you consent to this marriage
poisoned_frey It's a rare enough thing-- a man who lives up to his reputation
grand_maester_pycelle No!
grand_maester_pycelle We've gotta cut them loose!
hot_pie No!
pit_announcer Take my hand!
morag That's a wonderful pin
hallyne Oh, it's more of a brooch, really Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so
morag I'm very happy about
hallyne Uh, yes I-I am as well
morag I feel like I'm in a dream
hallyne Yes, me, too Definitely I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young The guests, the food, the tournaments And the bride, of course The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady
morag No I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing But it sounds wonderful I can't wait to see it And to leave this place
hallyne It's terrible, isn't it The most terrible place there is
rickard_stark I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this
illyrio_mopatis We can have them both killed
rickard_stark It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement Probably Sansa Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery
illyrio_mopatis Father doesn't discriminate We're all being shipped off to hell together
rickard_stark On a boat you built
illyrio_mopatis The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family I did what I did to protect our family
rickard_stark I'm your family A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it
illyrio_mopatis I do admit it If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate
rickard_stark Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater
rickard_stark The impulse I understand He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is So, fair enough He wants me dead But his stupidity He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army The boy's an idiot
illyrio_mopatis What do you want me to say
rickard_stark I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
illyrio_mopatis Probably But not from Joffrey He won't do anything now Father's here
rickard_stark Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister
illyrio_mopatis Not the Tyrells Soon they won't need to be afraid of him Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore And so will his children and their children History will be taken from our hands
rickard_stark You may escape, at least Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels
illyrio_mopatis When Jaime gets back, yes But when do we think that's going to be He's out there somewhere
rickard_stark Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked
illyrio_mopatis Who's going to tell her
morag Do you think people will like it
beric_dondarrion I don't think they will even notice it
morag You're right It's not my wedding Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding Loras likes green and gold brocade
beric_dondarrion I'm sure he does
morag Will they let me invite my family
beric_dondarrion They haven't asked my opinion
morag But do you think they will
beric_dondarrion No
dothraki_man_having_sex Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you Should I--
rickard_stark I beg your pardon, my lady
morag Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding
rickard_stark Yes, it should be quite a wedding I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa
morag Of course
rickard_stark Alone, if I may
beric_dondarrion Why do you need to speak to her alone
morag Shae Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion She's not from here But I trust her, even though she tells me not to
rickard_stark Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances
morag It's all right, really
rickard_stark How to begin It's-- this-- this-- this is awkward
black_lorren 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread
petyr_baelish There aren't There aren't even 200 I've counted
black_lorren Ha, I'm sure you have Ugly old thing Yet it has a certain appeal The Lysa Arryn of chairs Shame you had to settle for your second choice
petyr_baelish Early days, my friend It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want
black_lorren Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then
petyr_baelish You're so right For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment And she didn't bring me any enjoyment She was a bad investment on my part Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new Something daring And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience
black_lorren I did what I did for the good of the realm
petyr_baelish The realm Do you know what the realm is It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie
black_lorren But what do we have left once we abandon the lie Chaos A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
petyr_baelish Chaos isn't a pit Chaos is a ladder
petyr_baelish Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again The fall breaks them
petyr_baelish And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse They cling to the realm or the gods or love Illusions Only the ladder is real The climb is all there is
