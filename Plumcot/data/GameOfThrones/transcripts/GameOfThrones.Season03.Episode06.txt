GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve got too much wood in there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It needs to breathe.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Take off that big log.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You know your fires.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Someone built your fires for you growing up?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It doesn’t get so cold down in the Reach.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And there were servants, of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I knew you were highborn.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Buried treasure.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Thousands of years old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I think.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What does it do?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m not sure that it does anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s beautiful, though, isn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How much longer?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not so far.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A few more days.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Is the Wall as big as they say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Bigger.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So big you can’t even see the top sometimes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s hidden in clouds.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re playing with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m not.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s feet high, all made of ice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown On a warm day you can see it weeping.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Castle Black is nice enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Very tasty.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Dareon sings best.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you sing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No, no, no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not very well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sing me a song.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh, all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Let’s see.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Father’s face is stern and strong He sits and judges right from wrong He weighs our lives, the short and long And loves the little children The Mother gives the gift of life And watches over every wife Her gentle smile ends all strife And she loves her little children That’s not how you skin a rabbit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I know how to skin a rabbit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not by the looks of it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t see any game before I got here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Well, I made this bow myself.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Guess you don’t learn how to do that north of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You learn how to use your fists.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh, you’re gonna punch the rabbits to death?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I had someone else in mind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Well, someone else is sitting right here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re both very good at skinning rabbits.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Some of us are just a little better.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Or don’t they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Stop it!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve been fighting since you met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Just stop it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lady Reed here’s got a stick so far up her ass, it’s a wonder her feet touch the ground.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve been nasty to her every day.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Of course she’s nasty back.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s my fault?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown First time I met you, you held a knife at me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We can’t fight each other.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We’ll never make it to the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I want you both to make peace.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I said so, didn’t I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Osha!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re a good little hunter.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown See?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not so hard, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Don’t push me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m right here with you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What’s happening?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m right here with you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What’s wrong with him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The visions take their toll.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s having one now?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I saw Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You saw him?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown At Castle Black?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He was on the wrong side of the Wall, surrounded by enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Used to be you couldn’t find a tree within a mile of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Crows would come out every morning with axes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your flock gets smaller every year.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You ever climbed it before?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But Tormund’s done it half a hundred times.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Aren’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Well, it’s a long way up and a long way down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But I’ve waited my whole life to see the world from up there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Here, sit down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I brought a pair for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They’re too big for you, but they’re good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You kill someone for them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Nah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He wasn’t good to me the way you’re good to me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Well, he didn’t do that thing you do with your tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Can we not talk about that here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown “Can we not talk about that here?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown “I’m Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown “I’ve killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, “but I’m scared of naked girls.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown ” Did I seem scared the other day?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You were trembling like a leaf.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Only in the beginning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Huh.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Only in the beginning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re a proper lover, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And don’t worry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your secret’s safe with me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What secret?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you think I’m as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re loyal and you’re brave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You didn’t stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder’s tent.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But I’m your woman now, Jon Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re going to be loyal to your woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Night’s Watch don’t care if you live or die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Mance Rayder don’t care if I live or die.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We’re just soldiers and there’s more to carry on if we go down.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s you and me that matters to me and you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Don’t ever betray me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I won’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown ‘Cause I’ll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it ’round me neck.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And if you fall, don’t scream.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You don’t want that to be the last thing she remembers.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Cersei.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Ilyn Payne.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re not as good as you think you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Face, tits, balls…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I hit ’em right where I wanted to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You won’t be fighting straw men, little lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Show me your position.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Keep your elbow high.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You want your back doing the hard labour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re holding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Never hold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your muscles tense up when you hold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Pull the string back to the centre of your chin and release.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Never hold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But I have to aim.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Never aim.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Never aim?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Trust your eye.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown There’s someone out there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown That’s about far enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We come as friends.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Begging your pardon, m’lady, but we’ll be the judge of that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Valar Morghulis.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Valar Dohaeris.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t see many priestesses of R’hllor in the Riverlands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You are Thoros of Myr.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The High Priest gave you a mission.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What happened?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I failed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You quit, you mean.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You worship Him your way, and I’ll worship Him mine.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you speak the Common tongue?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown My friends here don’t speak High Valyrian.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why are you here, my lady?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Forgive my manners.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t see many ladies these days.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lucky for the ladies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How many times has the Lord brought him back?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Six.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown That’s not possible.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Lord has smiled upon me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You should not have this power.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I have no power.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I ask the Lord for His favour, and He responds as He will.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ve always been a terrible priest.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Drank too much rum.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Fucked all the whores in King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn’t believe in our Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I decided that He, that all the Gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So I wore the robes, and every now and then I’d recite the prayers, but it was just for show.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A spectacle for the locals.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one’s heart.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not because I believed in them, but…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He was my friend and he was dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And they were the only words I knew.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Beric’s eyes opened, and I knew the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Our god is the one true god.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And all men must serve Him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve been to the other side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The other side?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown There is no other side.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I have been to the darkness, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He sent you to us for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You have someone He needs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Bodkin point.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Penetrates plate at yards.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Can you make ’em?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Just need decent steel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll get you the steel.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t like that woman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown That’s ’cause you’re a girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What does that have to do with anything?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Forgive me, lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Let go of him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Tell them to stop.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He wants to be one of you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He wants to join the Brotherhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Stop them!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We serve the Lord of Light, and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Did the Lord of Light tell you that, or did she?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re not doing this for your god.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re doing it for gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We’re doing it for both, girl.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We can’t defend the people without weapons and horses and food.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And we can’t get weapons and horses and food without gold.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You told me this was a Brotherhood.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You told me I could be one of you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You are more than they can ever be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They’re just foot soldiers in the great war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You will make kings rise and fall.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re a witch.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re going to hurt him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I see a darkness in you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Eyes you’ll shut forever.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We will meet again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You staring at me ass, Jon Snow?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Look out!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You all right?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Were you sleeping?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Wa…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Wa…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Wa…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Water?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You want some water.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I wish I had some for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So, let’s play a game.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Which body part do you need the least?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown “Please” is not a body part.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll tell you everything, please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But you’ve already told me everything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Remember?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your daddy was mean to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Starks didn’t appreciate you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown One good bit, though.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Stark boys, they’re still alive.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Wouldn’t that be a hunt to remember?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You failed, but I’m a better hunter than you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Now…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How about your little finger?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You don’t use that for much, do you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Good.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Let’s start with that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Ah!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’ve been wondering why you’re here, haven’t you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Where you are.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Who I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why I’m doing this to you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So, guess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If you guess right, I’ll tell you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I’m torturing you, and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If I win, you’ll let me go?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Please.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You say “please” again and you’ll wish you hadn’t.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You first.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Where are we?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Too vague.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Deepwood Motte.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Terrible guess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Now, where?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Last Hearth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Karhold!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Karhold?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How did you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It was just a guess.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Very good, Lord Theon.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And who am I?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Torrhen Karstark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Strangled by the Kingslayer.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He was your brother.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You swore to tell me if I…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark’s bannerman.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I betrayed Robb.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown That’s why you’re torturing me.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You win.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Of course, you forgot to ask one question.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You forgot to ask if I’m a liar.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m afraid I am.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Everything I told you is a lie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown This isn’t happening to you for a reason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But, well, one reason…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I enjoy it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Please, cut it off!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Cut it off!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Cut it off!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I win.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Thank you for riding here so quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I know travel isn’t easy in these times.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown When the King of the North summons us, we come.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He deserves as much.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I was in the wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t think that’s…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We are fighting for the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Harrenhal is not in the North.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And there’s something else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not what, whom.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Uh, no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Roslin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How old is she?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Nineteen.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Could I see her first?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You want to count her teeth?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We depart for the Twins in the morning.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We need an answer before we leave, and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your father does realise we’re in the middle of a war?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Father is old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He has every right to be.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Please excuse us while we discuss it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m his liege lord.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s a proud man and we’ve wounded him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I didn’t wound him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown My answer is no.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Listen to me and listen very carefully.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The laws of gods and men are very clear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No man can compel another man to marry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s all right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You heard him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s wanted me for one of his daughters since I was .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s not gonna stop wanting it now.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I have a war to fight.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We can’t win it without them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I have no time to haggle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You recall that heroic engagement?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I had something less permanent in mind.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ve won every battle, but I’m losing this war.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If we don’t do this and do it now, we’re lost.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll marry her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re paying for my sins, Uncle.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s not fair or right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll remember it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Most kind of them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I am acting on Lady Stark’s orders to return Jaime Lannister to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If she wasn’t his mother, he’d have hanged her for treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I should send you back to Robb Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You should.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But instead, you’re sitting here, watching me fail at dinner.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why might that be?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Wars cost money.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Many people would pay a great deal for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We both know who would pay the most.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He doesn’t have time for anything else.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’ll make time for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown As soon as you’re well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King’s Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Shall we drink on it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t partake.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Very well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh, she won’t be going with you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You are charged with abetting treason.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m afraid I must insist.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re in no place to insist on anything.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I would have hoped you’d learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Impossible.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Your daughter…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms, and the mother of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Old?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Old.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m something of an expert on the subject.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Her change will be upon her before long.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll spare you the details of what will happen then.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The years punish us as well, I promise you that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown My stomach remains quite strong, however.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson’s nocturnal activities.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you deny them?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Oh, not at all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A swordswallower through and through.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sons of your father’s bannermen, squires, stable boys?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And you never…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not once?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not in any way?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Never.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I congratulate you upon your restraint.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But it’s natural, boys having a go beneath the sheets.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I wouldn’t say that.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown True, we don’t tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells, thanks to our new affiliation.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t care what people believe.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And neither do you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Now, if the rumours about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all, and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we’re throwing another prized flower into the dirt.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It is a chance we simply cannot take.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown All right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ll remove it for you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m sure you’re familiar with the Kingsguard vows.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He will never marry.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He will never have children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Ah.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Tyrell name will fade.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So, shall I draw up the order?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Or do you consent to this match?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s a rare enough thing, a man who lives up to his reputation.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We’ve gotta cut them loose!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Take my hand!
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown That’s a wonderful pin.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s more of a brooch, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m very happy about…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I am as well.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I feel like I’m in a dream.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yes, me, too.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Definitely.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ve dreamed of a large wedding since I was young.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The guests, the food, the tournaments.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And the bride, of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I had never left Winterfell before I came to King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But it sounds wonderful.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I can’t wait to see it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And to leave this place.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s terrible, isn’t it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The most terrible place there is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t suppose there’s anything we can do about this.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We can have them both killed.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Probably Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Father doesn’t discriminate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown We’re all being shipped off to hell together.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown On a boat you built.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I did what I did to protect our family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m your family.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family’s survival.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I do admit it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If it weren’t for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown There are two people in King’s Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The impulse I understand.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He hates me because I’m the only one who tells him what he really is.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown So, fair enough.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He wants me dead.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But his stupidity?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But the King orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The boy’s an idiot.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown What do you want me to say?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Probably.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But not from Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He won’t do anything now Father’s here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Not the Tyrells.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Soon they won’t need to be afraid of him.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doeeyed whore, and so will his children and their children.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown History will be taken from our hands.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You may escape, at least.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown When Jaime gets back, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But when will that be?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown He’s out there somewhere.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Jaime or not, I’m truly fucked.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Who’s going to tell her?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you think people will like it?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I don’t think they will even notice it.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s not my wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King’s Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They’d never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Loras likes green and gold brocade.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m sure he does.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Will they let me invite my family?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They haven’t asked my opinion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But do you think they will?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown No.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Should I…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I beg your pardon, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I was trying on a gown for Joffrey’s wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yes, it should be quite a wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Alone, if I may.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Why do you need to speak to her alone?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Shae.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Please excuse her.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown She’s not from here.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Sometimes we think we want to hear something, and it’s only afterwards, when it’s too late, that we realise we wished we’d heard it under entirely different circumstances.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s all right, really.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown How to begin?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown This…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown This…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown This is awkward.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon’s fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown There aren’t , blades.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown There aren’t even .
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’ve counted.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I’m sure you have.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Ugly old thing.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Yet it has a certain appeal.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The Lysa Arryn of chairs.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Early days, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Although who doesn’t like to see their friends fail now and then?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You’re so right.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown If I’m going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect…
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown You didn’t bring her any enjoyment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And she didn’t bring me any enjoyment.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown She was a bad investment on my part.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Something daring.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown I did what I did for the good of the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The realm?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Do you know what the realm is?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown It’s the , blades of Aegon’s enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A story we agree to tell each other over and over, till we forget that it’s a lie.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Chaos.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Chaos isn’t a pit.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Chaos is a ladder.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The fall breaks them.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Illusions.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown Only the ladder is real.
GameOfThrones.Season03.Episode06 #unknown The climb is all there is.
