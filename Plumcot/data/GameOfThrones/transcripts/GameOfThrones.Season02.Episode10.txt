tyrion_lannister  Pod.
tyrion_lannister  Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
podrick_payne  Yes, my lord.
grand_maester_pycelle  Would you like something for the pain?
tyrion_lannister  What happened?
grand_maester_pycelle  The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father
tyrion_lannister  Where am I?
grand_maester_pycelle  These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand
grand_maester_pycelle  Oh, For your trouble.
joffrey_baratheon  I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfatherTywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand
tywin_lannister  Thank you, Your Grace.
joffrey_baratheon  Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.
joffrey_baratheon  For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.
petyr_baelish  You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons. The crowd laughs
joffrey_baratheon  Ser Loras Tyrell.
joffrey_baratheon  Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.
loras_tyrell  Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses.
joffrey_baratheon  Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?
margaery_tyrell  With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.
joffrey_baratheon  I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king
cersei_lannister  Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a manbeheaded for treason, a girlwhose brother For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.
crowd#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Margaery! We want Margaery!
joffrey_baratheon  I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.
grand_maester_pycelle  Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.
joffrey_baratheon  The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister You will be my queen
petyr_baelish  My lady. My sincerest condolences.
sansa_stark  They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
petyr_baelish  You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.
sansa_stark  But, if he's not marrying me
petyr_baelish  He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.
sansa_stark  King's Landing is my home now.
petyr_baelish  Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
ros  Come in. Make yourself comfortable.
ros  That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me.
lord_varys  No need for that, my dear.
ros  You sure? Most men like what they see.
lord_varys  I'm not like most men.
ros  That's what most men say.
lord_varys  (laughs)
ros  If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.
lord_varys  I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
ros  Have we met?
lord_varys  You wouldn't remember me if we had?
ros  I meet a lot of men.
lord_varys  And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
ros  You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor.
lord_varys  You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
ros  I know who you are.
lord_varys  And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.
ros  How do you know about that?
lord_varys  I thought you said you knew who I was.
ros  What can I do for you, Lord Varys?
lord_varys  Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
ros  I'm afraid of him.
lord_varys  Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.
jaime_lannister  You're a virgin, I take it?
brienne_of_tarth  Walk.
jaime_lannister  Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne. BRIENNE" One or two tried.
jaime_lannister  Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.
brienne_of_tarth  Not interested.
jaime_lannister  Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
jaime_lannister  Ah. "They lay with lions." Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
brienne_of_tarth  I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
jaime_lannister  Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
jaime_lannister  What are you doing?
brienne_of_tarth  Burying them.
jaime_lannister  We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
brienne_of_tarth  I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  I didn't leave it here.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  I had me dagger.
jaime_lannister  Untie me. Now!
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?
brienne_of_tarth  Traveling a prisoner
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  You're a woman. - A woman!
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Well, fuck me!
brienne_of_tarth  If you've quite finished up
brienne_of_tarth  All right, we'll be going.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?
brienne_of_tarth  The Starks.
man2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10 What did he do?
jaime_lannister  Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
brienne_of_tarth  No, stealing is a crime.
jaime_lannister  But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Where are you taking him?
brienne_of_tarth  To Riverrun.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Why Riverrun?
brienne_of_tarth  Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Why not kill him?
jaime_lannister  For stealing a pig?
brienne_of_tarth  I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Sending him with you? How important could he be?
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  All right, have it your way, my lady.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Do I know you?
jaime_lannister  Have you been to Ashemark?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  No.
jaime_lannister  Then you don't know me.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
jaime_lannister  Is it near Ashemark?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  No.
jaime_lannister  I've never been there.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  What do you think of these beauties?
brienne_of_tarth  I hope you gave them quick deaths.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Two of them we did, yeah.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
jaime_lannister  I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
brienne_of_tarth  If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king
brienne_of_tarth  He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.
brienne_of_tarth  Two quick deaths.
jaime_lannister  Those were Stark men.
brienne_of_tarth  I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.
catelyn_stark  Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
robb_stark  I know that.
catelyn_stark  And you mean to do it anyway?
robb_stark  I love her.
catelyn_stark  I know that seems important to you.
robb_stark  It is important to me.
catelyn_stark  Your father He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.
robb_stark  And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father
catelyn_stark  Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
robb_stark  Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
catelyn_stark  And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father
robb_stark  My father And the only parent
stannis_baratheon  You said you saw my victory in the flames.
melisandre  l I did. I still see it.
stannis_baratheon  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?
melisandre  The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
stannis_baratheon  You claimed to speak for a god.
melisandre  Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?
stannis_baratheon  You talk about war as if you understand it.
melisandre  I've been fighting far longer than you.
stannis_baratheon  Have you? Show me how you fight.
stannis_baratheon  Show me.
stannis_baratheon  Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
melisandre  Inside you.
stannis_baratheon  I murdered my brother
melisandre  We murdered him. Share the weight with me.
stannis_baratheon  He wasn't your brother
melisandre  This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king
stannis_baratheon  You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know.
melisandre  Let me show you.
melisandre  Look into the fire, my king Look.
stannis_baratheon  I see fire.
melisandre  Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king
theon_greyjoy  I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.
maester_luwin  They want you to know you're surrounded.
theon_greyjoy  I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
maester_luwin  They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before
theon_greyjoy  Thank you, wise bald man Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
theon_greyjoy  No word from my father
maester_luwin  No.
theon_greyjoy  Send more ravens.
maester_luwin  You killed all the ravens.
theon_greyjoy  The first time I saw Winterfell
theon_greyjoy  First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, "Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. "We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."
maester_luwin  Lord Stark
theon_greyjoy  Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father
theon_greyjoy  I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.
maester_luwin  Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you.
theon_greyjoy  And what's your counsel, trusted friend
maester_luwin  Run.
maester_luwin  Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
theon_greyjoy  There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.
maester_luwin  Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
maester_luwin  Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven.
theon_greyjoy  I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.
maester_luwin  There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
maester_luwin  The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.
theon_greyjoy  The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
maester_luwin  The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
theon_greyjoy  I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.
maester_luwin  I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet.
theon_greyjoy  You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
theon_greyjoy  You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.
theon_greyjoy  They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye!
theon_greyjoy  You think they're right?
black_lorren  Aye.
theon_greyjoy  We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye!
theon_greyjoy  Mothers will name their sons for us.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye!
theon_greyjoy  Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye!
theon_greyjoy  And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye!
theon_greyjoy  What is dead may never die!
men#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  What is dead may never die!
black_lorren  Thought he'd never shut up.
dagmer_cleftjaw  It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
maester_luwin  What is this? What are you doing?
dagmer_cleftjaw  Let's go home.
man#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Come on.
tyrion_lannister  Why should I believe you?
lord_varys  Why would I lie about it?
tyrion_lannister  To create strife between my sister
lord_varys  Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister If it weren't for your squire
tyrion_lannister  Pod.
podrick_payne  Yes, my lord?
tyrion_lannister  Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
podrick_payne  No, my lord.
tyrion_lannister  You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.
podrick_payne  (nods)
lord_varys  I'm afraid your friend The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your fatheror your sister It varies from cloak to cloak.
tyrion_lannister  Then my hill tribesmen.
lord_varys  Have gone home. Your father I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.
tyrion_lannister  Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
lord_varys  We are. Podrick, would you mind?
lord_varys  There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king
lord_varys  Come along now, Podrick.
shae  My love.
tyrion_lannister  It was good of you to come.
shae  Good of me? Of course I come.
shae  I want to see you.
tyrion_lannister  Believe me, you don't.
shae  Have you looked?
tyrion_lannister  (shakes his head)
shae  I will be the first.
tyrion_lannister  Well?
shae  You are a mess.
tyrion_lannister  I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
shae  You think I'm here for money?
tyrion_lannister  That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
shae  Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave.
tyrion_lannister  Leave?
shae  Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here.
tyrion_lannister  What would we do in Pentos?
shae  Eat, drink, fuck, live.
tyrion_lannister  I want to go with you.
shae  So do it. Your fatheryour sister Forget about them. Come with me.
tyrion_lannister  I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?
shae  You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.
septon  In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words.
robb_stark  Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.
talisa_stark  Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.
robb_stark  I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
talisa_stark  I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.
kovarro  (dothraki) A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.
kovarro  Where are the guards?
jorah_mormont  No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
daenerys_targaryen  Let them try.
daenerys_targaryen  Is this a riddle?
jorah_mormont  Khaleesi! Khaleesi!
daenerys_targaryen  Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?
hot_pie  How did he find us?
arya_stark  What are you doing here?
jaqen_hghar  Waiting for you.
arya_stark  How did you know we'd come this way?
jaqen_hghar  After all the things you have seen, this is your question?
arya_stark  How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
jaqen_hghar  No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way. Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.
jaqen_hghar  If you would learn, you must come with me.
arya_stark  Where?
jaqen_hghar  Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
arya_stark  My dancing master was from Braavos.
jaqen_hghar  To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one.
arya_stark  I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brotherand mother And my sister I need to find her, too.
jaqen_hghar  Then we must part. A man
arya_stark  What is it?
jaqen_hghar  A coin of great value.
arya_stark  Could it buy a horse?
jaqen_hghar  It is not meant for the buying of horses.
arya_stark  Then what good is it?
jaqen_hghar  If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, "Valar Morghulis."
arya_stark  Valar Morghulis.
arya_stark  Please don't go, Jaqen.
jaqen_hghar  Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis.
arya_stark  Valar Morghulis.
jaqen_hghar  Good.
jaqen_hghar  Farewell, Arya Stark.
bran_stark  Osha, what are you doing?
bran_stark  Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
rickon_stark  We'll make you better. LUWIN I feel just fine.
rickon_stark  (cries)
bran_stark  They burned it down. They burned everything.
maester_luwin  Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
osha  North's the wrong way. And motherand brother We don't know where.
maester_luwin  There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother
bran_stark  I don't want to leave you.
maester_luwin  No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here.
maester_luwin  Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.
osha  I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it. LUWIN I don't want milk of the poppy.
maester_luwin  Do it quickly.
khal_drogo  (dothraki) Moon of my life.
daenerys_targaryen  (dothraki) This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
khal_drogo  (dothraki) Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
daenerys_targaryen  That sounds like something you would do.
khal_drogo  (dothraki) Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.
khal_drogo  (dothraki) You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.
khal_drogo  (dothraki) And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
daenerys_targaryen  Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
pyat_pree  They miss their mother.
pyat_pree  They want to be with you.
pyat_pree  Do you want to be with them?
pyat_pree  You will be.
pyat_pree  When your dragons were born,
pyat_pree  our magic was born again.
pyat_pree  It is strongest in their presence.
pyat_pree  And they are strongest in yours.
pyat_pree  You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again. Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them.
pyat_pree  And we will be with you until time comes to an end.
pyat_pree  Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.
daenerys_targaryen  This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.
pyat_pree  They will be waiting a long time.
daenerys_targaryen  Dracarys.
ygritte  We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go.
jon_snow  Careful with that. You might cut yourself.
jon_snow  Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.
rattleshirt  Enough of that!
jon_snow  Stop!
qhorin_halfhand  Why, traitor
rattleshirt  Let 'em fight.
qhorin_halfhand  That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.
qhorin_halfhand  Your traitor father
qhorin_halfhand  Or was it your whore mother?
qhorin_halfhand  We are the watchers on the Wall.
ygritte  You can tell Mance that's the man
rattleshirt  Burn the body.
wilding#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season02.Episode10  Aye.
rattleshirt  You don't want this one coming back for you.
ygritte  Come along, Jon Snow.
ygritte  Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
xaro_xhoan_daxos  What the
doreah  Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.
daenerys_targaryen  Come.
daenerys_targaryen  Nothing.
daenerys_targaryen  Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
