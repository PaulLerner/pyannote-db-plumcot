The battle between the Night's Watch and the wildlings has come.
Jon and Samwell are on duty on top of the Wall. Ygritte wants to be the one who kills Jon Snow. A petrified Gilly returns with her baby to Castle Rock, reporting about the wildling attack at Mole's Town. The Nights Watch prepare for battle. The wildling army attack the wall in the night, with giants riding mammoths. Jon sets out on a dangerous journey to help set things right.
The Night's Watch men are ready to defend Castle Black against the Wildlings. Gilly arrives with her baby and Sam hides them in a food store. Jon is assigned to protect the Wall by Ser Allister and he goes down to protect the gate. The battle begins with giants and one mammoth trying to open the outer gate. Meanwhile Ygritte and Tormund fight inside Castle Black. Will Castle Black and the Wall fall to the Wildlings attack?
The battle at the wall begins. John Snow has urged his superiors to destroy the tunnel entrance but they refuse. Sam is pleased with the sudden re-appearance of Gilly and her baby and hides them in a storage room knowing that he may not survive the attack. When the battle begins, they are beset on both sides of the wall. From the north, Mance Raydor's army attacks sending men climbing up the wall and others to attempt entry through the tunnel. From the south, they are attacked by the raiding party that includes Ygritte. The battle is deadly, and not many survive. While the Night's Watch survives the first night of battle, John Snow realizes that they will not survive a second and sets off to negotiate with Raydor.
