Meereen is under siege and the fleet of the masters is attacking the city. Daenerys wants to destroy their cities but Tyrion convinces her to not incur in the same mistake of her father in King's Landing. They schedule a meeting with the masters to discuss the terms of surrender. However the masters misunderstand and believe Daenerys want to surrender. She rides Drogon and together with the two other dragons, they burn part of the fleet. Meanwhile Daario and the Dothraki attack the Sons of the Harpy. Then Yara and Theon team up with Daenerys to accept the independence of the Iron Isles and to overthrow Euron. In Winterfell, Jon Snow, Sansa, Davos and Tormund meet with Ramsay, and Jon Snow proposes a dispute between them instead of sacrificing lives in a battle. Ramsay does not accept and they schedule the battle in the morning. Jon Snow plots a scheme with Davos and Tormund and Sansa warns that Ramsay plays dirty. When both armies are ready to battle, Ramsay brings a surprise that affects Jon and his army. Who will win the bloody battle?

Jon seems to be losing the fight of Winterfell, largely outnumbered by Ramsay's people. But then, close to his end, Jon's life is saved by the coming army, much to Sansa's delight. Ramsay tries to flee but Jon goes after him and makes it his mission to kill him. In the meantime Wun Wun goes down. Eventually the Starks have Winterfell and Sansa takes her revenge on Ramsay in a Ramsay style.
