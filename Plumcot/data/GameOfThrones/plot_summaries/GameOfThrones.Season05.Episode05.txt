In Meereen, Daenerys has to decide how to deal with the former masters after the death of Ser Barristan Selmy and the injuries inflicted on Grey Worm. She decides to round up the heads of the 13 richest families in the city and introduce them to her dragons. Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister approach the ancient city of Valyria and, after witnessing something quite incredible, they are set upon by the Stone Men, and Mormont does not escape unscathed. Sansa finally sees what has become of Theon, courtesy of Ramsay Bolton's jealous mistress. Ramsay is particularly cruel to Theon at a dinner, much to Roose Bolton's displeasure. At Castle Black, Jon Snow tries to convince Tormund Giantsbane to move his people south of the Wall and settle in lands that will be made available to them. Most of the men of the Watch object to the plan.
In Meereen, Grey Worm is wounded and Barristan is dead. Daenerys decides to arrest the leaders of the wealthy families and feeds one of them to her dragons. Jon Snow proposes a deal to Tormund to move the wildlings south of the Wall and join forces with the Night's Watch, and a great number of his men do not accept the truce. Stannis and his army head to the North to fight against the Boltons. Brienne sends a message to Sansa in case she is in danger, and Sansa is lured into reuniting with Theon. Daenerys reviews her position and decides to open the arenas again to placate the insurgent Meereenese. Mormont and Tyrion catch sight of a dragon, and then encounter the Stone Men in the ruins of Old Valyria. Forced to fight, they lose their boat and Mormont suffers an injury.
