Jon and the wildlings return to Castle Black. Jaime meets with Doran Martell. Stannis makes a hard choice. Arya runs into Meryn Trant. Daenerys attends the grand reopening of the fighting pits.
Things are not going well for Stannis and his army. Winter is upon them and they are attacked in the night losing most of their stores. Unable to move forward or back, he dispatches Ser Davos Seaworth to seek help from Castle Black. Jon Snow and the survivors of the attack at Hardhome make it safely back to the wall but the reception they get is anything but warm. In Dorne, Doran Martell takes the diplomatic route telling Jaime that Myrcella can return to King's Landing with him provided certain conditions were met. In Braavos, Arya sees Lord Tyrell who arrives to speak to representatives of the Iron Bank. He's accompanied by Meryn Trant, one of the men on her list. In Meereen, the Great Games begin but the needless killing is not to Daenarys or Tyrion's liking. Ser Jorah defeats his opponents in the arena but a trap is sprung and the Sons of the Harpy attack. Rescue is at hand however.
