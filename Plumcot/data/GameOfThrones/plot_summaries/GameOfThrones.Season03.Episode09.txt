Robb, his wife Talisa and mother Catelyn arrive for the marriage of Edmure Tully to one of Walder Frey's daughters. There is considerable tension between the two families but Robb's sincere apology for not marrying one of Frey's daughters is well received. It doesn't stop the elderly Frey from being both crude and rude towards his guests. Edmure is pleasantly surprised to see that his bride is to be Frey's prettiest granddaughter, Roslin. The festivities continue but Walder Frey has something very special planned. Arya and Sandor Clegane arrive at the Twins but too late to do anything. Daenerys meanwhile orders the attack on Yunkai based on information provided by Daario. Brandon learns the strength of his powers. Jon Snow is forced to choose between the Watch and Ygritte.
