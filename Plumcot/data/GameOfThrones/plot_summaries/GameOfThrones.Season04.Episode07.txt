Bronn, who has fought for him once before, has accepted the Queen Regent's offer of an arranged marriage with a noblewoman and so is not available. Tyrion finds a champion in someone unexpected. Brienne and Pod stop at an inn and meet Arya's old friend, Hotpie, who tells them she's alive and probably heading to the Eyrie.
