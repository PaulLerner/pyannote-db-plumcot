GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  How close did you get?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  Close as any man would.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 gared  We should head back to the wall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  Do the dead frighten you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 gared  Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter ... if I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  They were here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 gared  See where they went.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 waymar_royce  What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 gared  It's ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Go on. Father's watching.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  And your mother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 septa_mordane  Fine work, as always. Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 septa_mordane  I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. Quite beautiful ... the stitching ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Don't think too much, Bran.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Relax your bow arm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Quick, Bran, faster!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 rodrik_cassel  Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Get the lads to saddle their horses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Do you have to?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  He swore an oath, Cat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 rodrik_cassel  The law is law, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Tell Bran he's coming, too.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Lad, go run back and get the rest.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 will  Forgive me, lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Don't look away.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  King of the Andals and the First Men...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Father will know if you do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  You did well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  You understand why I did it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Jon said he was a deserter.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  But do you understand why I had to kill him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Our way is the old way?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  So he was lying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  A madman sees what he sees.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  Mountain lion?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  There are no mountain lions in these woods.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  It's a freak.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  It's a direwolf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Tough old beast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Now there are five.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  You want to hold it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 rodrik_cassel  They don't belong down here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  Right. Give it here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  No!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Put away your blade.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  I take orders from your father, not you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Please, father!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I'm sorry, Bran.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  What about you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  I'm not a Stark. Get on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you. You worry too much. It's starting to show.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock. A hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  What if Jon Arryn told someone?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  But who would he tell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  My husband.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  You should be the Hand of the king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I wonder if the old gods agree.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  It's your gods with all the rules.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I am so sorry, my love.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Tell me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Your sister. The boy ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  They both have their health. Gods be good. The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  If he's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  You can always say no, Ned.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  I'm told he drinks all night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  How much could he possibly drink? A man of his ... stature.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  In any case, candles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's sleek bit of mink?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 theon_greyjoy  Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Gods, but they grow fast. Brandon!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  How many times have I told youGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 BRAN_STARK But he's coming right now! Down our road!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I want you to promise meGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 BRAN_STARK I promise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Do you know what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  What?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? Go on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 arya_stark  Move!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  You've got fat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Cat!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 arya_stark  Where's the Imp?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Will you shut up?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 arya_stark  Arya.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 arya_stark  That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Would you please shut up.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  My queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  My queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Ned.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 arya_stark  Where's the Imp?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Tell me about Jon Arryn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  One minute he was fine, and then ... Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  We both did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  He never had to teach you much, but me ... You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I'm not worthy of the honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  I did hear something about that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  And the other brother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  The queen has two brothers?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  I hear they call him the Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  I hear he hates that nickname.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Clever girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Have you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  The gods gave me one blessing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  Don't get up.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 ros  M'lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  She has odd cravings, our sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Close the door!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  She belonged with me. In my dreams, I kill him every night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Not all of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Daenerys!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Go on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  It's too hot, my lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Where is he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  Come forward, my dear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Where's he going?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  The ceremony is over.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  When will they be married?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Is it true they lie with their horses?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Do you take me for a fool?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  I don't know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  He's so handsome.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Sansa ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Is he dead yet?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Uncle Benjen!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  You got bigger. Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  So take me with you when you go back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Jon ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  The Wall isn't going anywhere.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  I'm ready to swear your oath.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  I don't care about that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  You might, if you knew what it meant. I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  What're you doing back there?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jon_snow  What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  The two he was with are still missing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  A wildling ambush.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Winter is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Uncle Benjen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 benjen_stark  Robb boy. How are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  I'm good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Yes. Lovely country.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Thirteen, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  You're tall. Still growing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  I think so, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  And have you bled yet?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  No, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  And your dress. Did you make it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Such talent. You must make something for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I hear the same.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Your pardon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I don't fight in tournaments.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  No? Getting a little old for it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  Well said.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robb_stark  Time for bed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I won't let him take you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  How did he get so fat?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 kings_guard  It's Maester Luwin, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Send him in.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  Stay.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  What news?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 catelyn_stark  He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 maester_luwin  A different time. Different king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  When?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  When their omens favor war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jorah_mormont  A small gift, for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jorah_mormont  Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 illyrio_mopatis  Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  Thank you, Magister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  She's beautiful. ... Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say 'thank you' in Dothraki.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jorah_mormont  There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 viserys_targaryen  Make him happy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 khal_drogo  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  Do you know the Common Tongue?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 khal_drogo  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 daenerys_targaryen  Is 'no' the only word that you know?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 khal_drogo  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sandor_clegane  Rough night, Imp?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sandor_clegane  I didn't pick you for a hunter.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 tyrion_lannister  The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 sandor_clegane  It's not hunting if you pay for it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  No, but I'm still better than you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 eddard_stark  I hope I'll serve you well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 robert_baratheon  You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Come on, you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  Stop. Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  Are you completely mad?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  He saw us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 cersei_lannister  He saw us!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 bran_stark  Ten.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  Ten.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode01 jaime_lannister  The things I do for love.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jorah_mormont  You need to drink, child. And eat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Isn't there anything else?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jorah_mormont  The Dothraki have two things in abundance, grass and horses. People can't live on grass. In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end. It'll get easier.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  Khaleesi!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  Your hands.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jorah_mormont  We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 viserys_targaryen  I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jorah_mormont  As you wish, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 viserys_targaryen  Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jorah_mormont  Selling to one... some poachers I caught on my land.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 viserys_targaryen  Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  What good will my sympathies do them?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  One word and I'll hit you again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  I'm telling mother!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  You can't...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Do you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  The Prince will remember that, little lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Ah. Time for breakfast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burned black.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Little brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Beloved siblings.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 myrcella_baratheon  Is Bran going to die?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Apparently not.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  What do you mean?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  The Maester says the boy may live.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Please.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I never knew.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I am grateful.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Perhaps this time she'll listen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  A sword for the wall?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  I already have one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Good man. Have you swung it yet?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Of course I have.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  We've guarded the kingdoms for 8 000 years.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Soon enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jaime_lannister  Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not? It's only for life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. My things weren't properly folded, she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  It's good you've got help.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Impressive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  A present?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  It's so skinny.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  I can be quick.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  I think so.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  First lesson - Stick them with the pointy end.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  I know which end to use.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  I'm going to miss you. Careful. All the best swords have names, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a Needle of my own.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  You've said it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I want you to leave. 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  I have no choice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Cat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  You can. You must.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  You Starks are hard to kill.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  My mother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  She was very kind.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  It was always my color.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  Farewell, Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  And you, Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. Hmm? I promise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  I've half a mind to go with you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  You should have asked me 20 years ago.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  I recall a few chances.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Bessie. She was one of yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Wylla.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Nor will I.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  She's little more than a child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 benjen_stark  Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Why do you read so much?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Look at me and tell me what you see.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Is this a trick?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Until your brother killed that King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 tyrion_lannister  Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense. Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 maester_luwin  It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  Talk to Poole about it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 maester_luwin  Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I don't care about appointments!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 maester_luwin  Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  When was the last time you left this room?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I have to take care of him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jon_snow  You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  No!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Have you ever seen a dragon?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Everywhere? Even in the east?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jhiqui  It is known.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  The moon?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jhiqui  It is known.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Qarth tell you these stories?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  How old were you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Nine?!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Will it take three years?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 benjen_stark  Welcome.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 maester_luwin  The boy was always sure-footed before.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 theon_greyjoy  Saw what, my lady?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 rodrik_cassel  Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 theon_greyjoy  If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 maester_luwin  What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  I'll ride to King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  Mother, you can't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I must.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 rodrik_cassel  I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 rodrik_cassel  Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robb_stark  What about Bran?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 catelyn_stark  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Finish a man? Oh.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 doreah  If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 daenerys_targaryen  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Pardon me, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 mycah  I'll get you!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  What are you doing here? Go away.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  Your sister? And who are you, boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 mycah  Mycah, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  He the butcher's boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  He's my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 mycah  She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 mycah  It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Stop it!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya, stay out of this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  I'll gut you, you little cunt!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Nymeria!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Nymeria!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  No. No. Please don't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  Then go! Don't touch me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  It's a direwolf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  I'll check down here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 irri  I think I heard a noise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Go!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jory_cassel  My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Where is she?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jory_cassel  She's been taken directly before the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Who took her?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jory_cassel  The Lannisters found her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Right, get back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 jory_cassel  The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Back! Back to the inn. All back!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  I'm sorry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Are you hurt?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Joff told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  That's not what happened!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Liar!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 joffrey_baratheon  Shut up!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  In bed asleep.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Liar! Liar liar liar!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Hey! Stop it! That's enough of that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Liar liar liar!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Stop! Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  You let that little girl disarm you? Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Gladly, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  I'd forgot the damned wolf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  So be it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  We have another wolf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  As you will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  You can't mean it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 robert_baratheon  A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 arya_stark  Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sansa_stark  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  Is this your command... your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Where is the beast?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  Chained up outside, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 cersei_lannister  Is this some trick?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 eddard_stark  The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode02 sandor_clegane  He ran... Not very fast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 kings_landing_whore  Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jory_cassel  Yes, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 kings_landing_whore  If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Sturdy old thing. How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder? And what's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  But you just stood there and watched.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  You served him well when serving was safe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 renly_baratheon  And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Grand Maester.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  How many years has it been? You were a young man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  And you served another King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Without the King?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 renly_baratheon  Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  We are the lords of small matters here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 renly_baratheon  My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Mmm, how much?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  Can the treasury bear such expense?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80 000?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  How could you let this happen?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 renly_baratheon  "Counting coppers," he calls it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  Please, it's nearly healed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  It's ugly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  Do I have to marry her?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  I don't want to.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  How would you handle them?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  A royal army?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  And if the northerners rebel?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  And these 10 000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  For me. I'm their King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  I'm not asking.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 joffrey_baratheon  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 septa_mordane  Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I'm practicing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  Practicing for what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  The Prince.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 septa_mordane  Arya, stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  The Hound killed your friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  You're an idiot.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 septa_mordane  Enough!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  What's happening here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 septa_mordane  Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love. The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 septa_mordane  You've barely eaten a thing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  It's all right. Go on. War was easier than daughters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  Go away!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  Mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  It's called Needle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  Stick 'em with the pointy end.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  That's the essence of it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  So was I! He is a liar.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  But how you can let her marry someone like that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  Winter is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I don't hate her. Not really.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I can keep it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 old_nan  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 bran_stark  I hate your stories.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 old_nan  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 bran_stark  Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 old_nan  Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robb_stark  What are you telling him now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 old_nan  Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robb_stark  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 old_nan  Maybe we do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robb_stark  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 bran_stark  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robb_stark  Don't ever say that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 bran_stark  I'd rather be dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rodrik_cassel  Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rodrik_cassel  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 sansa_stark  Follow me, Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  A dear friend told me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Lord Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  How did you know I was coming?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Do you know whose dagger this is?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lord_varys  I must admit I do not.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Yours?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  To whom?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 alliser_thorne  Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us? Next! Next! Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  A charming man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Good news or bad?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  Both.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grand_maester_pycelle  Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  My wife is in Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Is she?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  You're a funny man. A very funny man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Ned!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Ah, the Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grenn  You broke my nose, bastard!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  It's an improvement.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grenn  If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 pypar  I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grenn  What're you looking at, Half Man?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Hmm. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rast  What do you care about our faces?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  It's just I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 grenn  We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choiceGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 JON_SNOW They hate me because I'm better than they are.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Oh... Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  We have proof. We have the blade.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 petyr_baelish  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  How could you be so stupid?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Calm down.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Then what are you raving about?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  And my husband?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about usGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 CERSEI_LANNISTER Let me go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  Never.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 cersei_lannister  Let me go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  I wish I could see the girls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  It's too dangerous.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Just for a moment.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Until we know who our enemies are...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  And if you find the proof?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  He still loves you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 catelyn_stark  Does he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 eddard_stark  Off with you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  Yes, it's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 barristan_selmy  Of course, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  Who was it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 barristan_selmy  A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  How'd you do it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 barristan_selmy  Lance through the heart.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I br ought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait." They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lancel_lannister  It's empty, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  What do you mean it's empty?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 lancel_lannister  There's no more wine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  Is that what empty means? So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 barristan_selmy  I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 barristan_selmy  A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  Your outlaw... Any last words?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  I cut his head off, so no.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 robert_baratheon  What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jaime_lannister  He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  From whom?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices - pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  Tell them all to stop.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  Until I command them otherwise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 viserys_targaryen  You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  No!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 viserys_targaryen  Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  Shall we return to the Khalasar? Khaleesi?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  You walk.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  You're leaving?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  What kind of reports?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  The kind I don't want to believe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  I'm ready. I won't let you down.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  But I'm better than every...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  A bear's balls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  You're joking?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  And how do a bear's balls taste?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  Call me what you like.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 benjen_stark  Enjoy the capital, brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  I always do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  Aye. Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  Aye, day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 yoren  I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  Yes, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  Armor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  Slow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  Slow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  There are no rabbits.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  I don't think she wants to eat dog.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  A blessing from the Great Stallion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 irri  She does not want to eat horse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 rakharo  We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jorah_mormont  Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 maester_aemon  How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Eight... no, nine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 maester_aemon  All of them brief?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 maester_aemon  This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually - winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 maester_aemon  The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jeor_mormont  Your sister sits by the side the King. Tell her we need help.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 maester_aemon  When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  It’s a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 khal_drogo  How do you know?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 daenerys_targaryen  I know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  Of course.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  He'll never walk again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 tyrion_lannister  If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 jon_snow  Farewell, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  Your dancing master, Syrio Forel. Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  It's too heavy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body sideface. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  What if I drop it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  I'm a girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 arya_stark  A Needle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode03 syrio_forel  Ahhh. Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me. Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 old_nan  The little Lord's been dreaming again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  We have visitors.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  I don't want to see anyone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  I don't want to go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robb_stark  Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robb_stark  I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 maester_luwin  He has no memory of that day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Curious.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robb_stark  Why are you here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  Kneel, Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Do you like to ride, Bran?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 maester_luwin  The boy has lost the use of his legs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  I'm not a cripple.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bran_stark  Will I really be able to ride?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robb_stark  Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robb_stark  You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  He's not my master.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  She wasn't feeling well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  My lady's whereabouts...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  Must have been a pretty sight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  We were outnumbered 10 to one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 theon_greyjoy  Careful, Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  What in seven hells is that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  Tell them your name.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 rast  Come to take the black pudding.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. Rast, see what he can do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I yield. Please, no more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Enough! He yielded.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Are you sure you want to do this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  Well fought!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Piss off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Did he hurt you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I've had worse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Why didn't you get up and fight?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I wanted to. I just couldn't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I'm a coward. My father always says so.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  The Wall's no place for cowards.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  You're too stupid to be a coward.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  You're too stupid to be a...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  Quick now, before summer's over.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Come on here!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  But if they did?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  And you know these men?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  You sold slaves. Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  I had no money and an expensive wife.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  And where is she now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  In another place, with another man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  Yes, my dear?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  They call you the last dragon...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  They do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  You have dragon's blood in your veins?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  It's entirely possible.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  Really? Why dragons?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Yes, seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  I was not locked in. I have seen things.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  What have you seen?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  A pirate ship?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  A dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  No. No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen - their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  What happened to the skulls?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  That's very sad.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  No, your Grace. To teach your sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  What if I have a girl?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  What if I only have girls?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  I wouldn't worry about that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  But what if?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  And everyone would hate me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Nobody could ever hate you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Joffrey does.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Please shut up about it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Aegon the Conqueror.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  And who built the Red Keep?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Maegor the Cruel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  And how many years did it take to build...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  The Mad King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Commonly known as the Mad King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Why were they killed?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  You should be speak to your father about these matters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  I don't want to speak to my father, ever.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  No, I won't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 janos_slynt  It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 janos_slynt  Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 lord_varys  Dreadful.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 renly_baratheon  If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 janos_slynt  I need more men.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  I will?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 janos_slynt  Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  The sooner this is over, the better.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 lord_varys  The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Oh this heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  What did Jon want the night before he died?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  He came inquiring after a book.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  A book? What book?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  No, I'd like to read it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the Last Hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Jon's death...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Such a tragedy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Nothing of import, my Lord. Oh. There was one phrase he kept repeatingGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 EDDARD_STARK "The seed is strong"? What does that mean?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  What else could it be?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Poison.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Everybody knows that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  Of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I've taken enough of your time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grand_maester_pycelle  No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  It's a hard fall down these steps.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Cats? Syrio says...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  He's right about that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  He needs to get his strength back first.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords. Hmm?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  No. That's not me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  No, that's all right. I'm fine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  You're not. You're freezing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I don't like high places.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. "You're almost a man now," he said, "but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more." Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Yes, he is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I'm not going to get any better, you know?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Well... You can't get any worse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  I hear you're reading a boring book.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Pycelle talks too much.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  I promised Cat that I'd help you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Varys or the Queen?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 hugh_of_the_vale  As you can see, I'm busy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 hugh_of_the_vale  I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  No "ser." I'm not a knight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 hugh_of_the_vale  I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Let them look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tobho_mott  The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  What did Lord Arryn want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tobho_mott  He always came to see the boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I'd like to see him as well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tobho_mott  As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  This is fine work.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  It's not for sale.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tobho_mott  Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  I made it for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tobho_mott  Forgive him, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  What kind of questions?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Your mother?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  Who she was, what she looked like.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  What did you tell him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 gendry  She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Find anything?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  King Robert's bastard son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  This is for the King from Lord Stark. Should I leave...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Three? Four?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Forgive me, my Lord...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  We've met before, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  That's where you got your scar?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  Vicious sons of whores.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  They like their bloodshed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Theon? He's a good lad.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  I doubt it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robert_baratheon  I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jaime_lannister  I don't serve Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Where have you been?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Watch duty. With Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  He wasn't hungry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 pypar  Impossible!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 rast  You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  No one touches Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 grenn  Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 doreah  Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 irri  Yes, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  Why did you hit her?!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  What's this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  It's a gift. I had it made for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  Please.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  This stinks of manure. All of it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  Stop - stop it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 viserys_targaryen  You do not talk back to me! You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I wouldn't doubt it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Sally on the side?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Huh. Yeah, I find that hard to believe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  You didn't know where to put it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I know where to put it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Was she... Old and ugly?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  What color hair?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Red.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  I like red hair. And her... Her...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  You don't want to know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  That good?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  Better.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  What's my name?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Jon Snow?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  And why is my surname Snow?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  Because... You're a bastard from the north.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  So... You didn't know where to put it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 samwell_tarly  It is a bit nippy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jon_snow  I build my own fires.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 alliser_thorne  That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  I hit him. I hit the dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  He is still the true King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  The truth now - do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jorah_mormont  Home.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 daenerys_targaryen  I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  Lover's quarrel?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  I'm sorry. Do I...?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 arya_stark  Why do they call you Littlefinger?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Arya!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 septa_mordane  Don't be rude!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robert_baratheon  I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  Gods, who is that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  And his opponent?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 robert_baratheon  Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 sansa_stark  I won't tell anyone. I promise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 petyr_baelish  No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 jory_cassel  My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  You're missing your tournament.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  She likes it here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  She is the only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the North in her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  What are you doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  If that's my job, then so be it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 eddard_stark  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 cersei_lannister  As was I.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 marillion  Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  And to you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 rodrik_cassel  Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 marillion  Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 rodrik_cassel  I'd rather throw myself down a well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 marillion  Now, now, grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 masha_heddle  I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 masha_heddle  Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 bronn  You can have my room.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 yoren  Aye, my Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 marillion  My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 masha_heddle  Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 knight_of_house_frey  It is, my Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 knight_of_house_frey  She is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  The Red Stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 knight_of_house_frey  Our lord is honored by his trust.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 tyrion_lannister  I envy your father all his fine friends... but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  I know your sigil as well... The twin towers of Frey. How fares your Lord, Ser?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 knight_of_house_frey  Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode04 catelyn_stark  This man... came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the King's justice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  He'd never worn this armor before.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  Bad luck for him ... going against the Mountain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Who determines the draw?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Aye ... but who holds the straws? You've done good work, sisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan ... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  And that lad ... he was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Yes. That will never happen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 barristan_selmy  Robert tends to do what he wants.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lancel_lannister  It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You're too fat for your armor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lancel_lannister  No, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You're torturing the poor boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher -- now!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  The breastplate stretcher?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  How long before he figures it out?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Maybe you should have one invented.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  And who's going to hit you back?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  will be you! There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I'm not thirsty.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Your squire ... a Lannister boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Hmm ... a bloody idiot ... but Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Robert?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Where's Arya
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers. Thank you, Ser Loras.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Hey.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  I can't watch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  I'll take that bet.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Or you could even buy a friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  He's going to die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Ser Loras rides well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  No honor but quite a bit of gold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 gregor_clegane  Sword!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Stop this madness in the name of your King! Let him go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  I owe you my life, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sandor_clegane  I'm no Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  Remove his hood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 marillion  On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  This isn't the Kings Road. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  I did ... often and loudly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  And why would I do that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Ah ... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  Five years ago.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now ... you might as well kill me here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  I am not a murderer, Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  The dagger found
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 rodrik_cassel  Should I gag him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Why? Am I starting to make sense?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 rodrik_cassel  My Lady, this way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Untie me. If I die, what's the point?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  Rodrik?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 rodrik_cassel  I'll be fine, My Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bronn  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Well, I'm willing if she is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Bran ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  The Iron Islands. Sigil -- a Kraken. Words -- "We do not sow".
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Lords?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  The Greyjoys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  And failed rebellions.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Sigil -- a stag. -- a crowned stag now that Robert's King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Words -- "Ours is the fury". Lords -- the Baratheons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  mm - hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  The Westerlands -- sigil -- a lion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  hmm ..
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Words -- "A Lannister always pays his debts."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Lords -- the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  We're still on their words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  I don't know them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  You do know them. Think.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  That's House Martell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  "Righteous in wrath".
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  House Hornwood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  "Family, duty, honor".
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Those are Tully words ... your mother's. Are we playing a game?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  "Family, duty, honor" ... is that the right order?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  You know it is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Family comes first?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  And then she left!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Why did she leave?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Do you know where she is now? Today?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  No, I don't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  I'll never shoot another arrow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  And where is that written?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  You need legs to work a bow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  hmm ... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bran_stark  Really?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 maester_luwin  Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Shh ... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Important enough for the likes of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  Jealous?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Why should I be jealous? Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  Might surprise you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  hmm?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  You are jealous.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  And what about the Starks?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  A ward - that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  My father fought for the freedom of his people. What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  You're a very serious boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  I'm not a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  Oh yes you are. A serious boy with a serious cock.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 theon_greyjoy  I don't want to pay for it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 ros  Then get yourself a wife.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  How is your son, My Lord?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  He'll never walk again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  But his mind is sound?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  So they say.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever ... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool ... your friend, I know, but a fool ... and doomed unless you save him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  I didn't trust you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  So why do you trust me now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  What sort of doom does the King face?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Who gave it to him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy ... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  The squire, Ser Hugh?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Someone who could afford it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  He started asking questions.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 illyrio_mopatis  And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse -- they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 illyrio_mopatis  What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  This Hand is not the other.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 illyrio_mopatis  We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  "Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 illyrio_mopatis  It never was.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  You do move quietly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  We all have our qualities.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear ... such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -- both equally important.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone ... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Strictly speaking.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Saw me with your own eyes?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Eyes I own.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion ... To think a simple word to the Queen ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  One shudders at the thought.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Ooh.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Have you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Was that you under the bed?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary ... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies -- to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right -- loyalty to the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Oh, please.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  To a small council meeting?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  Off with you. No begging.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  I'm not a beggar. I live here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  Do you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  I want to see my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 sansa_stark  You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  They said they were going to kill you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Who did?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Oh, Arya.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage ... something about the savage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Where did you hear this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  What were you doing in the dungeons?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  Chasing a cat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Pardon, My Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Your name, friend?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 yoren  Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  I'm a girl!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Did Benjen send you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 yoren  No one sent me, My Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 yoren  Thank you, My Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen ... his blood runs black -- makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Know what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 yoren  Best said in private, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Go on. We'll talk more later. Jory, take her safely to her room.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  How many guards does my father have?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 arya_stark  You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  No fear on that count, little Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Well?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 yoren  It's about your wife, My Lord. She's taken the Imp.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 vardis_egen  You're far from home, Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  To whom do I speak?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 vardis_egen  Ser Vardis Egan, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  There was no time to send word.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 vardis_egen  May I ask, My Lady, why he is with you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 vardis_egen  He doesn't look like a prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  My sister will decide what he looks like.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 vardis_egen  Yes, My Lady. She will at that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 bronn  Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes ... I'll impregnate the bitch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  I like you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 royal_steward  Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I need to see the King first -- alone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 royal_steward  The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord. He has summoned you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Is it about my wife?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 royal_steward  No, My Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  The whore is pregnant.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You're speaking of murdering a child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both -- and that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear -- fear and blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Then we're no better than the Mad King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Careful, Ned. Careful now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You want to assassinate a girl ... because the Spider heard a rumor?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Based on whose information?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army ...What then?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores? You're my council. Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  I understand your misgivings, My Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 grand_maester_pycelle  I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  We should have had them both killed years ago.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I followed you into war -- twice -- without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  She dies.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I will have no part in it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Right away, My Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  What can I do for you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  When do you return to Winterfell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Why? What do you care?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I don't have the time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Heward and Wyl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Find them and meet me at the stables.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters -- warning me
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robin_arryn  Mommy? Is that the bad man?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  It is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robin_arryn  He's little.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  He's Tyrion the Imp of house Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  You will watch your tongue! These men are knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved John Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 tyrion_lannister  If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robin_arryn  You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  Shh ... Shh ... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robin_arryn  Mommy ... I want to see the bad man fly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  Perhaps you will, my little love.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 catelyn_stark  This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lysa_arryn  Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 lord_varys  You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  You're jealous.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Are you sure this won't hurt?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Only if I slip.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  And you prefer me like this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  hm - mmm...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  I want you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Hold still.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Yes well, I guess we'll never know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Everywhere?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters -- they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  I have an outrageous amount of money.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Not as much as the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  But a lot more than you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks -- tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  hmm ... How did that ever happen?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Do you know who should be King?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Be serious.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  I'm fourth in line.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  Stannis?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  He's still my older brother. What are you doing?!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  Look at it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 renly_baratheon  You cut me!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 loras_tyrell  It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you. You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark -- he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  I don't know. But I do know this -- If the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea ... we won't be able to stop them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  It's a neat little trick you do -- you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Is my father wrong?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles -- a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King -- their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  We still outnumber them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Five.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Five ... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now -- back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Our marriage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Every day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  How long can hate hold a thing together?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  Yes, it is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Yes, it tis. What was she like?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  So why now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted ... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  I felt something for you once, you know?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  I know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a ... moment?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 robert_baratheon  No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 cersei_lannister  It doesn't make me feel anything.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 mhaegen  She looks like him, don't she, My Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Aye.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 mhaegen  Tell him when you see him, My Lord. If it please you ... tell him how beautiful she is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 mhaegen  And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 mhaegen  He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy ... healthy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Well, he has more than you, for a start.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  How many?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  Come. Jory!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  Such a small pack of wolves.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  Was! ... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is ... Lord of somewhere very far away.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  I remember him well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 petyr_baelish  My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jory_cassel  If you threaten My Lord again --
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of"?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 eddard_stark  You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode05 jaime_lannister  My brother, Lord Stark ... we want him back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Your pardon, your Grace. I would rise, but...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  Do you know what your wife has done?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  She did nothing I did not command.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Who'd have thought she had it in her?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  You were the King's Hand. You shall now be held accountable.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Will both of you shut your mouths?! Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  He butchered my men...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Quiet, woman.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  I took you for a King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Hold your tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown. I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again. See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not... That was not Kingly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  If we don't act, there will be a war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  I'm half a Kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters... I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats. So enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  As you command, your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Piss on that. Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the King. I get what I want. I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  The hunt?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  The Targaryen girl...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Seven hells, don't start with her again. The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  Khaleesi? Khaleesi!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  You're hurt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Not too fast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  Come on, Dancer.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  When are you gonna tell him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Not now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Blood for blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  Come on!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  You're talking about war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  I'm talking about justice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  You want me to march on Casterly Rock?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  And it's not your duty, because it's not your House. Where's Bran?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  I don't know. It's not my House.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  Robb?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  All alone in the deep, dark woods.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  I'm not alone. My brother is with me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  That's a pretty pin. Silver.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  We'll take the pin and the horse. Get down. Be quick about it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  I can't. The saddle... the straps.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  What's wrong with you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  You some kind of cripple?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  The boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood? Think what Mance would give us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far South as South goes. There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Drop the knife! Let him go and I'll let you live.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  Robb! Robb!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  Shut up. Drop the blade!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  No, don't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 irri  Do it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Are you all right?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bran_stark  Yes. It doesn't hurt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  You don't have the right...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  What about her?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  Give me my life, my Lord, and I'm yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robb_stark  We'll keep her alive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  Dwarf man making noise!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  How would you like to be rich?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  Dwarf man still making noise.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  No gold!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Well, I don't have it here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  No gold. Fuck off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  I don't want to practice today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 syrio_forel  No?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 syrio_forel  You are troubled.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  Yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 syrio_forel  Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  I don't like dolls and k...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 syrio_forel  You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you are with your trouble when fighting happens... More trouble for you. Just so. How can you be quick as a snake... Or as quiet as a shadow... When you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father. That is right. Do you pray to the Gods?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  The old and the new.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 syrio_forel  There is only one God and his name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to DeathGameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 VISERYS_TARGARYEN She has to eat the whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  She's doing well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  She'll never keep it down. Tell me what she's saying.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  "The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of his hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him... And their wives will weep tears of blood." She's going to have a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true Dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  "The stallion who mounts the world." The stallion is the Khal of Khals. He shall unite the people into a single Khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  A Prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  They love her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  She truly is a queen today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  It's not my law.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  They don't belong to you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  Whatever is hers is also mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Once, perhaps.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs... a ship and an army.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  And you have all three.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  I need a large army. I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old... And no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it. How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Who can rule without wealth or fear or love? Oh! You stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be Queen of the savages, and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  You can go. You can't have the eggs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  It means everything to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  And yet here you stand.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  And yet here I stand.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  Noise again!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  About the gold...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  No gold! No gold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Listen to me! Listen to me. Sometimes possession is an abstract concept... When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  Where?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Where? I don't know where, but when they free me...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  You want free? Go be free.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Have you ever heard the phrase "Rich as a Lannister"? Of course you have! You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "A Lannister always pays his debts." If you deliver a message from me... to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 mord  What message?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  You wish to confess your crimes?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Yes my Lady. I do, my Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  The sky cells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your Gods as an honest man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Where do I begin, my Lords and Ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was 10, I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice. When I was 12, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  Silence!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robin_arryn  What happened next?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  What do you think you're doing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Confessing my crimes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 catelyn_stark  Lord Tyrion, You are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord! Take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Is this how justice is done in the Vale? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's justice? I am accused and demand a trial!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  If you're tried and found guilty, then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  I understand the law.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door. You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment. Then you will leave... By one door or the other.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  You have that right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  My Lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your Lord husband, let me avenge his death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  I'll fight for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  It'll be my honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 osha  The honor should be mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robin_arryn  Make the bad man fly!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  Ser Vardis... You're quiet. Don't you want to avenge my husband?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 vardis_egen  With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Agreed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  You demanded a trial by combat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 vardis_egen  I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  I wouldn't be too glad, Ser. I name my brother Jaime Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  The trial will be today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Do I have a volunteer? Anyone? Anyone?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  I think we can assume that no one is willing...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bronn  I'll stand for the dwarf.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lancel_lannister  More wine, your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  What was I saying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  Simpler time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 barristan_selmy  It was, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  The enemy was right in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  It sounds exhilarating.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  Once. I think.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We used to call it "making the eight."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  Those were some lucky girls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  You ever make the eight, Barristan?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 barristan_selmy  I don't believe so, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Those were the days.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  Which days, exactly? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robert_baratheon  Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 renly_baratheon  I suppose it was all rather heroic... If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lancel_lannister  More wine, your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  They burned most everything in the Riverlands - our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women, then they took 'em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  Brigands, most likely.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  They weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King. The King is hunting.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 petyr_baelish  Fish. The Sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, my Lord Hand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  These men, were they flying a Sigil? A banner?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 cersei_lannister  None, your... Hand. The one who was leading them... Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 petyr_baelish  That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 petyr_baelish  I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog. I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection, it would be...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 petyr_baelish  That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our King, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion. You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 beric_dondarrion  As you command.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  My Lord. This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Grand Maester Pycelle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 grand_maester_pycelle  My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to Court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 petyr_baelish  A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robin_arryn  Fight!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  Stand and fight, coward!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Yes!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robin_arryn  Is it over?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 lysa_arryn  You don't fight with honor!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 bronn  No. He did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 robin_arryn  Can I make the little man fly now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 tyrion_lannister  Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine. A Lannister always pays his debts.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  My mother isn't from the North.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  I'm aware of that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  Yes, I have hair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  I've never seen it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  Would you like to?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  No. Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  I come from a very small village in...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Oh, wait. I just realized I don't care.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  Sansa...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Septa.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 septa_mordane  Now you are being rude. My Prince.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  My Prince.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 joffrey_baratheon  My Lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 joffrey_baratheon  You'll be Queen someday. It's only fitting you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  There's nothing to forgive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 joffrey_baratheon  You're my Lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my Lady now, from this day until my last day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Stop! Stop! What are you doing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  Going to King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  In a turnip cart?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  You can afford that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  Some of my friends are more generous than others.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  So I'll have lots of company.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Yes, you'll be very popular. Until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy? Mistress of the Iron Islands?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Don't be a fool.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon. Most of them will never come back. There's nothing left for me here. Let's go, Stefon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  Let me see it one more time!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  See what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 theon_greyjoy  I'm going to miss you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 ros  I know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  What?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Listen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  What about Joffrey?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  What? No!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Please, father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  This isn't a punishment. I want you back for your own safety.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  Can we take Syrio back with us?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen and have his babies.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  Seven hells.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone brave, gentle and strong...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  I don't want someone brave, gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Go on girls, get your Septa and start packing your things.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 arya_stark  Come on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 sansa_stark  But it's not fair!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 eddard_stark  Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair. Axel Baratheon, black of hair. Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair. Steffon Baratheon, black of hair. Robert Baratheon, black of hair. Joffrey Baratheon... Golden-haired.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  Daenerys! Where's my sister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  Stop him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  Where is she? Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  Get your hands off me! No one touches the Dragon! Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  That is no place for a King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 khal_drogo  You are no King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  Keep away from me!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  Viserys! Please.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  There she is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you. Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him. What's he saying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  He says yes. You shall have a golden crown... that men shall tremble to behold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  That was all I wanted. What was promised. No. No! You cannot touch me. I am the Dragon. I'm a dragon! I want my crown!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Look away, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 viserys_targaryen  No, no. Dany, tell them. Make them! Make them... No, you can't! Dany, please!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 khal_drogo  A crown for a King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 jorah_mormont  Khaleesi?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode06 daenerys_targaryen  He was no Dragon. Fire cannot kill a Dragon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"... Uh, "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown." Poor Ned Stark... brave man, terrible judgment.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  Attacking him was stupid. Lannisters don't act like fools. Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Catelyn Stark took my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  Why is he still alive?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Tyrion?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  Ned Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  Why is he still alive?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  It wouldn't have been clean.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  Clean. You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  That's what you want people to think of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  It's the truth.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back ... doesn't it bother you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Of course it bothers me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness. I'm giving you half of our forces ... 30,000 men. You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us. And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  No, it's not an opinion. It's a fact. If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared. Your mother's dead. Before long I'll be dead. And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children. All of us dead; all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on. Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family. Do you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 tywin_lannister  You're blessed with abilities that few men possess. You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms. And you are still blessed with youth. And what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings ... one a madman, the other a drunk. The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years. Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. I need you to become the man you were always meant to be. Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  You're in pain.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I've had worse, My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Perhaps it's time to go home. The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Has he done this before?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Jaime would have killed him. My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Your brother... or your lover?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure. Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  My son saw you with him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Do you love your children?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  With all my heart.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  No more than I love mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  And they are all Jaime's.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Thank the Gods. In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways. In the morning, he doesn't remember.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  You've always hated him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Hated him? I worshipped him. Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath. And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life. Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did ... what little he could do ... and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna." Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth. You must be gone by then ... you and your children. I will not have their blood on my hands. Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can. Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself. Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell. He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up. All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself. Such a sad mistake.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Oh, but it was. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Come here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  Oh yes, oh. Oh yes yes yes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you ... wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  Yes, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman. Well, go ahead. Slowly. You're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are. They know it's all just an act. Your job is to make them forget what they know. That takes time. You need to... ease into it. Go ahead. Ease into it. He's winning you over in spite of yourself. You're starting to like this. He wants to believe you. He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men. He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof. He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  Why don't you join us, My Lord?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  I'm saving myself for another.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  A stupid saying. What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  She must be very beautiful.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  I do believe My Lord's in love.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  For many years. Most of my life really. Play with her ass. And she loved me too. I was her little confidant, her plaything. She could tell me anything, anything at all. She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry. A northerner with a jaw like an anvil. So I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories. The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories. In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me. "He's just a boy," she said. "Please don't hurt him." So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  Is she still married to him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding ... and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen. She loves him, I'm afraid. And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so... good. Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win, not that way. That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them. I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am. And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 ros  And what do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is. Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight. Hmm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that? Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals. Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord... at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer. You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  Where is it you come from?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  The Iron Islands.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  They far away?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  "Trust me, My Lord." You're not living in the wilderness anymore. In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  And what's that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  I will be lord after my father ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  So you're not lord now?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  No, you ... you having a go at me? Is that it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  I'm not a Southerner.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  Impudent. It means rude, disrespectful. Do you want to lose that chain?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 theon_greyjoy  I thought she was our prisoner.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience? Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  I'm used to worse than him. I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  Why did you come here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this. As far South as South goes, before the long night comes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  Why? What are you afraid of?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  Owls and Shadowcats and ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_luwin  The "things" you speak of ... they've been gone for thousands of years.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 osha  They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping. And they ain't sleeping no more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  I miss girls. Not even talking to them. I never talked to them. Just looking at them, hearing them giggle. Don't you miss girls? Riders. The horn. We have to blow the horn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Why is he alone?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for ... there's no rider.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 sandor_clegane  Whoa, boy, whoa.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. Where's my Uncle?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  Ned! It's Robert. We were hunting ... a boar ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 robert_baratheon  I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man. I was never meant to be a father. Go on. You don't want to see this. My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust. It stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it. I paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain. You ask them if I didn't. Ask them! I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw. And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me. Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Robert, my sweet ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 robert_baratheon  Out, all of you!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  You damned fool.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 robert_baratheon  Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say. "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of ... " you know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles. "I hereby command Eddard of House Stark ... " titles, titles ... "to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son Joffrey comes of age." Give it over. Give it to the council after I'm dead. At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing. You'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well. The girl ... Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother... Worthless. No one to tell me "no" but you. Only you. Let her live. Stop it, if it's not too late.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 robert_baratheon  And my son... help him, Ned. Make him better than me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I'll... I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 robert_baratheon  My memory. King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig. Give me something for the pain and let me die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Give him milk of the poppy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 barristan_selmy  He was reeling from the wine. He commanded us to step aside, but... I failed him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  No man could have protected him from himself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 lord_varys  I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 barristan_selmy  His squire, from the king's own skin.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  His squire? The Lannister boy?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 lord_varys  Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment. I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 lord_varys  I'm afraid those birds have flown. The girl is likely dead already.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  ...Throne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 khal_drogo  Throne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  Can't you help me make him understand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. Have I said something funny, Ser?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right. He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  And because he had dragons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  You don't believe it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report. As for the rest... It was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened? Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  Well, I'll come with you.\
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Psst, Jorah the Andal. The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations. A royal pardon ... you can go home now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine. Just a taste.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  My Lady, you are from Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 doreah  You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  Princess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  That? Dornish swill. Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor ... nectar of the Gods. Let me give you a cask. Uh ... a gift.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  You honor me, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  The honor ... the honor is all mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 rakharo  Huh-uh, huh-uh.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  There are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  I hope to repay your kindness someday.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Rakharo.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  Is something wrong?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  I have a thirst. Open it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Open it. Pour.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  Do as he says.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  As the princess commands. Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord. Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  You first.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 wine_merchant  Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage. Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  You will drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 irri  Khaleesi!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 doreah  Stop him!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  Come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves. You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor. You came to us rich and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all. It does not matter. All that is in the past. Here, on the wall, are all one house. Tonight...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  You're allowed to look happy. You're going to be a Ranger. Isn't that what you always wanted?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  I want to find my Uncle. I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger. It's the steward's life for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  There's honor in being a steward.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  Not much, really. But there's food.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  Here you begin anew. A man of The Night's Watch... lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house; not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love; but for the realm and all the people in it. You've all learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them. The penalty for desertion is death. You can take your vows here tonight at sunset. Do any of you still keep the old Gods?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  I do, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Yes, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  My Lord, might I go as well?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  No, My Lord. I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 alliser_thorne  Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  The Night's Watch is my house now. The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old Gods will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jeor_mormont  As you wish, lad. You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths. Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders. Grenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers. Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers. Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders. Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers. Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the Rangers. May all the Gods preserve you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaremy_rykker  Rangers with me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  Builders!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_aemon  Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library. Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens. Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables. Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch. Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_aemon  Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  Do you take me for a servant?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_aemon  We took you for a man of The Night's Watch. But perhaps we were wrong in that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  May I go?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 maester_aemon  As you wish.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. He wanted it and he got it. Stewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! It's not fair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 pypar  Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock. I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver. So now I'm here ... at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you. I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again. So don't tell me about fair.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 pypar  You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song. Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch. You'll be with him day and night. Yes, you'll clean his clothes. But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself. He wants to groom you for command.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  I just... I always wanted to be a Ranger.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  I always wanted to be a Wizard. What? No, I'm serious. So you'll stay and say your words with me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  Lord Stark, a moment. Alone if you will. He named you Protector of the Realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  He did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  She won't care. Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  And what should I do with a hundred swords?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps. We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody. Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom. Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  What about Stannis?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis? You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Stannis is your older brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  This isn't about the bloody line of succession. That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now. What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is. He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice. He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 renly_baratheon  Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert. Tell me something - Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  You will sail to Dragonstone tonight. You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife. Only Stannis himself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Yes, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Now leave us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  My Lord protector.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  The King has no trueborn sons. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  So when the King dies ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  So it would seem. Unless ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  There is no "unless". He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  And he cannot take the throne without your help. You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Do you have a shred of honor?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it. Make peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey. We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis. And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  We?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you ... my price would be modest.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  What you suggest is treason.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  Only if we lose.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Make peace with the Lannisters, you say... with the people who tried to murder my boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  We only make peace with our enemies, My Lord. That's why it's called "making peace."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  No. I won't do it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  So it will be Stannis and war?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  There is no other choice. He is the heir.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  You promised Catelyn you would help me. The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms ... enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks. The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  Look at you. You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat. When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect? Who do they follow? The man who pays them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  Hear my words and bear witness to my vow. Night gathers and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 sandor_clegane  You knelt as boys. Rise now as men of The Night's Watch. Well done. Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  What's he got there?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jon_snow  To me, ghost. Bring it here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 samwell_tarly  Gods be good!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  What will they do to him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  And when he falls?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  I saw a man last nine miles once.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  King Robert still wants me dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  I thought he'd leave me alone ... now that my brother is gone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  He will never leave you alone. If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you. If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him. He will never abandon the hunt. You're a Targaryen ... the last Targaryen. Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 daenerys_targaryen  He will not have my son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jorah_mormont  He will not have you either, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Lord Stark!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  No, all right. It's all right. Let him through.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  King Joffrey?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 jaime_lannister  King Robert is gone. The Gods give him rest.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 lord_varys  He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers. Last seen galloping South in some haste.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 janos_slynt  We stand behind you, Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 royal_steward  All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 joffrey_baratheon  I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation. I wish to be crowned within the fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 barristan_selmy  King Robert's seal ... unbroken. "Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan? Protector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 barristan_selmy  Those were the King's words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  We have a new King now. Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord. Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son ... and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Your son has no claim to the throne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 joffrey_baratheon  Liar!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Ser Barristan, seize this traitor. Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 cersei_lannister  You think he stands alone?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 joffrey_baratheon  Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  Commander, take the Queen and her children into custody. Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 janos_slynt  Men of the Watch!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 eddard_stark  I want no bloodshed. Tell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 janos_slynt  Now!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode07 petyr_baelish  I did warn you not to trust me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Yah! Left high, left low. Right low, lunge right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  You break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 septa_mordane  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today. How she could forget ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning. She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 septa_mordane  Hush! Go back to your room. Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  What is it? What's happening?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 septa_mordane  Do as I told you. Run!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  This way! Left, right. Rah! Now you are dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  You said right, but you went left.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  And now you are a dead girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Only 'cause you lied.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  My tongue lied. My eyes shouted the truth. You were not seeing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  I was so. I watched, but you ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Watching is not seeing, dead girl. The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Arya Stark, come with us. Your father wants to see you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Mind your place, dancing master. This is no concern of yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  My father wouldn't send you. And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Take her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 hodor  Get out of my way, little man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  I am Syrio Forel...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 hodor  Foreign bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  ...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day. Run to your father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Bloody oafs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Be gone now, Arya.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Come with me. Run.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  The first sword of Braavos does not run. What do we say to the God of death?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Not today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 syrio_forel  Go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Not today. Not today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Stay away from me. I'll tell my father. I'll ... I'll tell the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  Who do you think sent me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Needle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  There she is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  She'll reward me ... the Queen!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 arya_stark  Stay away!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  Varys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  I promise you it isn't poisoned. Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord. I would save the rest, if I were you. Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  What about my daughters?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  The younger one seems to have escaped the castle. Even my little birds cannot find her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  And Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  Still engaged to Joffrey. Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though ... all dead, it grieves me to say. I do so hate the sight of blood.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  And would again, My Lord. I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords. When you look at me do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King. I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  The wrong brother sadly. And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  Not today, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 eddard_stark  Tell me something, Varys. Who do you truly serve?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  The Realm, My Lord. Someone must.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  It's Othor, without a doubt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  The smell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  What smell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  There is none. If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  We should burn them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them. The Wildling way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  I want Maester Aemon to examine them first. You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid. Get them inside.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  You heard him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers ... a raven from King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sandor_clegane  Come on, move 'em out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself. The King is dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Is there any word of my father?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  Sit. Lord Stark has been charged with treason. They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey. I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid. Your duty lies here now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  My sisters were in King's Landing too.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake. Send for my father. He'll tell you ... the King was his friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that. Yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King. She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see. I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 petyr_baelish  The girl is innocent, Your Grace. She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Robb.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt. Best it comes from you. If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace. Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  If ... if I could see my father, talk to him about ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  You disappoint me, child. We have told you of your father's treason. Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  I only meant that ... what will happen to him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  That depends.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  On ... on what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  On your brother. And on you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Treason? Sansa wrote this?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 maester_luwin  It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words. You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 maester_luwin  This is a royal command, My Lord. If you should refuse to obey ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing. But not alone. Call the banners.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 maester_luwin  All of them, My Lord?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 maester_luwin  They have.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Now we see what their words are worth.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 maester_luwin  Yeah.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  Are you afraid?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  I must be.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  Good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Why is that good?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  It means you're not stupid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  You've had this since dawn?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  He sent it to me, not you. I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner. My son intends to declare war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  A war? Your son against the Lannisters? You should go to him. Teach him patience.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law! Does family mean nothing to you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  Family means everything to me. And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robin_arryn  I'm hungry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  Hush now, darling. You just ate.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robin_arryn  But I'm hungry!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  Soon, love, soon. You're always welcome here, sister. But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  That is what I ask.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  If you fear for the safety of your son ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  Of course I fear for the safety of my son! Are you an idiot? They killed my husband. You say they shoved your boy from a window. These people will do anything.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  And that is why we have to stop them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lysa_arryn  The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  I should just take your food and leave you here. Eh? What would you do then?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Starve, most likely.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  You don't think I'd do it, do you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women? Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer. But you knew that. That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  Fair enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Though I would treasure your friendship, I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder. And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this - Whatever their price, I'll beat it. I like living.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Come, share our fire. Help yourselves to our goat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  Take the half man. He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  No no no no no! My ... my House is rich and powerful. If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  We have no use for a half man's promises.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by? Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back. Lannister smiths shit better steel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns. But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets. I will give you this.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  What is "this"?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  The Vale of Arryn. The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes. The Lords of the Vale want me dead. I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 alliser_thorne  Now there's a rare sight ... not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 alliser_thorne  Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there? Commander? Stay. Hello? Who's there? Lord Commander?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jeor_mormont  Snow?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Commander! Move move!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  What did they do? I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jorah_mormont  Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  Jorah, make them stop.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jorah_mormont  Khaleesi?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  You heard me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jorah_mormont  These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards. Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jorah_mormont  Come. What do you want done with them?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  Bring her to me. And those women there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jorah_mormont  You cannot claim them all, Princess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  I can, and I will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 mirri_maz_duur  Thank you, silver lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 daenerys_targaryen  Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 mirri_maz_duur  I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the Godswife of this Temple. My mother was Godswife here before me. She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments. All men are of one flock, so my people believe. The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his ... lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy. I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover. I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber. And when I am done with the Lannisters I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Oathbreaker, is it?! I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord. But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Your meat... is bloody tough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  What is it? What's happened?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Shh, it's all right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  Where are you going?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  South. For father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  But it's the middle of the night.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  The Lannisters have spies everywhere. I don't want them to know we're coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  They have more men than we do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Aye, they do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding. And I won't get in the way, I ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  There must always be a Stark at Winterfell. Until I return that will be you. You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand? Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  I will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared. Until I return.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  How long have you been hiding out there? Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rickon_stark  They've all gone away.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  They'll be back soon. Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rickon_stark  No, they won't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  Please watch over Robb. And watch over all the other men from Winterfell. And Theon too, I suppose.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  What are you doing here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  They're my Gods too. Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods. Even slaves are allowed to pray.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  You're not a slave. Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  You asked them, they're answering you. Shh. Open your ears.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  It's only the wind.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods? They see you, boy. They hear you. Your brother will get no help from them where he's going. The Old Gods have no power in the South. The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago. How can they watch when they have no eyes? Well, there's a big man. He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  Go back and find your clothes, Hodor. Go dress.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 hodor  Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bran_stark  Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 osha  Giants and worse than giants. I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way. All these swords, they should be going North, boy. North, not south! The cold winds are rising.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  They were touched by White Walkers. That's why they came back. That's why their eyes turned blue. Only fire will stop them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  How do you know that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  I read about it in a book ... a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  What else did the book say?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years. And when they wake up ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 pypar  And when they wake up, what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 samwell_tarly  I hope The Wall is high enough.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rodrik_cassel  Summer snows, My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  Robb's brought the North with him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels. And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South. Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts 10 times as large.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Mother!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  You look well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  I had not thought to be here. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Have no fear, My Lady. We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned. You old devil, Rodrik.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rodrik_cassel  Jon.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  You're not wasting away, are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling. And now I find you leading a host to war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  There was no one else.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  No one? Who were those men I saw here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  None of them are Starks.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  All of them are seasoned in battle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  If you think you can send me back to Winterfell ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  Oh, would that I could.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  There was... a letter. From Sansa.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  From the Queen, you mean. There's no mention of Arya.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  How many men do you have?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  You would never be allowed to leave. No. Our best hope ... our only hope ... is that you can defeat them in the field.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  And if I lose?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  They were butchered in their sleep.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder. If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Well, that makes it simple then.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  I suppose it does.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me. If the half man betrays us, Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  And feed it to the goats, yes. All right then. Time to meet my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  Tyrion.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Uncle. Father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Sorry to disappoint you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  And who are these... companions of yours?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows. Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men. This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears. And here we have Bronn son of...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 bronn  You wouldn't know him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West? Kind of you to go to war for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake. Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  We have our differences, Jaime and I. He's braver. I'm better looking.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  He's been covering himself in glory.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  ... Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  My sister rules, you mean.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  Stark's son has called his banners. He moves south with a strong host.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  A green boy. One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tyrion_lannister  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence. You'd like him. While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts. We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lannister_scout  If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws. So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly. And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  At once, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 tywin_lannister  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors. Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 shagga  Only if the half man fights with us. Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rodrik_cassel  The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north. We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun. Do that and the River Lords will join us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  Lord Frey controls that bridge. Your father's bannerman.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  "The late Lord Frey" my father calls him. At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done. Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 theon_greyjoy  Robb's right. We need that bridge.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  So what's it going to be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  Your pardon, my lords. We've captured a Lannister scout.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Don't worry, lad. He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Where did you find him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 stark_guard  In the brush above the encampment. He looked to be counting.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  How high did you get?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lannister_scout  20,000. Maybe more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 rodrik_cassel  You don't have to do this yourself. Your father would understand ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it. And he understands honor... and courage. Let him go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 catelyn_stark  Robb.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him. 20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lannister_scout  Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 jon_snow  Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 robb_stark  You call me boy again. Go on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Ser Aron.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  ... Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Lord Gyles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  ... And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time. In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King. Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Ser Barristan Selmy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  Your Grace, I am yours to command.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Rise, Ser Barristan. You may remove your helm. You have served the Realm long and faithfully. Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks. But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword. It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood. Our vows are taken for life. Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  You let my father die. You're too old to protect anybody.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  Your Grace ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Careful, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser. You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  A hall to die in and men to bury me. I am a Knight. I shall die a Knight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 petyr_baelish  A naked Knight, apparently.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 barristan_selmy  Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake! Here, boy! Melt it down and add it to the others.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  Come forward, My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 kevan_lannister  The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 cersei_lannister  Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  I do. As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  Treason is a noxious weed. It should be torn out, root ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  Let her speak. I want to hear what she says.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  Thank you, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 petyr_baelish  Do you deny your father's crime?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  No, My Lords. I know he must be punished. All I ask is mercy. I know My Lord father must regret what he did. He was King Robert's friend and he loved him. You all know he loved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him. They must have lied to him ... Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody. They must have lied!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  He was badly hurt. Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy. He wasn't himself. Otherwise he never would have said it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 lord_varys  A child's faith... Such sweet innocence. And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 grand_maester_pycelle  Treason is treason!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  Anything else?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 joffrey_baratheon  Your sweet words have moved me. But your father has to confess. He has to confess and say that I'm the King... Or there'll be no mercy for him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode08 sansa_stark  He will.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  You've seen better days, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Another visit? It seems you're my last friend.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  No no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  On her knees, begging for me, hmmm. Did you laugh with the others?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  You do me wrong, My Lord. Your blood is the last thing I want.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  I don't know what you want. I've given up trying to guess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  When I was still a boy ... before they cut my balls off with a hot knife ... I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. I am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. I'm a good actor, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  I could. But will I? No. As I said, I'm no hero.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories ... tell me, what do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad ... fighting for his father's freedom.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Robb? He's just a boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the King's ... the late King's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne, he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The Throne is his by rights.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life, it would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  I want you to serve the realm! Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. If you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... Of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learned it well. But I grew up with soldiers. I learned how to die a long time ago.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, My Lord? Is that a precious thing to you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rodrik_cassel  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Have my horse saddled and ready.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  I agree. I'll go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  You can't!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. He would never harm me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Unless there was a profit in it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Oh spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am I supposed to do with you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead to you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Father, please ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly. All right, you come forward. There. Now that I've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Is there somewhere we can talk?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you! You too. You see that? 15 she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  I'm sure she will give you many sons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  He is quite ill, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Didn't come to the last one either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  My Lord, I ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  I'm sure there were reasons why ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  To ask you to open your gates, My Lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Why should I let him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  You swore an oath to my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Oh yes, I said some words... And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right. Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish, I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Why don't you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 walder_frey  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon, give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  And... engage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Soon, he says.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  Good. You'll be ready for this then. I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear... So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  This is Valyrian steel.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  It was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. It was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  My Lord, you honor me, but I can't ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  Oh, you can and you will. I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me... So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it. Is that understood?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Yes, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  Right. Now don't think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword, it'll take a man to wield it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jeor_mormont  No you won't! I sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist ... I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this... Boy King. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Yes, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rast  Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rast  Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rast  You earned that, Snow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rast  Well done.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 pypar  Go on, let's have a look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  At what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 grenn  The sword! Show us the sword.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 petyr_baelish  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Let's have a look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Piss off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Get off of it. Piss off.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Give it here!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  What is it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Look at its eyes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Give it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 samwell_tarly  I ... I can't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  You can't what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 samwell_tarly  I ... I'm really not supposed to say.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that...?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 samwell_tarly  There was a raven. I read the message to Maester Aemon. It's your brother Robb.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  What? What about him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 samwell_tarly  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  I should be there. I should be with him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  ...If we do that, they'll never get back across.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Well? What did he say?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours as well ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Huh.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  ... Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  And what does he want in return?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Fine fine. And?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  She won't be happy about that. And?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  And when the fighting is done... You will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  I see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  I did.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  And?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  One was... Do you consent?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Can I refuse?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Not if you want to cross.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Then I consent.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Sam said you wanted to see me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  I did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of The Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  He would do whatever was right. No matter what.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Sam told you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  And this is my day? Is that what you're saying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes. I know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  You do not know! No one knows. I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till I was old. What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South ... the ruin of my House, the death of my family? I was helpless, blind, frail. But when I heard they had killed my brother's son, and his poor son... And the children! Even the little children.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when I had refused the Throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  You're Aemon Targaryen.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 maester_aemon  I'm a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch. I will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days. As I have.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kevan_lannister  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Ah. Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kevan_lannister  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes ... heavy black steel, double-sided.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Shagga likes axes.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kevan_lannister  They do seem rather ferocious.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Ferocious? Last night a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  It appears I'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, My Lords.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  I took her.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Took her? From whom?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  From, uh... Ser ... what's his name? I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  He said something.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Oh well. I... think I'll go and find myself one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Who are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Who would you like me to be?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  What did your mother call you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Shae. What did your mother call you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  My mother died giving birth to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  What sort of accent is that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Foreign.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  For ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  What do you want from me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  What do I want from you? I want you to share my tent. I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world ... which it may well be.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  And what do I get?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Who told you this? Women you paid?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And three - More gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Let's start with your last night in this world.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  He can't. He can't. I won't let him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  Even a Queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  I won't leave him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  He's already gone, Khaleesi.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Even if ... even if he dies, why would I run? I am Khaleesi and my ... my son will be Khal after Drogo.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  This isn't Westeros where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  I won't leave him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  The wound has festered.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  I think you're right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  You've saved me once more.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  And now you must save him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  He's beyond the healer's skills. All I can do is ease his path.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Save him and I will free you. I swear it. You must know a way... Some... Some magic.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Do it. Save him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  There is a price.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  You'll have gold ... whatever you want.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Only death pays for life. My death?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  No. Not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rakharo  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Kill her and you kill your Khal.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rakharo  This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  Go now!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  Take her and leave. Take her!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rakharo  Irriya?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 mirri_maz_duur  You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  No one will enter. Bring him back to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  What have you done?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  I have to save him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 irri  Khaleesi!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  Are you hurt?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 daenerys_targaryen  The baby... is coming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  Fetch the midwives.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rakharo  They will not come. They say she is cursed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jorah_mormont  They'll come or I'll have their heads.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rakharo  The witch ... she can bring baby. I hear her say so.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Are you in agony, my lion?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Ahhh. Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Just used to it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Let's play a new game.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Not if you win.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  No! No more fire games, no knife games. Let's do something I'm good at.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  What are you good at?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  I happen to be a great judge of character.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  This sounds like a boring game.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  It's not. Here's how it works - I make a statement about your past. If I'm right, you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink. And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  I don't want to play this game.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  But my mother hit harder.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  You killed your first man before you were 12.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  It was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  You've been North of the Wall.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  What brought you up there?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Work.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And... you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  I don't want to play.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  It's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And we've established the rules about lying?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Drink!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Mmmm. You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  So specifics ... you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you. So what's a lowborn girl to do?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Drink.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Are you sure ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever or I will carve your eyes from your head.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  My turn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Fine fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Who were you in love with?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  That's not how the game works. I don't care the way the game works.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Our Lord here used to be married.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Married?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  How did you hear that?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Another night, perhaps. Not another night. This night. It's not a pleasant story.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  Or maybe I will cry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  So... I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry ... together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. I forgot how afraid I was around girls, how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother. I forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow I found myself in her bed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  For three chickens, I should hope so.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon and there you have it ... man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up and told my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  I imagine that was the end of all that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing, the road, the rapers ... all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well ... a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  I would have killed the man who did that to me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  You should have known she was a whore.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Really? I was 16, drunk and in love ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  As I said, I was young and stupid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  You are still young and stupid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  What is it? What do you want?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  You're sleeping through the war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  What?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Get my squire!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  You don't have a squire.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  If I die, weep for me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 shae  You'll be dead. How will you know?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  I'll know.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Watch out! Move!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Out of the way!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 lord_varys  Move aside!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Stay low.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Stay low?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  If you're lucky, no one will notice you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  I was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon brothers!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  And painted dogs!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And painted dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward to claim what is yours! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! To battle.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  You're a shit warrior.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  I'm alive?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  You're alive.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Did we win?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  How did our tribesmen do?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 bronn  Yeah, good.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  It's nice to see them getting along.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  You're wounded.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Good of you to notice. I hear we won.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  Hmph. The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  He wasn't here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  Where was he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tywin_lannister  With his other 18,000 men.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 tyrion_lannister  And where are they?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rodrik_cassel  We should go, My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  No!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 rodrik_cassel  My Lady!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jaime_lannister  Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  It's not your sword I want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jaime_lannister  I've lost them too, I'm afraid.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down 10 of our men ... you saw him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  He's more use to us alive than dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 catelyn_stark  Take him away and put him in irons.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jaime_lannister  We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails ... choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Come on, pretty man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 theon_greyjoy  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 robb_stark  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  Could I have one? A lemon one ... or any of them.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kings_landing_baker  Three coppers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  How about a nice fat pigeon?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kings_landing_baker  Piss off now. Go on.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 kings_landing_baker  Piss off!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  Who?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  The Hand of the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Traitor! Coward!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Baelor. Baelor!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Traitor! Traitor!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son... And seize the Throne for myself.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Traitor!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 eddard_stark  Let the high Septon and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say - Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the Grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 grand_maester_pycelle  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 joffrey_baratheon  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 cersei_lannister  No! Stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 sansa_stark  Daddy! Someone stop him!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 cersei_lannister  My son, this is madness.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 janos_slynt  Put him down!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 yoren  Don't look!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 arya_stark  Let me go. Let me go!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 yoren  Shut your mouth. Look at me. Look at me!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 sansa_stark  Stop! Daddy! Stop! No no!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 jon_snow  Traitor!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode09 sansa_stark  Stop! Stop him, stop!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 yoren  Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut. Keep your mouth shut, boy.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 arya_stark  I'm not a boy!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 yoren  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  It had three eyes. It told me to come with him, so I did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 osha  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  You're afraid ... just like Hodor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 osha  I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go. That's my grandfather Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where I saw father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 osha  You see? He's not here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 rickon_stark  Here, Shaggydog.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  Rickon!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 osha  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 rickon_stark  He doesn't like chains.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 rickon_stark  No, I came to see father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  How many times have I told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 rickon_stark  He was down here. I saw him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 bran_stark  Saw him when?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 rickon_stark  Last night, when I was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 osha  You both miss him. It's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 maester_luwin  Bran...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  My Lady.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  Robb. Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword. Shh shh. Shh.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 robb_stark  I'll kill them all ... every one of them. I will kill them all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  the boar's great tusks, they boded ill; for good King Robert's health; and the beast was every bit as fat; as Robert was himself; but our brave King cried, "Do your worst! I'll have your ugly head!; you're nowhere near as murd'rous as; the lion in my bed"; King Robert lost his battle and; he failed his final test; the lion ripped his balls off; and; the boar did all the rest.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Very amusing. Isn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  I'm so sorry, Your Grace. I'll never sing it again, I swear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Tell me, which do you favor - Your fingers or your tongue?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  Your Grace?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Fingers or your tongue? If you got to keep one, which would it be?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  I ... I ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  or I could just cut your throat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Good. Tongue it is.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  Your Grace, please. I won't sing ... Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Ser Ilyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  I beg you! Please no. No! Your Grace, please. I beg you, I will never sing again!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  I'm done for the day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  No-oooo!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, mother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 marillion  Your Grace, please!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  You look quite nice.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  Thank you, My Lord.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  "Your Grace." I'm King now. Walk with me. I want to show you something.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sandor_clegane  Do as you're bid, child.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  ...And as soon as you've had your blood, I'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long. This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  You promised to be merciful.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  I was. I gave him a clean death. Look at him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  Please let me go home. I won't do any treason, I swear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Mother says I'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here and obey. Look at him! Well?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  How long do I have to look?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  If it please Your Grace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  That's your Septa there. I'll tell you what - I'm going to give you a present. After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, I'm going to give you his head as well.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sansa_stark  Or maybe he'll give me yours.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  My mother tells me a King should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sandor_clegane  Here, girl.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? I'll look for you in court.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 sandor_clegane  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants. You'll be needing that again.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  The proper course is clear - Pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 robb_stark  Renly is not the King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, My Lord. He put your father to death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 robb_stark  That doesn't make Renly King. He's Robert's youngest brother. If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be King before Stannis.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  Renly is not right!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  My Lords. My Lords! Here is what I say to these two Kings ... Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their Gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? It was the Dragons we bowed to and now the Dragons are dead! There sits the only King I mean to bend my knee to ... the King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  I'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their Iron Chair too. The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 theon_greyjoy  Am I your brother, now and always?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 robb_stark  Now and always.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 theon_greyjoy  My sword is yours, in victory and defeat from this day until my last day.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hodor  Lady Stark.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  I want to see him. Now! Leave us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. Is that why you came? I'm not at my best, but I think I could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to it. Oh, I do like a violent woman.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  I will kill you tonight, Ser, pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  Let me show you how ... hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look ... it shouldn't take long.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  But I don't, My Lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  Because you are going to the deepest of the Seven Hells, if the Gods are just.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  What Gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? If your Gods are real and if they are just, why is the world so full of injustice?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  Because of men like you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  There are no men like me. Only me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  I pushed him out the window.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  I hoped the fall would kill him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 catelyn_stark  Why?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jaime_lannister  You should get some sleep. It's going to be a long war.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lancel_lannister  I can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 cersei_lannister  Stop talking. Get back into bed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tywin_lannister  They have my son.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lannister_guard  I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lannister_guard  Is it true about Stannis and Renly?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 kevan_lannister  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered... It's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when h decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning... in case you hadn't noticed.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 kevan_lannister  I'm told we still have his sisters.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lannister_guard  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lannister_guard  No truces. We can't afford to look weak. We should march on them at once.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 kevan_lannister  First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tywin_lannister  They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now... Madness ... madness and stupidity. I always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps I was wrong.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  Half wrong. I'm new to strategy, but ... unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tywin_lannister  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  And do what?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tywin_lannister  Rule! You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy King to heel and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest - Baelish, Varys, Pycelle ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my Uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tywin_lannister  You're my son. Oh, one more thing - You will not take the whore to court. Do you understand?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Ser Jorah?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  Gently gently.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  My son... Where is he? I want him. Where is he?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  The boy did not live.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Tell me.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  What is there to tell?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  How did my son die?!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  He never lived, My Princess. The women say...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  What do the women say?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  They say the child was ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  Monstrous, twisted. I pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When I touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. I warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what I bought with my son's life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  As you command, lady. Come. I will take you to him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  Time enough for that later ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  I want to see him now. The Khalasar is gone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. I'm sorry, My Princess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Drogo! Why is he out here alone?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  This is not life. When will he be as he was?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Leave us.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  I don't want you alone with this sorceress.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  I have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  You knew what I was buying and you knew the price. It was wrong of them to burn my temple. It angered the Great Shepherd.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  Innocent? He would have been the stallion who mounts the world. Now he will burn no cities. Now his Khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  I spoke for you. I saved you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. I saw my God's house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting. In the streets I saw piles of heads ... the head of the Baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Your life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  Hmph. Why don't you take a look at your Khal... Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  You can't!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Get out of my way, Sam.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Better than you do.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  What are you going to do?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  I'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  You can't leave us now. We need you here.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Move.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  I won't let you go.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Move.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  Hand of the King?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  So it would seem.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  He knew my name?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  What?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  I believe he used the word "whore."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that I'm dancing around the court with my tits out? I'm funny now? I'm Shae the funny whore.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 tyrion_lannister  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 shae  I know what a Hand needs.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Ghost?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grenn  Samwell!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 pypar  Is he dead?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grenn  No, he's not dead.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  Did we get him?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grenn  Come on, help me get him up.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 pypar  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  I belong with my brother.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  But we're your brothers now.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 pypar  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 pypar  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grenn  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  I have to.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grenn  You can't. You said the words.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  I don't care about ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  To hell with all of you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 pypar  "Night gathers and now my Watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall live and die at my post."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 samwell_tarly  "I am the sword in the darkness... The Watcher on the Walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east... Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grand_maester_pycelle  Kings? Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about Kings. The thing you need to understand about Kings is... For the past 67 years, I've known ... truly known more Kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them. Yes. And keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen... of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man, such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood... Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal ... powerful man, a great warrior ... but alas, winning a Kingdom and ruling a Kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now I serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign. He is a capable young man ... strong military mind. Stern... But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. It's far too soon to know what manner of King he will be, but I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. True greatness.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 ros  So what's the thing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grand_maester_pycelle  What thing?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 ros  About Kings. You said, "the thing you need to understand about Kings..."
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grand_maester_pycelle  What? Things? What?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 ros  When you started, you ... never mind.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grand_maester_pycelle  Let me see you out, my dear.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 ros  It's all right. No need.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 grand_maester_pycelle  Yes yes. Till the next time. Right.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  A man with great ambition and no morals ... I wouldn't bet against you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  Oh, you can do better than that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? I've always wondered.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  I picture a gash like a woman's. Is that about right?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  Must be strange for you, even after all these years ... a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all ...
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  Am I? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  But you carry on, whispering in one King's ear and then the next. I admire you.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  And I admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor house with a major talent for befriending powerful men ... and women.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  So here we stand... In mutual admiration and respect.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  Playing our roles.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  Serving a new King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  Long may he reign.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lord_varys  My King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 petyr_baelish  My King.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 joffrey_baratheon  My Lords. Shall we begin?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 yoren  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions 'cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 arya_stark  Arry.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 yoren  Ah. We have a long way to travel and in bad company. I have 20 this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your Lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons and I didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot, half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself ... and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay ... or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  Watch yourself, midget.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lommy_greenhands  He's got a sword, this one.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lommy_greenhands  Maybe he's a little squire.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. I bet he stole that sword.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lommy_greenhands  Let's have a look.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  I could use me a sword like that.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lommy_greenhands  Well, take it off him.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  Give it here, midget.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 lommy_greenhands  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. I've seen him kick a boy to death.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 hot_pie  I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him until he was dead. I kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 arya_stark  You want it? I'll give it to you. I already killed one fat boy. I bet you never killed anyone. I bet you're a liar. But I'm not. I'm good at killing fat boys. I like killing fat boys.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 gendry  Oh, you like picking on the little ones, do you? You know, I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When I hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when I hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 arya_stark  It was a gift.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 gendry  It don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen ... murderers.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 arya_stark  Which are you?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 gendry  Armorer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here I am.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 yoren  Come on, you sorry sons of whores! It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall and winter is coming!
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring? Don't look so terrified. If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  My friends brought me back.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  I didn't say it was your honor.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  They killed my father.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  And you're going to bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the Gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  No.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  Good. Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jon_snow  Beyond the Wall?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jeor_mormont  I'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. I mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. I will command them myself. So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  They were not given to me to sell.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  Khaleesi, My Queen, I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  I must. You don't understand ... don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  I won't watch you burn.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  Is that what you fear? You will be my Khalasar. I see the faces of slaves. I free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me. I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of Old Valyria. I am the Dragon's daughter. And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 mirri_maz_duur  You will not hear me scream.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 daenerys_targaryen  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
GameOfThrones.Season01.Episode10 jorah_mormont  Blood of my blood.
