Jon melts down pointing out that every time the Wildlings have attacked through the centuries they have failed, she doesn't care saying this time will be different because Mance Rayder is different. He says that the better equipped and trained armies of the cities will kill "all of you." She corrects him saying "all of us," now that they have pledged themselves to each other.

He left her and returned as a White Walker and she was forced to kill him. Bran thinks maybe he was pushed off the tower for a reason and that the gods have plans for him and that if JoJen and his raven visions say he should reunite with Jon Snow, maybe that's what they should do.
A little ways into their ride on a break the maester looks at Jaime's stump, salves and bandages it. Jaime learns that he was stripped of his maester chain because he's a curious doctor. He said that the only way to figure out illnesses is to look at them and Jaime deduces correctly that he performed experiments on living men, dying paupers. The maester points out that Jaime has killed a countless number of people and wonders how many he's saved. Jaime says half a million: the population of King's Landing.
The maester tells him that Bolton turned down an offer of gold from Brienne's father. Because of Jaime's lie that Brienne's father presided over untold sapphire mines, Locke thought that he was cheaping out and will likely not value her enough to leave her unspoiled. Alarmed by what this means Jaime insists that they go back.
When they return Brienne is in a pit, fighting off a bear with a wooden sword for the amusement of Locke and the rest of Bolton's men. Jaime jumps in the pit with her knowing it wlll force them to save her since they swore to Bolton they would get him back to Tywin Lannister. They are both pulled up and out of the pit in the nick of time and Jaime informs Locke he will be taking Brienne with him.
