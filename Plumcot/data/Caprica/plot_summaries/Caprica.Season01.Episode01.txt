Caprica, 58 years before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies. Two families, the Graystones and the Adamas, are bound by a tragedy with unforeseen consequences, including the development of the Cylons.
Some 58 years before the events in Battle Star Galactica, a series of events bring two families together that will have an indelible impact on human-kind. Daniel Graystone is a successful entrepreneur having introduced major advances in technology, most notably the holopad that allows users to immerse themselves in a holographic world of their own designs. Joseph Adama is a Tauron refugee who has successfully established himself on Caprica and is a lawyer for the Tauron gangster community that paid for his legal training. Unbeknown to Graystone, his daughter Zoe has become a member of an organization that has monotheistic religious beliefs but is regarded as a terrorist organization by some, including the government. When Zoe and a friend are killed in an explosion set off by Zoe's boyfriend Dan, Adama's wife and daughter are also killed. As Daniel explores his daughter's personal holographic world, he finds that she has created an avatar of herself that is so realistic, he tries to download her image into a cybernetic being he is developing for the government.
