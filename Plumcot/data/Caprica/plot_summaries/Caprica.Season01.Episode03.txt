The Graystones begin to pay a heavy price for Amanda's public declaration that Zoe was a terrorist who was involved in blowing up the train. She resigns her position at the hospital and is stalked by paparazzi. The company's stock is dropping like a lead balloon and Daniel refuses to launch a publicity campaign to try and set things right. He also has to deal with Joseph Adama who insists that he find a way for him to visit with his avatar daughter. Joseph's brother Sam adds a little muscle to be persuasive. Meanwhile, Zoe's avatar has found a way to re-enter the holopad world.
