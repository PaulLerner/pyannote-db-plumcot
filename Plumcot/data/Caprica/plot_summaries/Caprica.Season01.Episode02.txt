Daniel Graystone believes his attempt to download Zoe's avatar into a cybernetic being has failed but is pleased when the soldier-cyborgs he is developing for the government finally seems to be working. He does not realize that Zoe's persona remains and is the edge that is finally making his latest invention work. Avatar Zoe is soon in touch with her close friend Lacy Rand and together they try to make sense of what has happened to her. Zoe's mother Amanda, still overwrought by their loss, attends a public memorial service for the victims of the explosion but realizing just how little she knew about her daughter, makes a startling public announcement. Joseph Adama is trying to keep his son William on the straight and narrow and desperately wants to visit his avatar daughter. In the final test of his new cyborg-soldier, Daniel Graystone wins praise from government officials for his new cybernetic life-form node, which he calls Cylons for short.
