Daniel Graystone gives in to the demands of his company's public relations experts and decides to go on talk show to talk about what Zoe has done and atone somewhat for any responsibility he wears for the terrorist attack. The decision to do so doesn't sit well with wife Amanda who now feels she misspoke and that they shouldn't blame Zoe for what has happened. The public appearance doesn't start well but Daniel gets help from an unexpected source. The police continue to investigate the crime and manage to get a warrant to search Zoe's and other's lockers at her school. The agent also get a warrant to search the Graystones' house but find nothing there either. Joseph Adama meanwhile pursues his revenge and sends his brother Sam to balance the score before he has second thoughts.
