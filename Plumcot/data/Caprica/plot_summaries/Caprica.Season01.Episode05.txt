Tamara Adama is still trying to make sense of her "life" in her new world. She doesn't understand where she is or why she's there. She does begin to realize that she is not a pure game creation nor is she a human who has entered the game via a holoband. Or at least not a conscious human, which is one of the suggestions put to her to explain how she fits in. She's become friendly with a young man who spends most of his life in the cyberworld preferring it to "real" life. She asks him to contact her father. Joseph Adama meanwhile realizes that unless he can put his wife and Tamara's death behind him, his son William will take a path in life that will no doubt lead to a life of crime.
