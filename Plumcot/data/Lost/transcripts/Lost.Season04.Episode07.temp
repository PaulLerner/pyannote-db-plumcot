KEAMY Lapidus! You ready?
LAPIDUS I'll be up.
KEAMY Don't be late, Frank.
LAPIDUS Regina?
REGINA Frank! I didn't hear you.
LAPIDUS Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you. Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub... you know your book's upside down.
LAPIDUS Just trying to help...
LAPIDUS Thought I'd check in on you guys and bring you some food. How are you feeling, by the way?
DESMOND Yeah, much better, thanks.
SAYID Why are we being held captive? We had nothing to do with Minkowski's death.
LAPIDUS This has nothing to do with Minkowski. The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided to bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.
SAYID We didn't bust out. The door was left open! We assumed that was you.
LAPIDUS Why the hell would I do that?
SAYID Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?
LAPIDUS No luck. Something must have happened to the phone.
SAYID Lima beans?
LAPIDUS Sorry, we had a little problem in the kitchen. Just stay put, alright?
SAYID I still want to talk to the captain.
LAPIDUS No, you don't.
LAPIDUS Regina?
JIN 왜 그래? 괜찮아? 
SUN 사이드하고 데스몬드가 떠난지 3일이나 지났는데 왜 아직 돌아오지 않는 걸까요? 
JIN 아마 배를 타고 오느라 시간이 좀 걸리나봐. 
JIN 자, 그 얘기 그만하고 더 중요한 게 하나 있어. 
SUN 뭔데? 
JIN Let's talk about baby names.
SUN Good. You're getting better... But no, Jin. 지금부터 아기 이름을 지으면 못 나가요. 
JIN 웬 미신? 
SUN 이 녀석한테 나쁜 일이 생기면 안 되지. 
JIN 당신 말뜻은 우리 공주님. 
SUN 어, 그러니까 당신은 딸일 것이다? 
JIN 지연. 지연이라고 지을래. 
SUN 아기 이름은 그만 얘기해요. 
JIN 왜 지연이 마음에 안 들어? 
SUN 아니, 이름은 예뻐요. 우리 이렇게 해요. 우선 이 섬에서 벗어난 다음에 그때 가서 아기 이름을 지어요. 
JIN Deal!
WOMAN ON THE PHONE 긴급 상황 서비스입니다. 
SUN 네, 저 응급차 좀 불러주세요. 
WOMAN ON THE PHONE 어떻게 도와드릴까요? 
SUN 저 임신부인데요. 뭐가 잘못된 것 같아요. 
STORE OWNER 어서 오세요! 뭐 찾으시는 거 있으세요? 
JIN 예, 팬더 하나요. 
STORE OWNER 자, 이쪽으로요. 예. 
JIN 네, 좋아요. 저걸로 주세요. 
STORE OWNER 마음에 드신다니 다행이네요. 
JIN 아니요, 시간이 없어요. 병원에 가는 길이예요. 얼만데요? 
STORE OWNER 5만원입니다. 분만실? 
JIN 예. 
STORE OWNER 아이, 진작 말씀해 주시지! 참 기쁘시겠네요. 혹시 아드님인지 따님인지 아시나요? 
JIN 아, 그건 아직 몰라요. 
STORE OWNER 팬더는 누구든 다 좋아하니까 걱정 마세요. 
JIN 네, 네... 지금 가는 길입니다. 예, 알겠습니다. 네, 간다니까요. 
STORE OWNER 어서 가세요! 
SUN 진수 씨! 진수 씨! 
SUN 진수 씨, 케이트하고 잭이 돌아왔어요. 
JIN What happened?
KATE You mean before or after the redhead knocked me out?
SUN She hit you?
KATE When I ran into them on my way back from Locke's camp.
SUN Why would she do that?
KATE I guess she didn't wanna have to explain why she was on her way to a poison gas factory. Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.
SUN Why would Juliet lie about that?
KATE Force of habit?
SUN Why were they going there?
KATE To turn it off, to deactivate the gas. I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.
SUN Do you think they're really going to rescue us?
KATE In all the time they've been here they've talked about a lot of things, and none involved rescuing us.
SAYID Good morning.
DESMOND Good morning.
SAYID I hope they resolve their kitchen issues.
DESMOND Sayid! What's that?
SAYID It's a note. Three days ago, when I was in Locke's camp, Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.
SUN Hello. My name is Sun.
DANIEL Hi, Sun, hi... I'm Daniel. Something I can help you with?
SUN I'm two months pregnant.
DANIEL Oh, you're... Wow, that's... Congratulations!
SUN So are you here to rescue us?
SUN It's a simple question. Are you or are you not going to rescue us?
DANIEL The thing is... um, it's not really my call, Sun.
SUN And whose call is it?
SUN Thank you.
JIN Uh, can you pass, uh, the cereal?
JACK Pretty good English, Jin.
JIN Thank you. I... understand better than I, uh, speak.
JACK Has Sun been teaching you, or are you just picking it up?
JIN Uh, Sun teach me... Uh, Sawyer, too. Sun, is... better.
JACK I bet.
JACK Hey Sun. How are you feeling?
SUN I'm good, thank you... The morning sickness has stopped, which has been nice.
JACK That's good... Well, if you need anything, just let me know, okay?
JIN Would you like some breakfast?
SUN 진수 씨, 지금부터 이유는 묻지 말고 내가 시키는 대로만 해야 해요. 
JIN 왜, 뭔데? 
SUN 이틀 동안 우리 먹을 식량을 챙겨서 20분 후에 우리 텐트에서 봐요. 
JIN 뭐 때문에 그러는데? 무슨 일이 생겼어? 
SUN 로크한테 가봐야겠어요. 
JULIET What are you doing?
SUN I needed another bottle of those vitamins you gave me, the... the pre-natals?
JULIET You could've just asked.
SUN You're right. I should have.
JULIET What happened to the last ones I gave you?
SUN Sorry?
JULIET The last bottle I gave you. There should be 20 left... are you planning a trip?
SUN Please, just give me the vitamins.
JULIET Where are you going, Sun?
SUN We're going to Locke's camp.
JULIET What? Why?
SUN Because I don't trust these people.
JULIET Whether you trust them or not, you can't go there. Locke doesn't want to leave the island, and I've told you... Sun, pregnant women... they don't survive here.
SUN Yes, you did tell me that.
JULIET You don't believe me... Look, I know that I have been less than truthful about certain things since coming here, but I promise you, Sun... I promise you, I'm not lying about this. After everything you've confided in me, I should at least have your trust.
SUN Claire's baby is fine. I feel fine. All I have are your stories that I'm going to get sick. I'm going to do what's best for me and for my baby, because, no... I don't trust you.
NURSE 1 곧 괜찮으실 겁니다. 
NURSE 2 맞지? 
NURSE 1 맞아, 오세아닉 6. 
SUN 잠깐만요, 지금 뭐하시는 거예요? 
NURSE 1 귀금속 빼셔야 합니다. 혈압이 높아서 몸이 많이 부었어요. 
SUN 안돼요, 내 반지는 안돼요! 
NURSE 1 별일 없으니 안심하세요. 
DR. BAE 아냐아냐, 그냥 둬. 백선화 씨, 전 닥터 박 대신 담당을 맡은 닥터 배입니다. 
SUN 박 선생님은요? 저 왜 이러는 거예요? 
DR. BAE 박 선생님은 지금 출장 중입니다.  제가 우선 진통제를 놔드리겠습니다. 
DR. BAE 자, 봅시다. 
SUN 제 애기한테 무슨 이상이 있는 건가요? 
DR. BAE 태아가 스트레스가 있군. 
SUN 뭐가 잘못됐나요? 
DR. BAE 아직은 잘 모르겠지만 알아보겠습니다. 연락드릴 가족분 계십니까? 남편분이나 부모님? 
SUN 제 남편한테 연락을... 제 남편 좀 불러주세요. 
SUN 진수 씨? 진수 씨 좀 불러주세요. 
DR. BAE 제가 바로 남편분에게 연락 드릴테니... 
SUN 제 남편 좀 불러주세요. 
DR. BAE 남편 꼭 오실겁니다. 
SUN 진수 씨... 
JIN 어, 택시! 
JIN 아우, 간다니까요... 여보세요? 여보세요? 
JIN 야, 뭐야? 
JIN 이놈의 새끼, 너! 너 이 새끼야! 너 오늘 죽었어, 너 나한테 잡히기만 해봐! 나한테 보이기만 해봐! 
JIN 팬더 하나만 더 주세요. 
STORE OWNER 어떡하죠, 손님. 그 인형이 마지막 거였는데요. 
JIN 저거는요? 바로 뒤에 있잖아요! 
STORE OWNER 저거는 벌써 팔린 거예요. 사신 게 워낙 잘 팔리는 물건이 돼서요. 
JIN 얼마면 돼요? 
STORE OWNER 저거 팔렸대니까요. 
STORE OWNER 손님, 이거는 어때요? 올해가 용띠 아니예요? 행운을 갖고 올 거 같은데. 
JIN 그냥 그 팬더 이리 갖고 와요. 
STORE OWNER 이거 마지막 거니까 잃지 마세요. 
KATE Once you hit the stream, you want to head northwest, pretty much in a straight line for about a day and a half.
SUN Thank you.
KATE I'm gonna have to tell Jack. But I'll give you guys a nice, long headstart.
SUN I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.
KATE No, he wouldn't.
KATE You'd better get going. Be safe okay?
SUN Thank you.
JULIET She's not going anywhere. Sun, this is a bad idea.
SUN What concern is it of yours?
JULIET Do you understand your wife's medical condition right now? Translate for me.
SUN No.
JULIET Your wife is very sick. If she doesn't get off this island in three weeks, she will die.
SUN 신경쓰지 말아요, 어서 가요. 
JULIET If you let her go, your wife is in danger. Jin... Danger.
JIN Wherever Sun go, I go.
JULIET Sun! Please.
JULIET Jin. Your wife had an affair.
JIN What?
JULIET Sun was with another man. She thought the baby was his.
SUN 진수 씨... 
SUN 진수씨, 진수씨... 나랑 얘기 좀 해요. 내가 다 설명할게. 그건 오래 전 일이었어요. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 다신 이러는 거 이해해. 입이 열 개라도 나 할말이 없어. 그래도 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요. 
SUN 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요.  진수 씨... 
BERNARD Hey! You going fishing?
BERNARD Uh, you mind if I... tag along?
BERNARD Oh... Oh, I am sorry. I—I didn't mean to interrupt.
JIN No. Come.
BERNARD You're sure?
JIN Yes... come.
BERNARD You realize we're the only two married guys on the island?
BERNARD Married?
JIN Married.
BERNARD Yeah, well, no, not to each other. No. You got it. It's not easy, is it? Oh, I mean, it's—it's wonderful, but... let's face it, every decision that you make takes twice as long. 'Cause you always gotta talk them into it. Rose... has cancer. She's sick. Dying. Well, at least, she 'was' dying. She says she's better now. She says it's this place... the island. But when the camp split up, I was sure that she'd want to go with Locke. Why would she want to leave the island, and risk getting sick again?
JIN Then why do you stay with Jack?
BERNARD Because it was the right thing to do. Locke... he's a murderer. See, it's all about karma, Jin. Do you know karma?
BERNARD You make bad choices, bad things happen to you. But you make good choices, and then good—
BERNARD Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You got one! Yeah. Here, pull it in.
BERNARD Wow, look at that! You see? Now, that's karma. We must be the good guys, huh?
DESMOND How long's that gonna go on for, eh? Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?
SAYID That sound is not mechanical.
DESMOND What, you think somebody's doing that? Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?
SAYID That's exactly what I think.
RAY Gentlemen, thanks for your patience. The captain would like to see you now.
SAYID Where's the helicopter?
RAY Lapidus is running an errand.
SAYID What kind of errand?
RAY I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.
SAYID Did he go to the island?
RAY You know anywhere else he could land?
SAYID What's he going to do there?
RAY I said I'm just a doctor.
SAYID What did Lapidus say?
RAY He didn't say anything to me.
SAYID What is he doing there?!
DESMOND Hey! Hey!
DESMOND That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!
DESMOND Don't just stand there! What's the matter with you people?!
SAYID What's wrong with you? Get the rope!
DESMOND Why aren't you doing anything?!
DESMOND Bring a rope!
SAYID Get a rope!
DESMOND and SAYID Get a rope!
GAULT Stop!
DESMOND She just jumped!
GAULT It's over! She's gone! Everybody get back to your posts. That was an order.
GAULT I'm Captain Gault. I suppose you two have a few questions.
GAULT So what can I do for you?
SAYID What?
GAULT You boys said you wanted to speak with me.
SAYID Let's just start with why a woman jumped over the side of your ship, and you did nothing to stop it.
GAULT I didn't jump in, or order my crew to jump in, because I didn't want to lose any more people.
DESMOND What exactly is going on here?
GAULT Some of my crew has been dealing with... what might best be described as a heightened case of cabin fever. I think it's got something to do with the close proximity of the island.
SAYID Why don't you turn around, then?
GAULT I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board, and he's done one hell of a job on my engines. I've got my crew working around the clock to repair them.
SAYID And then you'll take our people home?
GAULT Then we move to safer waters... those are my orders.
SAYID And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?
GAULT Sure, I will. Charles Widmore.
DESMOND This is Charles Widmore's boat?
GAULT That's right. You know him.
GAULT Do either of you know what this is?
SAYID It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.
GAULT That's exactly what it is. Now here's the funny thing. This black box comes from Oceanic Flight 815. A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean. It took a considerable amount of Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it. It was found with the wreckage of the plane, along with all 324 dead passengers. That's not the complete story, as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah, given the fact that you're standing here, breathing... the wreckage was obviously staged. Now, can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude? Faking the recovery of a plane crash? Putting 324 families through a grieving process based on a lie? But what's even more disturbing... where exactly does one come across 324 dead bodies? And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume, is just one of the many reasons we want Benjamin Linus.
JULIET I'm sorry. I had to stop you any way I could.
SUN It wasn't your place to stop us.
JULIET I know you don't trust me, but you need to get off this island. We all do.
SUN You want to leave?
JULIET More than anything. I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not, but it's something. I need to go home. So do you. Sun... in about three weeks, you'll be in an almost constant state of nausea. A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath that won't go away. A week after that, you will lose consciousness and slip into a coma. And then, Sun, you will die. And when your heart stops beating... so will the baby's. And that, Sun, is why it is my business, because you are my patient. If you go... you will die. And your baby will never be born.
DR. BAE 선화 씨! 제왕절개를 해야할 것 같습니다. 
SUN 안돼요, 그건 안돼요. 
DR. BAE 잘 모르는 것 같으신데, 저희가 놓아드린 진통제 때문에 자연분만은 아주 힘들 거 같습니다. 
SUN 안돼요, 남편이, 내 남편이 올 때까지 안돼... 
DR. BAE 바로 수술하셔야 합니다. 
SUN 내 남편 어디 있어요? 
DR. BAE 아직 안 오셨습니다. 더 이상 기다릴 수가 없어요. 
SUN 진수 씨! 진수 씨! 
NURSE 1 선생님, 아이가 보이기 시작했어요! 
DR. BAE 자, 선화 씨. 이제부터 힘을 주셔야 합니다. 거의 다 왔습니다. 조금만 더 미세요! 미세요! 할 수 있습니다! 네, 조금만 더 미세요! 
DR. BAE 잘 하셨습니다. 
DR. BAE 축하드립니다. 따님을 출산하셨습니다. 
RAY So what do you think of the captain?
SAYID He was surprisingly forthcoming.
RAY Yeah, he tells it like it is. Just don't piss him off. You know what I mean? I think you'll like your room. It's on a quiet part of the ship.
DESMOND This... ship isn't moving.
RAY Well, if you say so.
RAY That shouldn't still be there... Damn it!
RAY Hey, Johnson. Is that you? Johnson!
JOHNSON Yeah.
RAY Mop this up.
JOHNSON Sorry, I gotta go up on deck.
RAY No, you're gonna mop this up!
RAY Kevin, this is, uh...
SAYID Sayid.
DESMOND Desmond.
JOHNSON Kevin Johnson.
SAYID Nice to meet you Kevin.
JIN I made... dinner.
SUN 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어요. 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요. 
JIN 상관 없어. 
SUN 당신도 내 말을... 
JIN 당신이 왜 그랬는지 난 알고 있어. 그리고 내가 어떤 남자였는지도... 잘 알아. 이 섬에 오기 전에... 내가 당신에게 냉정하게 대하고 당신보다는 일을 선택한 나였어. 하여튼... 이 모든 것들이 다 나 때문이야. 그거 잘 알아. 그래서... 내가 당신을... 용서해. 
JIN 자, 로크한테 당신하고 같이 갈거야. 
SUN 더 이상 그 곳에 가고 싶지 않아요. 
JIN 왜? 
SUN 줄리엣 말이 맞았어요. 무슨 일이 있어도 우린 이 섬에 떠나가야 해요. 저 사람들은 헬리콥터도 있고 배도 있어요. 우리도 방법을 찾아봐요. 
JIN 무슨 일이 있어도 당신과 우리 아이를 지켜줄 거야. 맹세할께. 
SUN 고마워요. 
JIN 나한테 한 가지만... 솔직히 말해줄래? 
SUN 뭐든지. 
JIN Is... the baby... mine?
SUN 네, 진수씨. 하늘에 맹세코 당신 아이 맞아요. 정말이예요. 자기 너무 사랑해요. 
SUN 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어. 
JIN 나도 사랑해. 나 당신과 절대 헤어지지 않을 거야. 
JIN 안녕하십니까. 백 자동차사의 회장님이 보내서 온 권진수라고 합니다. 
MAN IN SUIT 예? 
JIN 대사님이 오늘 손주를 보셨다고 하셔서 선물을 전해드리러 왔습니다. 
MAN IN SUIT 여기서 기다리세요. 
JIN 참, 남자아이입니까 여자아이입니까? 
MAN IN SUIT 남자아이입니다. 
AMBASSADOR 네. 
JIN 네, 대사님. 이 팬더는 대국 중국에서 사업을 시작하겠다는 백 회장님의 뜻이 담겨 있습니다. 부디 오늘 같은 기쁜 날 이 선물을 받아 주시면 감사하겠습니다. 
AMBASSADOR 회장님에게 전해주게. 
NURSE 어, 벌써 가세요? 
JIN 제 아이도 아닌데, 뭐. 
NURSE 언젠가는 좋은 날이 오겠죠. 
JIN 시간이 충분히 있어요. 이제 결혼한 지 두달 밖에 안 됐거든요. 
SUN I can't believe you came all this way.
HURLEY Are you kidding? Is anyone else coming?
SUN No.
HURLEY Good. So... where is she?
HURLEY She's awesome.
SUN Thank you.
SUN Would you like to hold her?
HURLEY I don't know, I... kinda have two left hands.
SUN I trust you.
HURLEY Wow... she looks just like Jin.
SUN Yes. She does.
HURLEY So... I guess we should, like, go see him.
SUN Of course.
SUN 여보... 여보 말이 맞았어요. 딸이예요. 나 정말 견디기 힘들었어요. 의사 선생님 말로는... 나 계속 당신만 찾았대. 당신이 옆에 있었으면 참 좋았을텐데... 진수 씨, 우리 딸 예쁘죠? 아기 이름은... 당신이 원하는 대로 지연이라고 지었어요. 자기 너무 보고 싶어. 너무 보고 싶어.
