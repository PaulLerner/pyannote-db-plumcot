SUN 여보세요? 
MRS. PAIK 선? 어디냐? 
SUN 저 아직 LA에 있어요. 일 마무리 하면 내일 비행기 탈 거예요. 
MRS. PAIK 지연이가 통화하고 싶어해. 
JI YEON 엄마. 
SUN 어, 우리 이쁜 딸, 잘 지내지? 엄마가 미국에서 지연이한테 소개해주고 싶은 친구를 만났어. 이름은 애런이야. 
JI YEON 엄마 보고 싶어. 언제 와? 
SUN 엄마 빨리 갈게. 그래, 사랑해. 안녕. 
KATE Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
BEN Because he's not your son, Kate.
SUN Move away, Kate.
JACK Sun—
SUN I said, move away!
KATE S-Sun! What are you doing? Where's Aaron?
SUN He's in the car.
JACK Sun, listen. I know you think you're helping—
SUN If it wasn't for you, Jin would still be alive.
BEN I didn't kill your husband, Sun.
SUN Yes, you did.
BEN No, I didn't. Neither did anyone else, because he's not dead.
SUN You're lying.
BEN No, Sun. Jin's still alive, and I can prove it.

ROBERT You were on this island before?
JIN You see helicopter?
MONTAND D'abord un bateau, ensuite un hélicoptère. Bientôt il va nous parler d'un sous-marin. 
MONTAND Allez, j'sais par où passer. 
ROBERT T'es sûr ? 
MONTAND Ecoute, le signal est puissant. Ce qui veut dire qu'il y a sûrement une antenne sur cette île. Si on la trouve, on pourra appeler du secours. 
ROBERT Is there an antenna on the Island?
ROBERT Hey, Jin! Is—uh, please. Is there, um... ra—a radio tower?
ROBERT Um... um... okay.
ROBERT Like that. Is there a-a radio tower here?
JIN Yes. But I—I must find my camp because maybe, uh, helicopter go there.

MAN ON RECORDING 8, 15, 16, 23... 23...
MONTAND Par là. 
ROUSSEAU Ugh!
ROBERT Danielle ? Qu'est qu'il y a ? 
ROUSSEAU Rien, c'est rien. 
ROBERT Je savais que c'était une erreur, t'es enceinte de sept mois— 
ROUSSEAU Robert, ça va! Elle m'a juste donné un petit coup de pied. 
ROBERT Elle ? 
ROUSSEAU Elle ! 
ROBERT Arrête ! Combien de fois on va remettre ça ? Alexandre, c'est un garçon.

ROBERT Brennan ? T'as l'eau ? 
BRENNAN Nadine a un gourde. 
ROBERT Nadine?
BRENNAN Nadine? Nadine!
MONTAND Voilà ce qui arrive quand on amène des femmes. Elle court sûrement après un papillon, quoi. 
ROUSSEAU Did you hear that?
ROBERT What is that?
JIN Monster.
DANIELLE Qui est le dernier à voir Nadine? 
BRENNAN Elle était juste derrière moi. 
DANIELLE Okay, on fait le demi tour.  We go find her.
JIN No! We must go!
MONTAND You shut up.
MONTAND Allez. 
VARIOUS Nadine!
BRENNAN Qu'est-ce qu'il y a par terre là? C'est son sac à dos!

ROBERT Danielle, fais pas ça, c'est moi! 
DANIELLE T'es pas Robert! T'es changé! Cette machine t'as changé! 
ROBERT Danielle, je t'en prie. Pose ton arme. Je t'aime, pourquoi tu agis comme ça? 
DANIELLE Parce que t'es pas Robert. T'es malade. Ce monstre t'a rendu malade. 
ROBERT Mais il n'y a pas de monstre. C'est un système de sécurité qui garde ce temple, c'est tout. 
ROBERT Maintenant, pose ton fusil. 
ROBERT Je t'aime, Danielle. Je ne veux que rien nous arrive. A toi, et à notre bébé. Je t'en supplie, fais pas ça. 
JIN No!
DANIELLE You! You disappeared! Are you sick too? You're a carrier?
JIN No! No, please, wait!
MAN'S VOICE Turn around slowly.
SAWYER Jin?
JIN Sawyer?
SAWYER I thought you were on that boat, I thought you were dead!
JIN No, no, I... in water.
SAWYER Well what do you say!
JIN Where is Sun?
MILES Where'd that guy come from? I thought he was on the boat.
DANIEL The blast must've thrown him in the water. He's been moving with every flash, just like us.
SAWYER Every time the sky lights up, we... move through time.
JIN 무슨 말을 하는지 도대체 모르겠어. Translate. Please, translate.
SAWYER You heard the man, translate.
MILES Uh, he's Korean. I'm from Encino.
JIN 선이 이 섬에 없다는 것을 로크가 어떻게 알아?
CHARLOTTE He wants to know how you're sure his wife is off the Island.
SAWYER You speak Korean, Red?
MILES Obviously.
LOCKE Tell him I'm sure. But none of it will matter if we don't make it to the Orchid.
CHARLOTTE 확실해. 그리고 오키드까지 가야 한대. 
JIN 오키드가 뭔데? 
CHARLOTTE 섬을 벗어나는 법. 로크는 여길 벗어나 당신 친구들 모두 데려 온대. 당신 와이프도. 그래야만 플래쉬를 막을 수 있대요. 
JIN Bring Sun back? Why you bring her back?
LOCKE Because she never should've left.
SUN I've spent the last 3 years thinking... believing that he was dead. You say you have proof that he's not. I want to see it.
BEN Why don't you put down the gun. No one wants it to go off.
SUN How do you know he's alive?
BEN There's someone—someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.
SUN Someone? Who?
BEN The same person that's going to show us how to get back to the Island.
KATE Is that what this is about? You knew about this?
JACK No, no, I was...
KATE And that is why you're pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?
JACK I wasn't pretending anything...
KATE This is insane, you guys are crazy.
JACK Kate...
KATE Jack, don't! 
BEN Sayid, where are you going?
SAYID I don't want any part of this. And if I see you, or him again, it will be extremely unpleasant for all of us. 
BEN 30 minutes, Sun. We can be there in 30 minutes. And you’ll have proof—proof that he's alive. Or you can shoot me and never know.
SUN Let's go.
JIN How far?
LOCKE Just over the next ridge.
JIN How you will leave the Island?
LOCKE I'm not sure yet.
JIN I'll go with you.
LOCKE It doesn't work like that. It's a one man job.
JIN Why?
LOCKE I don’t know why, Jin, it just is. But I promise I'll bring Sun back.
DANIEL You okay? Want to take a break?
CHARLOTTE Let's just get there.
DANIEL So... you speak any other languages?
CHARLOTTE Just Klingon. Dan, is this gonna work?
DANIEL It... it does make empirical sense that if this started at the Orchid then that's where it's gotta stop. But as far as bringing back the people who left in order to stop these temporal shifts? That's where we leave science behind. You okay?
CHARLOTTE Oh no!
SAWYER Come on!
CHARLOTTE Ah!
DANIEL Charlotte! Charlotte!
SAWYER Juliet...?
JULIET Huh?
SAWYER ...you have a little... 
JULIET You too.
DANIEL Charlotte! Can you hear me? Charlotte, it's Daniel. Talk to me...
CHARLOTTE 데려 오지 말라고 해. 잘 들어. 데려 오지 말라고 해. 이 곳은 죽음 뿐이야.
SAWYER What'd she say?
CHARLOTTE Don't let them bring her back. No matter what—don't let them bring her back! This place is death!
SUN You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.
BEN I didn't account for traffic.
JACK Sun, I'm sorry.
SUN Sorry for what?
JACK For leaving Jin behind. When we landed that chopper on the boat, everything was just happening so fast. I knew he was down below. I should've waited for him.
SUN Why are you telling me this now, Jack? Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben if he's lying about my husband?
JACK After what he just did to Kate - if you don't do it, Sun, I will.
JACK What are you doing?!
BEN What I'm doing is helping you! And if you had any idea what I've had to do to keep you safe – to keep your friends safe – then you'd never stop thanking me! You wanna shoot me, then shoot me – but let's get on with it! What's it gonna be?
SUN Drive.
CHARLOTTE Why can't Daddy come with us?
DANIEL Charlotte, can you hear me?
CHARLOTTE You know what my mum would say about you marrying an American. I know more about ancient Carthage than Hannibal himself.
SAWYER What the hell is she talking about?
DANIEL I have no idea.
LOCKE Let's go – we have to keep moving.
DANIEL Alright. Somebody help me with Charlotte. We're going to have to carry her.
LOCKE No – she's going to hold us up.
DANIEL We can't just leave her.
SAWYER Flashes are getting closer together. Maybe when your nose starts bleeding, you'll realize we gotta get out of Dodge now. We'll come back for her just as soon as we can.
DANIEL No. No way. I'm not going to leave her behind.
CHARLOTTE Let them go without me.
DANIEL No, Charlotte, no, we're not going to leave you behind.
SAWYER Hell!
LOCKE We have to move, now!
CHARLOTTE He's right, go!
DANIEL Charlotte...
CHARLOTTE Just go!
DANIEL Charlotte...
CHARLOTTE Oh, oh turn it up! I love Geronimo Jackson.
JULIET We're running out of time, Dan.
DANIEL Go. I'm going to stay with her.
SAWYER Let me ask you something, John. If we don't even know when the hell we are, what happens if the Orchid ain't around anymore?
CHARLOTTE Look for the well. You'll find it at the well.
SAWYER I'll be sure and do that.
LOCKE Let's go.
LOCKE We're here.
JULIET Thank God! What are the odds that we would end up in the same time as this thing?
SAWYER You just had to say something.
MILES How the hell did Charlotte know this was here?
CHARLOTTE Daniel?
DANIEL Yes?
CHARLOTTE I've been here before.
DANIEL You've been...been here before?
CHARLOTTE I grew up here...on the island. And there was this thing...this... DHARMA Initiative. And then...I moved away with my mum. Just my mum...and...I never saw my dad again. And then when I got back to England, I would...I would...ask my mum about this place, yeah? But she would say that it wasn't real...and that I'd made it up. That's why... I became an anthropologist. To find this island again. It's what...I've been searching for my whole life.
DANIEL Charlotte...why are you telling me this?
CHARLOTTE Because I remember something now. When I was little, living here, there was this man... a crazy man, he really scared me. And he told me that I had to leave the island and never ever come back. He told me that if I came back I would die.
DANIEL Charlotte, I don't understand.
CHARLOTTE Daniel – I think that man was you.
SAWYER You're going down there?
LOCKE Uh-huh.
SAWYER What exactly are you hoping to find?
LOCKE A way off the island.
SAWYER You expecting a subway?
LOCKE Goodbye, James, Juliet, Miles... I'll see you when I get back.
JIN No! Stop! You don't bring Sun back.
LOCKE No, I have to bring them all back, that's... that's how it works.
JIN How you know?
LOCKE I... I just know.
JIN I cut this!
LOCKE No! You do that, you'll kill every one of us!
JIN This island is bad! You don't bring Sun back! You promise—you promise you don't bring my baby!
LOCKE All right, all right—you have my word.
JIN Promise, John.
LOCKE I promise.
LOCKE I won't go to Sun, Jin, but she might find me. If she does, what do I tell her?
JIN You tell her I dead. You say I wash up. You bury me. Proof.
LOCKE I'll be back as soon as I can.
SAWYER You sure you don't want us to lower you down?
LOCKE Where would be the fun in that? 
JULIET John, if whatever you're attempting to do actually works... thank you.
LOCKE You're welcome.
MILES Uh-oh.
SAWYER John, dammit, hold on!
MILES I think you can let go of that now.
SAWYER No... no no, no no!
JULIET James, stop.
SAWYER No, no!
JULIET James, stop.
SAWYER C'mon and help me!
JULIET James—we can't help him.
DANIEL Hold on... hold on... hold on... hold on... stay.... stay... stay with me... stay, okay? You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I've got a plan... I've got a plan. When we were back at the hatch, I talked to Desmond. I told him to find my mother. She can help us, Charlotte, she will help us!
CHARLOTTE How can your mother help us?
DANIEL She can! She will...
CHARLOTTE Hey, hey. Listen, listen.
DANIEL Yeah? What?
CHARLOTTE I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner... mm....
DANIEL Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte... No...!
LOCKE James! Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?
LOCKE Who's there?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Hello, John.
LOCKE You! What are you doing down here?
CHRISTIAN I'm here to help you the rest of the way.
LOCKE I... I don't understand.
CHRISTIAN You came to see me in the cabin. You asked me how to save the island and I told you you had to move it. I said that you had to move it, John.
LOCKE But Ben said he knew how to do it! He told me that I had to stay here and lead his people.
CHRISTIAN Since when did listening to him get you anywhere worth a damn? The good news is that you're here now. You ready to go?
LOCKE I don't... I don't... I... I don't know... what to do once I get there.
CHRISTIAN There's a woman living in Los Angeles. Now once you get all your friends together—and it must be all of them, every one who left—and once you've persuaded them to join you, this woman will tell you exactly how to come back.
LOCKE Who is she?
CHRISTIAN Her name is Eloise Hawking.
LOCKE What if I can only convince some of them to come back?
CHRISTIAN I believe in you, John. You can do this.
LOCKE Richard said I was going to die.
CHRISTIAN Well, I suppose that's why they call it sacrifice.
LOCKE All right. I'm ready.
CHRISTIAN Good. Now, on the other side of this column here is a wheel, slipped off its axis. All you have to do is give it a little push.
LOCKE Could you help me up?
CHRISTIAN No. Sorry. I can't.
CHRISTIAN Good luck John.
CHRISTIAN Say hello to my son.
LOCKE Who's your son?
BEN May I?
BEN Take it.
SUN 영원히 함께 하길.  How do you have this?
BEN John gave it to me.
JACK You said John never came to see you.
BEN That's true, Jack. I went to see him. Jin gave it to him before he left the Island.
SUN Why did he not tell me himself?
BEN I don't know. Maybe he never had a chance before he died. I'm sorry I had to bring you here before I gave it to you, Sun. But all those people back on the Island—Jin included—need our help. There is a woman in this church and she can tell us how to get back to your husband. But we're running out of time, Sun. So I need you to decide right now. Will you come with me?
SUN Yes.
MAN'S VOICE What are you doing here?
BEN I assume the same thing you are.
DESMOND You're looking for Faraday's mother too?
BEN Hello, Eloise.
ELOISE Hello, Benjamin. I thought I said all of them.
BEN This is all I could get on short notice.
ELOISE Well, I suppose it will have to do for now. All right! Let's get started.
