HURLEY Hold on a second, you want what now?
HURLEY You want to make snowballs?
MICHAEL He wants you to hold the bamboo tighter... I think.
JACK Hey.
MICHAEL Hey.
JACK How's it coming?
MICHAEL It's coming.
JACK As long as nobody sabotages this one, as well, huh?
MICHAEL I've got people standing guard 24-7. Nobody gets near this with or without intent to burn. Hey, listen, I was thinking, chances of a passing ship spotting this raft out there are pretty slim. We could use something to send out a distress call to any ships that might be close, like an SOS.
JACK Okay, well, look I'll ask Sayid, but even if he can make something like that he's not going to have anything to power it with.
HURLEY Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick has batteries?
SAYID Absolutely not.
JACK I'm not asking you to go. I'll do it.
SAYID No, you won't.
HURLEY Dude, we just trying to-
SAYID Do you really think she would give up something she needs for survival to a total stranger?
JACK All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her. That's it.
SAYID I was brought unconscious to her camp. When I escaped I was disoriented. I don't know how to find her.
HURLEY Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?
JACK Sayid, look, you've got her maps and her papers. Now you thought that they were pointing to something.
SAYID Well, I was wrong.
JACK Well, maybe they're pointing to her?
SAYID Look! I don't even know what these papers mean. For all I know they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind - song lyrics mixed with equations. If this map is pointing to her, then you should know she resides here, in this area. She gave it a name Territoire Fonce, Shannon translated it. It means dark territory. Does that sound like a place you'd like to visit?
JACK So, you won't help?
SAYID I didn't say that. I'll build a distress beacon, but I suggest you find another power source. There must be something in the cockpit.
JACK We're not going in the cockpit.
CARMEN What are you doing in there?
HURLEY Uno momento, Mama, just checking something out.
CARMEN I hope you're not watching those g-string mujeres again.
HURLEY Look, mom, we've talked about this. You want me living here -- you've got to respect my privacy. And no, I'm not.
CARMEN Look at you. It's Saturday night. A grown up man sitting at home watching TV. You should go out, try to find yourself a nice woman.
HURLEY Yeah, I'll get right on that.
CARMEN At least try eating better. You're gaining weight again.
MARY JO -- with mega number 42. And that makes tonight's mega-lotto-jackpot 4 8 15 16 23 With the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share, in a near record jackpot.
LOTTO OFFICIAL That's right Mary-Jo because this is the 16th week without a winner.
HURLEY Hi. You awake?
SAYID I was just wondering that myself.
HURLEY So, that French lady, she wrote this stuff, right?
SAYID Hurley, it's the middle of the night. What do you want?
HURLEY Nothing. Couldn't sleep, then I got curious. You and Shannon, you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff and I was wondering what, you know, you guys figured out about this stuff.
SAYID What stuff?
HURLEY I don't know. Look, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times - got any idea what it means?
SAYID I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.
HURLEY Coordinates, yeah. When you first found her, the French chick, you said you saw a wire or something on the beach? And you followed it, and it led you to her?
SAYID No, it led me to a trap she set.
HURLEY Her place is probably close, right?
SAYID Why are you suddenly so interested in Rousseau?
HURLEY I'm not -- just, you know, making conversation, dude. Sorry if it's a bad time. Goodnight.
HURLEY Yeah, you.
REPORTER #1 How'd you come up with the winning numbers, any significance?
HURLEY Oh, they just, uh, sort of came to me.
REPORTER #2 Why don't you introduce your family.
HURLEY Oh yeah, okay, um, this -- this patch of beauty is my mom, Carmen. Come here, mom. And this is my brother, Diego and his wife, Lisa.
DIEGO Woo! We're rich!
HURLEY Nice, dude. Ignore him, he's an idiot. And, uh, oh, you've got to know this guy. This is the greatest guy I know, my, my, my grandpa Tito. He's worked 3 jobs for -- how long has it been now?
TITO 52 years.
HURLEY 52 years. 70 years old, and the closest thing he's had to a vacation is when they put a pacemaker in him 4 years ago. So the first thing I'm going to do with the money is, uh, finally give him the rest that he's earned. That's really what it's all about for me, to be able to do things for the people I care about, because I really put my family through a lot recently, and, um, well, this way I can make it up to them. You know, maybe even buy my mom a new house. And uh, maybe after my grandpa comes back from his cruise we can, you know -- do some things that we always wanted to do. Grandpa?
CHARLIE Hey, man.
HURLEY What, I'm not doing anything.
CHARLIE What?
HURLEY What?
CHARLIE I'm just saying good morning.
HURLEY Oh, right. Morning. Sorry, I was just, uh...
CHARLIE You going somewhere?
HURLEY Me? No. Well, yeah. Just thought I might take a walk. Uh, maybe scope out some new fishing area.
CHARLIE Oh, hang on, I'll come with.
HURLEY That's okay.
CHARLIE No, I could use a little bit of the fresh wide open.
HURLEY Dude, I could really use some alone time right now.
CHARLIE Sure.
HURLEY I'm a big guy, I get dehydrated easy.
CHARLIE Yeah. Yeah, okay.
LOCKE Claire, you got a second?
CLAIRE Uh, yeah, sure.
LOCKE I was wondering if you were free to help me with a little project.
CLAIRE Me?
LOCKE Yeah. I'm building something and I could use an extra pair of hands.
CLAIRE I'm nearly nine months pregnant, I can barely waddle on the beach.
LOCKE Could you hold a saw?
CLAIRE Um, yeah.
LOCKE Can you move your hand back and forth, like this? 
CLAIRE Possibly.
LOCKE You're perfect. Come on.
CLAIRE Okay. So, what exactly are we building?
SAYID Where is it?
JACK Where's what?
SAYID The map. I told you, it won't help you find her.
JACK Whoa, slow down. I don't have the map.
SAYID What makes this worse is that you don't even do your own dirty work. You get Hurley to do it for you.
JACK Wait a minute -- Hurley?
SAYID He was in my tent last night, quizzing me about Rousseau, about numbers she wrote -- how I came to find her. You don't know anything about this, do you?
JACK Charlie, you seen Hurley?
CHARLIE A couple of hours ago, he was setting out for a walk. Acting like a loon, I might say.
SAYID My god, he's going after her.
SHANNON When are you going to be back?
SAYID If we can catch up to him, before nightfall. Why? You worried about me?
SHANNON So what if I am?
JACK Sayid, you ready?
SAYID I'll be fine.
CARMEN You turn that noise down.
HURLEY Uh, sorry.
CARMEN Where are you taking me? You know very well I don't like surprises.
HURLEY You're going to like this one, ma. I mean, after everything you've been through? Like grandpa -- And then at the funeral, Father Aguillar getting struck by lightening? Man, that was a freak storm. And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that . . . waitress?
CARMEN Don't mention that whore to me.
HURLEY I'm just saying you deserve something good to happen. You know, ever since I won the lottery it's like we've had nothing but bad luck. Like, I don't know, like the money's cursed or something.
CARMEN That's blasphemy. You know very well we're Catholic. We don't believe in curses.
HURLEY Jeez, ma, I'm just talking. Okay, we're almost there. Here, put this on.
CARMEN Why do I have to wear this?
HURLEY Give me your hand. Careful.
CARMEN No, no, you be careful.
HURLEY You're stepping down.
CARMEN I can't see anything.
HURLEY Okay, now take off your blindfold. And get a look at your new dream house.
CARMEN Ow, my ankle!
HURLEY I said take off your blindfold.
CARMEN Why did you make me put that in the first place?! Hugo, do I smell smoke?
HURLEY Oh, crap. Hang on mom, I've got to call 911.
CARMEN You tell them I broke my ankle.
COP Drop the phone, move away from the vehicle!
HURLEY Oh, no, no, no. It's the house.
COP Do it, now! Turn around.
HURLEY No such thing as curses, huh, ma?
COP You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
HURLEY Yo! French chick!
KEN HALPERIN I would think you'd be happy. Every one of your stocks is up. Your interest in orange futures skyrocketed after those tropical storms hit Florida. And, you are now the majority shareholder for a box company in Tustin.
HURLEY A box company?
KEN Mmhmm. They make boxes, lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me, your sneaker factory in Canada . . .
HURLEY I have a sneaker factory in Canada?
KEN Well, not any more. It was destroyed in a fire last month.
HURLEY Of course it was.
KEN You might have read about it -- eight something people died. But, the good news is we over-insured it. It's going to yield you a windfall of cash. And, when we add in the generous settlement from the LAPD for your false arrest you've almost doubled your net worth in a few short months. I still can't imagine how the police mistook you for a drug dealer.
HURLEY Bad luck.
KEN Hugo, you are not the first lottery winner to believe the money's brought them nothing but trouble. It's all in your head.
HURLEY What, you don't believe in jinxes? You know, curses?
KEN I'm an accountant, I believe in numbers. Hey, where'd you get them, anyway?
HURLEY What?
KEN The winning numbers. What'd you use, somebody's birthday, phone number?
HURLEY No, it's nothing, it's something that I . . .
KEN What?
HURLEY That's it. It's not the money, it's the numbers. The numbers are cursed. Dude, don't look at me like that, I'm not crazy. This is real.
KEN Come on, Hugo, listen to yourself. "The numbers are cursed." You know there is no such thing as a-
SAWYER You want to hit that a little harder?
MICHAEL I'm sorry. Is my building a raft to get us rescued bothering you?
SAWYER At the moment, yeah.
WALT Why aren't you helping?
SAWYER I am helping, Short Round. I'm keeping watch for arsonists.
MICHAEL Walt's got a point. You could pitch in, seeing as how you already bought your ticket.
JIN 내가 밤새도록 묶어놨는데!
MICHAEL Hey, did you tie this like I told you?! If you tied this like I told you the thing would still be together! What's the matter with you man?! What is your problem?!
SUN He's never going to speak to me again.
KATE He just needs time.
SUN I humiliated him. When the raft sails, do you think he's going to leave with them?
KATE I don't know.
SAYID Don't move!
HURLEY Hey, what are you guys...
SAYID I said do not move. You're standing on a pressure trigger. If you take your weight off it, it will release that.
HURLEY Oh, man.
SAYID We need to find something to replace his weight with the trigger.
CHARLIE Replace his weight? How are we going to do that?
HURLEY Hey!
SAYID Don't move!
JACK Hey, everybody, just calm down.
HURLEY Can I drop the wire?
CHARLIE Maybe if I find a rock or something?
SAYID A big one.
HURLEY I'm dropping the wire.
JACK Hurley, no!
HURLEY I can make it.
JACK Hurley, don't move!
CHARLIE No!
HURLEY I can get out of the way, I'm spry.
CHARLIE Oi!
JACK Hurley, stay put.
CHARLIE Oi! No, wait!
JACK No, Hurley, Hurley! Don't even...
CHARLIE Hurley, what the bloody hell's wrong with you?!
HURLEY Nothing.
JACK What are you doing out here, man?
HURLEY I came to get a battery.
JACK Hurley, seriously, what's going on?
HURLEY Nada. You guys coming?
SAYID You all want to go? Fine. But perhaps I should take the lead.
CHARLIE Excellent notion.
HURLEY Lenny. His name is Lenny, or Leonard.
NURSE But you don't know his last name.
HURLEY Look, I just need to talk to him for five minutes.
NURSE I'm sorry, but if you can't tell me the patient's name, sir, I can't very well look it up.
HURLEY How many Leonards are here? Can't you just type in Leonard? I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me.
NURSE Our records are private, sir. If any . . .
HURLEY Dude! Do not do that right now! Leave the bulb for another time, man! five minutes! All I need is five minutes!
DR. CURTIS Hugo?
HURLEY Oh, hey, Doc.
DR. CURTIS It's good to see you. What are you doing back here?
HURLEY Uh...
DR. CURTIS I don't remember you and Leonard being that close, Hugo.
HURLEY Yeah, well, we hung.
DR. CURTIS I'll leave you gentleman to it then. Good luck, Hugo.
LENNY 
HUGO Hi, Lenny. Remember me? Hugo. Hurley. Well I was just, you know, in the neighborhood, and uh -- look, Lenny, I've got to know, what do the numbers mean?
LENNY 4 8 15 16 23 42. 4 8 15 16 23 42 . . .
HURLEY C'mon, Lenny, give me something. Anything. Where'd you get the numbers? Is that why you're here, Lenny? Is it because of the numbers? Did they do something to you? Because I think they did something to me. I think they turned me into a jinx -- bad news to everyone around me. And when I tell people I think I'm the cause they, they, they look at me like I'm nuts. They don't believe me. But I know, ever since I won the lottery with those numbers.
LENNY You used those numbers to play the lottery?
HURLEY Uh, -- yeah.
LENNY Well, you shouldn't have done that. You've opened the box!
HURLEY I what?
LENNY Ah, you shouldn't have used those numbers!
HURLEY Why not?
LENNY It doesn't stop! You've got to get away from those numbers! You've got to get far, far away!
ORDERLY All right, hey, hold on. Lenny, Lenny. Calm down. Lenny.
LENNY Do you hear me?!? No, don't you understand?!? You've got to get away from it or it won't stop!
ORDERLY Try and calm down.
HURLEY Wait a second, I need some answers.
ORDERLY Sir, you need to step away.
HURLEY Those numbers, where'd you get them?
LENNY Sam Toomey! He heard them!
HURLEY Who's Sam Toomey?!?
LENNY He heard them in Kalgoorlie! It's a town where he used to work!
HURLEY It's a town where?!
LENNY In Australia! Oh, God!
SAYID It stops here. It goes into the ground. This poses somewhat of a problem.
CHARLIE Guys? You should come see this.
HURLEY Whoa.
JACK You never mentioned anything about a bridge.
SAYID I never saw this before.
JACK There's no way she could have built this all by herself.
SAYID No, but her team could have.
CHARLIE Or Ethan's team.
JACK Hurley, what are you doing?
HURLEY Relax, I'm just going to check it out. You guys should stay here.
JACK Hurley, get back here!
HURLEY Dudes, chill.
JACK Charlie.
CHARLIE Hey, if he can do it...
JACK Charlie!
HURLEY Dude, you okay?
CHARLIE I'm okay. Woo!
JACK Alright, you two stay put right there! We're going to find a way around and we'll meet you there!
HURLEY Nah, screw that! You guys stay! There's a path right here, Charlie and me-
CHARLIE Hurley, will you shut up and listen to Jack?!? He said stay put! You're acting like a bloody lunatic!
MARTHA If this weren't the middle of nowhere, I'd say you were lost.
HURLEY Hi, is this Sam Toomey's house?
MARTHA It is. I'm his wife.
HURLEY Is he around, because I'd kind of like to talk to him.
MARTHA I'd like that, too. But Sam's been dead for four years.
HURLEY Your husband worked with a guy I know, Leonard Sims.
MARTHA That's right, they served together in the U.S. Navy. How is Leonard? Still in the service?
HURLEY Uh, he's, um, retired. Anyway, he told me about Sam hearing something.
MARTHA You're talking about the numbers.
HURLEY Yes, the numbers, exactly. Do you know anything about them?
MARTHA Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific. Boring job. Sam hated it, nothing to do but listen to static night after night. Until one night, about 16 years ago, there's something in the static, a voice comes through, a voice repeating those numbers over and over again. A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar, must have been big as a pony, and it's filled to the rim with beans. Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar, within 10.
HURLEY Sam used the numbers?
MARTHA Yep, the answer was exact. To the bean. Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close. So we won the money. On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway, hits us head on. Lost my leg that night.
HURLEY What about Sam?
MARTHA Barely a scratch. Most people would consider themselves lucky, but not him. He was never the same after that. He started keeping a record. Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us, he believed it was all because he used those numbers. He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop.
HURLEY Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop?
MARTHA Yep. He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. What is it you're looking for Mr. Reyes?
HURLEY I used them, the numbers, to win the lottery. And now I think I'm under the same curse.
MARTHA Curse? There's no curse.
HURLEY But you just told me...
MARTHA You think I'd still have my leg if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans?! You think that floods wouldn't have happened?! That homes wouldn't have burned down?! That people wouldn't have died?!
HURLEY Well, yeah.
MARTHA You make your own luck, Mr. Reyes. Don't blame it on the damn numbers. You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist.
CLAIRE It's a trap, right? For catching animals?
LOCKE Pass me that cup please.
CLAIRE Ugh, what's this gunk?
LOCKE Glue.
CLAIRE Where'd you find glue?
LOCKE I made it out of rendered animal fat.
CLAIRE You made glue? Wow. Then you should have one of those shows where you fix up houses for people.
LOCKE I don't think so.
CLAIRE Thanks, for this -- giving me something to do. I'm tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there.
LOCKE How's that coming? Your memory?
CLAIRE Bits and pieces here and there. Nothing that makes any real sense.
LOCKE Well, maybe I can help. I'm good at putting bits and pieces together.
JACK What?
SAYID This is familiar, this area. We're close.
JACK How do you know? I thought she lived underground?
SAYID Jack!
CHARLIE What the hell was that?
JACK Hell of a security system. Somebody trips a wire and the whole place blows up?
SAYID There's nothing here.
JACK Batteries?
SAYID Nothing.
JACK I don't get it.
SAYID She knew. She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others. So she abandoned this place, booby-trapped it, and moved on.
JACK Moved on where?
HURLEY Jack! Sayid!
CHARLIE Do you even know where we're going?
HURLEY The blast sounded like it came from this way. I think.
CHARLIE You don't know.
HURLEY Dude, what do you want from me?
CHARLIE What do I want? I want to know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere? And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries. One minute you're happy-go-lucky, good time Hurley and the next you're Colonel-bloody-Kurtz. It just doesn't make any sense. It's not you.
HURLEY Dude, you don't know me.
CHARLIE Well, all this time on the Island, you've told me nothing about yourself.
HURLEY We've all got personal stuff, dude.
CHARLIE Don't change the subject. We're lost out here. Jack and Sayid could be hurt, if not blown to bits, all because you're acting like some bloody nutter.
HURLEY I am not crazy. I've got my reasons for every-
CHARLIE I think I have a right to know.
HURLEY Okay, alright, you want to know?
CHARLIE Yep.
HURLEY About a year ago...
HURLEY Is someone shooting at us?
HURLEY You must be the French chick.
DANIELLE Who are you?
HURLEY Hurley. I, uh -- Sayid? That guy you tortured, he...
DANIELLE You were on the plane.
HURLEY Look, I came here to find -- oh, easy, easy, easy. I'm just getting your notes. Please, tell me why you wrote this. What do these numbers mean? Please.
DANIELLE I don't know.
HURLEY What? You don't know? Okay, that thing in the woods, maybe it's a monster, maybe it's a pissed off giraffe, I don't know! The fact that no one is even looking for us, yeah, that's weird, but I just go along with it because I'm along for the ride, good old fun time Hurley! Well guess what? Now, I want some friggin' answers!
DANIELLE Our ship picked up a transmission -- a voice repeating those numbers. We changed course to investigate. After we shipwrecked my team continued to search for the transmission source. It was weeks before we found the radio tower.
HURLEY There's a radio tower on this Island?
DANIELLE Yes, up by the Black Rock. Some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers while we waited for rescue. But then the sickness came. When my team was gone, I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission.
HURLEY The distress signal we heard?
DANIELLE Yes.
HURLEY But the numbers -- did you ever find out anything about them? Do you know where they got their power?
DANIELLE Power?
HURLEY They bring bad stuff to everyone around you. They're cursed. You know that, right? The numbers, they're cursed.
DANIELLE The numbers are what brought me here. As it appears they brought you. Since that time I've lost everything, everyone I cared about. So yes, I suppose you're right. They are cursed.
HURLEY Thank you. Thank you. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to agree with me. Thank you. Oh god, thank you.
JACK We need to find Hurley and Charlie and get out of this jungle. I just hate that we're going home empty handed.
CHARLIE Hey, hey, someone shot at us, Hurley and me. We were looking for you when...
SAYID Rousseau.
JACK Where's Hurley?
CHARLIE I don't know. He was right behind me and then he just, he just wasn't.
SAYID I'll go and find him.
JACK No, no. We'll all go.
HURLEY Go where?
CHARLIE Hurley, what the hell happened to you?
HURLEY Need a battery? She says, hey.
LOCKE You think of a name yet?
CLAIRE Huh?
LOCKE For the baby.
CLAIRE Haven't really thought about it. I was going to give it away, you know, for adoption.
LOCKE That must have been a difficult decision.
CLAIRE Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now. It's my birthday today.
LOCKE Why haven't you told anyone?
CLAIRE I'm pregnant, single, and on an Island in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't really matter that it's my birthday, does it?
LOCKE I guess not. At least your birthdays will be close together, you and your baby, and that's good luck.
CLAIRE Yeah, you think?
LOCKE Yeah, I do.
CLAIRE You believe in that? Luck?
LOCKE I believe in a lot of things. That should do it.
CLAIRE Okay, I give up. What is it?
CLAIRE It's a cradle.
LOCKE Happy birthday, Claire.
CLAIRE Thank you.
CHARLIE I know food's scarce, but your shirt?
HURLEY When you find a laundromat, let me know.
CHARLIE Back in the jungle before we became target practice you were going to tell me what inspired this little quest.
HURLEY I think the plane crash might have been my fault.
CHARLIE Don't be daft, how could you possibly...
HURLEY Hey, before we came here a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around.
CHARLIE What do you mean, like bad luck?
HURLEY Yeah, that's -- that would be kind of a mellow way of describing it.
CHARLIE Hurley, bad things happen, planes crash, people die.
HURLEY Dude, you gotta let me finish.
CHARLIE You think you're the only person with baggage? You know what I was doing when the plane went down? I was snorting heroin in the toilet. I was such a junkie I couldn't even take a plane ride with out having a fix. I suppose that was your fault, as well? -- So how about it?
HURLEY What?
CHARLIE I just told you the biggest secret of my life. I thought you'd want to reciprocate.
HURLEY Okay. Back home I'm worth 156 million dollars.
CHARLIE Fine. Don't tell me.
HURLEY Dude.
CHARLIE I bare my soul, and all I get is bloody jokes!
