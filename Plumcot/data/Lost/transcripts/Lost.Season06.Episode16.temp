DESMOND Do you need someone to sign for that?
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER You work here?
DESMOND I do indeed, brother.
DRIVER You a priest or something?
DESMOND Or something... Do you mind taking it around the back there?
DRIVER Yeah, sure. You got it.
DESMOND Just around there, thank you.
KATE Who died?
DESMOND A man named Christian Shephard.
KATE Christian Shephard? Seriously?
DESMOND Seriously.
KATE Friend of yours?
DESMOND Not exactly.
KATE H-hang on a second. You bust me out of jail, and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert. And you won't even tell me why were here.
DESMOND No one can tell you why you're here, Kate... Certainly not me.
KATE You're the one who brought me here.
DESMOND I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here.
KATE Who are you? What do you want?
DESMOND My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And, as for what I want--I want to leave.
KATE Leave and go where?
DESMOND Let me show you.
SAWYER You okay?
JACK Yeah. You?
SAWYER Well, to be honest, Doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.
JACK That makes two of us.
SAWYER So, you're the new Jacob, huh? Feel any different?
JACK Not really.
SAWYER Well, Doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?
JACK Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp. Just past it, well, said I'd find the place we need to protect.
KATE This place, what is it?
JACK He called it the heart of the island. All he said was that it's...it's a light.
HURLEY And that Locke Smoke Thing wants to put it out?
JACK Something like that, yeah.
HURLEY So, what if he does?
JACK Then that's it for all of us.
KATE But, if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
SAWYER 'Cause he ain't got what he needs. I'm guessing that'd be Desmond... That's where we were headed before your inauguration. Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.
JACK Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond.
SAWYER Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything.
HURLEY That's kinda of true, dude. He's worse than Yoda.
SAWYER All right. Y'all head to your heart of the island and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.
JACK If I leave a trail, can you catch up with us?
SAWYER Hell, yeah I can.
JACK Then be safe.
SAWYER I'd ask you along, but that'd take all of the fun out me telling you, you can't come.
KATE Uh, I guess I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.
HURLEY I've got a bad feeling about this.
SAYID I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are. But, you understand, I can't be held responsible for--
HURLEY Yeah, yeah. Whatever, dude.
HURLEY None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You me, tranquilizer gun?
SAYID You are insane.
HURLEY Okay, fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.
SAYID What if I don't?
HURLEY Then, that's your choice. But, if you stick with me...you'll be happy you did.
MAN Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CHARLIE "Do not disturb" sign... Who are you? Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?
HURLEY Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up.
CHARLIE Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey? I don't care about a sodding concert.
HURLEY Charlie? Charlie, what if I told you that...playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then?
CHARLIE Sod off.
HURLEY Okay, dude. Sorry about this.
SAYID What was that?
HURLEY That was Charlie.
KATE Why did you take the job, Jack?
JACK Because I was supposed to.
KATE Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?
JACK I took it because the island's all I’ve got left. It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin.
KATE You haven't ruined anything. Nothing is irreversible.
HURLEY This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
BEN As long as you’re watching, why don't you join us?
LOCKE What are you doing here, James?
SAWYER I heard Desmond fell in the well, so I came to help him get out. Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch. Oh well.
LOCKE Do you know why I'm here?
SAWYER I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island.
LOCKE That's absolutely right.
SAWYER Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship? Suicide doesn't seem like your style.
LOCKE I'm not going down with anything. But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates", absolutely are.
SAWYER We're not candidates anymore.
BEN Ahh! Ohh! Aah.
SAWYER I'll be seein' ya.
BEN You're not gonna go after him?
LOCKE I don't need to.
BEN When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively.
LOCKE Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone? I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean. That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat. Because once we get Desmond to do, what we need him to do, I'm going to sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink. I think there was a dog here.
ROSE Morning.
BERNARD Morning. Sleep okay?
DESMOND Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
BERNARD I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.
ROSE Are you gonna talk his ear off or get the man some breakfast?
BERNARD Guess I'll go check the traps for fish... Come on. Vincent. Let's go.
DESMOND So, Rose, tell me...how long have the two of you been living here?
ROSE Well, we built this place in '75 and lived here a couple of years and then the sky lit up again. So God only know when the hell we are now. So...Desmond...I don't mean to be rude, but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on. We broke our rule with you.
DESMOND What rule is that?
ROSE We don't get involved. Whatever got you tossed inside the well...that's the kind of drama Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with.
DESMOND Fair enough.
ROSE Looks like you caught something.
BERNARD I'm sorry.
LOCKE Hello, Rose... I'll make this simple. Come with me now or I'll kill them both right in front of you.
ROSE You don't have to go anywhere with him.
LOCKE I'll make it hurt.
DESMOND I want your word. You won't touch them--ever.
LOCKE Done.
DESMOND Then I'll do what you want.
LOCKE Yes, Desmond. You will.
LOCKE You have any idea where I’m taking you, Desmond?
DESMOND No. But, I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light.
LOCKE What makes you say that?
DESMOND Oh. Just a hunch.
LOCKE What was that?
BEN What was what?
MILES Linus, can you hear me? Come in...I found Alpert. Linus... Damn it! You okay?
RICHARD What--what--what happened?
MILES You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke. It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
RICHARD Locke--L...is he still here?
MILES No...I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie, he won't pick up... Come on, let's get you some help.
RICHARD Help? Help? Help from where? You still have the explosives, the--the C-4?
MILES Yeah. Why?
RICHARD Because we need to go the other island to finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane.
SAWYER Detective Ford.
MILES Jim, it's me...I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.
SAWYER You at county lockup?
MILES No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing.
SAWYER Well, it can't be Jarrah. I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.
MILES Really? Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.
SAWYER What?
MILES Help me out here, Jim. Jarrah popped four people in cold blood. Only one witness left the scene alive, right? Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay?
SAWYER Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital. Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe.
JIN 좀 어때? 
SUN 좀 쑤시네요. 
JIN 총 맞으면 다 그래.  아이가 괜찮은지 보러 의사가 곧 올거야. 아무 이상이 없으면 바로 떠나도 된대. 
SUN 떠나? 우리 어떻게 해요... 이렇게 아빠로부터 계속 도망쳐요? 
WOMAN Am I interrupting? Hi...Miss Paik. I'm Juliet Carlson. I'm here to make sure your baby's okay. You must be the daddy. I'm sorry. You don't speak English. I'm...I'll try not to talk too much.
JULIET Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit. It's a little cold... Okay. Let's take a look.
JULIET You okay?
JIN 자기야, 괜찮아? 
SUN 나... 기억이 나. 
JIN 무슨 기억? 
JULIET There it is. There's your baby.
SUN 당신 봤어요? 
JULIET Do you see that little flutter? Right there? That's the baby's heartbeat. Perfectly perfect in every way. I have your amnio results. Everything checked out. Would you like to know if it's a boy or girl?
SUN It's a girl.
JULIET Yeah.
JIN Her name is Ji Yeon.
JULIET That's a lovely name... And for the record, y-you two speak English just fine. Congratulations.
HURLEY Whoa!
SAWYER Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me...I found Locke. The son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island. You had it right, Doc. Good news is, Desmond got out of that well. So, if we can find him before Smokey can--
JACK It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James. We're all going to the same place anyway.
SAWYER Then what?
JACK Then it ends.
JACK Hello, Mr. Locke.
LOCKE Dr. Shephard. Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me John.
JACK Okay, John. I thought I'd stop by and say hi before we started the anesthesia. You nervous?
LOCKE Are you sure this is going to work?
JACK Yes. I'm very confident that it will.
LOCKE Really?
JACK Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you...but, I'm trying to make you feel better.
LOCKE Okay. Okay, let's do it.
JACK All right. I'll see you on the other side.
LOCKE Hey, Doctor, back at L.A.X. when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up?
JACK As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning. They, uh, they found the coffin.
LOCKE Oh, good.
JACK Actually, it might be here already.
LOCKE Well, I hope that brings you some peace.
JACK If I can fix you, Mr. Locke, that's all the peace I'll need.
RICHARD It's gonna be a hell of a storm.
MILES Welcome to the club. 
RICHARD What?
MILES Do you mind?
MILES Looks like you got your first grey hair.
MILES What are you smiling about?
RICHARD I think I just realized that I wanna live.
MILES Well, it's good timing.
RICHARD What was that?
FRANK Help!
RICHARD Hey! Miles, up ahead!
FRANK Hey! Wha...
MILES Get him some water.
FRANK What are you guys doing out here?
RICHARD We're going to Hydra island to blow up the plane.
FRANK What do you want to do that for?
RICHARD Because the black smoke wants to get off the island. We have to stop that thing from leaving.
FRANK Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.
RICHARD And how are we going to do that?
FRANK In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.
LOCKE Well, this is gonna be interesting.
SAWYER Kate! Kate!
KATE You killed them!
SAWYER Kate! 
LOCKE You might wanna save your bullets.
LOCKE So it's you.
JACK Yeah. It's me.
LOCKE Jacob being who he is, I expected to be a little more surprised. You're sort of the obvious choice, don't you think?
JACK He didn't choose me. I volunteered.
LOCKE I assume you're here to stop me.
JACK I can't stop you. In fact, I uh, wanna go with you.
LOCKE I'm sorry, Jack. I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do.
JACK No I'm not. No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest. To the place that I've sworn that I'll protect. And then you think you're gonna destroy the Island.
LOCKE I think?
JACK That's right. Because that's not what's gonna happen.
LOCKE Then what's gonna happen, Jack?
JACK I'm gonna kill you.
LOCKE How do you plan to do that?
JACK That's a surprise.
LOCKE Okay. Then let's get on with it.
JULIET Doctor.
JACK Doctor.
JACK I didn't know you were working today.
JULIET I just finished. Did you get the tickets for the concert?
JACK Yep. Right here. 
DAVID Hey dad, did you remember the tickets?
JACK I just gave 'em to your mom.
DAVID Uh, who's gonna take yours?
JACK Well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt Claire. I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
JULIET Oh yeah, it's fine with me. In fact I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married.
JACK Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant.
JULIET Good luck on your surgery, doctor.
JACK Thank you.
JULIET Did you pick out a tie?
DAVID I did.
SAWYER Hi. I'm detective Ford, L.A.P.D.
RECEPTIONIST M-hm.
SAWYER I'm looking for a patient's room. Sun Paik.
SAWYER Something you wanna share with the rest of us, Doc?
JACK What's that?
SAWYER You said you were gonna kill Locke. What's your surprise?
JACK Desmond.
SAWYER How's that gonna work?
JACK I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob would have brought him all the way back to this Island just so Locke could make him destroy it.
SAWYER So, what, Desmond is bait?
JACK No. I think he's a weapon.
SAWYER That's a hell of a long con, Doc.
LOCKE Jack, Desmond. It should just be the three of us from here on.
HURLEY Jack. I believe in you, dude.
LOCKE Gonna be a bad one.
LOCKE We're here.
DESMOND This doesn't matter, you know.
JACK Excuse me?
DESMOND Him destroying the Island, you destroying him. It doesn't matter. You know, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else. A place where we can be with the ones we love, and not have to ever think about this damn Island again. And you know the best part, Jack?
JACK What?
DESMOND You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there too.
JACK Desmond, I tried that once. There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. Trust me, I know. All of this matters.
LOCKE Shall we?
SAYID What are we doing here?
HURLEY I'm not allowed to tell you.
SAYID What do you mean you're not allowed?
HURLEY There are rules, dude.
SAYID Whose rules?
HURLEY Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you.
SAYID And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust?
HURLEY I think you're a good guy, Sayid. You know, a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. You can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself.
SAYID I'm sorry. You clearly don't know anything about me.
HURLEY I know a lot about you, dude.
HURLEY Looks like a gnarly fight.
SHANNON Hey, leave my brother alone.
SAYID Hey, it's alright.
SHANNON Sayid.
SAYID Shannon.
BOONE I just got pounded, man. Thanks for taking your sweet time.
HURLEY It takes as long as it takes.
BOONE It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia.
HURLEY Yeah, but dude, it was worth it.
BOONE Should I go get 'em?
HURLEY Nah, let's give 'em a minute.
MILES Linus, are you there?
SAWYER What the hell is that?
BEN Miles, where are you?
MILES We just got to Hydra Island. We're on our way to the plane.
BEN Miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane.
MILES We're not gonna blow it up, we're gonna fly it the hell off the Island. Just get over here now.
FRANK What in the hell?
MILES Claire.
KATE Miles, it's Kate. Did you say Claire? Is she okay?
MILES Put the gun down.
CLAIRE Don't come any closer!
KATE Miles? Miles, what happened? Miles, are you there?
CLAIRE He sent you here to kill me, didn't he?
RICHARD No, listen. We're not with Locke.
CLAIRE Why should I believe you?
RICHARD Because we have a real chance to get far far away from him. We can be free from everything he ever did to us, and never look back. We can go home.
RICHARD Will you come with us, Claire?
CLAIRE No. 
LOCKE All right we...we lower him down nice and easy.
JACK You know what to do once you get down there?
DESMOND Aye. I go where the light's brightest.
JACK Don't get yourself killed.
LOCKE This remind you of anything, Jack?
JACK What?
LOCKE Desmond...going down into a hole in the ground. If there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it. It'd be just like old times.
JACK You're not John Locke. You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about most everything. I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.
LOCKE He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that.
JACK Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.
JULIET Oh...it's the hospital
DAVID Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.
JULIET I'm so sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. 
DAVID I know. It's cool. Go.
JULIET We'll get to know each other better, I hope?
CLAIRE Yeah, yeah, sure... Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid.
CHARLOTTE Oi... Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up.
CHARLIE Hey, What you doin'?
CHARLOTTE I'm just following the instructions... You're in the band, aren't you?
CHARLIE How do you know that?
CHARLIE Oh...I was shot by a fat man. It's all right.
CHARLOTTE Excuse me... Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is?
DANIEL I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?
CHARLOTTE I-I think he's in the band.
DANIEL Yes, yes. Of course. He’s the bass player from Drive Shaft. They're accompanying me tonight. I play piano...I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.
CHARLOTTE I'm Charlotte.
DANIEL It's a great pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE You, too.
CLAIRE Well, lead the way.
DAVID Excuse me. Is this table 23?
DESMOND Aye, indeed it is.
KATE Claire.
CLAIRE I...
DESMOND You two know each other?
MAN ON MICROPHONE Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention, please? Welcome to this very special benefit concert for the Golden State Natural History Museum. I'm Dr. Pierre Chang. Thank you. I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us. So, let's get to it, shall we? It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Daniel Widmore accompanied by Drive Shaft.
CLAIRE Mm.
DAVID You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah, yeah. I'm just--I'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll--I'll be right back...
DESMOND Aah! Aah! Aah!
DESMOND Uhh!
DESMOND No! No!
LOCKE It looks like...you were wrong... Goodbye, Jack.
LOCKE Uhh!
JACK Looks like you were wrong, too.
CLAIRE Oh, hello. Hello? Hi, uh, do you know where the bathroom is? Umm. Oh.
KATE Uh, can you please get a doctor?
KATE Small world, huh?
CLAIRE Yeah, well, what are you doing--mm! Oh!
KATE Oh! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Come on. Sit down.
CLAIRE Um, I-I think he's coming.
ELOISE I thought I made it clear that you were to stop this.
DESMOND Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore you.
ELOISE And once they know...what then?
DESMOND We're leaving.
ELOISE Are you going to take my son?
DESMOND Not with me...no.
CLAIRE Uhh!
KATE Just breathe, okay? Just breathe, breathe, breathe. Help is on the way.
CLAIRE Mnh-mnh! It's hap--it's happening. Like--like, right now.
KATE Right now... Um. Okay. I'm...I'm gonna get you comfortable. I want you to relax and breathe, all right? Just relax and breathe.
CLAIRE Who are you?
CHARLIE I'm with the band.
CLAIRE Uhh!
KATE Listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please?
CHARLIE Water and blankets?
KATE Yeah. All right. Uh...this is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing
CLAIRE I'm not ready. I'm really scared.
KATE I'm scared too, all right? Really scared. But I'm gonna need you to push because I can't do it without you. Okay? Okay? One, two, three. Push! Good, that's good. Okay, we’re gonna try again. You’re doin' good. One, two, three. Push!
KATE Push, push again.
CLAIRE Oh!
CLAIRE Shh... It's Aaron. It's...
CHARLIE I brought a blanket.
KATE Thank you.
CHARLIE It's just a blanket.
KATE Then go ahead and bring it to her.
CHARLIE Couldn't find any water.
CLAIRE Charlie.
CHARLIE Claire? Claire.
CHARLIE Hi, Aaron. Hey. Shh. It's okay... Hey, Aaron.
DESMOND Do you understand?
KATE So now what?
BEN Hugo, get out the way!
BEN Ohh!
JACK Desmond! Desmond!
KATE We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
SAWYER It's too damn heavy. There's no way we're gettin' it off him.
HURLEY We have to try.
KATE One...two...three!
KATE What is happening?
SAWYER I'll tell you what's happening! Locke was right! This Island's goin' down!
MILES Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Come in!
KATE Miles. Is that you?
MILES Yeah. What the hell is happening?
KATE Are you with Claire?
MILES She's here, but she doesn't want to come with us.
KATE Come with you where?
MILES Lapidus is working on the plane right now. Then we’re taking off... Hey, how much longer 'til we get this thing in the air?
LAPIDUS I still have to check the electrical and the hydraulics. Five hours, maybe six.
RICHARD You've got maybe one.
MILES Get your asses over here! We're leaving in an hour!
SAWYER Son of a bitch! How the hell are we supposed to get over there?
BEN I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat.
JACK LOCKE!
LOCKE I want you to know Jack, you died for nothing!
KATE I saved you a bullet!
LOCKE You're too late.
NURSE Nice work, Dr. Shephard. What happened to your neck?
JACK Damn it.
JACK OK, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower and see if I can catch up with David before the concert's over. Just give me a call if you need me.
NURSE Dr. Shephard? He's waking up. I watched the anesthesiologist...he got the full dosage.
JACK OK. I'll take it from here. Mr. Locke. Can you hear me? John, are you awake?
JACK You just had major surgery so I need you to try not to move and just relax, OK?
LOCKE It worked.
JACK Uh...it went well...but we wont know how you responded to the surgery--
LOCKE No, Dr. Shephard, it worked. I can feel my legs.
JACK John, it's highly unlikely that you would regain sensation that quickly so lets just take it slo--
LOCKE Oh.
LOCKE Oh. Did you see that?
JACK See what?
LOCKE You don't remember?
JACK Um... Mr. Locke Please just, ah, just relax. What we need to do...
LOCKE What we need to do is go...
JACK No, no, no...hey. John...
LOCKE Will you come with me?
JACK We're not going anywhere. You just had extensive spinal surgery and I...I need to see my son.
LOCKE You don't have a son.
JACK What?
LOCKE You don't have a son, Jack.
NURSE Doctor?
JACK Jean, um, would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest? I need to go.
LOCKE Jack...I hope that somebody does for you what you just did for me.
KATE Oh my god.
JACK Ahh.
KATE Jack...
JACK I'm fine. Just find me some thread and I can count to five.
SAWYER Hey! Oh my god. What the hell happened?
KATE Locke's dead...it's over.
SAWYER Sure don't feel like it's over.
SAWYER Excuse me, Miss...Paik?
SUN Yes.
SAWYER Hi. I'm Detective Ford, LAPD. I'm sorry I heard you were shot, I didn't expect you to be checking out so soon. Hey.
JIN Hello. Detective.
SAWYER Well I came by to check if you've seen this man. He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you. I'm gonna assign a uniform to keep an eye on you until we can app--
SUN You don't have to do that.
SAWYER All due respect, I have a job to do here ma'am. I need to keep you safe.
SUN It's okay, I am safe.
JIN We'll see you there.
SAWYER See me where?
FRANK Alright. It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work. Gotta reset the electronics.
FRANK Something's wrong with the hydraulics down at the nose wheel. You know any guys mechanical? Yeah?
MILES Well, I--I worked for a--a contractor renovating apartments for a couple of summers--
FRANK Take that! And this, and this. Go down there and make sure everything's hooked up right. Go!
BEN Lapidus?
FRANK Yeah?
BEN Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable?
FRANK Don't bother me!
BEN Sounds like they're making progress.
SAWYER We gotta go now.
KATE I don't understand. Locke's dead, why is this still happening?
JACK Because whatever Desmond turned off...I need to turn it back on again. But if it doesn't work, if I don't get it done you all need to leave now. You need to get on that plane.
KATE You can come with us too, Jack. You don't have to do this.
JACK No I do have to do this.
KATE No, you don't! Let the Island sink, Jack.
JACK Kate...I can't. You think you can get that boat across the channel in time?
SAWYER Yeah, I can manage.
JACK Good luck to you, James.
SAWYER Thanks, doc...for everything.
BEN James!
BEN If the Island's going down, I'm going down with it.
JACK Hugo, you better get going.
HURLEY Uh-uh, no way. You think I'm going down that? I'm with you, dude.
JACK Okay. Kate...you gotta go. Get Claire on that plane.
KATE Tell me I'm gonna see you again.
KATE I love you.
JACK I love you.
RICHARD Can you fix it?
MILES I don't believe in a lot of things but I do believe in duct tape. Yeah, I think we're good.
MILES Let's get the hell out of here.
SAWYER Yo Chesty, Sawyer and Kate...
RICHARD Yeah?
SAWYER We're on our way down to the sailboat then we're heading to you...don't leave without us.
LAPIDUS We're getting off the ground while there's still ground to get off. So if you wanna go you better get your asses in gear.
SAWYER Lapidus! Lapidus! Son of a bitch.
KATE What now?
SAWYER We jump.
KATE I'll see you at the boat.
SAWYER Kate!
SAWYER Hey, you know where I could get some grub around here?
JACK Uhh... the cafeteria's closed, but there's a vending machine down the hallway.
SAWYER Thanks, doc.
JACK Yeah, no problem.
SAWYER Oh, come on...
SAWYER Unbelievable.
JULIET Can I help you?
SAWYER It's okay... I'm a... I'm a cop.
JULIET Mmmm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights?
SAWYER That's funny.
JULIET Mmmm... Can I tell you a secret?
SAWYER Please.
JULIET If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again... the candy just drops right down.
SAWYER Is that right?
JULIET Yes, and it's technically legal.
SAWYER Oh... give that a shot...
SAWYER Oops...
JULIET It worked.
JULIET Oh...
SAWYER Whoa... did you feel that?
JULIET We should get coffee some time.
SAWYER I'd love to but the machine ate my dollar, I only got one left.
JULIET We can go dutch.
SAWYER Juliet? Juliet it's--it's me. Ju--
SAWYER It's me babe... I gotcha... I gotcha babe.
JULIET Kiss me, James!
SAWYER You got it blondie...
KATE It's over.
JACK Excuse me?
KATE The concert. It's over. You lookin' for someone?
JACK Yeah, my son. I was supposed to bring him here tonight, and then... I couldn't come, and...
JACK I'm sorry, where do I remember you from?
KATE I stole your pen.
JACK What?
KATE Uh... Oceanic 815, from Sydney? I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom, and I stole your pen.
JACK And that's how I know you?
KATE No... that's not how you know me.
KATE I missed you so much.
KATE Are you okay?
JACK What is happening to me? Wh--who are you? I don't--
KATE I know, you don't understand Jack. But if you come with me... you will.
JACK It's over there.
HURLEY How are we getting down there?
JACK We're not, I'm going alone.
HURLEY Dude, you can't go down there alone. If Desmond didn't make it, how the hell are you going to survive?
HURLEY No. No way, I'm not gonna let you die.
JACK Hurley, I'm already dead.
HURLEY You said you'd protect the Island!
JACK And that's what I'm doing.
HURLEY You're committing suicide!
JACK I'm not, this is the way it has to happen! This is what I'm supposed to do.
HURLEY You're not supposed to die! The Island needs you!
JACK Hurley... it needs you.
HURLEY What?
JACK It needs to be you, Hugo.
HURLEY I can't... it's supposed to be you!
JACK It was only supposed to be me so I can do this. But if someone has to take care of the Island, if someone has to protect it then... then it should be you. Hurley... I believe in you.
HURLEY Alright I'll take it. But it's only temporary, as soon as you get that light back in, I'm pulling you up, and I'm giving it right back to you, deal?!
JACK Deal.
JACK Do you have anything to drink? Anything to drink out of... uh... a cup, a canteen?
BEN I do. Is that okay?
JACK It's perfect.
JACK Drink this.
HURLEY Is that it?
JACK Now you're like me.
FRANK Second time's a charm. It better be because we sure as hell don't have the battery power for a third time.
RICHARD That good?
FRANK That my friends, is pure music!
HURLEY Easy. Easy. Easy.
JACK Ah, ahh.
JACK Desmond! Desmond? Can you hear me?
DESMOND The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place.
JACK I got you. Come on. Come on.
DESMOND I'm still here. You were right Jack.
JACK Well, there's a first time for everything.
DESMOND I have to put it back. It was like a drain.
JACK That's what you did, you took that stone out of that hole over there?
DESMOND Jack you can't, even if you turn it back on it'll kill you. It has to be me!
JACK Desmond, you've done enough. You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son.
DESMOND What about you, Jack?
JACK I'll see you in another life, brother.
KATE Claire?!
SAWYER Oh, that ain't good.
FRANK Miles, go look out the door! You gotta be my eyes while I back this outta here! Richard, go tell me what he says!
KATE Claire! Are you okay?
SAWYER Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
KATE Claire, come on please!
CLAIRE I can't!
KATE Why?!
CLAIRE Look at me! This Island's made me crazy, I--I don't want Aaron to see me like this. I don't even know how to be a mother anymore.
KATE Listen to me, none of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Come on, let's go.
FRANK Are we clear?!
RICHARD Are we clear?!
MILES Yeah looks like it to me!
RICHARD He says we're good!
FRANK You better pray we are Ricky boy, because I'm gonna spin her around! Hold on!
KATE Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell him we're coming!
SAWYER Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on!
FRANK Alright, we're good to go!
FRANK Let's go!
FRANK What the hell? Boys we got some late arrivals, open the door. Come on!
FRANK We're running out of time!
MILES Way to wait until the last second, Jim.
SAWYER Good to see you too, Enos.
RICHARD We got 'em!
FRANK Everybody buckle up tight! Hold on!
FRANK Here we go, Frank.
FRANK Come on. Come on.
FRANK Amen.
BEN He did it, the light's back on.
HURLEY Dude, pull!
HURLEY Hang on, Jack!
HURLEY Got him...Desmond? No...Jack! Jack!
LOCKE Thank you.
LOCKE Hello Benjamin.
BEN Hello John.
LOCKE Is everyone already inside?
BEN I believe most of them are, yes.

HURLEY Jack's...gone...isn't he?
BEN He did his job, Hugo.
HURLEY It's my job now... What the hell am I supposed to do?
BEN I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.
HURLEY But how? People can't leave the Island.
BEN That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.
HURLEY Will you help me?
BEN I'm sorry?
HURLEY I could really use someone with like, experience. For a little while. Will you help me, Ben?
BEN I'd be honored.
HURLEY Cool.
HURLEY Oh, hey dude.
BEN Hello, Hugo!
HURLEY We're all inside.
BEN I don't think I'm coming in.
HURLEY You know, you were a real good number two.
BEN And you were a great number one, Hugo.
