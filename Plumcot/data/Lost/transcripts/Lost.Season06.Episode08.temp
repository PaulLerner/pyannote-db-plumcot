JACOB Извини, что не смог прийти раньше 
ILANA Я очень рада тебя видеть 
JACOB I'm here because I need your help. Will you help me, Ilana?
ILANA Yes.
JACOB There are six people I need you to protect. I'm gonna give you a list of their names. This is what you've been preparing for.
ILANA Are these people... who are they?
JACOB They're the remaining candidates.
JACK Candidates? Candidates for what?
SUN To replace Jacob. She said I was one of them and so are you and so is Hurley.
LAPIDUS Well, that's great. So what do we do now?
ILANA I don't know.
JACK Then, who does?
ILANA After I've brought them to the temple, what do I do?
JACOB Ask Ricardus, he'll know what to do next.
HURLEY Who's Ricardus?
ILANA He is. So, Richard, what do we do next?
RICHARD Uhh.. I have no idea what we do next. You didn't tell your friends that I was trying to kill myself when you found me? That sounds like someone who has a plan?
ILANA Why would Jacob say you knew what to do if--
RICHARD Because everything he ever said is a lie.
JACK What are you talking about?
RICHARD You wanna know a secret, Jack? Something I've known a long, long time. You're dead.
HURLEY You mean that figuratively right?
RICHARD No, I mean literally. We are all dead, every single one of us. And this, this, all this, it's not what you think it is. We're not on an island, we never were. We're in Hell. So, I'm not interested in what Jacob said. In fact, maybe it's time to stop listening to him, and we started listening to someone else, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
JACK What are you doing?
ILANA I'm going after Richard.
JACK Why? You heard him he doesn't... doesn't know what we need to do next.
ILANA He knows! Jacob told me. He has to know.
JACK Alpert has lost his mind. He thinks that we're, we're in hell. If he cared about what Jacob said, he wouldn't be talking about, about listening to someone else.
JACK Wait, you know who he meant?
BEN Oh, this should be interesting.
JACK What?
SUN He meant Locke.
JACK Locke is dead.
BEN If it's any consolation, it's not exactly Locke.
HURLEY ¿Por qué? Que no sé. Sí, yo te puedo ayudar, pero yo no sé como encontrarlo si no sé cómo.... Why? I don't know. Yes, I can help you, but... I don't know how to find him.
JACK Hurley! What's he saying?
HURLEY Uh, what's who saying?
JACK Jacob, I saw you talking to him.
HURLEY I'm not talking to Jacob.
JACK Don't lie to me. Please, if you know something, anything that can help us figure out--
HURLEY It's not Jacob, man!
JACK Then, who is it?
Hurley Sorry Jack, but this has nothing to do with you.
BEN Shephard is right, you know.
ILANA Right about what?
BEN Richard. Going after him is a waste of time. He doesn't know anything.
ILANA And what makes you so sure?
BEN I've known him since I was twelve years old, that should count for something.
LAPIDUS So you guys met when you were kids, huh?
BEN No Frank, I was a kid. Richard looked just like he does today.
LAPIDUS You're saying this guy doesn't age.
BEN That's exactly what I'm saying.
LAPIDUS And how the hell do you think that happened?
ISABELLA ¿Eres tú, Ricardo? 
RICHARD Sí, soy yo. 
RICHARD Vuelve a dormir, Isabella. 
RICHARD Estás hirviendo. 
ISABELLA Estoy bien. 
RICHARD Voy a buscar al doctor. Si Dios quiere, mi amor, regreso antes del amanecer. 
RICHARD Espero que tengamos suficiente. 
ISABELLA Dale esto al doctor. 
RICARDO No, no, no, no, Isabella, no. 
ISABELLA Tómalo, mi amor. 
RICHARD Si algo te pasa... 
ISABELLA Cierra tus ojos. Siempre estaremos juntos. 
RICHARD Te voy a salvar. 
SERVANT ¡No, no puede entrar, no! ¡No puede usted, no debe entrar, no puede pasar! 
RICHARD Perdón, perdón... Perdóneme usted, pero no podía esperar, mi mujer está muy enferma, señor. 
DOCTOR Dale unas cobijas. 
RICHARD Muchísimas gracias, señor. 
DOCTOR No son para ti, me estás goteando el piso. 
RICHARD Mi esposa está tosiendo sangre. Ella lo necesita, por favor, señor. 
DOCTOR ¿Dónde viven? 
RICHARD Cerca de El Socorro. 
DOCTOR ¿El Socorro? Ese es un viaje de medio día. Yo no voy a cabalgar hasta allá con esta lluvia torrencial. Tengo una medicina que le puede salvar la vida, pero es muy cara. 
RICHARD Sí, sí, claro, lo que sea. Sí, muchísimas gracias, señor. .]
DOCTOR ¿Esto es todo lo que tienes? 
RICHARD Ahora lo tiene todo. 
DOCTOR Esto no vale nada. 
RICHARD No, no, no. No, por favor, señor. Haré lo que sea para pagarle. Por favor, se lo ruego... 
DOCTOR ¡Suéltame! ¡Quítame las manos de encima! ¡Te he dicho..! ¡Quítame las manos de encima! 
RICHARD Isabella, Isabella.
FATHER SUAREZ Te traje un poco de comida, hijo mío. 
RICHARD No tengo hambre, padre. 
FATHER SUAREZ Tal vez la tendrás después. ¿Me permites ver tu Biblia? 
FATHER SUAREZ ¿Está en inglés? 
RICHARD Sí. Yo me he estado enseñando yo mismo. Isabella... mi esposa y yo íbamos a ir al Nuevo Mundo. Queríamos comenzar una familia, una vida nueva. 
FATHER SUAREZ ¿Estás listo para confesarte? 
RICHARD In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amén. Perdóneme, padre, porque he pecado. Padre, yo... yo maté a un hombre. De verdad me arrepiento. Y le ruego, le ruego, padre, por el perdón de Dios. 
FATHER SUAREZ No.
RICHARD ¿Cómo? 
FATHER SUAREZ No te puedo otorgar la absolución por un asesinato. 
RICHARD Padre, fue un accidente, yo no quería matar a ese señor. 
FATHER SUAREZ Pero lo hiciste. 
RICHARD Por favor, Padre, debe de haber alguna manera para recibir el perdón de Dios 
FATHER SUAREZ La única manera de regresar a Su gracia es a través de la penitencia. 
RICHARD Sí, claro, haré lo que sea. 
FATHER SUAREZ ¡Pero tú no tienes tiempo para nada! Porque mañana... mañana te van a colgar. 
FATHER SUAREZ No, hijo mío. Me temo que el diablo te espera en el infierno. Que Dios tenga misericordia de tu alma. awaits you in hell. May God have mercy on your soul.]
FATHER SUAREZ Véndenle los ojos. 
RICHARD Señor, por favor, perdona mis pecados, estoy penitente y arrepentido (x4, not clear) 
JONAS Is this him?
FATHER SUAREZ Yes.
RICHARD ¿Qué están haciendo?
PRIEST ¡Estate quieto!
JONAS You say he speaks English?
FATHER SUAREZ Yes, Mr Whitfield.
JONAS Do you speak English?
JONAS I asked do you speak English? Take him away and bring me another. Hang him.
RICHARD Yes! I speak English! I speak English!
JONAS Wait! You have strong hands, what sort of work did you do?
RICHARD I worked...I worked in the fields.
JONAS I understand you were interested in going to the New World?
RICHARD Yes.
JONAS Well then, this is your lucky day. Thank you Father.
JONAS This man is now the property of Captain Magnus Hanso. Hope you don't get seasick.
RICHARD Ignacio. ¿Puedes ver algo? 
IGNACIO Está demasiado oscuro. ¡Espera, puedo ver tierra! ¡Veo la costa! ¡Es una isla! 
IGNACIO ¡Veo el Diablo! ¡Esta isla está protegida por el Diablo! ! The island is guarded by the devil!]
IGNACIO Dios nos tuvo piedad. Al menos, a algunos de nosotros. 
VOICE FROM OUTSIDE THE SHIP Do you see anything?
OTHER VOICE No, no.
JONAS You, Pierce, bring me the Captain.
PIERCE Sir, Captain Hanso is dead.
JONAS Good God we're in the middle of the bloody jungle!
RICHARD ¡Ayuda! ¡Ayuda! ¡Aquí abajo! Help, help, down here!
OTHER PRISONER ¡Estamos vivos! ¡Estamos aquí abajo! 
OTHER PRISONER ¡Gracias Dios, gracias! ¡Muchas gracias! 
IGNACIO No!
RICHARD No, stop! Stop!
RICHARD No! Stop!
RICHARD No! What are you doing?
IGNACIO Se lo ruego. No lo haga. No lo haga, por favor. 
JONAS We are shipwrecked in the middle of the jungle. We have no fresh water, and limited supplies, and there are only five officers left.
RICHARD Why, why are you doing this?
JONAS Because if I freed you, it'd only be a matter of time before you tried to kill me.
RICHARD No!
JONAS What happened up there?
JONAS I said report!
RICHARD Santo Padre que estás en el cielo, santificado sea Tu nombre, vénganos Tu reino. 
RICHARD ¡Vete de aquí! ¡Te voy a matar! ¡Te voy a matar! 
ISABELLA ¿Hola? ¿Hay alguien aquí? ¿Se encuentra alguien aquí? 
RICHARD Sí... ¡Sí, estoy aquí! ¿Isabella? 
ISABELA Ricardo... Ricardo...
RICHARD No lo entiendo. ¿Cómo estás tú aquí? 
ISABELLA ¿No lo sabes, Ricardo? Estamos muertos los dos. Estamos en el infierno. Estoy aquí para salvarte antes de que regrese "él". . I'm here to save you before he comes back.]
RICHARD ¿Cómo? ¿Antes de que regrese quién? 
ISABELLA El diablo. .]
RICHARD ¿El diablo? ?]
ISABELLA Yo miré en sus ojos, y todo lo que vi fue maldad. ¿Tú lo has visto, Ricardo? 
RICHARD Sí, yo creo que sí. 
RICHARD Mi amor... 
ISABELLA Tenemos que salir de aquí. 
RICHARD ¡Corre! ¡Vete, vete! ¡Corre, mi amor! No... debes irte, ¡ya vete! 
ISABELLA No puedo. 
RICHARD ¡No! ¡Dije que te iba a salvar, mi amor! ¡No! ¡Dije que te iba a salvar, y lo haré, mi amor! Por favor. 
ISABELLA ¡Ricardo, por favor! ¡Tengo miedo! 
RICHARD Yo sé, pero... ¡si me quieres, vete! ¡Vete! 
RICHARD ¡No, no! ¡Déjala en paz! ¡Déjala! ¡Déjala en paz, por favor! ¡¿Isabella?! ¡¿Isabella?! 
MAN IN BLACK Shhh. Here, water.
RICHARD Who are you?
MAN IN BLACK A friend.
RICHARD I am... in Hell?
MAN IN BLACK Yes, I'm afraid you are.
RICHARD You... you were not on the ship.
MAN IN BLACK I was here long before your ship.
RICHARD Did... did you see my, my wife?
MAN IN BLACK I'm sorry?
RICHARD Isabella, my wife. She was here. She was. But then the black smoke came and she ran.
MAN IN BLACK And she hasn't come back?
MAN IN BLACK That probably means he has her.
RICHARD Who?
MAN IN BLACK I think you know who.
RICHARD If she's alive I must save her, please, please help.
MAN IN BLACK Of course. Of Course I'll help. I want to be free too.
MAN IN BLACK As luck would have it, I found these on one of the officers outside. I think they'll work. But before I try, I need to know that you will help me.
RICHARD Yes, yes, yes, I do of course.
MAN IN BLACK You'd do anything I ask?
RICHARD Yes yes, anything, yes, I promise.
MAN IN BLACK Then we're agreed.
RICHARD Thank you.
MAN IN BLACK Of course my friend. It's good to see you out of those chains.
RICHARD Thank you.
MAN IN BLACK Got to get you on your feet. Gonna need your strength if we're going to escape.
RICHARD Escape?
MAN IN BLACK That's right. I'm afraid there's only one way to escape from Hell. You're going to have to kill the Devil.
MAN IN BLACK When you're finished eating, you walk due west. Once you get to the ocean, you'll be able to see the Statue.
RICHARD What statue?
MAN IN BLACK Your ship smashed through it, on its way inland. Broke it into pieces. That's where you'll find the Devil.
MAN IN BLACK You only have one chance. Put this through his chest. Do not hesitate, do not let him say a word. If he speaks, it will already be too late. He can be very persuasive.
RICHARD How, how can I kill him with this, he's...black smoke.
MAN IN BLACK No. I am.
RICHARD My wife Isabella, she was running from you?
MAN IN BLACK She was running from him. I'm sorry. I saw him take her but I couldn't do anything to stop it.
RICHARD But if you are the black smoke...
MAN IN BLACK You aren't the only one who's lost something, my friend. The Devil betrayed me. He took my body. My humanity.
RICHARD You killed the officers on the ship.
MAN IN BLACK I'm not the one you need to worry about. The Devil has your wife, and you are going to have to kill him if you ever want to get her back.
RICHARD Murder is wrong. That is what brought me here.
MAN IN BLACK My friend, you and I can talk all day long about what's right or wrong, but the question before you remains the same - "Do you ever want to see your wife again?"
RICHARD Yes I do.
JACOB What are you doing here? Who gave you this?
RICHARD Where is my wife?
JACOB What?
RICHARD Where is my wife?
JACOB I don't know your wife. Did she come here on the ship?
RICHARD No, she's dead.
JACOB Then why are you asking me where she is? Did you meet a man in the jungle dressed in black?
RICHARD Yes.
JACOB What did he tell you?
RICHARD He said you are the devil.
JACOB And?
RICHARD He said the only way I would see my wife again is if I kill you. I - I saw her, here, in this place. Where is she?
JACOB That wasn't your wife.
RICHARD Yes, it was! She's dead, just like me.
JACOB You're not dead.
RICHARD I am in Hell. I know that I am in Hell.
JACOB You really think you're dead?
RICHARD Where else would I be?
JACOB Alright then.
RICHARD What are you doing? What are you doing?
JACOB Still think you're dead?!
RICHARD Stop!
JACOB Still think you're dead?! Why should I stop?
RICHARD Because I want to live!
JACOB That's the first sensible thing you've said. What's your name?
RICHARD Ricardo.
JACOB Ricardo... Get up, we need to talk.
RICHARD What is inside?
JACOB No one comes in unless I invite them in. 
RICHARD Are you the Devil?
JACOB No.
RICHARD Then who are you?
JACOB My name is Jacob. I'm the one who brought your ship to this island.
RICHARD You brought it here? Why?
JACOB Think of this wine as what you keep calling hell. There's many other names for it too malevolence, evil, darkness. And here it is, swirling around in the bottle, unable to get out because if it did, it would spread. The cork is this island and it's the only thing keeping the darkness where it belongs. That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it's in their very nature to sin. I bring people here to prove him wrong. And when they get here, their past doesn't matter.
RICHARD Before you brought my ship, there were others?
JACOB Yes, many.
RICHARD What happened to them?
JACOB They're all dead.
RICHARD But if you brought them here, why didn't you help them?
JACOB Because I wanted them to help themselves. To know the difference between right and wrong without me having to tell them. It's all meaningless if I have to force them to do anything. Why should I have to step in?
RICHARD If you don't, he will.
JACOB Do you want a job?
RICHARD A job?
RICHARD Doing what?
JACOB Well, I don't want to step in. Maybe you can do it for me. You can be my...my representative and intermediary between me and the people I bring to the island.
RICHARD What will I get in return?
JACOB You tell me.
RICHARD I want my wife back.
JACOB Can't do that.
RICHARD Can you absolve me of my sins so I don't go to Hell?
JACOB I can't do that either.
RICHARD I never want to die. I want to live forever.
JACOB Now that...
JACOB ...I can do.
MAN IN BLACK You let him talk to you, didn't you?
RICHARD He told me to give you this.
MAN IN BLACK I'm sure you realize that if you go with him, you'll never see your wife again? I understand. He can be very... convincing. But I want you to know if you ever change your mind, and I mean ever, my offer still stands.
MAN IN BLACK I have something for you.
MAN IN BLACK You must've dropped it. I found it on the ship.
RICHARD Adiós, mi amor. 
RICHARD I've changed my mind. Are you listening to me? I've changed my mind. I was wrong. You said I could change my mind. You said the offer would stand. Does the offer still stand? Does the offer still stand?! Does the offer still stand?!
HURLEY What offer, dude?
RICHARD What the Hell are you doing here? Did you follow me?
HURLEY Well, kind of.
RICHARD Get out! Get out!
HURLEY Hey!
RICHARD Didn't you hear what I said?!
HURLEY I was just trying--
RICHARD I told you people, I don't know anything!
HURLEY Just calm down!
RICHARD Why did you follow me?!
HURLEY Your wife sent me.
RICHARD What did you say?
HURLEY I said your wife sent me. Isabella. She wants to know why you buried her cross.
RICHARD H--how do you know about that?
HURLEY Because she just told me.
RICHARD What do you mean, just told you?
HURLEY Isabella saw you dig it up, man. She's standing right next to you.
ISABELLA Él no te cree. 
HURLEY A veces a las personas les toma un poco. .]
RICHARD I--I don't see her.
ISABELLA Dile que su inglés es magnífico. 
HURLEY She's right there. She says your English is awesome.
RICHARD ¿Estás tú realmente aquí? 
ISABELLA Cierra tus ojos.
HURLEY She wants you to close your eyes. It's okay, I'll tell you what she says.
ISABELLA No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo.
HURLEY No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo. 
ISABELLA Por más que quisiste salvarme, era mi hora. 
ISABELLA Ya has sufrido suficiente, Ricardo. 
RICHARD Te extraño, yo... Yo haría cualquier cosa para estar juntos de nuevo. 
ISABELLA Mi amor, ya estamos juntos. 
RICHARD Is she gone?
HURLEY Yeah.
RICHARD Thank you.
HURLEY Yeah, you got it.
RICHARD Something wrong?
HURLEY She kinda said one more thing. Something you have to do.
RICHARD What?
HURLEY She said you have to stop the Man in Black. You have to stop him from leaving the island. 'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno. .]
JACOB Good morning
MAN IN BLACK Morning.
JACOB I see you got my present.
MAN IN BLACK Don't gloat, Jacob. It doesn't become you.
JACOB So you tried to kill me?
MAN IN BLACK You expect an apology?
JACOB No. I guess I'm just wondering why you did it.
MAN IN BLACK Because I want to leave. Just let me leave, Jacob.
JACOB As long as I'm alive, you're not going anywhere.
MAN IN BLACK Well then, now you know why I want to kill you. And I will kill you, Jacob.
JACOB Even if you do so, somebody else will take my place.
MAN IN BLACK Then I'll kill them too.
JACOB Here. Something for you to pass the time.
JACOB I'll see you around.
MAN IN BLACK Sooner than you think.
