SAWYER Want some cocoa?
KATE Where'd you find cocoa?
SAWYER I didn't. Pretend.
LOCKE How's the leg?
JIN Still hurts.
LOCKE You should leave the bandage off for a while. The air'll do it some good.
JIN I'll try that.
LOCKE You mind if I sit down?
LOCKE I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs?
JIN You mean the cave? The one with the names on the wall?
LOCKE Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. Kwon is one of them.
JIN Does that mean me or Sun?
LOCKE Well Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together.
JIN But, Sun is not here...
LOCKE You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it.
SECURITY OFFICER Alright Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch.
JIN Money?
SECURITY OFFICER I'm sorry, federal law says we have to confiscate the $25,000.
JIN Confiscate?
SECURITY OFFICER It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork.
JIN And... the money...
SECURITY OFFICER You can exit right over there, sir.
JIN 가자. 
SUN 괜찮아요? 
JIN 식당에서 만나기로 한 약속도 놓쳤잖아! 
SUN 그 돈은 뭐에요? 
JIN 나도 몰라. 우리 바로 떠나기 전에 아버님이 시계하고 같이 전해주라고 주신거야. 아버님께 질문할 입장도 아니고, 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 
CLERK May I help you?
SUN Paik.
CLERK A reservation for Paik...
CLERK Yes, I've got it right here. I've got a beautiful oceanview room for you on the eighth floor.
JIN Two room. Two! No marry.
CLERK Oh...
JIN Kwon. Jin-Soo Kwon.
CLERK I'm sorry, I apologize... yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir.
CLERK Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon... welcome to Los Angeles.
LOCKE I'm leavin' for a little while. I got an errand to run.
SAYID When will you be back?
LOCKE Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone.
SAYID I don't feel anything.
LOCKE Excuse me?
SAYID Anger. Happiness. Pain. I don't feel it anymore.
LOCKE Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's coming.
SAWYER What're you doin', Hoss?
JIN I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back.
SAWYER What thing?
JIN Locke. And you're just sitting around here listening to whatever he tells you...
SAWYER I ain't listenin' to nobody! I already told you I have a deal with Widmore, so if you just--
JIN It doesn't matter who you have a deal with! I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife.
SAWYER Find her where?
JIN Go back to the temple. And if she's not there I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun so stop trying to--
SEAMUS Is this the guy?
ZOE Yeah. Let's take him.
MILES Play your card, captain.
BEN Now what?
ILANA We wait.
BEN Wait... for what?
ILANA For Richard to come back.
BEN You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!
ILANA Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back.
MILES Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, I'm not sure Hurley can track anything...
LAPIDUS Hey, don't talk about bacon.
ILANA Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait.
JACK How are the tomatoes?
SUN Dead.
JACK I remember when you first planted this here. Feels like a hundred years ago...
JACK You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you?
SUN I don't care if he comes back.
JACK What about us... being candidates?
SUN What about it?
JACK Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And there was a mirror. And all around it there were... there were hundreds of names written down.
SUN I don't care. I don't care about Alpert, or being a candidate.
JACK Sun... there was a reason why we were--
SUN I don't want to hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone!
SUN 진수 씨... 뭐하는 거에요? 
JIN 이 시계를 전하러 이렇게 멀리까지 왔는데... 식당엘 가 봐야겠어. 
SUN 들어오지 않을래요? 이런 얘기 여기서 하고싶지 않아요. 
SUN 지금 열한시 반이에요. 이 시간에 누가 식당에 있겠어요? 
JIN 그래도 가보긴 해야지. 
SUN 진수 씨. 그 사람, 우리 아빠 직원이에요. 그렇게 걱정할 필요가 없어요. 
JIN 무슨 상관이야. 자긴 여기 쇼핑만 하러 온 거 아니야? 
SUN 나에 대해서 그렇게밖에 생각 못해요? 내가 그냥 여기 쇼핑하러 온 것 같아? 
JIN 아닌가? 
SUN 왜? 단추 채우라고 하지 그래? 기내 안에서 했던 것 처럼? 
JIN 사람들이 많았잖아. 누군가 우리를 보고 있을수도 있고. 
SUN 우릴 보는 사람은 아무도 없어. 그래서... 단추를 채우라는 거야, 말라는 거야? 
JIN 아니. 
SUN 그럼... 이거는요? [Subtitle What about... this one?
JIN 아니지. 
SUN 이것도? 
JIN 그건... 당연히 아니지. 
LOCKE Sun...
LOCKE I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Bad day?
SUN What are you doing here?
LOCKE I found your husband.
SUN What?
LOCKE I promised you I would reunite you two... took me a little longer than I thought it would... but he's with my people, back at my camp across the island. I can take you to him right now.
SUN I don't believe you. You killed those people at the temple.
LOCKE Those people were confused. They were lied to. I didn't want to hurt them. Any one of them could have chosen to come with me. And I'm giving you that choice, Sun... right now. I would never make you do anything against your will. I'm asking you. Please. Come with me. Jin is waiting.
LOCKE Sun!
LOCKE Sun, wait!
SUN 좋은 생각이 있어요. 
JIN 뭔데? 
SUN 우리 도망가요. 
JIN 뭐? 
SUN 농담 아니야. 같이 도망가요. 
JIN 돈도 없이 어떻게? 
SUN 내 앞으로 된 계좌가 있어요. 
JIN 아니, 이게 다 처음부터 계획한거야? 
SUN 화났어요? 
JIN 아니... 그렇지만 그건 말도 안돼. 
SUN 내가 묻는 말에만 대답해요. 날 사랑해요? 
JIN 자기 잘 알잖아, 내가 얼마나 사랑하는지. 
SUN 좋아요. 당신이 알아야 될 게 있어요. 
JIN 누구지? 
SUN 글쎄요. 사인을 걸어놨는데? 
JIN 잔다고 그냥 보내. 
KEAMY Miss Paik? Hi. I'm, uh... Martin Keamy.
KEAMY I'm a friend of your father's.
KEAMY Mind if I come in? I believe you got something for me...
BEN Sun? Sun, can you hear me?
BEN What happened? You alright?
SUN 그 사람 어디 있어요? 
BEN I'm sorry, what?
SUN 날 쫓아 왔는데... 그 사람... 분명히 왔어요. 그 사람... 
BEN Slow down. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you?
SUN Locke.
LOCKE Sayid! Sayid, hey! What happened?
SAYID We were attacked.
LOCKE By whom?
SAYID I don't know.
LOCKE Where is Jin?
JIN Hey! Hey!
ZOE Well... that was weird, huh?
JIN Where am I?
ZOE It's called Room 23. The DHARMA Initiative was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here. But... you know all about the DHARMA Initiative... don't you, Mr. Kwon?
JIN Why did you bring me here?
ZOE Relax. You're safe.
JIN I'm leaving.
ZOE Sorry, but we went to a lot of trouble getting you here off of the other island. And I can't let you leave.
JIN What do you want from me?
ZOE These are grid maps that the...the DHARMA people used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Whoever signed these could really help me out. I know... I know the writing's diffcult to read but... but sure looks like it says Jin Soo-Kwon. So, is it you or isn't it?
JIN You want answers to your questions? Then get me your boss. I want to talk with Charles Widmore.
ZOE Well... then you're in luck, Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like to talk to you too.
LOCKE You a good swimmer?
SAYID Good enough.
LOCKE Wrap this in plastic, you don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger.
LOCKE Something wrong, Claire?
CLAIRE Um... what, what you said to Jin... about the names on the wall? Told him you needed them all to get off the island?
LOCKE Yes I did.
CLAIRE So... was my name on the wall?
LOCKE No.
CLAIRE Then... it doesn't matter if I get on that plane then. I mean you don't, you don't need me--
LOCKE No. That's not true, Claire. I need you.
LOCKE And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us.
CLAIRE Now when we go home, Aaron's not going to know me. Stranger to my own son. He thinks Kate's his mother. Was her name on the wall?
LOCKE No, Claire... it isn't. Not anymore. But I need Kate.
CLAIRE Why?
LOCKE Because I'm three people shy of getting off this island and Kate can help me get these people on that plane. But... once she does... then whatever happens, happens.
SAWYER What's up with the guns? You two goin' somewhere?
LOCKE We're taking a boat ride over to the other island.
SAWYER What do you need a boat for? Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water?
LOCKE Do you think if I could do that I would still be on this island?
SAWYER No, 'cause that would be ridiculous... what the hell are you goin' over there for anyway? Thought you were tryin' to avoid Charlie Widmore.
LOCKE They took one of our people, James. So I'm going to get him back.
KEAMY Is this for me? Wow this is really nice. Hmm. Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money. Where's Mr. Kwon?
SUN No English.
KEAMY Sit down.
OMAR I checked his room, he's not there.
KEAMY Check the bathroom.
OMAR Come on, let's go.
KEAMY Mr. Kwon! Why don't you come and join us? Look, thank you for the watch, okay, but you're also supposed to give me an envelope with money in it. Twenty-five thousand dollars. Yeah?
JIN 그럼 어떻게 해? 
SUN 우리 돈을 좀 주면 안될까? 
JIN 놈한테 돈을 주자고? 
KEAMY Stop it. I feel like I'm in a damn Godzilla movie. What's that guy's name, the uhhh Russian guy, speaks like nine different languages, uhhh uhhh Danny's friend?
OMAR Mikhail.
KEAMY Mikhail. He speak Korean?
OMAR Think so.
KEAMY Go get him. Now put your damn clothes on.
SUN 그 돈은 세관에서 압류당했지만, 나한테 돈이 있어요. 
MIKHAIL She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs.
KEAMY It's not my problem.
SUN 같이 은행에 가면 내가 돈을 찾아줄게요. 
MIKHAIL She wants you to let them please go to the bank, they will get it for you.
KEAMY You take her to the bank, I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant, then we'll meet there.
MIKHAIL 진수는 나중에 보기로 하죠. 
JIN 저희... 두 사람에 대해서는 미스터 백께 비밀로 해주십시오. 부탁드립니다. 
KEAMY What's he whining about?
MIKHAIL He wants you to promise that you won't tell her father that they are involved.
KEAMY Oh. Hey, don't worry about that. Okay, your secret, it's safe with me. Okay? Just bring me the money and then we could all live happily ever after, right?
BEN What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes and she was already unconscious when I found her. Why won't you believe me?
ILANA Because you're speaking.
JACK You got a pretty descent size bump, might be a slight concussion. You can understand what I'm saying?
JACK But you can only speak Korean.
SUN 맞아요. 
MILES She hits her head and forgets English? Are we supposed to buy that?
LAPIDUS Asks the man who communes with the dead.
JACK It might be aphasia. It's um, a condition that's caused by trauma and it affects the language center of your brain. It's usually temporary. Sun, You're gonna be okay.
MILES What are you smiling about?
RICHARD Pack your bags, we're leaving.
MEN DON'T MOVE!!
SEAMUS Let me see your hands!
LOCKE Easy, friend, I come in peace.
WIDMORE Do you know who I am?
LOCKE Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am?
WIDMORE Obviously you're not John Locke. Everything else I know is a combination of myth, ghost stories, and jungle noises in the night.
LOCKE I think you know more than that judging by these pylons.
WIDMORE Why did you come here?
LOCKE You took one of my people, Jin Kwon.
WIDMORE I have no idea what you're talking about.
LOCKE A wise man once said that war was coming to this Island, I think it just got here.
JACK Where exactly are we going, Richard?
RICHARD Where's Locke?
BEN What?
RICHARD You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be?
BEN Hydra island.
RICHARD Which is exactly where you landed the plane that you flew back here, right?
LAPIDUS That's right.
RICHARD This man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. You wanna know where we're going, we're gonna stop him.
MILES This is your fault isn't it?
HURLEY Sorta.
ILANA How are we gonna stop him from getting on the plane?
RICHARD We have to destroy it.
SUN 뭐라고요? 비행기를 없애버린다고요? 그럼 이 섬에서 어떻게 탈출하려구요? 
RICHARD Why isn't she speaking English?
JACK She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke.
RICHARD He came back here?
RICHARD What, what did he want? What did he say to you? Do you understand me?
SUN 그래, 다 이해했어 이 바보야! 내가 널 도와서 이 섬을 빠져나갈 유일한 방법을 없앨거라고 생각한다면 넌 미쳐도 한참 미쳤어! 난 이 세상을 구하러 온게 아니라 내 남편을 다시 찾아서 다시 돌아가려고 여기 온거야. 내가 중요하다고 이 여자가 그랬어. 
SUN 만약에 사실이라면, 넌 내가 꼭 필요해! 하지만 이것만은 알아둬, 난 여기서 한발짝도 움직이지 않을거야! 
HURLEY I don't think she wants to come.
SUN 무슨 문제라도 있어요? 
MIKHAIL Miss Paik would like to know if there is a problem.
BANK CLERK I'm sorry, I'm showing that your account was closed. The balance is zero.
MIKHAIL 당신 계좌가 끊겼답니다. 
SUN 아니, 그럴 리가 없어요. 나 밖에는 이 계좌에 대해서 아무도 아는 사람이 없어요. 
MIKHAIL If she may ask, who closed the account please?
BANK CLERK Looks like her father, Mr. Woo-Jung Paik had access. The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts at our main branch in Seoul.
MIKHAIL 아버님께서 지시하셨습니다. 
SUN 왜? 뭐 때문에요? 
MIKHAIL 정말 몰라서 물어요? 
OMAR Go on, get in.
KEAMY What's going on?
OMAR I bumped his head on the door.
KEAMY Come on Omar, you gotta be more careful than that.
KEAMY I got this. You go get the Arab guy.
OMAR Hey...I'm an Arab.
KEAMY Just go pick him up
KEAMY Sorry about that. Omar is loyal but he lacks attention to detail. You don't really understand a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothing? Right. Just hold still okay. I'm gonna strap you in here just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realise how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. That other twenty five that you were supposed to deliver, that was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, now anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.
JIN Thank you.
KEAMY I'm sorry. Some people just aren't meant to be together.
WIDMORE What the hell were you thinking?
ZOE I'm sorry, I know, I know we panicked.
WIDMORE This was not supposed to happen for days. We had a timetable.
ZOE See, he was leaving their camp.
WIDMORE Well you should have let him leave and taken him in the jungle.
ZOE Well maybe you should put a mercenary in charge instead of a geophysicist.
WIDMORE What's done is done. I need you to get the package from the submarine and take it to the infirmary. Can you do that for me please Zoe?
ZOE Yeah. Sure.
WIDMORE Mr Kwon, my deepest apologies for everything that's been done to you. My name is--
JIN I know who you are. Why did you bring me here.
WIDMORE We searched the Ajira plane, discovered your wife's luggage and found this inside. I thought you might want to have it. Go ahead, turn it on.
WIDMORE Her name is Ji Yeon. Your daughter. I understand you've never seen her before. I have a daughter too. I know what it's like to be kept apart. I understand the one thing you want is to be reunited with your wife and daughter. But it would be short lived. If that thing masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island, your wife, your daughter, my daughter, everyone we know and love - would simply cease to be. I came here to make sure that doesn't happen.
JIN How?
WIDMORE Come with me. I think it's time for you to see the package.
JIN What package?
WIDMORE It's not a what. It's a who.
JIN 죽이지 말아주세요. 제발 살려주세요! 
SAYID Who are you?
JIN No English.
SAYID I don't know why you're here and I don't really care.
JIN No! Free! Free! Free!
SAYID Good luck.
MIKHAIL Martin! Martin! Who did this to you?
KEAMY Look behind you, you idiot.
JIN 총 내려놔. 
MIKHAIL 흥분하지 마. 알았어. 누가 이런거야? 
JIN 버리라고 그랬지. 어서! 선, 저리 가. 귀 먹었어, 이 새끼야? 안 버리면 쏜다! Do you hear me? Drop it or I'm going to kill you.]
MIKHAIL 그러진 못 할걸. 죽이려고 했다면 벌써 쐈겠지. you would've shot me already.]
JIN 
SUN 나 임신했어... 
JACK Brought you a couple of things. Thinking about a patient that I had during my residency. Car crash, banged his head, when he woke up he couldn't talk. The guy was frustrated, I mean, who wouldn't be. Then one of the nurses said "just because he can't speak, doesn't mean that he can't write". Think you can give it a try?
JACK Take a little longer to get your point across, but at least you have your voice back. Went back out to your garden to see if he was there. He wasn't. I found this.
JACK That's one stubborn tomato. Guess no-one told it it was supposed to die.
JACK Don't worry about it. Not the first person to tell me to leave them alone.
JACK Locke - what did he say to you?
JACK Why didn't you go with him?
JACK You trust me?
JACK Sun, come with us and I'll help you find Jin. I'll help you find him and I'll get you both on that plane and as far away from this island as you can get. I promise.
SAWYER Where'd you go?
KATE What?
SAWYER Looked like your brain took a little stroll.
KATE Why aren't you worried, James?
SAWYER I am worried. Just really good at pretending I ain't. But I got a feeling this is almost over. 'Cause if Locke rode over there on a boat with Sayid, then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water.
KATE What if he didn't?
SAWYER Well then we're screwed six ways from sun--
SAWYER Oh Hell.
KATE He's alone.
SAWYER Thought you went over there to find Jin?
LOCKE They said they didn't have him.
SAWYER And you believed that?
LOCKE No.
SAWYER Where's Sayid? You lose him too?
LOCKE When you were over there James, you mentioned that Widmore had someone guarding a room on his submarine. Guarding something that he didn't want you to see?
SAWYER Yeah, so?
LOCKE I don't like secrets.
SEAMUS The guy can hardly stand.
ZOE Well what do you expect?
SEAMUS How much did you give him?
ZOE Obviously I gave him too much but we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse. Come on, get him up.
SEAMUS Let's go Mr. Hume.
