JULIET I burnt my hand -- and my muffins.
AMELIA Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
WORKER GUY It's a work in progress.
ADAM It's not even literature. It's popcorn.
AMELIA And why isn't it literature, Adam? I'm dying to know.
ADAM There's no metaphor. It's by-the-numbers religious hocum-pocum.
AMELIA No metaphor?
ADAM It's science-fiction -- now I know why Ben isn't here.
JULIET Excuse me?
ADAM I know the host picks the book; but seriously, Julie, he wouldn't read this in the damn bathroom.
JULIET Well, Adam, I am the host and I do pick the book. And this is my favorite book. So I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it. Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like. Here I am thinking that free will still actually exists on--
JULIET The doorway -- get into the doorway.
GALE Goodwin, did you see where the tail landed?
GOODWIN Yeah, probably in the water.
GALE You run and you can make that shore line in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors; and you're one of them. A passenger -- in shock -- come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in 3 days. Go.
GALE So I guess I'm out of the book club.
JACK Kate! Kate, can you hear me?! Kate!
TOM Rise and shine, Kate.
KATE Where am I?
TOM You don't really think I'm going to answer that, do you?
KATE Where are Sawyer and Jack?
TOM I'll tell you what, why don't you just take a nice hot shower -- wake yourself up -- wash the day off you and start fresh. There's a nice clean towel, soap, shampoo...
KATE I'm not showering in front of you.
TOM Kate, you're not my type.
SAWYER Hey. Where are we? Who the hell are you? Oh, you ain't gonna talk to me? What -- you got more important things to do?
KARL I wouldn't do that.
SAWYER If I want your advice -- I'll ask for it.
SAWYER Son-of-a-bitch!!
KARL Told you.
UNKNOWN VOICE Stop that.
JULIET Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet.
JACK Hi, I'm Jack Shephard. I'm here...
SARAH Where's your lawyer?
JACK You look pretty.
SARAH Where's your lawyer?
JACK I fired him. Sarah, I'm sorry for, for pushing us to this place. I know that I...
SARAH Excuse me; I'm sorry. Yeah, um, no not yet. He just got here. I'll call you when I get home. Jack, I'm going to say this as simply as I can...
JACK What's his name?
SARAH Jack, stop it.
JACK I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to keep asking you that until you tell me.
SARAH No, I don't ask you what you do in your...
JACK Just tell me what his name is! I want to know who he is. Look, you can have everything -- the cars, the house -- I don't care. I just -- I just want to know the name of the man that is with my wife.
JULIET Jack, can you hear me in there? Is that a yes?
JACK Where are my friends?
JULIET Come down from the table first.
JACK You want me to come down -- come in here and get me down.
JULIET If you want to talk, I'm happy to...
JACK Tell me where my friends are!!!
JULIET I will -- if you let go of the chain.
JACK You think I'm stupid?!
JULIET I don't think you're stupid, Jack. I think you're stubborn.
KATE Hey! Where are my clothes?!
TOM Come on, Kate. He's waiting.
GALE Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to put those on, Kate.
KATE And if I don't?
GALE Then you don't get any coffee.
GALE A little tighter. Please.
KATE What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?
GALE Now why Sawyer?
KATE Why Sawyer what?
GALE He's the first one you asked about. "What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"
KATE You don't know me.
GALE Of course I don't.
KATE I want my clothes back.
GALE We burned them.
KATE Why did you bring me here? Why did you make me put on this dress? Why are you feeding me breakfast?
GALE I brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted -- comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean. I gave you the dress so that you'd feel like a lady. And I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized. I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to. Because, Kate, the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.
JACK Yeah, hi. Uh, I met a woman on the train. Sarah. And she dropped her cell phone and I don't even know her last name. But your number was in her phone so I was just wondering... I'm sorry, forget it.
CHRISTIAN Hey.
JACK Just give me a minute, Dad. I asked you to give me a minute here.
CHRISTIAN What's this? Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?
JACK Because one of them is him.
CHRISTIAN You've got to stop this, Jack. It's over.
JACK Not until I know his name -- where he works, where he lives, when they first kissed. I want to know what it is about him.
JACK Why is Sarah calling you, dad?
CHRISTIAN I think it's time that you let this go.
JACK Why is she calling you?!
CHRISTIAN Because she was afraid -- for you.
JACK I want to know exactly why the hell she was calling...
CHRISTIAN She could see that you were slipping -- you were losing your grip.
JACK My grip is not the problem here!
CHRISTIAN Which is exactly what's happening here! Jack, I think I know a little something about being obsessive.
JACK No, being a drunk is not obsessive.
CHRISTIAN Let it go, Jack.
JACK What? If you're trying to talk to me, I can't hear you.
JULIET I know you're hungry. I brought this for you. This is how it will work. You sit there across from the door, back against the wall. I open the door and leave the tray. Can I trust you to do that, Jack?
JACK I don't want your food.
JULIET Well, it's a delicious sandwich...
JACK I want you to tell the guy who's trying to talk to me through that intercom that he can give it up.
JULIET Maybe you're hungrier than you think. That intercom hasn't worked in years.
JACK What's that for -- the button -- what's it for?
JULIET It's for emergencies.
JACK Who's watching me?
JULIET Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door? It's just off the frying pan.
JACK You can have it.
JULIET What do you do, Jack? What's your profession?
JACK I'm a repo man. You know, when people don't pay their bills I go in for the bank and I collect their possessions. I'm a people person so I really love it.
JULIET Are you married?
JACK No. I never saw the point. What about you? What's your job, besides making sandwiches?
JULIET Oh, I didn't make it. I just put the toothpicks in. When your plane crashed, where were you flying from?
JACK Sydney.
JULIET What were you doing there?
JACK I was bringing my father home.
JULIET Why would you go all the way to Australia just to...
JACK Because he was dead.
JULIET I'm sorry.
JACK Yeah, I'm sure you are. Thanks.
JULIET You can trust me, Jack. I'm not going to hurt you.
JACK What the hell is going on here?
KARL Hey. Hey, how long would it take to get to your camp?
SAWYER What, you talking to me now, Chachi?
KARL From where they got you, how long a walk was it? A day, two days? And what are the people like from your plane?
SAWYER Oh, they're just awesome. Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our Iraqi. He tortured me, too. But hell, he don't know any better.
SAWYER Hey, how'd you get out of there?
KARL Run that way.
SAWYER Hold on!
KARL You run that way!
JULIET Hey.
TOM Say it. Say it, Karl.
KARL I'm sorry. Sorry, I involved you in my break out attempt.
JULIET The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a pretty serious side-effect -- dehydration. Your head is probably sore, your throat is raw. If you don't eat or drink something soon you're going to start hallucinating.
JACK So, you're a doctor, huh?
JULIET No, I'm a repo woman. No strings attached. You don't have to answer any questions. You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall. Let me open that door, put the plate down and leave. I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing, if you do anything that I ask you to. But you're not. You need to eat. What do you say?
JULIET Thank you, Jack.
JACK Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a PCA.
NURSE You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?
NURSE Dr. Shephard...
CHRISTIAN Jack?
JACK Give me your cell phone.
CHRISTIAN What? What?
JACK I want to see it. Now.
CHRISTIAN Look where you are, Jack. I mean, just look around you, please.
JACK Give me the phone.
CHRISTIAN This is not the place for this.
MODERATOR You must be Jack. Why don't you grab a chair and join us?
JACK You know me?
MODERATOR Yes, your father's told us all about you.
JACK Yeah, what's he told you about me? What did you tell them about me, dad? That your son never really had it -- not like the old man. I didn't have the will to make it work? My life, my job, my marriage. What did you tell them about my marriage, dad?!! You want to know how he manages his marriage? A bottle of scotch every night before dinner.
MODERATOR Your father has been sober 50 days now. We're very proud of that.
JACK Wow, dad, I wonder what helped you turn that corner? Do you think maybe it was a new lady friend? Do you think maybe that's what...
CHRISTIAN I will not let you you talk to me...
JACK I will not let you sleep with my wife.
CHRISTIAN Oh, Jack. Jack, I'm your father. Jack, please just let it go.
JACK Which way out?
JULIET Don't do this, Jack. Don't. Don't.
JACK Open the door.
JULIET No. I can't. I can't, Jack. I do that -- we die. I'm not. I'm not.
JACK Open the door!!
JULIET I can't! I swear I can't!!
GALE She's telling the truth, Jack.
JACK I swear to god, I will kill her.
GALE Okay. Have her open the door and she dies anyway. We all do.
JULIET Jack, over here!
JULIET The button!
JACK What?
JULIET The yellow button, the button!!
SAWYER Oh, come on. Unbelievable.
TOM Keep moving.
TOM Stick your arms out through the bars; I'll take off your cuffs. They scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they? I'll bring you some anti-septic later.
SAWYER How about you bring me an ottoman? While you're at it I could use a blow dry.
TOM Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit. How'd you do that?
SAWYER I figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how.
TOM Only took the bears 2 hours.
SAWYER How many of them were there? You okay, Freckles?
KATE Yeah. You?
SAWYER Just swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Nice dress.
KATE They made me wear it.
SAWYER You hungry?
JACK It's an aquarium.
JULIET Excuse me?
JACK This thing's for what -- sharks?
JULIET Dolphins, too.
JACK We're underwater, aren't we?
JULIET Yes.
JACK Is this one of their stations -- the DHARMA Initiative?
JULIET They called it the Hydra.
JACK So you people are just whatever's leftover of them.
JULIET Well, that was a long time ago. It doesn't matter who we were. It only matters who we are. We know exactly who you are, Jack Shephard.
JACK You don't know anything about me.
JULIET We know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of St. Sebastian's Hospital in Los Angeles. I know that you went to Columbia and that you graduated med school a year faster than anyone else. I know that you were married only once and that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in Sydney. I know this because I have a copy of his autopsy report.
JACK How did you get...
JULIET We got it.
JACK What is that?
JULIET This, Jack, is your life.
JACK Do you -- is it just about me or is it about my family, too -- my friends.
JULIET It's pretty much about everything.
JACK Do you know about my -- about my ex-wife.
JULIET Sarah. Yes, Jack, we know all about her. What would you like to find out?
GUARD Shephard, someone posted your bail.
JACK How'd you, uh...
SARAH Your dad told me you were here. I called you a cab. So, um, goodbye. 
JACK Sarah!
SARAH What?!
JACK Is that him? 
SARAH What difference does it make?
JACK It just does.
SARAH It's not going to change anything.
JACK Look, I want to know! I need to know who he is.
SARAH It doesn't matter who he is. It just matters who you're not. Jack, your father -- he called me to help you. He was so drunk I could hardly understand him. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix.
JULIET Jack. Jack. What would you like to find out?
JACK Is she -- is she happy?
JULIET Yes, Jack, she's very happy. Now, I'd like to bring you some food and water. But this time I need to know that you'll behave. Can I trust you, Jack? Put your back against the wall, please.
GALE Good work, Juliet.
JULIET Thank you, Ben.
