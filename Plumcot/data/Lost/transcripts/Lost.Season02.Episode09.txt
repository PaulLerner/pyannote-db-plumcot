dr_jack_shephard Sorry, man, I know this hurts. Michael told me you pulled the bullet out with your bare hands. You'll have to show me how to do that sometime.
james_ford Where is she?
dr_jack_shephard What? I didn't...
james_ford Where is she?
dr_jack_shephard You mean Kate. She's been watching over you for the past 24 hours straight. The only way I could get rid of her was to send her out to get some food for you.
james_ford I love her. I love her.
wayne Well, heya, girl. What are you doing here? Hey, there.
kate_austen Alright, let's get you to bed. Watch your step, watch your step.
wayne What the hell is that smell?
kate_austen Probably your breath.
wayne Sha, right.
kate_austen Come on.
wayne You're beautiful. Hey. Hey! I just gave you a compliment.
kate_austen Yeah, I heard you.
wayne Aren't you going to take my pants off first? You are beautiful.
kate_austen Good night.
diane_janssen Coffee, pie, both?
kate_austen How about a beer?
diane_janssen I'd like to see some I.D.
kate_austen I'm 24, Ma.
diane_janssen You want to ride around on that on that deathtrap of yours without a helmet -- I'm not going to help your cause by getting you drunk.
kate_austen How's that wrist?
diane_janssen What, this? You know that shelf in the kitchen sticks out sometimes. You'd think I'd remember it was there, but I banged it.
kate_austen Don't.
diane_janssen I made my bed, Katherine.
kate_austen Well, your bed's gone, Ma.
diane_janssen What?
diane_janssen What is this?
kate_austen An insurance policy for the house.
diane_janssen What? I never...
kate_austen I took it out in your name.
diane_janssen What did you do? Does Wayne know about this?
kate_austen Just remember that you were here and you didn't see me, okay.
diane_janssen Katherine! What did you do?
kate_austen I took care of you, Ma. I've got to go and you're not going to see me for awhile.
diane_janssen Katherine, what did you do? Katherine!
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. You okay?
kate_austen Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm just -- I think I'm tired. How is he?
dr_jack_shephard His fever's still up there. I can't tell if the anti-biotics are working. It'll help to get some food in him. You should get down to the beach for -- for Shannon.
kate_austen I was actually thinking that I should stay and watch Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard I'll stay with him.
kate_austen You should be there.
dr_jack_shephard Keep him hydrated -- maybe mash up some of that fruit and see if you can get him to eat it. And everybody'll be at the beach, so don't forget the button.
kate_austen I got it.
dr_jack_shephard I'll be back in a couple of hours. -- You're sure you're okay?
kate_austen Yeah, I'm great.
ana_lucia_cortez Hey.
mr_eko I'm going to go to the funeral.
ana_lucia_cortez I don't think I'm going to make it.
mr_eko I think most of them realize it was an accident, Ana.
sayid_jarrah Shannon and I were strangers. We never would have met if... We wouldn't even have spoken if... But we did meet and we did speak. At least... I loved her.
dr_jack_shephard May she rest in peace.
kate_austen You hungry? I'm just going to mash you up some fruit here. When you wake up you're going to get a kick out of me feeding you like a baby. I saw a horse. Yeah, that's what happens when you don't sleep.
james_ford
kate_austen Sawyer? Are you awake?
james_ford
kate_austen What?
james_ford Why did you kill me? Why did you kill me?!
john_locke It's the alarm.
dr_jack_shephard Kate! Kate!
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer.
john_locke 4, 8, 15, 16, 22. Gah. 23, 42.
john_locke What happened?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
john_locke Well, you said-
dr_jack_shephard I don't know, John!
john_locke Well, where's Kate?
charlie_pace Kate, hey. You missed the funeral.
kate_austen Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.
charlie_pace Oh, right. A few of them came -- the new people. Not her -- the one who killed Shannon. That would have been a bit awkward. They seem to have had a rough time of it. It looks like they went bloody Lord of the Flies out there. You haven't listened to a word I've said.
kate_austen Do you think there are horses here?
charlie_pace What?
kate_austen I think I saw a horse in the jungle.
charlie_pace I've seen polar bears. I've seen monsters, well, heard monsters, but horses, no. Kate! Where are you going?!
kate_austen Tallahassee one-way, please.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode09 IN LINE Tallahassee? I spent a week in Tallahassee one night. It's all strip malls and waffle houses. What's a pretty girl like you going to do down in Tallahassee?
kate_austen I'm sure I'll find something.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode09 IN LINE I'll bet you've got family down there, huh?
kate_austen Actually, I'm just visiting.
marshal_edward_mars Hey, hey, don't I know you?
kate_austen No, I don't think so.
marshal_edward_mars Don't run, Kate.
marshal_edward_mars I've got her. Kate Austen, you're under arrest for murder.
kate_austen I didn't do anything.
marshal_edward_mars Oh, yeah you did. Your mama gave you up, Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, have you seen Kate?
charlie_pace A little while ago in the jungle. She was acting kind of barmy, asking me about horses on the island.
dr_jack_shephard You know where she is now?
charlie_pace She's on the path heading back to the caves. Everything okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, Charlie, everything's fine.
jinsoo_kwon Thank you.
john_locke Free at last, huh?
michael_dawson Yeah, man. Looks good.
michael_dawson Hey, Locke, what's up with the blast doors?
john_locke Blast doors?
michael_dawson Yeah, like in case of an explosion they come from the ceiling. That guy down here, uh...
john_locke Desmond?
michael_dawson Desmond. He didn't tell you about these -- what they're for?
john_locke No, no he didn't. But he did leave a movie.
michael_dawson A movie?
john_locke Yeah. You want to see it?
mr_eko I would like to see it too -- if you don't mind.
john_locke Why not? The more the merrier.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, what the hell are you doing out here? What happened in the hatch, Kate? Why'd you leave? I come back, I find Sawyer just lying on the ground. You just took off...
kate_austen Is he okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yes, Kate, he's fine.
kate_austen I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Are you?
kate_austen Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I am not as perfect as you! I'm sorry that I'm not as good!
dr_jack_shephard Okay, what's going on with you?
kate_austen Just forget it.
dr_jack_shephard No, don't walk away from me.
kate_austen Let go of me. Just...
dr_jack_shephard No. Kate. Kate, Kate, Kate.
kate_austen Don't! I've got...
dr_jack_shephard It's okay. It's okay.
kate_austen Please, this place is crazy -- it's just -- I can't -- it's driving me nuts.
dr_jack_shephard I know. It's okay. It's alright. It's alright.
dr_jack_shephard Kate!
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode09 CANDLE From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer for anything . Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
michael_dawson Alright, so you've been pushing that button every 2 hours since you got down here.
john_locke That's right.
michael_dawson How does that even work?
john_locke I set up 2 person shifts -- 6 hours -- everyone's on the roster.
michael_dawson Don't they want to know why?
john_locke I think the film's pretty self-explanatory.
michael_dawson Really? All I heard was something about electro-magnets and an incident. What about all the missing pieces?
john_locke Oh, you mean the splices? Yeah, just a frame here and there, I think -- nothing important. What do you think? About the film -- what do you think?
kate_austen I'm sorry I missed it -- her funeral -- I had to be with Sawyer, so...
sayid_jarrah Why aren't you with him now?
kate_austen Because I'm going crazy. Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah I saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot. Does that make me crazy?
marshal_edward_mars It's a long drive back to the arraignment, you comfy? Why now?
kate_austen What?
marshal_edward_mars Nice, corn fed farm girl like yourself -- no history of violence, straight A's, no record, couple of speeding tickets... I just got to wonder, why'd you kill him now? Oh, right, yeah, don't tell me. You wouldn't want to incriminate yourself, not after you were so smart planning it. That jury back in Iowa sure ain't going to get hung up on pre-meditation. And a gas leak, come on, it's -- it's amateur hour from top to bottom.
kate_austen Sounds like you've got it all figured out.
marshal_edward_mars I do have you all figured out.
kate_austen You don't know anything about me.
marshal_edward_mars White trash mom divorces dad, starts up with some guy who's a drinker. Then he knocks her around a little bit, she marries him, because, you know, that's what happens. And then this drunk, this Wayne, he moves into your house, and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy's old bedroom. And even that wouldn't be so bad if he didn't beat her up all the time. But she loves him. She defends him. If that don't make a person want to kill somebody I don't know what does. But the question is now, why now? Why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor Wayne up? He come knocking on your door late at night?
kate_austen He never touched me.
michael_dawson Why can't you just put the numbers in now?
john_locke It doesn't work that way. The alarm goes off at 4 minutes. You can't type anything until then.
michael_dawson You mind if I check out some of this hardware?
john_locke Sure. -- Just don't break it.
john_locke Hello again.
mr_eko Hello. I have something I think you should see. If you don't mind, I will begin at the beginning. Long before Christ the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.
john_locke Boy when you say beginning, you mean -- beginning.
mr_eko At that time the temple where the people worshiped was in ruin. And so the people worshiped idols, false gods. And so the kingdom was in disarray. Josiah, since he was a good king, sent his secretary to the treasury and said "We must rebuild the temple. Give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done." But when the secretary returned, he had no gold. And when Josiah asked why this was, the secretary replied, "We found a book." Do you know this story?
john_locke No, I'm afraid I don't.
mr_eko What the secretary had found was an ancient book -- the Book of Law. You may know it as the Old Testament. And it was with that ancient book, not with the gold, that Josiah rebuilt the temple. On the other side of the island we found a place much like this, and in this place we found a book. I believe what's inside there will be of great value to you.
hugo_reyes Hey. So, Rose's husband's white. Didn't see that one coming.
dr_jack_shephard Is there something you need, Hurley?
hugo_reyes No, just taking a walk, thought I'd say hey. -- Who's taking care of Sawyer?
dr_jack_shephard Sun is.
hugo_reyes So, you're like, mad at him?
dr_jack_shephard Why would I be mad at Sawyer?
hugo_reyes Maybe because he's the one that always comes down here and chops wood, and now you are? It's like, transference.
dr_jack_shephard What, are you a shrink now?
hugo_reyes Well, that's what they call it in the mental hospital.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not mad at anyone.
kate_austen Where's Jack?
sunhwa_kwon I don't know. He didn't come back.
kate_austen Has he said anything?
sunhwa_kwon Sawyer? No, he's still sleeping. Can you watch him? I can stay with...
kate_austen Yeah, I -- I can.
sunhwa_kwon Thanks.
kate_austen Right, uh-huh. Yes, I'm sure that's the exact one you have, uh-huh. I'll send one over to you, right. I'll call you back later.
kate_austen Hi, Dad.
kate_austen Katie, the police and the U.S. Marshals are looking for you. You shouldn't have come here.
kate_austen I've been waiting outside for 2 hours, they're not here.
kate_austen Is it true what they're saying? Katie, what'd you come here for?
kate_austen Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
kate_austen Tell you what?
kate_austen I was making a scrapbook -- a surprise for your birthday. So I called one of your COs to get some pictures of you in uniform. The pictures that he sent me had dates on the back -- photos of you in Korea up until 4 months before I was born. Why didn't you tell me that Wayne was my father? Why?
kate_austen I didn't tell you because I knew you'd kill him. And your mother loved him. You were 5 years old. I wanted to take you along with me. She wouldn't let me.
kate_austen So why didn't you kill him?
kate_austen Because I don't have murder in my heart. I'm going to have to call them.
kate_austen Can I have an hour?
kate_austen Bye, Daddy.
kate_austen Can you hear me? Sawyer? -- Wayne? I'm probably crazy and this doesn't matter, but maybe you're in there somehow. But you asked me a question. You asked me why I -- why I did it. It wasn't because you drove my father away, or the way you looked at me, or because you beat her. It's because I hated that you were a part of me -- that I would never be good. That I would never have anything good. And every time that I look at Sawyer -- every time I feel something for him -- I see you, Wayne. It makes me sick.
james_ford That's about the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
kate_austen Sawyer?
james_ford Who the hell's Wayne? I'm in a bunk-bed?
kate_austen Yeah, you're in a bunk-bed.
james_ford Are we saved?
kate_austen No, Sawyer. Not yet.
john_locke Voilà. What are the odds?
mr_eko The odds?
john_locke Yeah. -- Here, hold this down on the table there nice and flat. I mean, think about it. Somebody made this film. Someone else cut this piece out. We crash -- 2 halves of the same plane fall in different parts of the island -- you're over there, I'm over here. And now, here's the missing piece right back where it belongs. What are the odds?
mr_eko Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
james_ford You've got to be kidding me.
kate_austen Air lock's over this way.
james_ford Come on, admit it, we've been rescued.
kate_austen You got it? Sorry. Watch yourself.
james_ford Son of a bitch.
kate_austen Watch yourself, okay?
james_ford Oh, got it.
kate_austen Okay.
james_ford Home sweet home.
kate_austen Yeah.
james_ford I really thought you were yanking my chain. What do you keep smiling at?
kate_austen You need a haircut.
james_ford Oh, really? Maybe you ought to take me back inside.
kate_austen You see that?
james_ford If you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle, then yeah.
james_ford Do you know that horse, Freckles?
kate_austen Yeah, I do.
dr_jack_shephard Tequila and tonic, that's your drink, right?
ana_lucia_cortez Where's the tonic?
dr_jack_shephard We're running a little low on mixers.
ana_lucia_cortez You sure you want to waste that on me?
dr_jack_shephard Figured you could use a drink. I know I could.
ana_lucia_cortez Are you going to try to convince me that everyone here doesn't hate me?
dr_jack_shephard Only if you're going to try to convince me that every woman in the world's not crazy.
