dr_juliet_burke Jack! Jack! Jack? Jack, I need you to wake up. Jack! Can you hear me? You okay?
bernard_nadler Come on! Come on! I just wanna know why.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
dr_juliet_burke Here.
rose_nadler He knows somethin'!
bernard_nadler I want the truth!
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know. That's the truth. I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now.
bernard_nadler Signal? What, there was a signal when you called them last night.
rose_nadler That's right.
bernard_nadler So—so—so what? Now they're just ignoring us?
dr_charlotte_lewis How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?
rose_nadler Oh, who's talking to you?
dr_charlotte_lewis And in case you haven't noticed, we're not on the bloody boat, are we?
rose_nadler Just watch your tone, Red.
bernard_nadler I just wanna know why.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Everybody just needs to calm down, okay?
bernard_nadler Jack, these people are lying to us.
dr_jack_shephard I know they're lying. I know it. Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
sunhwa_kwon Unless they run off again.
dr_jack_shephard Listen to me.
rose_nadler Jack, are you all right?
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm fine. We just have to be patient, okay? I've gotten us this far. I said I was gonna get us off the Island — all of us. I promised that I would.
rose_nadler Jack? Jack?
bernard_nadler Jack?
dr_juliet_burke Jack.
rose_nadler Is he all right?
dr_juliet_burke Jack? Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Hello?
jane Dr. Shephard? Just confirming your 1100 consult with Ms. Berenberg. It was moved up yesterday, and I know how you are with your calendar.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.
jane Thank you, doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Alright. Bye.
dr_jack_shephard Ow. Son of a bitch.
dr_jack_shephard A-Rod.
dr_jack_shephard Morning.
dr_erica_stevenson Morning yourself. I bought you a razor.
dr_jack_shephard What, you don't like the scruff?
dr_erica_stevenson Razor's by the sink, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Morning.
dr_jack_shephard "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?
dr_jack_shephard But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Aha, that's the great puzzle."
kate_austen You're a natural.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard My old man used to read me that story.
kate_austen Really?
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen It's just... it's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.
dr_jack_shephard I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. Hey. You okay?
kate_austen Yeah. Just, I... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind. I'm so glad that you're here.
dr_jack_shephard Me, too.
dr_juliet_burke Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give—give him some air, guys.
dr_jack_shephard
dr_juliet_burke You okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.
kate_austen Hey, what happened?
dr_juliet_burke He passed out.
kate_austen You fainted?
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. I'm just, uh... I'm just a little dehydrated.
kate_austen No, Jack. You're not okay. You're burning up.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... just need to get a little rest.
dr_juliet_burke Jack—
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine.
claire_littleton Oh!
james_ford You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah, just a bit woozy.
james_ford How's your head?
claire_littleton It's better. Bit of a headache, but at least I'm not seeing things anymore.
miles_straume Yeah? What'd you see?
james_ford Back off, Donger.
miles_straume I'm just making conversation.
james_ford Let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.
james_ford What?
james_ford Hey. Hey!
miles_straume Who's Danielle and Karl?
claire_littleton Y—you mean Rousseau? The French woman?
claire_littleton Oh, my God.
miles_straume Is this your French woman?
james_ford Karl. How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this?
miles_straume They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this.
claire_littleton Can we just—can we just get out of here, please? Can we just go?
james_ford Yeah, yeah, of course. But don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right? Come on. Let's go.
dr_jack_shephard Ahh. I hate being sick.
dr_juliet_burke What do you think it is?
dr_jack_shephard It's food poisoning.
dr_juliet_burke What makes you think that?
dr_jack_shephard I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.
dr_juliet_burke I respectfully disagree.
dr_jack_shephard Do you?
dr_juliet_burke You want to lift your shirt up?
dr_juliet_burke If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.
dr_juliet_burke It's your appendix, Jack. When did the pain start?
dr_jack_shephard Yesterday.
dr_juliet_burke Has it ruptured?
dr_jack_shephard Not yet.
dr_juliet_burke Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out.
dr_juliet_burke Do you remember where the medical station is or don't you?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, I remember.
dr_juliet_burke These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.
sunhwa_kwon "Clamps"? "Sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like.
dr_daniel_faraday I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. Uh...
dr_juliet_burke I thought you were a physicist.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if—if—
jinsoo_kwon No.
sunhwa_kwon We can't trust them.
dr_charlotte_lewis See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. Might as well keep playing the part.
dr_daniel_faraday Damn it, Charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your—your attitude — your very bad attitude — it's exactly why they don't trust us. Come on. Juliet, please. Don't blame us for—for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help.
dr_juliet_burke If either of them tries to run, shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can.
sunhwa_kwon Okay.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, gather as many tarps as you can.
kate_austen Hey Juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, then why don't we just bring Jack there?
dr_juliet_burke Because if we move him, there's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die.
james_ford Don't even think about it.
miles_straume What?
james_ford Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. Twenty feet.
miles_straume What are you, her big brother?
james_ford No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face unless you say, "Yeah, I getcha."
miles_straume Yeah, I getcha.
bernard_nadler Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.
rose_nadler That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "Why did he get sick?"
bernard_nadler Why? It's just—it's just bad luck.
rose_nadler The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, the person that we count on the most suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, and you're chalking it up to bad luck?
bernard_nadler Well, what are you saying, that—that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose.
rose_nadler Not here. Here, they get better.
dr_jack_shephard When was the last time you did this?
dr_juliet_burke An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?
dr_juliet_burke In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then.
dr_jack_shephard Then you know the incision needs to be two inches lower than where you're shaving.
dr_juliet_burke I'm just cleaning the area. Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard I wanna talk you through it.
dr_juliet_burke What?
dr_jack_shephard I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine to numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, help you out.
dr_juliet_burke And, uh, how are you gonna watch, flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?
dr_jack_shephard We can use a mirror. Kate can hold it.
dr_juliet_burke If someone's going to be in there, shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? Bernard's a dentist—
dr_jack_shephard No, I want it to be Kate.
dr_juliet_burke Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg. You're in good hands.
BERENBERG#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard I'll see you tomorrow at 500 a.m.?
BERENBERG#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 Mm-hmm.
dr_jack_shephard And remember, no solid food. Okay?
BERENBERG#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 Thank you, doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Have a good evening.
dr_erica_stevenson Jack? Jack?
dr_erica_stevenson Will you take a look at this X-ray? Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think.
dr_jack_shephard The L4. Yeah. Yeah.
receptionist Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a Dr. Stillman from Santa Rosa Hospital, says it's about a friend of yours.
dr_stillman STILLMAN He's refusing to take his meds, and he's stopped sleeping.
dr_jack_shephard What about his therapy sessions?
dr_stillman STILLMAN Therapy's... been rendered useless.
dr_jack_shephard And why is that?
dr_stillman STILLMAN Because he doesn't think I exist.
dr_jack_shephard Hey Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hey Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Why aren't you taking your meds?
hugo_reyes 'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six, we're all dead. We never got off that island.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley ... that is not true.
hugo_reyes What'd you do today?
dr_jack_shephard What did I do today? I, uh... I woke up, took a shower. Uh, Kate and I fed the baby.
hugo_reyes I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.
dr_jack_shephard I changed my mind after the trial.
hugo_reyes Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.
dr_jack_shephard Just because I'm happy doesn't mean that this isn't real, Hurley.
hugo_reyes I was happy too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie. He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. So what did the two of you talk about?
hugo_reyes Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message.
dr_jack_shephard A message?
hugo_reyes He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up. "You're not supposed to raise him, Jack." Does that make any sense?
dr_jack_shephard No, that... doesn't make any sense.
hugo_reyes Do you think he means Aaron?
dr_jack_shephard Take your meds, Hurley. Just take 'em.
hugo_reyes Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you too. Soon.
sunhwa_kwon We're here.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. Uh... why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.
dr_charlotte_lewis Okay. Be careful, Dan.
dr_daniel_faraday Absolutely.
jinsoo_kwon 저 여자는 저 남자가 좋아하는 걸 알까?
sunhwa_kwon 그럼, 여잔데… 당연히 알지.
sunhwa_kwon 어서 가요.
dr_daniel_faraday Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?
dr_charlotte_lewis Add that one to the list, Dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?
jinsoo_kwon 괜찮아?
sunhwa_kwon 줄리엣이 날 데리고 온 곳이에요. 여기서 우리 아기를 봤어요.
sunhwa_kwon 진수씨, 저 사람들이 우리를 도와 줄 것 같지 않아요.
jinsoo_kwon 자기야, 걱정 마. 내가 한 말 이해 가지? 당신하고 우리 아기는 이 섬에서 꼭 벗어나게 할 거야.
miles_straume Whoa! Hey, you want a hand with the baby?
claire_littleton Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
miles_straume You sure? I'm good with kids.
james_ford What part of "restraining order" don't you understand?
james_ford Get behind me, Claire.
frank_lapidus Whoa! Hey!
james_ford Who the hell are you?
miles_straume Lapidus?
frank_lapidus Miles?
james_ford You two know each other?
frank_lapidus You gotta hide, man, right now.
miles_straume What?
frank_lapidus Keamy's coming back, and if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.
frank_lapidus And he's close, man. You gotta hide now! Go! Hide!
james_ford Come on.
frank_lapidus Just hide!
james_ford Come on. Come on. Let's go!
martin_keamy Where's the chopper?
frank_lapidus It's about a click back that way.
martin_keamy Did you bring the kit?
frank_lapidus Yeah, it's right here. Jeez, man, he looks bad. What the hell happened?
martin_keamy You do your job. I'll do mine.
frank_lapidus Okay. It's gettin' dark, man. We gotta leave now.
frank_lapidus Mr. Keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.
frank_lapidus Keamy, we gotta get back, 'cause I'll tell ya right now, I am not flying Faraday's bearings at night. I'm not gonna do it. So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.
martin_keamy Fine. You lead the way.
martin_keamy Come on.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 1 Okay.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 2 Come on.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode10 3 Watch it now.
kate_austen The tent's all set. Everything's ready.
dr_juliet_burke Good. Thanks. Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there. You wanna help me out?
kate_austen Um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.
dr_juliet_burke It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."
dr_juliet_burke What?
kate_austen I'm just surprised he's not taken it out of himself by now.
dr_juliet_burke Jack. What are you doin'?
dr_jack_shephard I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet.
kate_austen I'll help you.
dr_juliet_burke They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there.
kate_austen So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.
dr_jack_shephard Wouldn't be the first time.
dr_jack_shephard Listen, um... if something happens to me—
kate_austen Shut up, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Fair enough.
dr_jack_shephard Kate? Kate?
dr_jack_shephard Wake up, Kate. Hey.
kate_austen Hey. What time is it?
dr_jack_shephard It's late. I just got home.
kate_austen Were you working?
dr_jack_shephard No. I just... had to stop and get something. I just... took a while.
kate_austen Hey. What's going on? What's wrong?
dr_jack_shephard The other night, when I was reading to Aaron, you said... that I was a natural. (Sighs) Do you really... do you really think that I'm good at this?
kate_austen Yeah. You're good at this.
dr_jack_shephard Will you marry me?
kate_austen Yes.
kate_austen Of course I will. Yes.
bernard_nadler Look, they're back.
dr_juliet_burke Did you find everything?
dr_daniel_faraday Yes, ma'am. The entire list. Is he okay?
dr_juliet_burke For now. Sun, we need to sterilize these. There's a pot of water boiling over here.
jinsoo_kwon Charlotte.
dr_charlotte_lewis Yeah?
jinsoo_kwon 난 알고 있어.
dr_charlotte_lewis Pardon?
jinsoo_kwon 너 한국말 할 줄 알지? 아까 우리가 너 이야기 할 때 너 웃는 거 내가 봤어. 그리고 너 스테이션에서도 우리 말 엿듣고 있었지?
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm sorry. Perhaps I can get your wife to translate—
jinsoo_kwon 계속 날 속이면... 니 친구 다니엘을 가만 두지 않겠어. 앞으로 그 친구 손가락 쓰기는 아마 힘들걸? 이해가 되지?
dr_charlotte_lewis 나한테 원하는 게 뭐죠?
jinsoo_kwon 헬리콥터가 돌아오면... 내 아내를 데리고 이 섬을 떠나기만 하면 돼.
dr_charlotte_lewis 당신과 당신 친구는요?
jinsoo_kwon 넌 선만 헬리콥터에 태우면 돼.
bernard_nadler You know, Jack, they found some chloroform at the medical station. I could knock you out. Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?
dr_jack_shephard No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Just hold it right there.
bernard_nadler Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision. After that, I would like to be able to tell you you' not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.
dr_juliet_burke You ready?
dr_juliet_burke Okay. Here we go.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, Jack. One more.
dr_jack_shephard Oh!
dr_juliet_burke Okay, try not to move.
dr_juliet_burke Just stay still. Spreader.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, I—I can't see it.
kate_austen Sorry.
dr_juliet_burke Don't worry about the mirror. Just stay still. Spreader.
dr_jack_shephard That's good. That's good. Yeah. This is it. That's good.
dr_jack_shephard Aah!
dr_juliet_burke Knock him out, Bernard.
dr_jack_shephard No! No... not wanna be unconscious.
dr_juliet_burke You don't want to be out of control.
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
dr_juliet_burke Kate, you need to leave.
dr_jack_shephard No.
dr_juliet_burke Bernard!
dr_jack_shephard Kate—
dr_juliet_burke Kate, you need to go.
dr_jack_shephard —please.
dr_juliet_burke Bernard!
dr_jack_shephard No!
dr_juliet_burke Kate, get out of here! Bernard.
dr_jack_shephard Kate...
kate_austen Jack.
dr_juliet_burke Kate. Kate, get outta here! Damn it, Bernard! Knock him out!
bernard_nadler I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.
dr_jack_shephard Laker, Ryan. Patient is male, 36.
dr_jack_shephard Osteoblastoma is present in the posterior area of the lumbar. I am recommending biopsy for—
dr_christian_shephard Jack?
dr_erica_stevenson Jack?
dr_erica_stevenson You okay?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, yeah. I'm—I'm... I'm okay. I, uh... I just, uh...
dr_jack_shephard The, um, the smoke detector was... was beeping, and I just...
dr_erica_stevenson Okay. Thank you for keeping us safe.
dr_jack_shephard Erika, um... Do you mind doing me a favor?
dr_erica_stevenson Yeah, sure.
dr_jack_shephard Can you write a script for... clonazepam?
dr_erica_stevenson For you?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now, and I'm just a little snowed under with all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged. Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? Just...
dr_jack_shephard Thank you.
dr_erica_stevenson You know, getting engaged is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. You're right.
dr_erica_stevenson Maybe you should talk to someone.
dr_jack_shephard I'll do that.
dr_erica_stevenson Good night.
dr_jack_shephard Good night.
kate_austen Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay for an extra couple hours. Jack's never home before 800 anyway. I could stay for at least an hour. I—I gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Bye.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen Hey. You scared me.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed. Who was that?
kate_austen That was Noreen.
dr_jack_shephard Noreen?
kate_austen Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park. What?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing. I just... never heard you mention her before.
kate_austen Well, now you have.
kate_austen I'll see you upstairs.
claire_littleton Dad?
bernard_nadler Hey. Don't worry. It went well. She did good. She said you could go back inside if you want to.
kate_austen Thank you.
bernard_nadler Okay.
dr_juliet_burke He didn't lose that much blood. I got the appendix out and put everything back where it belongs, I think.
kate_austen So he's gonna be okay?
dr_juliet_burke He should be fine. We just have to talk him into resting.
kate_austen Good luck with that.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry I yelled at you.
kate_austen Don't worry about it. You had enough going on.
dr_juliet_burke You know, he kissed me.
kate_austen What?
dr_juliet_burke The other day, when you came back from the other side of the Island, Jack kissed me.
kate_austen Oh.
dr_juliet_burke It was nice... but it wasn't for me. It was for him. I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.
kate_austen Prove what?
dr_juliet_burke That he doesn't love someone else.
kate_austen Thank you, Juliet. Thank you for saving his life.
dr_juliet_burke I know you're awake.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen Hey. You're home early. Where's Veronica?
dr_jack_shephard I sent her home. The baby's asleep.
kate_austen Good.
dr_jack_shephard Why was she here?
kate_austen Sorry?
dr_jack_shephard The nanny. She only works 'til 400. I came home at 600.
kate_austen I had to run some errands, so... I asked her to stay a couple extra hours. What's going on, Jack? Why are you home so early?
dr_jack_shephard I went to see Hurley.
kate_austen Today?
dr_jack_shephard Last... Friday.
kate_austen Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.
dr_jack_shephard Because he's crazy, Kate, and I didn't wanna upset you. Where were you today?
kate_austen I'm gonna ask you... to trust me. Trust me. Just leave it be.
dr_jack_shephard Where were you?
kate_austen Jack, don't.
dr_jack_shephard No, I heard you on the phone last night. Who were you talking to?
kate_austen Just let it go.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, I wanna know.
kate_austen No, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.
kate_austen It doesn't matter, Jack. Please.
dr_jack_shephard No, tell me. Tell me!
kate_austen I was doing something for him.
dr_jack_shephard For who?
kate_austen For Sawyer. I made him a promise. It...
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.
dr_jack_shephard Then why won't you tell me?
kate_austen Because—because he wouldn't want me to.
dr_jack_shephard But he's not here, is he? No. No, he made his choice. He chose to stay. I'm the one who came back. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one who saved you.
kate_austen Jack. You can't—you can't do this. If you have problems, you need to figure them out. All right? 'Cause I can't have you like this around my son.
dr_jack_shephard Your son? You're not even related to him!
kate_austen Hey, sweet pea. Hey.
miles_straume Morning.
james_ford It's way too early for Chinese. Where's Claire? Ladies' room?
miles_straume Nope. She just walked off into the jungle.
james_ford What? When?
miles_straume In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.
james_ford You let her go alone?
miles_straume She wasn't alone.
james_ford Well, who was she with?
miles_straume She called him "Dad". I'd have followed them, but I have a restraining order.
james_ford Claire! Claire!
james_ford It's okay. It's okay. I've got you.
james_ford Claire! CLAIRE!
james_ford CLAIRE! CLAIRE!!!
