claire_littleton Mom! Mom!
charlie_pace Oh look Aaron! Your mom has finally decided to wake up.
claire_littleton Mmm...
charlie_pace Only way I could get you to sleep in, was to borrow the midget.
claire_littleton And, err, what is all this?
charlie_pace An aperitif...of mysterious island fruit before the breakfast picnic I have set up in your honor a short walk down the beach.
claire_littleton What's gotten into you Charlie?
charlie_pace Sorry?
claire_littleton It's just, you've been so depressed all week, and now it's breakfast in bed and picnics...
charlie_pace I woke up this morning and I thought it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and seize the day, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather do some day-seizing with than you. So, what do you say? Let's drop the cherub off with Auntie Sun and Uncle Jin and you and I, go for a little stroll.
claire_littleton I would love to.
sayid_jarrah From the position of this stream, we should be here, and if the scale is right, his people are two miles in that direction. I don’t expect you to confirm that.
john_locke It's electrical wiring map, Sayid. I'm not sure it's as accurate as you think.
sayid_jarrah Well it's certainly not as infallible as the magical carvings on your stick.
john_locke Hey, the stick did get us to that station.
sayid_jarrah Oh, the station which you accidentally blew up.
john_locke Well, if you'da warned me that the basement was rigged with C4, I might'a been a little more careful.
kate_austen Why don't you just tell us if we're going the right way?
mikhail_bakunin You're going the right way.
john_locke Remind me why we're keeping him alive.
sayid_jarrah What do you suggest, we shoot him like a dog?
john_locke No, I like dogs.
danielle_rousseau He's right; they will not trade his life for his friend's. We should shoot him.
kate_austen Enough, nobody's shooting anybody. The map says where they are, and he says the map is right. Just keep moving.
charlie_pace Okay, here we are, here we are. Not bad eh?
claire_littleton Not bad at all...
charlie_pace Well, if you take a seat, we'll begin with our first course, which is cereal, we have fresh fruit salad—
desmond_hume Good morning.
charlie_pace Morning yourself. What brings you down to the beach, Desmond?
desmond_hume Boar running thick. I was hoping you might want to join me in a hunt.
charlie_pace Oh, well thanks for the invite, but as you can see we're just about to begin a picnic.
desmond_hume I think hunting might be a better way to spend your day, Charlie. I mean of all the things you could choose to do today, hunting with me might be your best option.
claire_littleton Oh my god, oh, oh my god.
charlie_pace What is it?
claire_littleton I think I know how to get us off this island.
claire_littleton Sun, Jin!
sunhwa_kwon Claire! What's the matter?
claire_littleton I need Jin's nets and fish. We gotta hurry, and buckets, I'm gonna need those too.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐라고 하는 거야?
claire_littleton We have to catch the birds.
sunhwa_kwon What birds?
claire_littleton They just flew over and they're only gonna be here today, so if we're gonna catch one, we need to do it now.
james_ford Oh, this sounds like fun.
claire_littleton Can you get some nets?
james_ford Nets for what, Barb—
james_ford Nets for what, Claire?
claire_littleton Okay, five minutes ago, a flock of seabirds flew over my head. Seabirds are migratory, which means they're going to keep heading south.
sunhwa_kwon I'm sorry; I don't understand why we need to—
claire_littleton They're tagged!
jinsoo_kwon Tagged?
claire_littleton Scientists tag these birds so they can track them. So, when they eventually land in Australia or New Zealand or wherever, somebody's gonna gather them up.
sunhwa_kwon We can send a message!
claire_littleton If we can catch one. Okay, so here's the plan. First we gotta cut up these fish, make chum, that'll get the birds to settle in the water. And then, umm, we're gonna need to cut up some of this net. Charlie, can you go get some knives?
claire_littleton Umm, Charlie.
claire_littleton Charlie!
charlie_pace Yeah, err, how do you even know this stuff about birds, Claire?
claire_littleton I, umm, I watched a lot of nature shows with my mum.
charlie_pace That doesn't exactly make you an expert. I just... I don't want to see you wasting your time, that's all.
claire_littleton So what happened to seizing the day?
charlie_pace Sorry, I don't see the point.
E.R.#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode12 DOCTOR Hold still dear, just another second. There. We're through now.
OFFICER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES Miss Littleton? I'm Officer Barnes. I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to ask you a few questions. Can I—ask you how the accident happened?
claire_littleton A truck forced us off the road.
officer_barnes Okay... and who was driving?
claire_littleton Me.
officer_barnes Has anyone contacted your father?
claire_littleton My father died when I was two.
officer_barnes I'm sorry to hear that. I spoke with the truck driver — he's fine by the way — umm, he said that when you hit him—
claire_littleton No, he hit us.
officer_barnes At about what speed would you say that happened when you were driving?
claire_littleton It just came out of nowhere, I didn't—
officer_barnes That's not the question I asked, Miss Littleton.
claire_littleton I don't, I don't know how fast I was driving. Why are you even asking me these questions?!
officer_barnes These questions are standard procedure when there's a fatality.
claire_littleton My mother is in surgery, she's not dead.
officer_barnes Right. So she is.
claire_littleton This is not my fault.
officer_barnes Didn't say it was. Good day Miss Littleton.
kate_austen Can I ask you something? I told you that your daughter was living with them, and you haven’t asked me a single question about her, you haven't—
danielle_rousseau Your friend, Jack. Do you care about him?
kate_austen Yes.
danielle_rousseau Imagine 16 years from now, you're told he's still alive, but in your heart, you know that he wouldn't remember you. He wouldn’t know you. He wouldn't even know that you ever cared about him. I haven't asked you questions about my daughter because I do not want to know the answers.
kate_austen Water?
mikhail_bakunin No thank you.
kate_austen So how'd you get here? How'd you get onto this island?
danielle_rousseau Don't waste your breath; whatever he says will be a lie.
mikhail_bakunin I was recruited when I was 24; I was approached by a man—
kate_austen I didn't ask you when, I asked you how.
mikhail_bakunin They brought me on the submarine.
kate_austen So your people, they can just come and go whenever they want?
mikhail_bakunin Oh yes, but two weeks ago, our underwater beacon stopped emitting its locator signal. There was an event, an electromagnetic pulse. It would be impossible to come back.
kate_austen Why would you want to come back?
mikhail_bakunin You would not understand.
kate_austen Try me.
mikhail_bakunin I misspoke. What I meant to say is you are not capable of understanding.
kate_austen And why am I not capable?
sayid_jarrah Kate.
mikhail_bakunin Because you are not on the list.
kate_austen What list?
mikhail_bakunin The man who brought me here, who brought all of my people here, he is a magnificent man.
kate_austen If Ben's so magnificent, then why did he need one of us to save him?
mikhail_bakunin Ben? Ben is not. I will try to make this as simple as I can. You are not on the list because you are flawed. Because you are angry, and weak, and frightened.
sayid_jarrah The more I learn about your people, the more I suspect you're not as omniscient as you'd have us believe. Don't speak to us as if you know us.
mikhail_bakunin Of course I don't know you, Sayid Jarrah. How could I? And you, Kate Austen, are a complete stranger to me. But you John Locke, you I might have a fleeting memory of, but I must be confused, because the John Locke I know was paral—
danielle_rousseau Hey! Look at this! Over here... come on.
john_locke Well, looks like we're here.
claire_littleton Will this work?
jinsoo_kwon Yes, work.
jinsoo_kwon Err, Sun, needs help.
claire_littleton Okay.
claire_littleton Mmm... smells great!
sunhwa_kwon Let's get it over with. This was my mother's worst fear.
claire_littleton What do you mean?
sunhwa_kwon That I would end up doing something very much like this, cutting bait. She had high hopes for my future. They did not include me marrying a fisherman's son.
claire_littleton Well, I guess we don't always turn out like our mother's wanted.
sunhwa_kwon Of course, mine never worked a day in her life.
claire_littleton My mom was a librarian.
sunhwa_kwon Was?
claire_littleton We should get this stuff out there.
lindsey_littleton Where were you?
claire_littleton Went home to take a shower.
lindsey_littleton Oh, that must have been nice.
claire_littleton They said she was still in surgery. I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.
lindsey_littleton Well I'm glad that you're feeling refreshed.
dr_woodruff WOODRUFF Good afternoon. Are you the daughter? I'm Doctor Woodruff, neural surgery. I'll be observing your mother for the next few days.
lindsey_littleton How is she?
dr_woodruff We’ve managed to stabilize her immediate injuries, but... your mother's suffered a severe head trauma. We'll have to wait for the swelling in her brain to go down before we determine the full extent of her injuries. But, uh, I'm afraid we're looking at fairly widespread damage.
claire_littleton Wait, what does that mean?
dr_woodruff It means that right now, these machines are sustaining her life.
claire_littleton It won't always be, I mean when she wakes up she won't need—
dr_woodruff I can't say with any real confidence—that she will wake up.
claire_littleton Can she hear us?
dr_woodruff I'd like to think she can.
lindsey_littleton How long will she be like this?
dr_woodruff Could be a day, a week, or years. We'll just have to wait and see. But I can assure you she'll be well looked after.
lindsey_littleton Oh, that's very nice, but we can't pay for that.
dr_woodruff Don't worry; her expenses have already been taken care of.
lindsey_littleton By whom?
dr_woodruff I've been asked to keep that confidential.
jinsoo_kwon One, two.
claire_littleton Oh no!
jinsoo_kwon 야...
desmond_hume Look, I'm sorry.
jinsoo_kwon 이 멍청한 놈아!
desmond_hume I'm sorry, man.
jinsoo_kwon 우리 다 죽을 뻔 했잖아!
desmond_hume I said I'm sorry.
claire_littleton What the hell is wrong with you?!
desmond_hume Look I was shooting at a boar, I had no idea you were out here.
claire_littleton Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
desmond_hume He's back at the camp, look I'm really sorry.
claire_littleton So it's just you?
desmond_hume Aye it's just me.
claire_littleton Hunting? In the exact same spot we're setting our trap!
desmond_hume I was following a boar, Claire.
claire_littleton Oh, so it's just a coincidence then. Where is it?
desmond_hume It got away.
claire_littleton You don't want me to catch the birds do you? You and Charlie. What's going on?
desmond_hume Why wouldn't I want you to catch the birds?
kate_austen What is it?
sayid_jarrah Don't touch it! Don’t even go near it! What are these pylons?
mikhail_bakunin What do you think they are?
sayid_jarrah A security perimeter. Those sensors on the side would be triggered if anyone passed between them. It's an alarm system, or a trap. Either way, we'd be safer going around it.
mikhail_bakunin You're right, it was a security perimeter. But like everything else on this island, it hasn't functioned in years.
sayid_jarrah Of course it hasn't.
mikhail_bakunin If you wish to waste your time, be my guest. The pylons encircle the entire Barracks. There is no going around them. If you don’t believe me, look at your map.
sayid_jarrah He appears to be telling the truth.
sayid_jarrah John, John!
mikhail_bakunin Thank you.
kate_austen Oh my god.
john_locke Sorry.
sayid_jarrah Looks like he suffered cerebral hemorrhage.
kate_austen Why did you do that? We needed him!
john_locke They were never going to trade him for Jack.
kate_austen You don't know that!
john_locke Well you don't know it either! What we do know is that he shot one of his own people who didn't want to be in this exact situation. So I'm going to stick with my opinion.
kate_austen Yeah, well we could've discussed it.
john_locke Nobody asked me about it when we brought him along in the first place.
sayid_jarrah Alright.
john_locke Pardon me, for not knowing that they had a— a sonic weapon fence. I didn't know he was gonna die, how would I know that?
sayid_jarrah Why are you really here? Are you here for Jack?
john_locke Why else would I be here?
sayid_jarrah We'll talk about this later.
john_locke Fine by me. Just tell me how we're gonna go through this.
kate_austen We're not going through it, we're going over it. Sayid, where's the axe?
sayid_jarrah It's in his pack.
john_locke No wait a minute I got it— here I got it.
sayid_jarrah I thought you didn't know there was any C4?
john_locke Well I stand corrected.
sayid_jarrah Why did you take it?
john_locke You never know when a little C4 might come in handy.
sayid_jarrah You'll have to do better than that.
charlie_pace Okay, here we go. Ohh...
claire_littleton What's going on with you Charlie?!
charlie_pace Shh, I just put Aaron down.
claire_littleton No, you and Desmond, what's going on?
charlie_pace I don't know what you're talking about.
claire_littleton So you don't know anything about Desmond shooting off his gun and scaring away the birds?
charlie_pace I've been with Aaron, all morning.
claire_littleton You're lying to me Charlie.
charlie_pace I am not lying!
claire_littleton What happened to the guy that woke up this morning and wanted to go and have a picnic and seize the day?
charlie_pace You really wanna know the truth? The glint you saw could have been anything; a piece of glass stuck in the birds foot, or it coulda been nothing at all! I don't want to advocate false hope, Claire. That's all.
claire_littleton Well I'm sorry I bothered you with my stupid ideas. And err, it won't ever happen again. And Charlie, I don't want my baby around liars.
charlie_pace I think you might be overreacting.
claire_littleton Overreacting?! No, I thought you were here for me, that I could count on you! I was wrong!
charlie_pace Claire...
claire_littleton No, I'm on my own and at least I know that now.
charlie_pace Claire...
claire_littleton Just go!
head_nurse NURSE Morning dear. Oh, I like your new doctor.
claire_littleton What new doctor?
head_nurse NURSE Oh, the American. He's in with your mum now.
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode12 Dr. Brown to the OR stat, Dr. Brown to the OR stat.
claire_littleton 'scuse me.
claire_littleton The nurse said that—are you a doctor?
dr_christian_shephard Yes, umm. I'm umm. I'm very sorry, I shouldn't be disturbing you, I was just leaving.
lindsey_littleton What are you doing here?
dr_christian_shephard I was just on my way out, Lindsey.
lindsey_littleton If Carole knew you were here—
dr_christian_shephard She'd what? What would she do? She wouldn't be acting the way you are.
claire_littleton Aunt Lindsey, err, what's going on here? Who is he?
lindsey_littleton It doesn't matter, just go.
dr_christian_shephard Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey? She deserves to know.
lindsey_littleton Please, just leave us alone.
dr_christian_shephard You are not the arbiter here.
lindsey_littleton No, you are taking advantage of my—
dr_christian_shephard Under these circumstances, I do believe that Claire has every right to know!
claire_littleton Just stop it! You are the one paying the bills? Are you the one taking care of all this?
dr_christian_shephard Yes.
claire_littleton Then who are you?
dr_christian_shephard I'm your father, Claire.
sayid_jarrah The system appears to fire a sonic pulse when an object breaks the plane between two pylons. So, as long as we don't break the plane, we should remain unharmed.
danielle_rousseau Why don't we just use the plastic explosive you took?
john_locke Be my guest, you wanna go stick it on there?
sayid_jarrah Whoever climbs over, give those sensors a wide berth.
kate_austen I'll go first.
john_locke I guess I'll go next.
sunhwa_kwon Here you go.
claire_littleton Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon You have every right to be upset.
claire_littleton It just doesn't make any sense. Desmond's never gone boar hunting before, and the boar never come that close to the beach.
sunhwa_kwon Well whatever's going on, they're still talking about it.
claire_littleton Can you watch him?
sunhwa_kwon What are you going to do?
claire_littleton Get some answers.
claire_littleton I'll be with you in a sec!
claire_littleton There you go, that'll be ten bucks.
claire_littleton What are you doing here?
dr_christian_shephard Buy you a cup of coffee?
claire_littleton I have nothing to say to you.
dr_christian_shephard Claire, I'm leaving tonight, then I'll be out of your life forever. Just one cup of coffee.
claire_littleton So it's true?
dr_christian_shephard Yes, it's true.
claire_littleton How'd you find out about the accident?
dr_christian_shephard A doctor friend here in Sydney told me. I got the call the minute your mother went into surgery.
claire_littleton Why did she tell me that you were dead?
dr_christian_shephard Well, because I, no doubt, left her with so many wonderful memories. Look, we had a fling, I was back in Los Angeles, and she told me she was pregnant, that she was going to have the baby, have you.
claire_littleton And you didn't want to see me?
dr_christian_shephard No, no, I came out a bunch of times when you were little. I stayed over, I gave you toys, I sang to you.
claire_littleton Why'd you stop coming?
dr_christian_shephard Cause your aunt hates me and your mother didn't like the fact that I had another family.
claire_littleton Why are you here now then? And why'd you come? You could've just paid the bills from the States.
dr_christian_shephard I came over because I wanted to help.
claire_littleton Help with what?
dr_christian_shephard Claire, your mother is alive, but she's not really living.
claire_littleton What the hell's that supposed to mean?
dr_christian_shephard It means that now may be the time to look at other alternatives; other ways to relieve her pain. Now, it is illegal to turn off her machines, but I know of ways that can achieve the same effect without the legal consequences.
claire_littleton Just stop it! You didn't come here to help me, you came here to try and fix a mistake that you made.
dr_christian_shephard No honey, that's not true.
claire_littleton You think that just paying her bills makes you noble or something? You come down here and you try and get me to kill her? You know, just go. Why don't you just go, go back to your real family.
claire_littleton You know... You know, you might be my father, but I don't even know your name, and I umm, want it to stay that way.
dr_christian_shephard Claire! Claire, Claire listen to me. Do not keep your mother alive for the wrong reasons. Now there is hope and there is guilt. And believe me, I know the difference. Bye kiddo, it was great seeing you again.
claire_littleton What the hell are you doing?!
desmond_hume You followed me. Stay back!
claire_littleton It's one of the birds.
desmond_hume Stay back!
claire_littleton It's a—
claire_littleton How did you know it was gonna be here?
desmond_hume I didn't.
claire_littleton Yes you did, you had to. That's what you and Charlie were arguing about. You knew.
desmond_hume How would I?
claire_littleton I don't know, but you know, you walked straight here, no doubt at all about where you were going. You came right to this beach and right to this rock, and lo and behold, there's the bird. What the hell is going on Desmond?
desmond_hume See that spot over there? That's where Charlie slipped and fell. He got pounded again and again by the rocks and broke his neck.
claire_littleton What? What are you talking about?
desmond_hume That's where Charlie died.
claire_littleton Look what Desmond found.
charlie_pace How 'bout that? It does have a tag. You were right.
claire_littleton Desmond told me everything. About all his visions; that he knew you were gonna get hit by lightning; that you were gonna drown, trying to rescue me in the ocean; how you died trying to get me this bird.
charlie_pace You don't believe all that, do you?
,#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode12 walks into her mother's hospital room.]
claire_littleton Now who turned the telly off? Don't they know how much you love your nature shows?
claire_littleton That's better. So how are you today Mom? Did you have an okay night? There's umm, something I have to tell you, Mom, something I should have told you a long time ago. I'm pregnant. I err, I'm giving it away, it's for the best. I wish—I don't know how you did it... raising me alone? It must have been so hard. And I was just awful, awful... so horrible to you. I'm so sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all the awful things I said to you in the car; that I hated you; and that I wished you weren't my mother; and I wished you were dead. It's all my fault, the accident and everything. I'm so sorry, mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll see you soon, okay?
charlie_pace To whom it may concern, we are survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. We have survived on this island for 80 days. We were 6 hours into the flight when the pilot said we were off course and turned back towards Fiji. We hit turbulence and crashed. We've been waiting here, all this time, waiting for rescue that has not come. We do not know where we are; we only know you have not found us. We've done our best to live on this island. Some of us have come to accept that we may never leave it. Not all of us have survived since the crash, but there is new life too, and with it, there is hope. We are alive. Please don't give up on us.
charlie_pace It's—it's perfect, Claire.
claire_littleton You know, I'm not giving up on you either, Charlie. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We'll get through this together.
kate_austen What?
sayid_jarrah We're here.
kate_austen Jack—
tom_friendly Ha! Whoop!
