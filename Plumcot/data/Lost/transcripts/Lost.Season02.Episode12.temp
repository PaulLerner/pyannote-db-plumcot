YOUNG LIAM Voltron, whoa!
YOUNG CHARLIE Where are my presents?
MRS. PACE Right over here, Charlie. 
YOUNG CHARLIE It's a piano! This is mine?
MRS. PACE Yes, Charlie. Father Christmas must have known how talented you are. You're special, love. Someday you're going to get us out of here, all of us. Now, go on, play us a tune.
LIAM Come on, baby brother. You can't save us if you don't play.
MRS. PACE Come on, Charlie, play. Play me a tune. Come on now, let's hear it.
VOICE He ain't saving no one, he ain't. Music. Music will never get you anywhere, Charlie boy.
BUTCHER You need a trade.
CHARLIE Dad?
LIAM Do it baby bro; save us.
MRS. PACE Save us, Charlie. Save us.
CHARLIE Aaron?
CHARLIE Aaron! Aaron! It's okay Aaron, it's alright.
CHARLIE Aaron!! Aaron!!
CHARLIE Sun! Hey, Sun! Have you seen Claire and the baby, they've gone.
SUN They're right over there.
CHARLIE Is Aaron okay?
SUN Yes, he's fine. Charlie!? --
CLAIRE It's okay, shhh.
CHARLIE Hey.
CLAIRE Hey.
CHARLIE I made Aaron some nappies this morning. I'll just put those there.
CLAIRE Thanks.
CHARLIE Has he been asking about me?
CLAIRE Charlie -- don't.
CHARLIE I'm sorry. I should have told you about the statue -- what was in it. I just wish things could get back to the way they were before.
CLAIRE There is no before, Charlie. We were strangers on a plane and we became friends.
CHARLIE Now Locke's your friend, huh?
CLAIRE Please, Charlie, just for now give me some space, okay?
CHARLIE Yeah, space. See ya, mate. Take care of your mom now, okay.
KAREN Charlie? Hey!
CHARLIE Hey! What are you doing up? You should be lying down.
KAREN I just needed to see her again. Isn't she brilliant?
CHARLIE She's beautiful, Karen.
KAREN I named her Megan. Where's Liam? He's not here.
CHARLIE Karen, look, it wasn't his fault. We were leaving the club in Dresden -- I was in a cab -- he, he was in a van with the gear and they blew a tire on the way to the airport. He missed his flight. He's on the next plane, alright? He'll be here soon.
KAREN But he's okay?
CHARLIE He's great. He's a dad.
CHARLIE Oh, for the -- Liam. Unbelievable. Liam?
CHARLIE Liam, wake up! Oi, what the hell's wrong with you? What the hell are you doing?
LIAM Hey, baby brother.
CHARLIE You're supposed to be cleaning up. Get up. I told Karen you missed your flight. She's all alone at the hospital and you're here fixing? What's the matter with you?
LIAM I'm cool. I'm cool. I just needed to get right, that's all. Don't worry, I left you some.
CHARLIE Get right? Why don't you get up? Take a shower, get dressed, get to the hospital.
LIAM Alright. Alright, I'm on it. Alright.
CHARLIE Oh, by the way -- you have a daughter. Her name's Megan.
LIAM After mum?
CHARLIE Yeah, after mum. Now clean yourself up. You're a sodding father now.
KATE Easy. That's good. That was good. Okay, one more.
HURLEY Uh, Sawyer, when you were over there across the Island how well did you get to know those Tailies?
SAWYER Well enough, why?
HURLEY That Libby chick seems pretty cool. I mean, is she?
SAWYER Well, you got a little love connection brewing over there, Jabba?
HURLEY Nah, just asking.
SAWYER I hear you asking.
HURLEY Forget it.
KATE What's with you? You're acting like you're in junior high.
SAWYER Well, what do we have here? It looks like Ana Lucia is getting the 20 dollar tour. That's the third time I've seen them walking out of the jungle. What do you suppose they're doing out there?
KATE Why don't you just do your exercises, Sawyer.
CHARLIE Bloody hell.
CHARLIE Hey! Hey! Somebody help me! I ca-- help!
CHARLIE Help! The baby!
CHARLIE Aaron! Aaron! I'm coming! I'm coming, Aaron! Okay. Just hang on.
CHARLIE I've got you. It's alright. It's okay. You're okay now. You're safe. You're safe. It's okay.
CHARLIE Mom? Claire?
MRS. PACE He's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in terrible danger. He's in danger. You have to save him. He's in danger. You have to save him. Danger. You have to save him. He's in danger.
CLAIRE You have to save the baby. Charlie, only you can save him. The baby. You have to save the baby, Charlie.
HURLEY Charlie? What are you doing?
CHARLIE What?
HURLEY What are you doing, man?
CHARLIE What's going on?
HURLEY It's the middle of the night. What are you doing with the baby?
CHARLIE I don't know.
CLAIRE Help! Somebody took my baby!! I don't know, Aaron's gone.
HURLEY It's okay! We're over here!
CLAIRE Is he alright?! Is he okay?!
CHARLIE Claire. I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. He's okay, though. I, I had this dream --
HURLEY Stick? I don't know, dude. Don't you need 21? I think you should hit.
SAWYER But I've got a 6; I'm going to bust.
HURLEY How do you know that?
SAWYER Well, I don't, but you've got to assume that I'm going to bust.
HURLEY Why?
SAWYER Well, well, look who's off to the laundromat? Well, go on. I'm sure you've got a load you need to drop in, don't you, Jethro?
HURLEY I'm kind of waiting for my moment.
SAWYER Well, your moment is now, Hoss. Hey Libby!
LIBBY Hey yourself. 
CHARLIE Hey, John, can I talk to you for a second?
LOCKE Yeah, what is it, Charlie?
CHARLIE I take it you heard about what happened last night.
LOCKE If you mean you taking the baby out of Claire's tent in the middle of the night -- yeah, I heard.
CHARLIE This whole thing was a big misunderstanding, John. I was sleepwalking. I don't how or why --
LOCKE Is there something you want from me, Charlie?
CHARLIE I was hoping you could speak to Claire for me. You know, put in a good word.
LOCKE Are you using?
CHARLIE What?
LOCKE Heroin. Are you using again?
CHARLIE Kate sees a horse -- nothing. Pretty much everybody's seen Walt wandering around the jungle. But when it's Charlie it must be the bloody drugs, right?
LOCKE It's funny, you didn't answer my question.
CHARLIE You remember the plane, John? We burned it, Eko and me. We burned the whole thing -- the heroin, the statues -- it's all gone. Destroyed.
LOCKE All of them?
CHARLIE All of them.
LOCKE Trust is a hard thing to win back. Claire needs time. You should leave her and the baby alone for awhile.
CHARLIE Can you do this? You look green.
LIAM Sod off. I'm fine.
DIRECTOR All right, let's give this another go, shall we?
CHARLIE Get it together, alright. Lest you forget, we need this.
DIRECTOR Tea. So, you lads ready?
CHARLIE Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.
DIRECTOR Let's try not to blow it this time, eh.
CHARLIE Thank you. You good?
DIRECTOR We've only 20 minutes until we're in overtime. Now get it right.
DIRECTOR Alright. Camera. Rotate on the 8 count.
CREW Rolling.
DIRECTOR Hold the product up!
CREW Bubbies diapers, take 53.
CREW Playback.
DIRECTOR And, action.
DIRECTOR Cut!
CHARLIE It's alright.
DIRECTOR That's it. We wrap.
CHARLIE Oi, no! Oi, mate, hang on. Wait, what are you doing?
DIRECTOR Let's not waste anymore time, shall we? You were only hired as a favor to your lawyer. I wanted Dirt Spigot.
CHARLIE Come on, mate. Give us another chance.
DIRECTOR You want another chance? Take my advice; ditch that one . He's a bloody disaster.
CHARLIE I'm not ditching anyone. He's my brother.
DIRECTOR Right. Well then, I guess you're fired.
LIBBY Is this washer and dryer newer than everything else in here?
HURLEY It washes clothes. That's all I need to know.
LIBBY Ah, finally, someone who keeps it simple. Oh, hey, look at this. I got it in some of the abandoned luggage. You think I can pull this off? Let me give you a hand -- when a girl asks that kind of question, she's looking for validation.
HURLEY Do I know you from somewhere?
LIBBY You mean other than the flight?
HURLEY Flight?
LIBBY Okay, turn around.
HURLEY Huh?
LIBBY Turn around. I want to try it on. Turn around.
HURLEY Oh, oh, sure, go ahead.
LIBBY No peeking. I cannot believe you don't remember stepping on my foot.
HURLEY I did?
LIBBY Yes, you did. And it was hard. I know that because I remember you were the last one on the flight, and you were all sweaty, and you had headphones on -- and crunch. You stepped on my foot. Okay, turn around. What do you think?
HURLEY It's awesome.
LIBBY Thanks.
CHARLIE What are you doing?
EKO I'm marking trees.
CHARLIE Why?
EKO Because these are the ones I like.
CHARLIE Did you tell Locke you gave me one of those statues from the plane?
EKO Why would I do that?
CHARLIE He knows, man. Bald wanker knows something.
EKO Something wrong, Charlie?
CHARLIE Apart from me losing my mind? No, everything's just peachy.
EKO Why would you say you are losing your mind?
CHARLIE How about the fact that I've been sleepwalking? Stealing babies from their cribs? Oh yeah, and then there's the vivid dreams that make me feel like I'm completely awake until, of course, I wake up.
EKO What are your dreams about?
CHARLIE Variations on Aaron being in mortal peril -- trapped in a piano, drifting out to sea, there's the flying dove, and Claire and my mum dressed as angels telling me I need to save the baby. What?
EKO Have you ever considered that these dreams mean something?
CHARLIE Like what?
EKO What if you do need to save the baby?
CHARLIE I have to talk to her.
KATE Hey, you know, now's not a good time. Okay?
CHARLIE No, I have to talk to her. She'll want to hear this.
KATE Okay, you know what, so tell me and I will tell her.
CHARLIE Kate! No. Claire!
KATE I said not now!
CHARLIE Claire! Wait, please, Claire! Listen to me. Aaron's in danger.
CLAIRE What are you talking about?
CHARLIE The baby's in danger! Look, I've been having these dreams. I know what they mean now.
KATE Charlie.
CHARLIE Kate! Claire, listen, we have to baptize Aaron.
CLAIRE What?
CHARLIE We can do this! Eko's a priest! We can do this!
KATE It's time to go.
CHARLIE No, wait! I'm not finished! Claire, look, we have to baptize Aaron!
KATE I said it's time to go. Now!
JACK Here. For when it rains.
ANA Thanks.
ANA So when are you going to tell me what happened in the jungle?
JACK I already did. Pull it tighter; it'll sag.
ANA You told me what that guy said. You didn't tell me what made you turn around -- what made you come back.
JACK He had a gun at Kate's head.
ANA You hittin' that?
JACK What?
ANA Plane crash -- you both survive -- nice beach -- she's hot, you're hot. It's what people do.
JACK I'm not hittin' that.
CHARLIE Hey.
LIAM Karen kicked me out, man.
CHARLIE What? What happened?
LIAM She, uh, she thinks I'm dangerous.
CHARLIE Why would she think that?
LIAM Because I dropped her. I dropped Megan.
CHARLIE Oh. Hey, Liam, sorry.
LIAM I've got no money. I've got nothing. What are we going to do?
CHARLIE We'll get through this.
LIAM Yeah, how's that?
CHARLIE I'm writing again. I've got a new song. It's about 2 brothers.
LIAM 2 brothers who should be butchers.
CHARLIE Don't say that! It's a good one. I feel like this might be the one. Alright, listen to this, okay. Funny now, you finally see me standing here/Funny now, I'm crying in the rain. All alone, I try to be invincible/Together now , we can be saved. Nice, man.
LIAM This could work.
CHARLIE It's good, right?
LIAM We could make it work. Write all night just like the old days.
CHARLIE Alright.
LIAM So, baby brother, have you got any?
LOCKE I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.
CHARLIE You followed me?
LOCKE How long have you been coming out here?
CHARLIE John, you've got the wrong idea, man.
LOCKE You said you destroyed them all, and yet here they are. How is that the wrong idea?
CHARLIE I came out here to finish the job. I'm going to get rid of these right now.
LOCKE Yeah, that's very convenient now that I found you. 
CHARLIE What are you doing?
LOCKE There was a time when I let you choose whether or not you were going to do this to yourself. Now I'm making that choice for you.
CHARLIE Oh, you don't believe me? Give them to me. Give them to me right now; I'll destroy them! Look! I'll throw them in the sodding wind. Look, John, I know I lied, alright. Just wait, wait, wait! Remember all those talks we had, you and me? You said everything happens for a reason -- this island tests us. That's what this is, John, a test. This is my test. That's why these are here.
LOCKE These are here because you put them here, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Wait, John, wait. What are you going to do? Are you going to tell Claire? You can't. If she sees them, I'm done. She'll never trust me again, and she has to, John. It's about the baby, alright? Aaron's in danger. You have to believe me.
LOCKE You've given up the right to be believed, Charlie.
CLAIRE Hey.
LOCKE Hi. How's our boy?
CLAIRE Oh, he's good. Hey, John, can I ask you something?
LOCKE Sure.
CLAIRE Do you think Aaron and I could stay in the bedroom in the Hatch for a while?
LOCKE A pretty loud alarm goes off every hour and a half. It's not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night.
CLAIRE Oh, yeah, sure.
LOCKE How about if I move my stuff down here for a couple of nights -- set up right next to your tent?
CLAIRE That would be great, thanks.
LOCKE Consider it done.
CLAIRE Hey, John, you don't know anything about baptism, do you?
LOCKE Not a whole lot, why?
CLAIRE Charlie came by my tent before and told me Aaron had to be baptized -- he was in danger.
LOCKE My understanding is that baptism is about making sure that children get into heaven -- should anything happen. Call it spiritual insurance. There isn't any danger, Claire. Charlie is just -- Charlie just feels like he has to save the baby because he can't save himself. I'll see you tonight.
SAYID Charlie, can you give us a hand?
CHARLIE Now's not a good time, Sayid.
SAYID Here, let's lift this.
SAYID Fire! Fire! Grab tools, containers for sand, anything you have. If we don't stop it now, it's going to burn right through the camp.
LOCKE Stay here with Aaron.
SAYID We need to cut a fire break right here! Form a bucket line!
LOCKE Some of you people down to the water! We'll hand them up, wait here.
CHARLIE Liam! My piano. What's going on? Liam, where's my piano?
LIAM I sold it.
CHARLIE You what? Hey, wait, I don't have to --
LIAM Get off me.
CHARLIE Where's the money?! Is it up your sodding arm?!
LIAM I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.
CHARLIE Two days? Well, happy anniversary!
LIAM Well, how long have you been clean?!
CHARLIE Where's the money?
LIAM She was going to leave me, Charlie. She was going to take Megan.
CHARLIE What did you do, Liam?
LIAM Karen's got an uncle in Australia. He's going to get me a job. There's a rehab clinic in Sydney. I just needed the money to get us there. I have to do this. I have to take care of myself for them -- for my family.
CHARLIE I'm your family!
CHARLIE Wait. Will you just wait?
LIAM I can't, Charlie.
CHARLIE What about the band? What about the song?
LIAM Try to understand. I have to go. I have to. Look, I'll give you a call when things settle down for me. 
CHARLIE For you? What about me? What about my family? What about my family?!
CLAIRE Charlie, what are you doing?!
CHARLIE I'm doing what I have to do.
CLAIRE He's got my baby!! Stop it!
CHARLIE No, Claire, it's alright! It's not --
CLAIRE Charlie, stop! Help! Somebody help! He's got my baby!!
CLAIRE Help! Come on, Charlie, please. Stop it.
CHARLIE I just wanted to save him!
LOCKE Charlie! Give me the baby.
CHARLIE Eko, tell them! Tell them, Eko! Tell them what you told me -- that the baby has to be baptized!
EKO This is not the way.
LOCKE Charlie, come on, give him to me.
CHARLIE Who the hell are you, John?! Aaron's not your responsibility! Where were you when he was born?! Where were you when he was taken?! You're not his father! You're not his family!
LOCKE Neither are you, Charlie.
CHARLIE I have to do this. I need to. I'm not going to hurt him.
CLAIRE You're hurting me, Charlie.
CHARLIE Claire. I'm sorry, Claire.
JACK You need stitches. Try to be still.
CHARLIE I started the fire, Jack.
JACK Yeah, I know.
CHARLIE I was desperate. She --
JACK I need to know you're never going to do anything like this again. Ever.
CHARLIE I know what this looks like -- what people think. It doesn't matter now, but I didn't use. I wanted to. I really wanted to. But I didn't.
JACK That's not what I asked, Charlie.
CHARLIE It's not going to happen again.
CLAIRE Charlie told me you were a priest.
EKO Yes.
CLAIRE He said that you told him that I had to have --
EKO I did not tell Charlie to do what he did. I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.
CLAIRE But, do you think the baby has to be baptized?
EKO Do you know what baptism is?
CLAIRE It's what gets you into heaven.
EKO It is said that when John the Baptist baptized Jesus the skies opened up and a dove flew down from the sky. This told John something -- that he had cleansed this man of all his sins. That he had freed him. Heaven came much later.
CLAIRE I haven't been baptized. Does that mean that if you do it to Aaron and something happened to us that we wouldn't be together?
EKO Not if I baptize you both.
