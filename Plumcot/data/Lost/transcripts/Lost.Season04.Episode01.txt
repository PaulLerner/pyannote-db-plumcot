NEWSREADER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?
JEFF#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 We're getting reports that the pursuit began near the La Brea area, then travelled to a warehouse in the district south of the ten freeway.
NEWSREADER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Can you see how many people are in the car?
JEFF#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 It would appear to be just the one, the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here are pictures of the ten freeway, south of downtown.
NEWSREADER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Is that a Camaro, Jeff?
JEFF#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Yes, yes it looks like a vintage early 70's model.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it.

hugo_reyes Stop! Don't you know who I am? Stop, wait, don't you know who I am? I'm one of the Oceanic six! I'm one of the Oceanic six!!!
detective_mike_walton So five minutes before you led ten cruisers on a chase across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until, you see something and freak out. Mr Reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store and it made you run away in a...
hugo_reyes I wasn't running away from anyone.
detective_mike_walton Do you think I care that you're a celebrity? You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighbourhood.
hugo_reyes I'm not a celebrity.
detective_mike_walton Is that why you kept shouting "Hey I'm one of the Oceanic Six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence?
hugo_reyes Sure.
detective_mike_walton I knew somebody on your plane.
hugo_reyes Really?
detective_mike_walton Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez. She was my partner before I made detective. Dark hair. Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her? Maybe you met her on the plane? Before it took off?
hugo_reyes Sorry, never met her.
detective_mike_walton Why don't you watch the tape. Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut, you want one?
hugo_reyes No thanks.
detective_mike_walton When I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.
hugo_reyes Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
detective_mike_walton The hell is wrong with you?
detective_mike_walton What are you doing Reyes? Huh, you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? 'Cause if that's what you want, I can make that happen right now, my friend.
hugo_reyes You can? Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
hugo_reyes Jack? You there dude? Beach to Jack, come in Jack. Beach to Jack—
dr_jack_shephard Right here, Hurley, what's up?
hugo_reyes Hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat, they're on their way to pick us up right now.
hugo_reyes Seriously? It worked?
dr_jack_shephard Seriously, we're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags buddy .
hugo_reyes Hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
dr_jack_shephard Any luck?
kate_austen Nothing, no sign of him. (She looks at Naomi lying on the ground) It's like he just disappeared. Why would Locke kill her? He hadn't even met her.
dr_jack_shephard Because he's crazy.
kate_austen So what if he comes back?
dr_jack_shephard He comes back, I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna get everybody together, the sooner we get back to the beach, the better.
kate_austen Are we really going home?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. We're really going home.
sunhwa_kwon I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital.
claire_littleton Oh rub it in why don't you!
sunhwa_kwon Oh, no...
rose_nadler You ladies need a hand?
claire_littleton No, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know, you must be very proud with Bernard, I hear he's quite the hero.
rose_nadler But everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, Claire. If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you'd better make sure you treat him real good when we get back.
claire_littleton Rose!
ben_linus I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex and get as far from here as possible.
danielle_rousseau What?
ben_linus Listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now, I don't care where you go, just go, I will not have my daughter—
danielle_rousseau She is not your daughter.
hugo_reyes Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me.
bernard_nadler Oh yeah, who needs a hundred and fifty million dollars, right?
hugo_reyes Now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think I'm dead. We get rescued and I go back. I'm gonna be free. (Pauses) I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And I wanna do a cannonball.
bernard_nadler Hurley. You wanna do a cannonball? Cannonball.
sayid_jarrah Are you alright Desmond?
desmond_hume We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
james_ford Easy, Scottie, everything's cool, boat's on the way.
desmond_hume What? On the way? No.
hugo_reyes Hey where's Charlie?
desmond_hume No that woman, Naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!
dr_juliet_burke What?
james_ford Then who are they?
hugo_reyes Desmond, where's Charlie?
desmond_hume I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack, now!!
dr_juliet_burke It's alright, we can call him, we have a walkie. It's OK.
desmond_hume Where is it, get it.
bernard_nadler What do you mean the people aren't who they say they are?
hugo_reyes Where's Charlie?!
desmond_hume I'm, I'm sorry brother. I...
kate_austen That's our ride.
dr_jack_shephard Hello.
george_minkowski Hey Jack. This is George Minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some RF interference. We're gonna need to re-jigger some of the settings on your sat phone.
dr_jack_shephard Er sure, ok, just tell me what I gotta tell.
george_minkowski How about you put Naomi on.
dr_jack_shephard Naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second, let me see if I...
dr_jack_shephard Where is she?
ben_linus
james_ford Look, we gotta call the Doc.
sayid_jarrah Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand.
james_ford Look, I'm sorry he's dead. But I don't even know what the hell "not Penny's boat" means.
sayid_jarrah Calling Jack accomplishes nothing.
dr_juliet_burke It would accomplish warning him.
sayid_jarrah It also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. I've no doubt they're monitoring our communications, if we call Jack...
james_ford You know what? I got the walkie, I'm making the call. Hey!
hugo_reyes We better get going.
james_ford Going where?!
danielle_rousseau I found blood. The girl's trail. Probably crawled away. Can't be more than 10 minutes ahead of us. We should go, now, and find her.
dr_jack_shephard We're taking him with us.
danielle_rousseau Why would we do that?
dr_jack_shephard Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach. When these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find. OK?
claire_littleton You look worried, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard The only thing I'm worried about is missing our ride home.
kate_austen I found her trail. She's headed West across the Island.
dr_jack_shephard Rousseau already found it, we're going after her right now.
kate_austen But, are you sure it's hers?
dr_jack_shephard Unless someone else is bleeding.
kate_austen But if she didn't want us to find her, then she could have created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in case.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, six hours from now we're gonna be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt, she ran into the jungle, she's not thinking about leaving fake trails.
kate_austen You're right.
dr_jack_shephard I'll track her down, why don't you get everybody back to the beach.
kate_austen You got it.
kate_austen Be careful, OK?
james_ford The hell's gotten into you, Hugo? They'll all be back in the morning, if you just wait.
hugo_reyes You don't wait with warnings dude, you warn.
james_ford And here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.
hugo_reyes You almost got me that time. How about best out of seven?
nurse Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?
nurse Oh by the way, you have a visitor.
VISITOR#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Mr Reyes. Hello. My name is Matthew Abaddon. I'm an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes?
hugo_reyes OK.
matthew_abaddon I'm here, Mr Reyes, because we heard about your recent... episode. Your arrest. Your incarceration here. Frankly, we feel terrible about it. So, on behalf of Oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade.
hugo_reyes What kind of upgrade?
matthew_abaddon To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls. Where you'd have your own bathroom. You could see the ocean from there...
hugo_reyes I don't wanna see the ocean.
matthew_abaddon No problem.
hugo_reyes Actually, thanks, I'm... I'm fine right here.
matthew_abaddon Are you fine Mr. Reyes?
hugo_reyes What do you mean?
matthew_abaddon You're in a mental institution.
hugo_reyes Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
matthew_abaddon I must have left them at home.
hugo_reyes Then we're done, dude.
matthew_abaddon Are they still alive?
hugo_reyes What?
matthew_abaddon You heard me.
hugo_reyes Nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me.
NURSES#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 It's OK, it's OK.
james_ford Alright there, Hugo?
hugo_reyes Yeah, dude, I'm fine.
james_ford You wanna talk about it?
hugo_reyes Talk about what?
james_ford Charlie. I mean, you two were buddies, I just thought...
hugo_reyes We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.
james_ford I'm gonna head up and tell 'em to slow down.
hugo_reyes I can keep up.
james_ford Alright "esé"... Just holler if you need me.
hugo_reyes Guys. Guys! Guys! Guys!!! Guys!
hugo_reyes Uh oh.
danielle_rousseau The blood trail ends here.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean?
danielle_rousseau It ends.
dr_jack_shephard You're telling me she stopped bleeding here?
danielle_rousseau No. I'm telling you that she fooled us. Doubled back.
ben_linus Better call the boat. Tell 'em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood.
dr_jack_shephard Where is it?
ben_linus OK, I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one.
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about?
ben_linus Kate took it when she hugged you.
ben_linus She found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.
kate_austen Hello.
george_minkowski Who's this?
kate_austen Uh, this is Kate.
george_minkowski You with Jack?
kate_austen No, no, he's not here.
george_minkowski Where's Naomi?
kate_austen We're looking for her.
george_minkowski What do you mean, you're looking for her?
naomi_dorrit Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
kate_austen Naomi, listen to me. You're hurt, let me help you.
naomi_dorrit Help me? I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued. And you throw this knife in my back.
kate_austen No, no, it was not us.
naomi_dorrit Who?
kate_austen His name is John Locke.
naomi_dorrit Why?
kate_austen He said that you weren't who you said you were.
kate_austen I swear to God, we would never hurt you, you know us. Please. We need your help, please help us.
naomi_dorrit Give me the phone.
naomi_dorrit George. It's Naomi.
george_minkowski Naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there?
naomi_dorrit I had an accident. I'm hurt.
george_minkowski Wha, an accident. What accident? What happened? Naomi? Hello? Hello?
naomi_dorrit I hit a tree branch, when I parachuted in. Took it through my gut.
george_minkowski Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?
naomi_dorrit I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me until I could talk to you myself.
george_minkowski We've lost our signal and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency?
naomi_dorrit Yeah. Try it now.
george_minkowski Clear as a bell. Hang on Naomi, we'll get you back here ASAP, OK?
naomi_dorrit I'm sorry, George. Just tell my sister that I love her.
hugo_reyes Hello?
hugo_reyes Help! Help! Help!!!
hugo_reyes There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
john_locke Hello, Hugo.
john_locke You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo. How did you get separated from the group?
hugo_reyes I just... fell behind, I guess.
john_locke Is that why you were shouting for help?
hugo_reyes I got scared.
john_locke What Desmond said happened down in that station, "not Penny's boat." Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?
hugo_reyes Jack should never have called those people.
john_locke I couldn't agree more.
hugo_reyes It's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us.
john_locke Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo. Because if we can't talk 'em out of it, then Charlie died for nothing.
james_ford Where the hell have you been, Hugo?
hugo_reyes Sorry, I was just er... I got lost.
sayid_jarrah What are you doing here?
john_locke I came here for the same reason you did, to warn Jack about the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, but, I figured I might have better luck with some support.
sayid_jarrah You want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨!
bernard_nadler Still in one piece.
rose_nadler Rambo.
bernard_nadler Ow!
hugo_reyes I'll tell her.
hugo_reyes He's dead. Charlie's dead.
claire_littleton No.
PATIENT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 I'd watch out if I were you.
hugo_reyes What you talking about, dude?
PATIENT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 There's a guy over there, staring at you.
hugo_reyes What guy?
PATIENT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 That guy.
charlie_pace Hey man. Don't run. Hurley. Just, just, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. Don't do what you did in the store. OK? There's no need to freak out.
hugo_reyes No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the Ho Hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?
charlie_pace Can we just sit down?
hugo_reyes I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.
charlie_pace I am dead. But I'm also here.
hugo_reyes OK, prove it.
hugo_reyes Alright, OK.
hugo_reyes Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
hugo_reyes Then why didn't you tell me?
charlie_pace Because you would have tried to stop me. And since I was gonna do it anyway I thought I would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. You knew I was here to tell you.
hugo_reyes I'm not listening to this. No, 'cause you're not here.
charlie_pace I am here, you're being a baby.
hugo_reyes I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open them, you'll be gone.
charlie_pace I am here.
hugo_reyes One!
charlie_pace Don't do this.
hugo_reyes Two!
charlie_pace They need you.
hugo_reyes Three!
charlie_pace They need you, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Four!
charlie_pace You know they need you.
hugo_reyes Five!
claire_littleton What, what happened? I mean, how, how did he...
hugo_reyes He was trying to help us.
dr_juliet_burke Jack.
john_locke You're not gonna shoot me, Jack. Any more than I was gonna shoot—
john_locke It's not loaded.
james_ford Come on.
dr_jack_shephard Let go of me! Do you know what he did?
sayid_jarrah Yes, I know what he did!
john_locke All I did, all I have ever done, has been in the best interest of all of us.
dr_jack_shephard Are you insane?
john_locke I know I... I have a lot of explaining to do. But, I never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you there was a traitor in your midst.
dr_jack_shephard She helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off of this island. You killed Naomi.
ben_linus Well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet.
kate_austen Yes, he did.
kate_austen She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, and she fixed this.
kate_austen They're on their way.
john_locke She didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. I'm going to the Barracks. The Others abandoned them. It's the only place on the Island with any form of security right now, it'll have to do until I can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.
dr_jack_shephard No one's going anywhere with you, John. Because they're not crazy.
hugo_reyes He's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he... I don't know why, but he changed his mind.
hugo_reyes Because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie.
john_locke Anyone else? There isn't much time.
ben_linus Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.
dr_jack_shephard He's all yours.
bernard_nadler You said you'd never leave the Island. If you wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind you.
rose_nadler I'm not going anywhere with that man.
kate_austen What are you doing?
james_ford Same thing I've always done, Kate. Surviving.
john_locke You know where to find us when you change your mind.
dr_jack_shephard Do you ever miss?
hugo_reyes Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I was on my way back from a consult. Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse?
hugo_reyes You're on. So, consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard H.
hugo_reyes Reporters leaving you alone?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee.
dr_jack_shephard Thinking about growing a beard.
hugo_reyes You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's H-O. So, what are you really doing here, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I was just checking on ya, seeing if everything was OK.
hugo_reyes Checking to see if I was nuts, if I was gonna tell.
dr_jack_shephard Are you?
hugo_reyes You're up.
dr_jack_shephard Nah, you win. I, uh, I gotta run. It was great seeing you Hurley.
hugo_reyes I'm sorry. I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.
dr_jack_shephard It's water under the bridge, man.
hugo_reyes I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley.
hugo_reyes And it's going to do everything it can—
dr_jack_shephard We're never going back!
hugo_reyes Never say never, dude.
kate_austen Are you thinking of Charlie?
dr_jack_shephard Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen?
kate_austen Thunder's getting louder.
dr_jack_shephard That's not thunder.
dr_jack_shephard Come on.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode01 Are you Jack?
