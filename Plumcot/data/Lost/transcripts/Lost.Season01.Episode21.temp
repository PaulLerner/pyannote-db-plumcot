SAYID Is there anything I can do for you? Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg -- he didn't want him using up the antibiotics. She said he knew what was happening to him -- that he was brave.
AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT Heathrow airport authority reminds traveling passengers that safety regulations require...
AGENT COLE Okay, Sayid, 18 hours in a holding cell should be enough. Let's get to it, shall we? I'm Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence, this is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS. We're here because you're going to do us a favor.
SAYID A favor?
AGENT HEWITT Last week 300 pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne. The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in Iraq. 300 pounds of C-4 - I want it back.
SAYID You're the CIA, plant a few bugs.
AGENT COLE Oh, we have. But you're going to get inside for us.
SAYID I am Iraqi. I am not a terrorist.
AGENT COLE We didn't snatch you up because you are a terrorist, Sayid. We snatched you up because you know one.
AGENT HEWITT Essam Tasir, your roommate at Cairo University. He's a member of the cell.
SAYID And why should I care?
AGENT HEWITT You'd be saving lives.
SAYID I repeat, why should I care?
AGENT COLE Because we know where she is. 7 years since you left Iraq -- 6 months here, 3 months there -- always moving. There's only two reasons a man would do that, Sayid. Either he's running away from something, or looking for something. Noor Abed-Jazeem.
SAYID Nobody calls her Noor.
AGENT COLE You want to know where she is? Then we're going to Sydney.
JACK Kate? What are you doing out here?
KATE Looking for you.
JACK Well, you found me.
KATE You're walking in circles. You need to come back.
JACK Not without Locke.
KATE You haven't slept. You gave Boone your own blood.
JACK Locke lied.
KATE Well, now you're-
JACK He lied, Kate. Boone did not fall off any cliff. His leg was crushed, and I based my medical treatment on his lie.
KATE People are scared and upset. They don't know what's going on. We need you to come back, Jack. Please.
JACK Shannon? Do you want to say something?
SHANNON No.
SAYID I didn't know Boone very well, and for that I am sorry. On our 6th day here a woman named Joanna died. She drowned. And Boone was the first one into the water. I didn't know him, but I remember his courage. And I know he will be missed.
LOCKE It was my fault. We found a plane, a Beechcraft, in the jungle. It was lodged in the canopy so -- I would have gone up, but I -- my leg was hurt so he -- there was a radio inside and he thought he could -- look, his weight must have made the plane shift and it fell -- and -- it happened because he was trying to help us. He was a hero.
JACK Where were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you, you son of a bitch?! What did you do to him?!
CHARLIE Hey, wait, wait, Jack!
JACK Where were you?! You left him to die! You lied to me! Where were you?!
CHARLIE Jack, okay, it's okay.
JACK Where were you?! Where were you?!
KATE Jack! Jack, what's the matter? Are you okay? Are you okay?
SAWYER Get some water!
CHARLIE Breathe. He's okay. Just breathe, Jack.
JACK He's lying.
SAYID You're suffering from fatigue.
JACK Locke told Boone not to tell.
SAYID Tell about what?
JACK Something about a hatch. Locke's hiding something.
SAYID Jack, lis-
JACK Look, the man is hiding something.
SAYID Jack, listen to me. What we need is for the one doctor on this Island to get some sleep.
JACK I'm fine. I don't need it.
KATE Jack.
SUN You need some rest. C'mon.
ESSAM Sayid! Sayid, it is you.
SAYID Essam.
ESSAM I see you haven't forgotten me.
SAYID Hardly.
ESSAM What are you doing in Sydney?
SAYID I've been traveling, and you?
ESSAM I live here -- almost a year now -- I'm a tree-cutter. I cut trees.
SAYID It sounds like good, honest work.
ESSAM So much for my philosophy degree, huh?
SAYID Whatever puts food on your table. How is Zahra?
ESSAM She died -- stray bomb while she was shopping for a dress.
SAYID I'm so sorry.
ESSAM Listen, listen, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Why don't you come over?
SAYID I'd love to.
YUSEF Damn it. I'm out of ammo.
HADDAD Use the crowbar.
YUSEF That only works on the zombies, not the big bugs.
HADDAD Indeed.
SAYID The 3 of you live here?
ESSAM Sydney's very expensive. This is the best we can afford.
HADDAD And what is it you do, Sayid?
SAYID At the moment I'm at liberty.
ESSAM He's on holiday. You'll love the beaches here. There's something to be said for Australian women.
SAYID I've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years. The last beach I was at was Sharm-el Sheikh with you Essam -- remember, before our English exams? I hear the beaches here are very nice, especially the women. Perhaps we can go. So tell me exactly what kind of trees do you cut?
HADDAD Who are you?
SAYID I was a communications officer.
ESSAM Sayid was Republican Guard. He knows things.
HADDAD Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the Mosque. Perhaps it is fate.
CLAIRE It's okay. Look, I'm fine, really, okay?
CHARLIE You need rest, Claire. Sun, tell her.
SUN In a hospital they would have you sleep. The nurses would take your baby.
CLAIRE Yeah, but I'm not in a hospital.
CHARLIE Well, all the more reason to take extra care, Claire. Look, it's okay, I can take care of turnip-head for a while.
CLAIRE Turnip-head?
CHARLIE It's just what I'm calling him until you give him a name because his head -- it's like a turnip.
CLAIRE What if he needs something, okay?
CHARLIE You'll be there for him -- after you sleep.
CLAIRE No, okay? No.
CHARLIE Claire, no one is going to take this baby away from you. No one.
CLAIRE You don't know that, okay. You can't say that.
CHARLIE I won't let anything happen.
CLAIRE Just be really careful, okay? Make sure if he gets hot that you take his blanket off -- his neck, okay, got his neck?
CHARLIE Got it.
LOCKE This was his. I didn't go through it.
SHANNON Thank you.
LOCKE Welcome. Storm coming. I should have said no -- the first time he offered to hunt with me I should have said no.
SHANNON He would have gone anyway.
LOCKE Yeah, I suppose he would have. I know how confused and angry you must be right now. I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I know what it feels like when you lose family. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry.
SHANNON You asked if you could do anything for me.
SAYID Anything.
SHANNON John Locke killed my brother. Will you do something about that?
KATE Little more.
JACK No.
KATE You need to get your blood sugar level up.
JACK Look, enough already. I've rested. 
KATE Jack.
JACK I'm fine.
KATE Where are you going?
JACK I'm going to go talk to Locke.
KATE You need to lie down.
JACK No, I don't.
KATE I strongly advise it.
JACK Advise? Advice -- alright, what's going on now?
KATE Lie down, okay. I crushed up some sleeping pills -- put them in your juice.
JACK Why would you -- you drugged me?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Oh, okay.
KATE Night.
SAYID How did you get that? 
LOCKE War wound.
SAYID Looks more like a surgical scar.
LOCKE Like I said, war wound.
SAYID The plane's radio? Was Boone able to pick up a signal?
LOCKE I was on the ground, all I could here was static.
SAYID But it was working?
LOCKE Yeah, but I can't imagine it survived the fall.
SAYID Some of its parts might work in the transmitter I'm building for the raft. If you'd be willing to take me?
LOCKE Of course.
SAYID How did you find this plane?
LOCKE Luck.
SAYID You and Boone were hunting.
LOCKE Was that a question?
SAYID Yes.
LOCKE The boar got scarce a couple of weeks back. We weren't hunting, we were exploring.
SAYID So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees?
LOCKE Yep.
SAYID At the funeral you said your leg was injured.
LOCKE It was just a charlie-horse. A cramp.
SAYID I know what a charlie-horse is, John.
LOCKE Back in Iraq you were an interrogator.
SAYID Is that a question?
LOCKE Yeah.
SAYID A long time ago I was.
LOCKE Well, you haven't lost your touch.
SAYID Why would I interrogate you, John?
LOCKE Jack called me a liar in front of every man, woman and child I've come to know over the past month. Maybe there's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane out here at all.
SAYID I know when I'm being lied to. There's a plane.
LOCKE Like I said, you haven't lost your touch.
SAYID You've lost your edge, old man.
ESSAM I never had one when playing against you.
SAYID Were you always this slow?
ESSAM C'mon, c'mon, let's keep playing.
SAYID You have to get out of that apartment -- practice more.
ESSAM Haddad would like that -- more blending in with the community.
SAYID I think he's got his eye on a target.
ESSAM What makes you say that?
SAYID For the last 2 weeks he's been asking me about explosives -- blast radius, transport.
ESSAM Haddad's very thorough.
SAYID Do you know if he's gotten hold of any yet?
ESSAM Explosives? I don't know. All I know is there's going to be an operation -- and there is going to be a martyr.
SAYID You?
ESSAM Haddad told me this morning. C'mon let's keep playing. C'mon -- I'll wipe the floor with you.
SAYID Essam, what is it, huh? What is it?
ESSAM I don't think I can do it.
AGENT COLE You're kidding me, right?
SAYID Listen to me, I can get Essam to turn himself in. He wants out.
AGENT COLE Does he know where the C-4 is?
SAYID The other two are the ones you want. Essam's confused-
AGENT COLE Does he know where it is?
SAYID No.
AGENT COLE Then he's useless. These cells run top down. It's all need-to-know. The recruit's handed a bomb and target at the last possible moment. The only way to find that C-4 is to wait for Essam to walk out that door with a target to hit.
SAYID He's in over his head. He doesn't even know why he's doing it...
AGENT COLE That's why you're going to convince him to go through with it.
SAYID No. No, I will not.
AGENT HEWITT Excuse me?
SAYID I'm done. It's over.
AGENT HEWITT No, no, you're not even close to being done, my friend.
SAYID What are you going to do? Arrest me?
AGENT COLE No, we'll arrest her. Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency. Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant, Sayid? So, if you want any chance of ever seeing her again you're going to go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up.
CHARLIE The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout, down came the rain and drowned the spider out...
HURLEY Dude, it's washed -- washed the spider out. Unless it's some kind of British version?
CHARLIE Oh, okay. Down came the rain and washed the spider -- oh, bollocks, shhhh, shhh, shhh.
HURLEY What's the matter, man?
CHARLIE Well, I can't get the bloody thing to stop crying.
HURLEY Maybe it's hungry?
CHARLIE Nope, Claire nursed him 5 times.
HURLEY Any deposits? You know, diaper-wise?
HURLEY Alright, it's time to break out the big guns. Dude, that's all I got.
SAYID Heroin.
LOCKE The cargo hold's full of it. The best I can figure it -- they were smugglers.
SAYID The plane was perched in the canopy?
LOCKE Right up there.
SAYID And Boone climbed up by himself because of your charlie-horse?
LOCKE Yes, that's right.
SAYID Why did you lie?
LOCKE I made a mistake.
SAYID I'm going to salvage what I can of the radio. If we leave now we should beat the storm back.
LOCKE Why don't you trust me, Sayid?
SAYID For one thing, you've been carrying a gun you've told no one about.
LOCKE We found one of the smugglers about a half a click West of here dressed as a priest -- Nigerian currency in his pockets, and this. Now you're armed and I'm not. Does that earn me any trust?
SAYID You gave this to me because I caught you concealing it. That earns you adaptability.
LOCKE Okay, I'll tell you something you don't know.
SAYID Please do.
LOCKE The first week after the crash there was a cave in. Jack was trapped. Do you remember that?
SAYID Of course.
LOCKE You, Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to try and triangulate a signal.
SAYID Yes.
LOCKE You were hit from behind -- knocked unconscious? When you woke up your transceiver, your equipment was destroyed. That was me.
SAYID This is one time you'd better not be telling the truth.
LOCKE I did what was in everyone's best interest.
SAYID You ruined my chance to find the source.
LOCKE The source of a distress call that kept saying they're dead, it killed them all, over and over? Is that a place you really want to lead people to?
SAYID Why wait all this time? Why not tell me then?
LOCKE Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in reasonable debate, and nobody else would have. You were all so focused on getting off the Island that you weren't seeing things clearly. It's like what's happening now with the raft.
SAYID Did you burn the raft, John?
LOCKE No, Sayid, I didn't.
SAYID What is the hatch?
LOCKE The hatch?
SAYID Boone mentioned it before he died.
LOCKE A hatch? Two hatches on a plane, Sayid, could be forward or aft.
ESSAM I'm not sure if I can do this.
SAYID You would not be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear, Essam.
ESSAM I'm not afraid to die. It's all the innocent lives -- all those people. The Imam preaches peace, Sayid. Every human life is sacred.
SAYID It's true, innocent lives will be lost -- in service of a greater good.
ESSAM What if I'm doing this because I'm angry? What if I'm doing this because they killed her?
SAYID What if you are? Should we just accept what happened to Zahra? Do we just accept their deaths? Because if we do, it means that ultimately we can do nothing about them. I lost someone, too, Essam. I will never be whole again. There need to be consequences for those responsible. That's my duty. That is how I will honor her.
ESSAM Haddad was right, it was fate that brought us back together. Sayid, will you do this with me?
SAYID I will.
SAYID How are you? Do you want to take a walk?
SHANNON Sure.
SAYID I spoke to Locke.
SHANNON What did he say?
SAYID He took me to the plane. I believe what happened was an accident.
SHANNON Then why did he lie?
SAYID I have no idea. But I don't believe he meant to harm Boone.
SHANNON So that's it?
SAYID I know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame.
SHANNON You don't get it, do you?
SAYID Shannon.
SHANNON Just forget about it, okay?
WALT How much weight can this hold?
MICHAEL I don't know. A lot. Enough.
JIN 그거... 조여줘요.
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah, tighter. Got it.
WALT What if it tips over?
MICHAEL It won't. That's why we made it this wide. There, that should do it. Right? Good?
JIN Good.
MICHAEL Alright.
WALT What if a shark attacks?
MICHAEL A shark's not getting anywhere near us, man.
WALT What if we die?
MICHAEL We are not going to die.
WALT Boone died.
CHARLIE Hey, Michael, do you know anything about babies? I can't get this little guy to be quiet.
MICHAEL Walk with him, he'll calm down.
CHARLIE Yeah, I tried that. Hey, Jin, have you seen Sun?
JIN 어?
CHARLIE Sun. I need some help with this baby.
JIN No.
CHARLIE Okay.
SAWYER Hey, Chuckie, want to keep that kid quiet? Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard.
CHARLIE Oh, there you go. You happy now? 
SAWYER I was. If you're going to play nursemaid, at least do the damn job. 
CHARLIE Hey, say something else. Just say something, say anything.
SAWYER Okay, fine. I liked that thing a lot better inside than I like it outside.
SAWYER What?
KATE Hey -- brought you something to eat.
JACK What's in it, chloroform?
KATE Soup.
JACK Thanks, but I think I'll -- Who was in here?
KATE I don't know, what's the matter...
JACK Was anybody in here?
KATE No, why are you...
JACK The key to the gun case, it's gone.
KATE Maybe it fell off this morning.
JACK It didn't fall off.
SAYID What's going on?
JACK Locke took the key -- he's after the guns.
KATE I haven't seen him all day, you don't know that...
JACK No, then who was it?
SAYID Jack, it wasn't Locke.
HADDAD Sayid, get in. It's time.
HADDAD Stay relaxed and focused; drive with the windows down -- the fresh air will keep you alert. You will need to wear these . If you run into any problems use this . You are heroes. Good luck.
SAYID Essam stop.
ESSAM Don't be nervous, brother. We'll be okay.
SAYID I'm working with the CIA.
ESSAM What?
SAYID I'm going to give you 10 minutes to get away before I call them.
ESSAM You set me up?
SAYID Essam, just go.
ESSAM Why would you do this to me?
SAYID You're wasting time.
ESSAM You said we were going to do this together. You said you lost someone.
SAYID Her name is Nadia. We were separated years ago. They know where I can find her.
ESSAM You used me to find a woman? You talked me into this.
SAYID Essam, don't.
ESSAM You said it was for the greater good.
SAYID I'm begging you to go.
ESSAM You said you were my brother. You were supposed to be my brother, my friend.
SAYID I am your friend.
ESSAM A friend who told me to do this for Zahra just so you could find some woman that you love?!
ESSAM Well, then, Sayid, I hope she makes you whole again.
SAYID Essam!
JACK Go! Go.
LOCKE She doesn't believe me, Sayid.
SAYID Shannon, Shannon, please listen to me.
SHANNON He did it. I know it.
SAYID You're not thinking rationally. You've never fired a gun before.
SAYID Shannon, you don't want to do this.
SHANNON Yes, I do!
SAYID If you do it, you can never take it back.
SHANNON Stay back! What did you do to him?!
LOCKE I told you it was an accident.
JACK Shannon.
SHANNON Jack, you told me he was a liar!
SAYID I'm sorry.
SHANNON Don't. Get away.
SAYID Shannon.
SAWYER The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway. The 32 valve V-8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes all 400 horses and 350 pound feet rear-wheel torque.
CHARLIE Keep going. Keep going.
CLAIRE Charlie.
SAWYER Beneath the hood the 4.4 liter power plant features a fully integrated super-charger made into a 6 speed transmission from the manual sequential shift feature.
CHARLIE Keep going.
SAWYER This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of taste, comfort and economy.
KATE She just needs time. She's been through a lot.
SAYID Time won't make a difference. Perhaps I made a mistake.
KATE You couldn't let her kill Locke. You had no choice.
SAYID There's always a choice.
AGENT COLE She lives in Irvine, California, just south of Los Angeles -- works as a lab-tech at a medical testing company -- plane ticket, walking around money, you're on an Oceanic flight to LA. It leaves in two hours.
SAYID What happens to his body?
AGENT COLE He was a terrorist so he's not exactly getting a state funeral.
SAYID What happens to his body?
AGENT HEWITT After it's released; he'll be cremated.
SAYID A Muslim man is supposed to be buried.
AGENT HEWITT Yeah, well, there's no one to claim the body.
SAYID I'll claim him.
AGENT HEWITT You can't claim him when you're on a plane in 2 hours, mate.
SAYID Then change my flight to tomorrow. 
SAYID How's your head?
LOCKE It'll heal.
SAYID Another war wound.
LOCKE I know what it cost you to do what you did. Thank you.
SAYID I did it because I sense you might be our best hope of surviving here. But I don't forgive what you did. And I certainly don't trust you. And now, you're going to take me to the hatch.
LOCKE Hatch? -- I already showed you the...
SAYID John, no more lies.
