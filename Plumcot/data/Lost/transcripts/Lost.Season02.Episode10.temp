THUG CAPTAIN Kill him. Shoot him. Now.
THUG CAPTAIN Shoot him! Do it!
THUG CAPTAIN What's you're name, boy? What's you're name, boy!?
YOUNG EKO Eko.
THUG CAPTAIN Look at Mr. Eko. No hesitation. A born killer. Come. You won't need that anymore.
CLAIRE What are you writing?
EKO Things I need to remember.
CLAIRE Do you mind if I sit?
EKO Please.
CLAIRE Thanks. So you're Eko, huh?
EKO Yes.
CLAIRE Claire; and this is Aaron.
EKO Aaron? The brother of Moses?
CLAIRE Yeah, that must have been tough to live up to, right? The pressure of everyone saying, "Why can't you be more like your brother, Moses."
EKO Yes, I'm sure it was. Why did you choose it -- Aaron?
CLAIRE I just liked it.
EKO Aaron was a great man. Moses had great difficulty speaking so it was Aaron who spoke for him.
CLAIRE So you're religious, huh? You should speak to Charlie. He doesn't want to admit he's religious, but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary.
EKO Statue?
CLAIRE Yeah, he says he found it on the island. Weird, right?
EKO May I see it?
EKO Where did he find this?
CLAIRE He said he found it in the jungle.
EKO Where in the jungle?
CLAIRE I don't know.
EKO Where?!
CLAIRE Look, what are you -- it's just a statue.
EKO Just a statue?
EKO Where is Charlie?
MICHAEL You breaking in or breaking out?
LOCKE I used to love those old silent movies where the robbers would crack a combination lock with their ear pressed up against the safe. And the money they stole was always in a white bag with a big dollar sign on it.
MICHAEL Silent movies, huh? You're not that old, man.
LOCKE I'm old enough.
MICHAEL You set the combination?
LOCKE With the new folks joining us I figure we better limit people's access to the guns. Can't have just anyone who wants one walk in and help themselves -- which I'm guessing is why you're here, Michael.
CHARLIE He's got wit he's got charm/But when he gets rough he'll break your arm/He's got taste, manners and grace/But when he gets rough he'll slit your face/He'll buy you jewels, expensive shoes, uh, oooo -- Hey Jin, do you like the Kinks? Kinks?
JIN Keens?
CHARLIE No, man, Kinks. Kinks with a "k" at the end. A kicking ka. Kinks. You know, Once you're in love, you're not getting out ha-a-a-a so look out. It's a good tune, Jin. Look out.
JIN 너때문에 물고기가 다 도망가잖아!
CHARLIE Oh, thank you very much, Jin. I do have a beautiful voice, don't I?
EKO Where did you find this?
CHARLIE What happened?
EKO Where did you find it?
CHARLIE In the jungle. I found it in the jungle.
EKO Take me there.
JIN 왜 그래?
EKO This is not your business. I want you to take me to where you found it.
CHARLIE Okay, fine. Yeah, we'll go for a stroll -- there's nothing there. We'll go first thing in the morning, alright?
EKO We're going now.
CHARLIE Okay, let me go tell Claire so she doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait here --
EKO Tell her on your way.
TOUGH MOROCCAN Get us some beers. Go.
EKO Where did you find this?
TOUGH MOROCCAN What does it matter?
EKO Same in the other bag?
TOUGH MOROCCAN Yes.
EKO Fifty.
TOUGH MOROCCAN Fifty what?
EKO Fifty is what I will pay you in exchange for the favor you are asking me to do.
TOUGH MOROCCAN A favor?
EKO You have a large quantity of heroin in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale. Your drugs are of no value here, so you must get them out. The borders are all guarded by the military so you must fly. But as I'm sure you are aware the only private planes currently allowed into the air are either U.N. aid or the Catholic missionaries. And so you have come to me for a favor. I will buy your heroin -- for 50.
TOUGH MOROCCAN It is true what they say about you.
EKO And what is that?
TOUGH MOROCCAN You have no soul.
EKO No. Go. Go. And tell your friends that I let you live -- that Mr. Eko let you live.
CHARLIE Just give me a second, okay? Hi, Claire. What happened to the statue?
CLAIRE Don't play stupid, Charlie.
CHARLIE What?
CLAIRE What's this? Because this was in your little statue. And, unless I'm mistaken I seem to remember you saying you're a drug addict.
CHARLIE I didn't know. Look, it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know? Claire, I'm not using. Look, you believe me now? I don't -- care.
CLAIRE Someone's waiting for you.
LOCKE Got it?
MICHAEL Got it.
LOCKE Alright. Breath half-way out -- gently squeeze the trigger. Squeeze. Good.
MICHAEL How'd you learn all this stuff?
LOCKE My dad used to take me hunting.
MICHAEL Hunting for what?
LOCKE Birds mostly. Of course, birds don't shoot back.
MICHAEL Yeah. I know people are talking -- thinking I'm going to go running off after Walt again.
LOCKE If people are talking I'm not hearing it. But if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan.
MICHAEL Yeah, it's not.
LOCKE Let's try one for real.
LOCKE Bravo.
CHARLIE Well done with Claire, mate. You got me in a lot of trouble there, so thanks for that. Hope you're happy. Oh, that's right, you don't do happy. Alright, well, we're here. I found it right here, right by that tree.
EKO You found it here?
CHARLIE Yeah, found it here.
EKO You're lying.
CHARLIE You know what? I don't even know you. You asked to see where I found it. This is where I found it. We're done. Have a nice hike.
EKO You did not find the statue here. Take me to the plane.
CHARLIE How'd you know about the plane, man? It's old, you know. It's been out in the jungle for years. Of course, you would know that - you know everything.
EKO Why did you lie to the girl?
CHARLIE What?
EKO You told her you did not know what was inside the statue.
CHARLIE I wasn't lying.
EKO Then what is the wrong idea?
CHARLIE What?
EKO When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster, you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea. What is the wrong idea?
CHARLIE I don't have to tell you anything, man. You come traipsing across the island, and what, suddenly now you're in charge? You want me to take you to your plane? You best start treating me with some respect. I'm not just some guy you can just...
CHARLIE What? What?
EKO Let's go.
CHARLIE Yes, sir.
NIGERIAN WOMAN Sir! Sir, if you buy a statue, the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 200 Naira, sir.
YEMI What are you doing here?
EKO I have come to give my confession.
YEMI Hello, Eko.
EKO Hello, brother.
EKO So I come to visit you for the first time in 3 years and you won't hear my confession? You know, Monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper Catholic boy.
YEMI Well, why waste your time confessing. It won't help you.
EKO It won't?
YEMI No, for confession to mean something you must have a penitent heart.
EKO You and your guilt, Yemi. I've only done what I needed to do to survive. How is that a sin?
YEMI You may live far from here, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard of who you are and what you have done.
EKO Have you forgotten how you got that cross, brother -- the day they took me? Is what I did that day a sin? Or is it forgiven because it was you that was saved?
YEMI Why are you here, Eko?
EKO I have come to help you. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. I would like to use one of your church relief flights to transport it.
YEMI Merchandise? You mean drugs.
EKO It is not my normal business, Yemi. We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria so that they cannot be used by our people. And the money -- you'll have all the money to buy your vaccine. God has given us this opportunity; we should not turn our back on it.
YEMI God did not bring you here, Eko. Your own greed did. I will always love you, but I will not help you. It's good to see you again, brother. 
SAWYER A little close to the ear, Freckles. You sure you know what you're doing?
KATE Would you please turn your head.
SAWYER Why, you ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck? I can cut my own damn hair.
KATE You know, you don't have to be belligerent just for belligerence's sake. Everyone loves you now.
SAWYER Bull puckey.
HURLEY Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man.
SAWYER Yo yourself, Pillsbury.
KATE See?
MICHAEL Hey, Kate? Hey, Locke said you were on hatch duty later. I was wondering if, uh, you mind if I go instead?
KATE You want my shift?
MICHAEL Help me take my mind off things.
KATE Sure, it's all yours.
MICHAEL Thanks, appreciate it. Glad you're okay, man.
SAWYER Yeah. Don't even say anything.
CHARLIE Alright, time to take a break.
EKO You just had a break.
CHARLIE I'm not what you think I am.
EKO And what do I think you are?
CHARLIE It was my brother's fault.
EKO Sorry?
CHARLIE It was his fault I became an addict. He started with the heroin. I tried to make him stop. You don't know me, man. I was a good person. I was an altar boy. Alright, I knew what was in that statue, it doesn't mean I needed what was inside it. So don't judge me, man.
CHARLIE What? What's that? It's a parachute.
CHARLIE Is that a priest?
CHARLIE What are you doing?
CHARLIE You know that guy?
EKO Yes, this man saved my life.
CHARLIE He saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense. He takes off in a plane in Nigeria -- we're out in the middle of the South Pacific -- that makes all the sense in the world.
CHARLIE This is scripture written here. You're a priest. You're a priest, right? He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right?
EKO I need to talk to you.
YEMI I'm in the middle of a confession.
EKO It cannot wait.
YEMI Bless you. God be with you all and please come back in the morning. It's okay. How dare you come here and disrupt my work?
EKO Have you reconsidered?
YEMI What?
EKO My request?
YEMI Flying drugs under the cover of the church? How is that something I could ever reconsider? Look, hey, don't touch those!
EKO I'm going to make this easy for you. You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
YEMI Make you priests?
EKO Just sign these ordination documents and I will give you the money for the vaccines.
YEMI Leave this church now, Eko. Go. Now.
EKO Yemi, I understand that you live in a world where righteousness and evil seem very far apart, but that is not the real world. I am your brother and I would never do anything to hurt you, but my friends -- if you do not do what I ask -- they will burn this church to the ground. Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper? Think of the lives you will save.
YEMI My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
EKO How many of the statues do you have left? The Virgin Mary statues, how many?
YEMI I don't know -- three hundred.
EKO I will take all of them.
EKO I guess we are both sinners now.
YEMI Perhaps we are but God will forgive me, Eko.
CHARLIE Uh, I'm lost. It was dark. I was following Sayid. Right afterwards a big bag of rocks fell on my head so I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography.
EKO Climb that tree.
CHARLIE What?
EKO Climb that tree and perhaps you will be able to get your bearings or spot the plane.
CHARLIE You climb it. What if I don't? You going to beat me with your Jesus stick? I find it a little odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it.
EKO Are you going to climb that tree, or not?
CHARLIE What kind of priest are you, anyway?
EKO You need to get higher.
CHARLIE Wonderful. Thank you.
CHARLIE Eko, run! Run!
EKO Did you see it?
CHARLIE Yeah, I saw it. What the bloody hell did you do?
EKO I did nothing.
CHARLIE Most people, when they see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run.
EKO I was not afraid of it.
CHARLIE I can see that. That thing kills people.
EKO Did you see the plane?
CHARLIE Yes, I saw your plane. It's about a kilometer that way.
EKO Thank you.
CHARLIE Wait!
MICHAEL Come on. Come on. Where are you?
MONITOR Dad?
MICHAEL Are you OK?
MONITOR Yes. Are you alone?
MICHAEL Yes.
MONITOR Can't talk long. They're coming back soon.
MICHAEL Where are you?
MONITOR You need to com...
JACK Hey, Michael.
MICHAEL Hey.
JACK How're you doing?
MICHAEL I'm good, thanks.
JACK You down here alone?
MICHAEL Yeah, Hurley's supposed to be here, but, uh, I guess he's running late.
JACK Well, listen, uh, no one's forgotten about Walt.
MICHAEL What?
JACK I can't -- I don't have any idea what you must be going through, but I just want you to know that as soon as we can we're going to figure a way to go out and bring him back.
MICHAEL Yeah, thanks, man. Thanks. 
JACK You okay?
MICHAEL Yeah, fine.
JACK Well, I'll leave you to it then.
MICHAEL Thanks.
OLU Eko.
EKO What are you doing here, Yemi?
YEMI I came to stop you.
EKO Go back to your church.
YEMI Do not get on that plane, Eko. You saved my life once and now I'm here to save yours.
EKO Save my life?
YEMI Look, if you get on that plane -- if you do this...
EKO Do what, Yemi?! Are you a prophet now?!
YEMI Please, Eko! Let me take your confession! Anything I can do, I will do! But please, don't go.
GOLDIE He called the military!
EKO You did this?
YEMI I did not tell them who was involved. Just leave the drugs and come back with me.
YEMI No! Stop! No more! No more!
EKO Yemi! No! No! Help me get to the plane.
EKO Forgive me, forgive me.
SOLDIER Father? Are you okay, Father?
CHARLIE Eko? Who's that?
EKO He's my brother.
CHARLIE I'm sorry.
EKO For the one I broke.
CHARLIE So, are you a priest or aren't you?
EKO Yes, I am. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I fear no evil for thou art with me; thy rod, thy staff they comfort me.
EKO Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.
CHARLIE Claire?
CLAIRE You lied to me, Charlie.
CHARLIE I know I did. I'm sorry. I just -- it made me feel safer to have it around.
CLAIRE Look, I can't have you around my baby, okay?
CHARLIE Claire, I...
CLAIRE Charlie, I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us, okay?! Just go.
