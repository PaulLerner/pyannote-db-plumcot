. We hear the sound of a sword being unsheathed. There is wind and motion in the trees.]
CLAIRE What's happening?
LOCKE You know what's happening.
CLAIRE But I don't understand. Why --?
LOCKE He was your responsibility but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now.
CHARLIE It's alright. Hey, hey, you're dreaming. You were sleep-walking, alright? . Claire, what happened?
JACK That must have been a hell of a nightmare.
CLAIRE Who said it was a nightmare?
JACK I'd say when someone makes their fists so tight they dig their fingernails a quarter of an inch into their palm they probably weren't dreaming about riding ponies. Did you ever sleep-walk before?
CLAIRE No. I don't think so. How would I know?
JACK It'll get back to you. I had a girlfriend once that told me I talked in my sleep.
CLAIRE What did you say?
JACK Don't know. Whatever it was she didn't like it. How was your OB-GYN in Sydney?
CLAIRE Good. She was good.
JACK She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester?
CLAIRE Yeah, I went for a checkup the week before and she said it'd be fine.
JACK Ultrasound was cool?
CLAIRE Uh-huh. Very healthy.
JACK How have you been feeling?
CLAIRE Okay. Back's pretty sore, but it's probably just from sleeping on the ground. I get dizzy if I stand up too fast. And I have to pee all the time.
JACK Are you eating enough?
CLAIRE Boar and bananas.
JACK How many weeks in are you? What was the date that you found out you were pregnant.
THOMAS Is it pink?
CLAIRE I don't know yet.
THOMAS I mean, did you actually pee on it?
CLAIRE I don't know, just give me a second.
THOMAS Maybe you didn't do it right.
CLAIRE Thomas, I can pee on a stick.
THOMAS Okay, well, what color is it?
CLAIRE How long's it been?
THOMAS 6 -- 66 seconds. Oh god. . Okay, it's definitely two lines.
CLAIRE Two pink lines?
THOMAS Pink? No, no, no, these are, like, red.
CLAIRE What? They're pink.
THOMAS These two lines?
CLAIRE They're pink.
THOMAS Okay, first of all these tests are not always accurate.
CLAIRE Thomas.
THOMAS No, no, no, my uncle he thought he had testicular cancer, remember that.
CLAIRE He did. He's dead.
THOMAS Yeah. I mean, no, no. It was like the wrong -- it was a bad diagnosis. Look, this thing, it doesn't mean for sure that you're pregnant.
CLAIRE Thomas --
THOMAS We can go get another one.
CLAIRE I am six weeks late, okay. Six weeks. That never happens. I'm pregnant.
THOMAS Okay. Okay. Look, it's all going to be okay.
CLAIRE I know. I know.
THOMAS Hey, Claire? If we, if we wanted to we could do this.
CLAIRE Stop it.
THOMAS No. I'm not kidding.
CLAIRE My mom would disown me.
THOMAS She basically has already.
CLAIRE Yeah. But with what? My... my five dollar an hour job at Fish and Fry?
THOMAS You're not the only one with a job, you know. I mean, I've got my painting.
CLAIRE That's sweet, but this isn't what we want.
THOMAS Maybe it is. This could be like, uh, I don't know. It could be like the best thing ever.
CLAIRE You, you really want to try?
THOMAS Yeah. Claire, I love you.
JACK Well, this is a first -- you standing still, middle of the day, doing nothing. Amazing.
KATE I'm doing something.
JACK Yeah, what's that?
KATE I'm sinking. Water goes out, takes the sand with it and you sink. I used to do it with my mom when I was a kid.
JACK Ah, new plan. You're going to just sink your way right off the Island. Sayid would be proud.
KATE He's been gone for almost a week.
JACK Something tells me he'll be okay.
KATE So what are you doing this far from the caves?
JACK Bringing water down, bringing fish back. Claire's going to have the baby soon.
CHARLIE "Dear diary, still on the bloody Island. Today I swallowed a bug. Love, Claire." Here, what separates us from these savage Yanks if we can't drink tea? Feeling better?
CLAIRE It was just a dream.
CHARLIE Mmmmm. I have this dream... I'm driving a bus and my teeth start falling out. My mom's in the back eating biscuits. Everything smells of bacon. It's weird. Of course, I don't wake up screaming.
CLAIRE I'm alright, Charlie.
CHARLIE No, of course you are. It's just, I think about you in this place -- how hard it must be for you without your family and your friends. And I think we could be friends. I could be your friend. We don't have to do each other's hair or anything. I just mean that if you needed someone to talk to about anything, I'm here.
CLAIRE Charlie.
CHARLIE Okay -- .
CLAIRE I didn't mean that --
CHARLIE It's cool, Claire. It's cool.
CLAIRE Thomas cleaned out his whole loft. I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
RACHEL That is great.
CLAIRE I know. He's awesome. . You know, maybe we shouldn't --
RACHEL No, you're not backing out now.
CLAIRE It's seems --
RACHEL He's just a psychic, Claire. I mean, I thought you were all into this, all your astrology stuff.
CLAIRE Yeah, I know, but I don't need somebody telling me what's going to happen or how to live my life.
RACHEL It's not about what you need. It's about what's fun. So unless you have another excuse --
MALKIN I'll need your hands for this.
MALKIN Ah, so when did you find out?
CLAIRE What?
MALKIN About the baby.
CLAIRE Two days ago.
RACHEL She hasn't told her mom yet. We're afraid she might -- .
CLAIRE What? Should I not tell her? What? What is it?
MALKIN I'm sorry. I can't, I can't --
CLAIRE What were you gonna -- what did you see?
MALKIN I'm... I'm not doing this reading.
CLAIRE You, you were going to say something.
MALKIN You'll have to leave. Now. Thanks, thanks very much.
RACHEL What a freak.
CLAIRE Help me! Somebody's going to hurt me, please, help me.
CHARLIE Someone attacked her.
JACK What?
CLAIRE He held me down.
MICHAEL Which way did he go? How long ago?
CLAIRE I don't know. I couldn't see. Just now, just now, he just ran away.
HURLEY What's going on?
CHARLIE We should find out, check the surrounding caves.
JACK Hey, wait, wait, hold on don't go --
CHARLIE Hurley, let's go.
JACK C'mon, c'mon, let's sit down here, okay? Go get her some water.
ETHAN Yeah, sure.
JACK Claire, look at me, it's okay. You're safe now.
MICHAEL Did you get a look at him, at all?
CLAIRE No, it was dark. I couldn't see.
JACK Where did this happen?
CLAIRE It was here. I, I was sleeping and I woke up and he was trying to hurt my baby! He had this... this thing -- like... like a needle. And he stabbed me with it. He was trying to hurt my baby.
JACK It's okay. It's okay.
HURLEY We looked around the entire perimeter, man.
JACK Nobody saw or heard anything?
HURLEY Uh-uh, nada. Everyone was asleep. So, I had an idea. I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right? And I'm realizing who the hell are Scott and Steve?
JACK I'm not following you?
HURLEY Look, if I was a cop and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Knock on doors, find witnesses. But we don't even have doors.
JACK Hurley, you're not helping me understand where you're...
HURLEY Look, we don't know who's living here and who's still at the beach. I mean, we don't even know each other. My name isn't Hurley, it's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's just a nickname I have, alright? Why? I'm not telling. The point is, we've got to find out who everyone is.
JACK You want to start a census.
HURLEY Yeah, a registry, you know, names, what people look like, who's related to who. I mean, we start laying down the law, maybe we'll stop attacking each other. It seems like someone's getting punched, or stabbed, or something every other day here. We've got to find out who did this to her.
CHARLIE You alright? Don't worry, you want to close your eyes, I'll be here all night. I won't let anyone get to you. I won't leave you, Claire. Promise.
THOMAS Wow, we have drapes now.
CLAIRE I know it. I feel all grown up. You like them?
THOMAS Yeah. They're good.
CLAIRE I don't know why drapes represent age for me. I guess it just feels like something my mum would do. Oh, um, Sasha called, they're going out tonight, wanted to know if we'd go. What? I didn't eat all the chips, there's another bag.
THOMAS Claire? I can't do this.
CLAIRE Do what? Did you have a bad day?
THOMAS This isn't working. Come on, you knew that.
CLAIRE I what? Um, just so I'm not over-reacting here, are you breaking up with me?
THOMAS Look, for the past three months, it's just, you know, there's always some plan, some responsibility, somewhere that we have to be, someone that you have to talk to.
CLAIRE Well, yeah, I'm trying to make sure that when the baby comes...
THOMAS Oh, the baby, yeah, I mean, that is just not -- it's like this now, you know. What's it going to be like when the baby comes?
CLAIRE But you said we should do this.
THOMAS Yeah, well, now it's real.
CLAIRE Well, you can't just change your mind.
THOMAS How in the hell am I supposed to be a dad, Claire? How about my painting, my life?
CLAIRE I knew... I knew this was going to happen.
THOMAS I told you so -- terrific. Now I get all your daddy abandonment crap, huh?
CLAIRE Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try and justify what you're doing!
THOMAS I have done nothing, okay. I have done absolutely nothing.
CLAIRE What?! I have?!
THOMAS You don't think I've seen what you've done?
CLAIRE Excuse me?
THOMAS You were supposed to be on the pill.
CLAIRE You think I got pregnant on purpose?
THOMAS I don't even care.
CLAIRE Like this was some kind of plan? You are out of your mind!
THOMAS It's over, Claire.
CLAIRE No, it's not over!
THOMAS I'm outta here.
CLAIRE Thomas!
HURLEY John, right? John Locke?
LOCKE Is this about your census?
HURLEY Yeah, you know, I thought it'd be a good idea, you know, to get everyone's name and place of residence.
LOCKE And who's checking on you?
HURLEY Uh, me?
LOCKE That was a joke.
HURLEY Uh, good one.
LOCKE Yep. You already know my name. I lived most of my life in Tustin, CA.
HURLEY Cool. And, reason for travel? The reason you were in Australia?
LOCKE I was looking for something.
HURLEY Looking, uh-huh. So, did you find it?
LOCKE No. It found me. Anything else?
HURLEY No, no. That's good. Uh, thanks.
HURLEY Hey, uh, I know I already talked to you, but, uh, I just wanted to get away from him fast, okay?
CHARLIE Did you see anyone leave the beach last night?
KATE People come and go, but I, I don't know. . What?
JACK I'm not sure anything actually happened.
CHARLIE Wait, what?
JACK Claire told Michael and I that this attacker tried to inject her with something. But there was no mark on her stomach. She wakes up two nights in a row screaming. The first time she was sleep-walking.
CHARLIE You think she was making this up? She was terrified, man.
JACK Look, she said that the guy was trying to hurt her baby. Why would someone do that now with all of us sleeping 20 feet away?
CHARLIE So, you think she's lying?
JACK No. Pregnant women have extremely lucid...
CHARLIE Lucid, right.
JACK These are textbook anxiety nightmares.
CHARLIE You know everything that's going on with everyone?
KATE Hey. So what do we do?
JACK She's due in a little more than a week, maybe two, but if she stays stressed out like this, or has another panic attack it could trigger an early labor. And out here, with no instruments, no monitors, no anesthetic -- that would not be good.
CHARLIE It's not all in her head.
HURLEY Hey, Lance.
ETHAN Sorry?
HURLEY Lance. Your name's Lance, right?
ETHAN Ethan.
HURLEY Dude, that's right. Lance is the little skinny guy with the glasses and the red hair.
ETHAN I can see how you'd confuse us.
HURLEY Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces. It's pretty pathetic, huh? You'd think after a couple of weeks on the Island with the same people, we'd all know each other.
ETHAN Yeah, you're right. You would think so.
HURLEY So, we're doing this list, you know, survivors, names, home addresses, stuff like that.
ETHAN Okay, well, you already have my name...
HURLEY Not Lance.
ETHAN Definitely not.
HURLEY Last name?
ETHAN Rom.
HURLEY Rom, R-O-M?
ETHAN That's right?
HURLEY Great, where are you from Ethan Rom?
ETHAN Ontario.
HURLEY Right on, love Canada, great uh... well that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude.
ETHAN Hey, what's this for?
HURLEY Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh, you know, I thought I'd be a good idea.
JACK Claire?
CLAIRE Did you find him?
JACK Um, no.
CLAIRE Well, what if he comes back?
JACK Claire, this situation we're in -- the crash, that no one's coming, this place -- it, it can kind of mess with your head a little, and maybe make you see things that aren't actually there. Now, I know it feels very real.
CLAIRE I, I don't understand...
JACK Your baby's coming, soon. And I can't even imagine how scary that must be for you, but the more upset you are, the more dangerous it is for you, and your baby. So, I want you to take these.
CLAIRE What are they?
JACK It's a sedative, very mild -- commonly used in situations like yours. It won't harm the baby, I promise.
CLAIRE You don't believe me.
JACK Claire.
CLAIRE You think I'm making this up? I get attacked and you want to give me sleeping pills?
JACK They're not sleeping p -- look, it's a very mild sedative.
CLAIRE I'm leaving.
JACK What? No. Claire, Claire.
CLAIRE I was safer at the beach. It's not safe here.
JACK Don't do this, Claire. You need to think about the baby.
CLAIRE Don't talk to me about the baby. I'm sick of everyone telling me what to do.
JACK Please.
CLAIRE Let go of me.
CHARLIE You okay? What did you say to her?
MALKIN Yes?
CLAIRE Mr. Malkin, we met before.
MALKIN Yes. I remember.
CLAIRE You wouldn't give me a reading. I was hoping you would now.
CLAIRE If you're psychic, why do you have to count it?
MALKIN That's not how it works.
CLAIRE I was just joking.
CLAIRE So, how does it work?
MALKIN I don't know. Oh, when did he leave you?
CLAIRE Last week. Is that why you didn't want to do my reading last time?
MALKIN No, no. I saw something, sort of a blurry thing.
CLAIRE And, blurry's bad?
MALKIN Blurry's bad. That's why I stopped the reading. Are you sure you want to go on now?
CLAIRE Yeah, yes, please.
MALKIN I can tell you, this is important.
CLAIRE Okay.
MALKIN It is crucial that you yourself raise this child.
CLAIRE You mean with Thomas? Is he...
MALKIN The father of this child will play no part in it's life, nor yours.
CLAIRE So what exactly are you saying?
MALKIN This child parented by anyone else, anyone other than you -- danger surrounds this baby...
CLAIRE Danger?
MALKIN Your nature, your spirit, your goodness, must be an influence in the development of this child.
CLAIRE Look, if Thomas and I don't get back together I'm putting this baby up for adoption. I just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life.
MALKIN There is no happy life -- not for this child, not without you.
CLAIRE I don't...
MALKIN It can't be another. You mustn't allow another to raise your baby.
CLAIRE Okay, great. Thanks for taking my 200.
MALKIN Oh, no look, take it. Ms. Littleton, I am begging you just to consider...
CLAIRE I can't raise this child by myself.
MALKIN You have to listen to me!
CLAIRE Okay, thanks for your time, and my money back.
MALKIN Ms. Littleton, please. The baby needs your protection! Ms. Littleton, please!
CLAIRE Hello?
MALKIN Ms. Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.
CLAIRE Oh, my God.
MALKIN Listen to me. I have a plan, something that will make this all better.
CLAIRE You've got to stop calling me. It's too late, alright. I'm going to see adoptive services tomorrow.
MALKIN I've been telling you for months, you cannot do that.
CLAIRE Look, what I do with my baby is none of your business.
MALKIN If you don't do what I'm suggesting, great danger will befall...
CLAIRE Hey, great danger will befall you if you don't stop calling me in the middle of the night.
MALKIN I know what you're feeling inside, Claire -- that you're doubting your decision to give up the baby. Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. At least hear my plan first.
CLAIRE Good night.
CHARLIE Hi. Where are you going?
CLAIRE Back to the beach.
CHARLIE What happened? Did Jack...
CLAIRE Jack tried to dope me. He thinks I'm making all this up, that none of it really happened.
CHARLIE Right. So, to prove your sanity you go tromping through the jungle alone. Well done.
CLAIRE I'm not crazy, Charlie.
SHANNON You want my information. Name Shannon Rutherford, Age 20, Address Craphole Island.
HURLEY So, uh, where were you guys last night?
SHANNON Um, the beach.
BOONE Why the interrogation?
HURLEY You're like the 20th person to ask me that. Why is everyone so uptight about answering a few questions?
BOONE Well, maybe we're just not cool with you setting up your own little Patriot Act, man.
SHANNON He's a liberal.
BOONE No, seriously, why the list?
HURLEY Ah, it's nothing, we just had a little incident in the valley last night.
SHANNON An incident?
HURLEY Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl, you know her, she, uh, kind of got attacked.
SHANNON What?
BOONE She okay?
HURLEY Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
SHANNON I am so not moving to the rape caves.
BOONE You know, your life would be so much easier if you just had the manifest as we crossed out all the names of the dead after we burned the fuselage, so it should be a full roster of the rest of us.
HURLEY What? Really? Where is it?
BOONE Who do you think?
HURLEY I'm just going to lay it out straight.
SAWYER Okay, you do that.
HURLEY I hear you have the flight manifest, and I need it, and I want you to give it to me.
SAWYER That so?
HURLEY Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something -- tell me to screw off.
SAWYER Screw off?
HURLEY Or, you could just give it to me -- because, dude, you could use the points.
SAWYER Well, gosh, you sure know how to butter a man up, Stay Puft.
HURLEY It's a gift.
SAWYER Manifest is in the brown suitcase. Take it.
CHARLIE Please let me carry your bag.
CLAIRE I'm fine.
CHARLIE I know you're fine, but I can still carry your bag.
CLAIRE Why did you come after me?
CHARLIE Well, it's probably because I like you. What?
CLAIRE You don't like me, Charlie, okay? You just want to rescue me because, because of this . I'm fine, okay. I don't need rescuing. I don't need... 
CHARLIE Whoa, Claire. What is it? What, Claire, what, what is it?
CHARLIE Is that another one?
CLAIRE Yeah.
CHARLIE Okay, we need to time the contractions. That's what you do, time the contractions, okay. One sugar-plum fairy, two sugar-plum fairy...
CLAIRE Charlie.
CHARLIE You just need to calm down, alright. Big deep breaths. . Oh, bloody hell.
CLAIRE Charlie, I need you to go get Jack.
CHARLIE What?
CLAIRE I'll be alright.
CHARLIE I'm not leaving you alone.
CLAIRE Charlie, please just go.
CHARLIE I can deliver a baby. I can do this. This must happen all the time.
CLAIRE Charlie, you don't know how to deliver a...
CHARLIE Just listen to me. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I might not know what I'm doing but I'll figure it out. If I can kick drugs I can deliver a baby. Let me explain. I'm a drug addict. I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.
CLAIRE Get Jack!
CHARLIE Right.
LAWYER Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne. They'll pay your living and medical expenses.
ARLENE We found you an apartment. It's a really nice two bedroom place. And, well, we think you're going to be really comfortable in it.
LAWYER As discussed, once the baby is born and handed over to the Stewarts you'll have no right to see the child again. You'll have no right to correspond with the child. It will be entirely up to Eileen and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you. Understood?
CLAIRE Yes.
LAWYER Upon your discharge from the hospital you'll be given an additional payment of 20,000 dollars.
CLAIRE I just want to make sure that you're going to take really good care of the baby.
ARLENE Of course we will.
LAWYER Now, I'll need you to sign and date here, where indicated.
CLAIRE Do you know "Catch a Falling Star"? It's a song, like a lullaby.
ARLENE "Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket."
CLAIRE My dad used to sing that to me when I was little. Do you think you could sing it to the baby once in a while?
ARLENE Of course.
CLAIRE It's not working.
LAWYER Here.
CLAIRE I, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
ARLENE What? No!
CLAIRE Okay, what is it? What's your offer.
CHARLIE Oh, thank god. What's your name?
ETHAN Ethan.
CHARLIE Ethan...
ETHAN Are you alright?
CHARLIE ...you need to go the caves. Run to caves. Get Jack. Tell him that Claire...
ETHAN Claire. Is she okay?
CHARLIE She's having the baby. Go fast, okay? I'll be with her, on the path over there. Go.
CHARLIE Claire?
CLAIRE I'm here.
CHARLIE Claire. Okay, Jack's coming. How are you doing?
CLAIRE It hurts.
CHARLIE Okay, just take my hand. Squeeze. Okay, breathe. Inhale, exhale. Good, just breathe. Inhale, okay, good.
CLAIRE I'm not supposed to be here.
CHARLIE I think we all feel like that a little bit.
CLAIRE I know, it's just -- someone promised me it would be different.
CHARLIE Well, he was wrong.
CLAIRE Yeah. He was wrong.
CLAIRE You spent the last 4 months telling me I have to raise the baby myself. Now you're giving me money and saying I don't have to?
MALKIN I found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt. The baby will be safe in their care. Now, I've foreseen...
CLAIRE Heh, Foreseen? I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry.
MALKIN I know this sounds ridiculous, Claire. All this psychic business, and I appreciate that you must think I'm a raving madman. But this is what must happen.
CLAIRE So, you're giving me 6000 dollars to give my baby to a couple of strangers in Los Angeles?
MALKIN 12,000. The other 6 when you arrive in Los Angeles. And they're not strangers, Claire. They're good people.
CHARLIE A psychic?
CLAIRE I know. It's embarrassing. And now after everything, he was just full of it.
CHARLIE Or not. I mean, all he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right? Maybe he knew. I mean, if he wanted it bad enough. You know, if he had the gift, and I believe some people do, maybe he knew, Claire.
CLAIRE I can't go tomorrow. I have to get my...
MALKIN It has to be this flight. It can't be any other. They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive. Flight 815. Flight 815.
CLAIRE There was no couple in Los Angeles. He knew. He knew about the plane, what was going to happen. Oh my god, he knew.
CHARLIE You feel another one coming?
CLAIRE I don't think so.
CHARLIE Where the hell is Jack?
CLAIRE You know, I think, I think I'm alright.
CHARLIE The contractions?
CLAIRE Maybe that was the last one? Please let that be the last one.
CHARLIE Jack said that stress can cause false labor. You sure you're alright?
CLAIRE No pain.
CHARLIE Birthing emergency averted. I told you I'd take care of you.
CLAIRE Thanks, Charlie.
CHARLIE You're quite welcome. You think you can make it back to the caves? I won't let anything happen to you.
CLAIRE Okay, let's go.
JACK Sayid?
SAYID Listen to me. I found her, the French woman.
JACK I need some water. What happened?
SAYID The woman -- on the island. I had to come back. I had to come back. We're not alone.
CHARLIE You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah, yeah. Look, he just kicked, here .
HURLEY We've got a problem. The manifest, Jack, the census, the names of everyone who survived, all 46 of us. I interviewed everyone. Here, at the beach, got their names. One them, one of them isn't -- Jack! One of them isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane.
ETHAN Hello there.
CHARLIE Ethan, where's Jack?
