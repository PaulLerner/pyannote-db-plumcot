MEATHEAD Stay down! It's your choice man, walk away now and you won't get your ass kicked.
MEATHEAD You should've stayed down, Jack.
CHARLIE Jack, Jack!
CHARLIE Jack. Hey, Jack. There's someone out there. You gotta—the current's—there's someone out there, look.
CHARLIE I woke up and she's—I don't swim.
CHARLIE I don't swim.
JACK You okay, just take deep breaths now. Come on, just breathe, just breathe.
BOONE Did you get her?
JACK What?
BOONE There was a woman—I was trying to—did you get her?
BOONE You gotta go back.
KATE Jack?
JACK There's someone else still out there.
KATE Hey.
JACK So, what'd they say?
KATE Jack, maybe you should...
JACK Who was she?
KATE Her name was Joanna, she wasn't supposed to be on the plane. She was scuba diving off the barrier reef and got an ear infection so the doctor grounded her for two days. She bumped her flight. That's how she ended up with us.
JACK She was just swimming this morning, got caught in a riptide. We've been here six days and I never talked to her. Never said a word to her.
KATE Jack, don't.
JACK There were 47 of us and I never said a single word to her.
KATE You tried.
JACK No I didn't. I thought maybe I'd—I thought maybe I could bring him back and still have the time. I was there, in the water. I didn't try. I decided not to go after her.
KATE Jack?
KATE Jack?
KATE Are you okay?
JACK Did you see that?
KATE What?
JACK Standing there, in the water, there was a man. You didn't see that?
KATE Jack, when was the last time you slept?
JACK I need to put this with the rest of the gear.
MICHAEL Who taught you that?
WALT Sun, the Korean lady.
MICHAEL Don't swallow it.
WALT Why not?
MICHAEL Ocean water'll make you thirsty.
WALT Why?
MICHAEL Just don't swallow it, man. Alright?
JIN 입술 좀 봐. 물을 꼭 마셔야 돼. 
SUN 아니. 난 괜찮아요… 고마워. 우리한테 언제 얘기해 줄까요? 뭘 어떻게 해야 할 지 모르겠네. 아무도 우릴 찾지 않을 것 같아요. 
JIN 걱정하지 마. 사람이 올 거야. 
SUN 모두 다… 우릴 무시해요. 좀 더 적극적으로 얘기를 하려고 노력을 하면… 
JIN 우리는 괜찮을 거야. 다른 사람은 필요 없어. 그냥 내가 하라는 대로 하면 돼. 
SHANNON Have you got it or what?
SAWYER You're in my light, sticks.
SHANNON Lightsticks? What the hell is that supposed to...?
SAWYER Light, comma, sticks. As in those legs of yours.
SHANNON Look, while I really love my new nickname, and I think it's really sweet...
SAWYER Calm down. I got your damn stuff.
SHANNON It'll keep off sand fleas?
SAWYER You bet. Even has aloe.
SHANNON How much?
SAWYER Your money's no good here.
SHANNON Then what the hell do you want?
SHANNON If you really think I'm going to...
SAWYER Five grand.
SHANNON I thought you said my money was no good here.
SAWYER I was negotiating. I can take an IOU. Something tells me you're good... for it.
CLAIRE You haven't found a hairbrush in there, have you?
KATE No. Sorry.
CLAIRE I must have looked through twenty suitcases. I can't find one. It's weird, right? When you think that everyone packs a hairbrush.
KATE You alright?
CLAIRE Yeah, it's just the heat. Oh, and, and I'm pregnant.
KATE Really? 
CLAIRE Thanks. What are you doing?
KATE I'm sorting the practical clothes from the impractical. Wanna help?
CLAIRE Sure. Can I—can I ask you something?
KATE Sure, shoot.
CLAIRE Are you a Gemini?
KATE Yeah, I am.
CLAIRE I thought so, restless, passionate. You know, everyone thinks astrology's just a load of crap but that's just because they don't get it. I can do your chart if you want to? Or not... Geminis...
HURLEY Hey Jack!
HURLEY Whoa. You look tired, brother.
JACK I'm fine. What's up?
HURLEY We got a problem.
JACK That's it?
CHARLIE That's it.
JACK How many?
CHARLIE 18.
HURLEY People just kind of took what they needed because we were supposed to be rescued, but we weren't.
CHARLIE Even if we divided it up, split the bottles in half it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.
JACK 46. There is 46 of us now.
HURLEY People find out this is all we have left, they're going to freak out, man.
CHARLIE The boar's running low until we can catch another one. What should we tell them?
JACK I don't know.
HURLEY Maybe we can make one of those water finding sticks.
CHARLIE What should we do with the stuff we've got?
JACK I don't know.
CHARLIE We should put it in the tent, yeah?
HURLEY Maybe the dog can find water?
CHARLIE Probably better if no one knows how little is left.
HURLEY I mean, dogs can find pot and bombs, so I'm sure they can find water.
CHARLIE Don't tell the others we're running low. That way you can ration it. Then you can decide what...
JACK I'm not deciding anything!
HURLEY Why not?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD You wanna come in?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD So, you want to tell me what happened?
YOUNG JACK A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman. But they didn't jump you?
YOUNG JACK No.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I had a boy on my table today. I don't know, maybe a year younger than you. He had a bad heart. It got real hairy, real fast. And everybody's looking at your old man to make decisions. And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day, after the boy died, I was able to wash my hands and come home to dinner. You know, watch a little Carol Burnett, laugh till my sides hurt. And how can I do that, hmm? And even when I fail, how do I do that, Jack? Because I have what it takes. Don't choose, Jack, don't decide. You don't want to be a hero, you don't try and save everyone because when you fail... you just don't have what it takes.
BOONE Why didn't you leave me? Hey, I'm talking to you.
JACK Not now, man.
BOONE I could have made it back. What? Not going to answer me? I told you to leave me.
JACK You were drowning.
BOONE You should've saved her.
JACK But I didn't save her. And neither did you.
BOONE You think you're all noble and heroic for coming after me? I was fine! You're not the only one who knows what to do around here, you know that? I run a business! Who appointed you our savior, huh? What gives you the right—. Look at me. Hey, I'm talking to you.
BOONE Look at me, Jack. Where are you going? Hey, where are going? Hey!
JACK Dad?
MARGO Your father's gone, Jack. Did you hear what I said? He's gone, Jack.
JACK He'll be back.
MARGO This time it's different. I want you to bring him back.
MARGO What?
JACK He hasn't talked to me in two months, Mom.
MARGO You haven't talked to him in two months.
JACK He doesn't want me to bring him back, trust me. Let one of his friends.
MARGO He doesn't have friends anymore. Why do you think that is? He was right about you.
JACK Right about what?
MARGO You don't understand the pressure that he's under.
JACK I understand pressure.
MARGO Jack, please you know how he gets—he doesn't—he won't take care of himself. You have to go after him.
JACK I'm sorry. I can't.
MARGO "I can't?" You don't get to say "I can't." Not after what you did. Bring your father home, Jack.
JACK Where is he?
MARGO Australia.
WALT Hey, hey!
KATE What's the matter?
WALT That pregnant lady fell down.
KATE What happened?
CHARLIE She just dropped.
KATE It must be the heat. Is she breathing?
MICHAEL Yeah, I think.
KATE Come on. Let's get her inside.
CHARLIE Wake up.
KATE Claire? Claire, honey, wake up. Claire? Can you hear me, Claire. Come on. Wake up. Come on. Come on, please wake up. Come on. Claire, can you hear me? Alright.
CLAIRE Hmm?
KATE Hi. It's me. It's Kate.
CLAIRE What?
KATE You passed out. Just take it easy, okay? She needs water.
KATE Don't move, okay? Honey, I think you have a fever, but if you keep really still that's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
CHARLIE What the... The water's gone. Someone stole it.
LOCKE Where is the doctor?
KATE I don't know. No one can find him.
SAYID Is this the last of the camp's water supply?
KATE Yeah.
SAYID Keeping it all in one place, foolish.
KATE I can go into the jungle, try to find some fresh water.
SAYID You're not going alone.
LOCKE When the others find out the water's gone it's going to get ugly. And when they find out that someone pinched it, it's going to get uglier. I'll go. Camp needs you two here, especially with the doctor gone. And besides, I know where to look.
JACK Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?!
HOTEL MANAGER The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days.
JACK Did he rent a car from the concierge?
HOTEL MANAGER No, sir. Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard, I don't think your father rented a car at all.
JACK Yeah, why's that?
HOTEL MANAGER There was an incident a few nights ago, here at the hotel bar. I had to get security to escort your father to his room.
JACK What's that have to do with renting a car?
HOTEL MANAGER I'm sorry, sir, I shouldn't have said-
JACK Come on, what's that have to do with renting a car?
HOTEL MANAGER Mr. Shephard, I don't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition.
JACK My father is a Chief of Surgery.
HOTEL MANAGER Of course, sir. I apologize.
JACK He left his wallet. Who leaves a wallet?
HOTEL MANAGER Perhaps you should talk to the police, Mr. Shephard.
JACK Where are you?
LOCKE Take my hand. Come on.
LOCKE You okay?
CHARLIE Hey.
CLAIRE Hey. How long have I...
CHARLIE A couple of hours. Here. It's not much but it's what we have. Just relax, you have to think about the little one now, you.
CLAIRE Thanks for the water, Charlie.
CHARLIE There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it.
CLAIRE Is Jack back yet?
CHARLIE No. No one's seen him. But, I wouldn't worry. Good old Mr. Locke's gone into the jungle to get some water for you.
CLAIRE Great. Our only hunter's going to get eaten just so he can get the pregnant girl some more water.
CHARLIE I wouldn't worry, luv. I mean, you tell me, who would you rather meet in a dark alley, whatever's out there, or that geezer with his 400 knives? I mean, who packs 400 knives? Personally, I can only have space for 200, 300 at most.
CLAIRE When are they going to rescue us?
CHARLIE Soon.
CLAIRE Thanks, Charlie.
CHARLIE For what?
CLAIRE People don't seem to look me in the eye here. I think I scare them. The baby... It's like I'm this time bomb of responsibility just waiting to go off.
CHARLIE You don't scare me.
HURLEY Uh, the Chinese people have water.
SAYID Where did you get this? Where did you get this? Where! Did! You!-
KATE She doesn't understand you.
SAYID She understands me. Did you steal this water?
SUN 죄송하지만 무슨 오해가 있는 것 같은데요. 그런 게 아니라…
Jin 떨어져, 이 새끼야. 내 와이프 한 번만 더 만지면 넌 죽어.
KATE Just take it easy, alright. We just want to talk, alright? This had water in it. Is it yours? Who gave you this?
SAYID I don't see the water.
KATE And?
SAYID You go after him now, he'll give you nothing. But if you wait, a rat will always lead you to it's hole.
SAWYER Well, it's about time.
KATE For what?
SAWYER I made this birthday wish four years ago.
KATE Where's the water?
SAWYER That's better.
KATE Get off of me.
SAYID Give us the water now.
SAWYER Touch me again, huh.
SAWYER You really think I stole your damn water?
SAYID We know you gave two bottles to the Koreans.
SAWYER I don't give nothing to nobody.
KATE It's not here.
SAWYER I traded Mr. Miyagi the last of my water for a fish he caught. We worked it out caveman style.
KATE You gave him your last two bottles?
SAWYER Water has no value, Freckles. It's gonna rain sooner or later. And hell, I'm an optimist.
SAWYER Hey, you forgot something. . Seeing as you're the new sheriff in town. Might as well make it official.
JACK How are they, the others?
LOCKE Thirsty. Hungry. Waiting to be rescued. And they need someone to tell them what to do.
JACK Me? I can't.
LOCKE Why can't you?
JACK Because I'm not a leader.
LOCKE And yet they all treat you like one.
JACK I don't know how to help them. I'll fail. I don't have what it takes.
LOCKE Why are you out here, Jack?
JACK I think I'm going crazy.
LOCKE No. You're not going crazy.
JACK No?
LOCKE No, crazy people don't know they're going crazy. They think they're getting sane. So, why are you out here?
JACK I'm chasing something—someone.
LOCKE Ah. The white rabbit. Alice in Wonderland.
JACK Yeah, wonderland, because who I'm chasing—he's not there.
LOCKE But you see him?
JACK Yes. But he's not there.
LOCKE And if I came to you and said the same thing, then what would your explanation be, as a doctor.
JACK I'd call it a hallucination. A result of dehydration, post traumatic stress, not getting more than two hours of sleep a night for the past week. All of the above.
LOCKE All right, then. You're hallucinating. But what if you're not?
JACK Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
LOCKE I'm an ordinary man, Jack, meat and potatoes, I live in the real world. I'm not a big believer in magic. But this place is different. It's special. The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them. But we all know it. We all feel it. Is your white rabbit a hallucination? Probably. But what if everything that happened here, happened for a reason? What if this person that you're chasing is really here?
JACK That's impossible.
LOCKE Even if it is, let's say it's not.
JACK Then what happens when I catch him?
LOCKE I don't know. But I've looked into the eye of this Island. And what I saw was beautiful.
JACK Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?
LOCKE To find some more water.
JACK I'll come with you.
LOCKE No. You need to finish what you started.
JACK Why?
LOCKE Because a leader can't lead until he knows where he's going.
MEDICAL EXAMINER The police found him in an alley in Queens Cross. Now, a tox screen showed a blood alcohol content, which for a man of his size, probably brought on myocardial infarction - a sizable, and fatal heart-attack.
JACK That's him.
JACK What do you mean you won't put it on the plane?
AGENT I'm sorry Mr. Shephard, but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation. There's just no latitude.
JACK No latitude? No latitude?
AGENT Without the proper documents-
JACK Look, you can't do this to me. I'm ready to go now.
AGENT Perhaps another carrier?
JACK No!
JACK I want you to listen to me, okay. Because I'm asking you a favor, Chrissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral and I'm asking you a favor. In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there. And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Chrissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because... because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just—I need to bury my father.
BOONE Hey, hey, Claire .
CLAIRE How did you get that?
BOONE Shhh.
CHARLIE Where'd you get that?
CHARLIE Here's your thief.
MICHAEL Where'd he hide it?
CHARLIE I don't know. This wanker had three bottles on him. Why'd you do it, pretty boy, eh?
BOONE It was just sitting in—it was just sitting in the tent, and Jack just took off.
CHARLIE Claire could've died!
BOONE I tried to give her some sooner, but it just got out of hand. No one would have understood.
KATE What is going on?
BOONE Someone had to take responsibility for it. It would have never lasted!
CHARLIE Oh shut up!
JACK Leave him alone! It's been six days and we're all still waiting. Waiting for someone to come. But what if they don't? We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning just going for a swim and he tried to save her, and now you're about to crucify him? We can't do this. Every man for himself is not going to work. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're going to survive here. Now, I found water. Fresh water, up in the valley. I'll take a group in at first light. If you don't wanna come then find another way to contribute. Last week most of us were strangers, but we're all here now. And god knows how long we're going to be here. But if we can't live together, we're going to die alone.
SUN 고마워요-- 아까 물 갖다 줘서. 
JIN 남편이니까 그렇게 해야지. 
SAWYER So, how does it feel?
BOONE How does what feel?
SAWYER Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list. Sucks, don't it?
JACK Thanks.
KATE So where were you today Jack?
JACK Just had to take care of a few things.
KATE That's all I'm gonna get, huh?
JACK My father died. In Sydney.
KATE I'm sorry.
JACK Yeah. I'm sorry, too.
