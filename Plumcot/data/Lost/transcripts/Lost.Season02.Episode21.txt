ana_lucia_cortez What are you building?
mr_eko Hello, Ana.
ana_lucia_cortez Well, hello yourself. So, are you going to tell me? What is it?
mr_eko I am building a church.
ana_lucia_cortez Now, why the hell would you want to do that?
mr_eko Because I was told to.
ana_lucia_cortez Told to by who?
mr_eko I was just told. I think it was in a dream.
ana_lucia_cortez A dream like this one?
ana_lucia_cortez You need to help John.
mr_eko Yemi?
yemi Hello, brother.
mr_eko Forgive me. I should have listened to you. You were right. I didn't want to do it.
yemi The work being done in this place is important, Eko. It is more important than anything. And it is in danger. You must help John. He has lost his way. You must make him take you to the question mark.
yemi John will not want to show you, so you must make him. Eko, there are many distractions, brother , but you must move past them. What is done is done. Do you understand?
mr_eko Yes, Yemi.
yemi And, Eko, bring the axe.
charlie_pace What's the matter? You alright, mate?
mr_eko I need to find John.
dr_jack_shephard What were you thinking, John?
kate_austen Jack, leave him alone.
james_ford No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
dr_jack_shephard Shut it, Sawyer. If Ana hadn't lifted your gun we wouldn't...
james_ford Well, ain't that swell, Gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the Artist Formally Known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
dr_jack_shephard How about you go back to the beach?
kate_austen Hey, enough -- both of you.
dr_jack_shephard Michael, hey.
michael_dawson He shot me.
dr_jack_shephard Who?
michael_dawson He's gone. He ran out.
dr_jack_shephard Go, I got him.
michael_dawson I was sleeping and I heard gunshots. I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy. He had a gun and...
dr_jack_shephard Okay, come on, we've got to get you up.
mr_eko Let me help you.
kate_austen She's dead.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, we've got to get her up. We've got to get her to the back room, okay.
mr_eko Grant us this mercy, oh Lord. We beseech Thee. Amen.
dr_jack_shephard She's in shock. Alright, we've got to keep pressure on this.
kate_austen Can you do anything? Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I heard you. Keep pressure on her, okay.
michael_dawson How is she?
dr_jack_shephard I'm doing what I can. How long ago?
michael_dawson What?
dr_jack_shephard When did this happen? How long ago did he leave?
michael_dawson I don't know. 20 minutes, maybe a half hour.
dr_jack_shephard We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
james_ford Man's got a head-start, a gun, and he ain't afraid to...
dr_jack_shephard He shot 3 of our people! One of them is dead, one of them...
james_ford Who's going to take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
mr_eko I will go. John, you have tracking experience, yes?
john_locke Yeah.
mr_eko We will find his trail together.
dr_jack_shephard You find anything -- anything -- you come right back here and we figure out what we're going to do next, together.
mr_eko Let's go, John.
mr_eko How long has it been since your last confession?
caldwell Oh, good question. Too many years for me to even remember.
mr_eko What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for? What sins have you committed?
caldwell Let's see. Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
mr_eko Just once, or many times?
caldwell How many is many?
mr_eko To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
caldwell Oh, I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
mr_eko Do you have it?
caldwell What'd you do, Padre? Skim from the collection plate? You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles. I could get you on with them.
mr_eko Doing what?
caldwell You know, stuff.
monsignor Good morning, Father Tunde.
mr_eko Good morning, Monsignor. This is Mr. Caldwell. He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
monsignor I'm sorry Father, but I've got some bad news. You're going to have to postpone your trip. It appears we have a miracle.
joyce_malkin My daughter, she -- she drowned.
mr_eko I'm very sorry for your loss.
joyce_malkin Oh, no, you don't understand. She came back to life. We were out in the back blocks and Charlotte must have slipped; and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer. She was dead and the next day she woke up. Don't you understand? It's a miracle -- a confirmation of faith. Everyone needs to know about it. People need...
mr_eko Where is your daughter?
joyce_malkin At home with my husband.
mr_eko What does he think?
joyce_malkin The world needs to know about this. We need to tell the Vatican. We need to tell the world-
monsignor I'm sorry; we can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin. The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told. Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
mr_eko Mrs. Malkin, will you excuse us for a moment, please.
joyce_malkin Of course.
mr_eko Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
monsignor Why not?
mr_eko Because I do not believe what this woman says.
monsignor Why do you think I chose you?
john_locke Are you seeing something I'm not? Hey! I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the Hatch. What the hell are you following?
mr_eko Where is the question mark?
john_locke The what?
mr_eko The question mark, John. Where is it?
john_locke You know what, you keep chasing after your own shadow; I'm going back.
mr_eko I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
john_locke No, I don't have to show you anything.
mr_eko Then I am sorry.
john_locke You hit me. Why did you...?
mr_eko Because you were being difficult.
john_locke Are you insane?
mr_eko No.
john_locke Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
mr_eko Ana wants me to help you, John.
john_locke Help me do what?
mr_eko Find the question mark.
john_locke You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?
mr_eko No, but you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
john_locke Here, you want to find your damn question mark? Here, this is it right here. Here take it. Take it because it's nothing. It's a memory. It's 10 seconds of nothing.
mr_eko This is your hatch, yes?
john_locke It's not my hatch.
mr_eko If the Swan is where we came from then we go that way.
john_locke We shouldn't even be out here. Ana Lucia would still be alive if I just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
mr_eko Now, she wants us to go here, John, together. She said this in my dream.
john_locke Of course, a dream.
mr_eko Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
dr_ian_mcvay So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
mr_eko That depends upon what I put in my report. Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
dr_ian_mcvay Well, I got a call around 1am -- Ambrose brought this girl in, dead. She'd been in the water 2 hours.
mr_eko Have you had much experience in this type of death?
dr_ian_mcvay Yeah, of course. I'm, I'm an undertaker. Well, I mean, it's my day job. I mean, I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner. I mean, I did go to medical school.
mr_eko And when did you find out that she was -- not dead?
dr_ian_mcvay During the autopsy.
mr_eko During the autopsy?
dr_ian_mcvay It's alright; I didn't expect you to believe me.
dr_ian_mcvay I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
dr_ian_mcvay This is a Caucasian female. She's 161 cm, 51.3 kilos. Body prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McDervish.
VALERIE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode21 Ian, stop it.
dr_ian_mcvay Commencing with the post. This is a clear case of drowning. I'll begin with a thoracic...
dr_ian_mcvay Take it. No, please, I don't ever want to listen to that tape again.
john_locke You lost already?
mr_eko Your map is inexact.
john_locke No kidding.
mr_eko These landmarks -- is this a river?
john_locke No, it's a wavy line. I didn't draw it, I just transcribed it. I told you, I don't even know if it is a map.
mr_eko Let's assume it is.
john_locke What's the axe for?
mr_eko I don't know yet.
mr_eko You are the one that found this plane, yes?
john_locke Yeah. It was up there.
mr_eko And what made it fall?
john_locke Boone. Boone made it fall. Then he died. A sacrifice that the Island demanded.
mr_eko Excuse me?
john_locke Nothing. So, what's next?
mr_eko We make camp. Get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
dr_jack_shephard Where the hell are they?
kate_austen Just calm down. Finding his trail in the dark is not going to be easy. They'll be back.
michael_dawson She say anything? Libby?
dr_jack_shephard She's still unconscious. The bleeding stopped.
kate_austen That's good, right?
dr_jack_shephard No, it's not good.
michael_dawson And there's nothing you can...
dr_jack_shephard I can make her comfortable. But I don't have what I need.
james_ford Why are you looking at me? I gave you all the damn meds 2 days ago...
dr_jack_shephard The heroin, Sawyer.
james_ford Give me 20 minutes.
dr_jack_shephard Kate's going to go with you.
james_ford It doesn't take 2 people to...
dr_jack_shephard Kate is going with you.
kate_austen What are you talking about? Why would he need me to go with him?
james_ford Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns. So, I can either show you where it's at, or let poor Libby suffer. That pretty much it, Doc?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
james_ford Let's go, Freckles.
kate_austen I'm curious about something.
james_ford Yeah, what's that?
kate_austen How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
james_ford I don't know, she must've lifted it off me.
kate_austen She pick-pocketed your gun? How'd she do that?
james_ford Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, now would she? After you.
kate_austen I thought you were taking me to your stash.
james_ford Do you have to make everything so damned difficult? Just go in.
kate_austen You kept the guns here, all this time, right under you?
james_ford Fooled you, didn't I?
hugo_reyes Hey guys, you seen Libby around?
yemi Eko.
mr_eko Yemi.
yemi You'll wake John. Come, follow me.
mr_eko Yemi.
mr_eko Yemi! Yemi.
yemi Wake up, John.
mr_eko Are you alright, John?
john_locke Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
mr_eko You had a dream. Was there a man? A priest? The man that you saw was my brother.
john_locke Your brother?
mr_eko This is why we needed to come together. This is how we are going to be led, and how we will know where to go next.
john_locke But I don't know where to go.
mr_eko Did he tell you anything?
john_locke No, he, he...
mr_eko Nothing? Anything?
john_locke It wasn't even me. It was you. It didn't -- he wanted me to follow him.
mr_eko Follow him where? Wait here.
john_locke Eko, it was just a dream. It's not safe. Eko!
joyce_malkin Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time. You'll have to come back later.
mr_eko Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter. Yesterday in the church you said that...
joyce_malkin I know what I said. It's just that right this minute is not a very good time.
richard_malkin Get back in the house, Joyce. Get her inside.
joyce_malkin Richard, please.
richard_malkin Inside, now!
richard_malkin I know why you're here, friend. But you can save yourself the trouble. What happened here was not a miracle.
mr_eko The doctor that treated your daughter seems to feel differently.
richard_malkin Treated her? He tried to cut her open. He's just trying to cover up his own negligence. He tell you the whole story -- how she supposedly drowned? She fell into a mountain river, her body shut down; she went into hypothermia which made her appear dead.
mr_eko And why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
richard_malkin Because she's a zealot. All of this -- everything she's doing -- is to spite me.
mr_eko Why would she spite you?
richard_malkin Because she knows I'm a fraud. Because I make my living as a psychic. You see, that's what I do. I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it. Everyday I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one. But there are none to be had. Not in this world, anyway.
mr_eko I will report back to my Monsignor that there was no miracle here. Your daughter is alive. This is all that matters.
john_locke Eko, be careful!
john_locke Eko! Eko!
mr_eko I'm fine.
john_locke Eko, what's up there?! You see anything?!
mr_eko I don't see nothing.
mr_eko It's salty.
john_locke What?
mr_eko The earth. It's been salted so that nothing can grow.
john_locke Why would anyone wanna salt -- there's nothing here.
mr_eko I believe they made a circle -- a target -- so that this place can be seen from up above.
john_locke They? What place?
mr_eko The place that this plane fell upon, John.
mr_eko John! Will you help me with this?
mr_eko Wait.
john_locke Eko, may I?
mr_eko Please, be my guest.
hugo_reyes We were going to have our first date.
michael_dawson Date?
hugo_reyes Yeah, a picnic on the beach. I'm glad you're okay, man.
mr_eko John.
WICKMAN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode21 Hello, I'm Dr. Mark Wickman, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or the Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded -- not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole. As Karen DeGroot herself has written, "Careful observation in the only key to true and complete awareness." Your tour of duty will last 3 weeks and during this time you and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress. Your duty is to observe team members at another station on the Island. These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance, or that they are the subjects of an experiment. Working in 8 hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we provided. What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask? What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfill their tasks? You, as the observer, don't need to know. All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance. Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded. Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up containers provided. Then, simply place the container in the pneumatic tube, and presto, it will be transported directly to us. At the end of your 8 hour shift, proceed to the Pala ferry which will take you back to the barracks prepare for your next shift . On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste and good luck.
mr_eko Would you like to watch that again?
john_locke No. No, I've seen enough.
john_locke What are you doing?
mr_eko I'm taking this back with us.
john_locke Why?
mr_eko Because they may be important.
john_locke Important? I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
mr_eko Yes, John. And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
john_locke What work?
mr_eko Pushing the button.
john_locke That's not work. That's a joke -- rats in a maze with no cheese.
mr_eko It is work, John. We are being tested.
john_locke Tested?
mr_eko The reason to do it -- push the button -- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
john_locke Oh -- well, then what is the reason, Mr. Eko?
mr_eko We do it because we believe we are meant to. Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
john_locke I was never meant to do anything! Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button! You think it's important? You think it's necessary? It's nothing. It's nothing. It's meaningless. And who are you to tell me that it's not?
AGENT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode21 That's flight 815, leaving from gate 23.
mr_eko Thank you.
mr_eko What are you doing here?
charlotte I had to see you.
mr_eko Look, your father said I shouldn't...
charlotte I know. He doesn't want me talking to you. And I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
mr_eko A message?
charlotte He says you were a good priest.
mr_eko Who says that?
charlotte Yemi.
mr_eko Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
charlotte I saw him when I was -- between places. He said that you would come and see me. He said that even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
mr_eko Who put you up to this? Did your father tell you to do this?
charlotte He wants you to know that he will see you soon. He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, that he has faith in you.
mr_eko Why are you doing this to me? What do you want from me? Why are you doing this to me?!
libby_smith Is everything alright?
charlotte He has faith in you. One day you'll believe me.
Announcer#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode21 Oceanic Flight 815 is now boarding...
mr_eko This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi. Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God. And because I betrayed him he was shot and died. He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria half a world from here. Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island. And somehow, here, I found my brother again. I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria. In the same plane that lies above us now -- that has concealed this place. And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine, just as it was on the day I first took another man's life. So let me ask you -- how can you say this is meaningless? I believe the work being done in the Hatch is more important than anything. If you will not continue to push the button, John, I will.
hugo_reyes Can, can I talk to her?
dr_jack_shephard Sure.
hugo_reyes Hey, it's Hurley. Hugo. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. Libby?
libby_smith Michael.
dr_jack_shephard Michael. He's okay. He made it, Libby. It's okay. It's alright.
