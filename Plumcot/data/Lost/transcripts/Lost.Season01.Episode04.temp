MICHAEL Walt, you gotta keep that dog quiet.
WALT I don't know what's wrong with him. Come on, Vincent, cut that out.
MICHAEL Sorry, hey, sorry, sorry.
KATE What is it?
CLAIRE Somebody's in there.
SAYID Everyone in there's dead.
JACK Sawyer.
SAWYER Right behind you, Jackass.
KATE Jack?
SAWYER I'm gonna shed some light on this thing.
JACK Run.
HURLEY Oh crud, now what?
SAYID They're gone.
CHARLIE What the bloody hell was that?
LOCKE Boars. 
JACK Those boars were looking to feed. We have to get rid of the bodies.
CHARLIE Bury them? There's a whole bunch in there.
SAYID More than twenty. Digging will be difficult without shovels.
JACK We're not burying them. We need to burn them.
KATE They're people.
JACK I know they're people, Kate.
SAYID Burning the remains, they deserve better than that.
JACK Better than what? Being eaten by wild animals? Because that's what's going to happen. Any bodies we bury are not going to stay buried for very long. Look, I know this seems harsh, but that fuselage in the sun—it's not about what they deserve. They're gone, and we're not.
SAYID What you say may be true, but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest—it's not right. No regard for their wishes? Their religions?
JACK We don't have time to sort out everybody's god.
CHARLIE Really, last I heard we were positively made of time.
JACK Look, I'm not happy about it either, but we crashed a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place. It's been 4 days, no one's come. Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood, dried brush, and turn that fuselage into a furnace. Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we start the fire.
CHARLIE If he's so eager to burn the bodies why are we waiting until sundown?
KATE He's hoping someone will see it.
KATE Looks like I'm not the only who couldn't sleep last night.
SAYID There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood.
KATE You don't agree with Jack. What are you making?
SAYID Too soon to talk about. I'm not sure it will even work.
KATE You're trying to pick up the transmission aren't you? The one we heard on the transceiver.
SAYID If the French woman's transmission has truly been playing on a loop for 16 years then there must be a power source on the Island. A significant one.
KATE And you can find it?
SAYID Hypothetically, yes. I'm making an antenna of sorts. With a few of these mounted at different points on the Island I may be able to use the transceiver to triangulate the signal, find out where it's coming from.
KATE So what can I do to help?
SAYID It appears you are as anxious to get off this Island as I am.
WALT Catch the ball, catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy, good job Vincent.
MICHAEL Hey, hey, where you going, man?
WALT Nowhere, I just thought I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.
MICHAEL Hey, why don't you help your dad with the wood. I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day anyway.
WALT At least he talks to me. Come on, Vincent.
HURLEY What's your problem? Hand them over.
SAWYER How about no?
HURLEY There's other people here or don't you give a crap?
SAWYER Well if one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share...
HURLEY Oh that's bull and you know it. You're not happy unless you're screwing over everybody...
SAWYER Hey I'm peachy, pork pie.
JACK Guys, knock it off.
SAWYER Stay out of this, Metro.
JACK What's going on?
HURLEY Jethro here's hoarding the last of the peanuts.
SAWYER My own stash. I found it in there.
JACK What about the rest of the food?
HURLEY There is no rest of the food, dude. We kind of—ate it all.
SHANNON What?
JACK Okay everybody, just calm down.
SAYID We can find food. There are plenty of things on this Island we can use for sustenance.
SAWYER And exactly how are we going to find this sustenance.
LOCKE We hunt.
KATE How'd you get that knife on the plane?
LOCKE Checked it.
JACK You either have very good aim, or very bad aim, Mr...
MICHAEL Locke. His name is Locke.
JACK Okay Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting?
LOCKE We know there are wild boar on the Island. Razorbacks, by the look of them. The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets, 100, 150 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar-like tusks, and a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it, and slit its throat.
SAWYER And you gave him his knife back?
JACK Well, if you've got a better idea.
SAWYER Better than the three of you wandering into the magic forest to bag a hunk of ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife? Hell no, it's the best idea I ever heard.
HURLEY Who is this guy?
LOCKE Yes?
GL12 Colonel Locke, is this line secure?
LOCKE Line secure GL12, go ahead.
GL12 Target area is acquired. Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours. Repeat we are a GO.
LOCKE Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.
RANDY Locke. I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today. Not 1230; not 1215; noon.
LOCKE I heard you the first time, Randy.
RANDY And no personal calls during office hours, Colonel.
JACK So? Hunting boar, now, huh?
KATE Who says it's my first time boar hunting?
JACK Uh-huh. Tell me something, how come every time there's a hike into the heart of darkness you sign up? You know what's in there.
KATE Actually, I don't. And neither do you.
JACK What's your feel on our new friend?
KATE Seems to know what he's doing.
JACK Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives?
KATE If I didn't know any better, I'd say your worried about me, Jack.
JACK If I didn't know any better, I'd say you have a problem staying in one place for very long, Kate. So, you want to tell me why you're really going?
KATE Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard—find the source.
JACK This isn't about boars.
KATE I'm a vegetarian.
WALT But why can't I come?
MICHAEL Because I said so.
MICHAEL Hi, hi, excuse me. Um, I am going off, away, to hunt, and um, I was wondering if you could keep an eye on my boy, Walt. And, I'm Michael. Anyway, could you watch him for me, until I come back?
SUN 아... 아드님은 제가 잘 돌보고 있을게요. 예...
MICHAEL Sorry I don't understand, but you're cool with this, right? 
WALT I don't need a babysitter.
MICHAEL Come on, Vincent needs you here. And, hey, cheer up. This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke a little better.
SUN 너무 걱정하지 마. 아버지 괜찮으실 거야.
WALT Yeah, whatever.
CLAIRE Excuse me. Doctor?
JACK Claire, right? How's the .
CLAIRE Oh, he's good, yeah, thanks. Um, I thought maybe you should see this . Someone found it in there. They're collecting all the belongings. They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristin. They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me. I remember because they looked so happy.
JACK I don't understand, Claire, what am I supposed to do with this?
CLAIRE Oh, well, um, some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of memorial service, or something. You could lead it.
JACK Uh, no, I don't think it...
CLAIRE Well, you know, just a few words, or we could just read their names from passports, and drivers...
JACK Look, it's not my thing.
CLAIRE Oh, okay. Maybe I'll do it.
JACK Yeah, sounds fine. Whatever everybody wants.
BOONE That woman's still sitting there.
SHANNON Mmmhmmm.
BOONE Her husband was on the plane.
SHANNON Right.
BOONE Are you even listening to me?
SHANNON What's a four letter word for I don't care?
BOONE I just think somebody should go talk to her.
SHANNON I nominate you, Captain America. You just can't help yourself, can you?
BOONE Yeah, well, at least you don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you.
SHANNON I'm not going to starve.
BOONE Right, what are you going to eat?
SHANNON The ocean's full of fish.
BOONE I hate to break it to you—the ocean is not going to take your gold card.
SHANNON You really don't think I can't catch a fish?
KATE You find something?
LOCKE The ground here has been rooted up. That's how boars get the majority of their food, they dig. Afterwards they generally wallow in the dirt, rub up against the trees, scoring them with their tusks.
MICHAEL Okay. So what's all that mean?
LOCKE Means we're close.
SHANNON Hi.
CHARLIE Hi. (putting the drugs back in his pocket). Shannon, right?
SHANNON Yeah. Are you doing anything?
CHARLIE Me? No, I was just, uh. What are you doing?
SHANNON I was just going to go for a walk. Do you want to come?
CHARLIE Yeah, yes, sure.
SHANNON Can I ask you something?
CHARLIE Oh, I wondered when this was going to come up. Yes, I'm the bass guitarist in Dri…
SHANNON Do you know anything about fishing?
CHARLIE What? Fishing? My grand-dad used to take me out, taught me everything he knows. Everything he knew, he's dead now, god rest his soul. Yeah, I'm like a … I'm a fishing fiend. I mean England's an island so I just throw it in and … fish.
SHANNON Good.
BOONE Hey doc, you got a second?
JACK What's up?
BOONE The woman's been sitting over there by herself. Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband? I don't think she's had anything to eat or drink. Think maybe you can go talk to her?
JACK Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist. I mean, maybe you should...
BOONE I just thought you might want to do it. You're the one that saved her life.
JACK Hi. Rose, right? Remember me, seat 23A? I'm the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence. Everybody's getting pretty worried about you, Rose. If you want to be alone that's fine, but you have to take care of yourself. You should really drink. Okay. We don't have to talk. Let's just sit for a while.
KATE Your son, how's he handling all of this?
MICHAEL A hell of a lot better than I am.
KATE You must be proud. He's a brave kid.
MICHAEL Yeah. I can't take credit for that. I wasn't part of his life. Till his mother passed away, two weeks ago.
KATE I'm sorry. I didn't know.
MICHAEL That's okay. There were living in Sydney the past couple of years. I flew out last week, you know, to go get him. What were you doing in Australia?
LOCKE Shhh.
MICHAEL Hey, quit giving us the steal signal.
KATE He's bad.
GL12 Move. You've got to move Col. Your troops are across enemy lines.
LOCKE Patience, the quality which you lack, GL12, is the hallmark of a leader.
RANDY Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. While you're at it, tell me about this Col. thing. I cruised your file in human resources, you've never been in any of the armed forces.
LOCKE I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's my lunch hour, I can play a game.
RANDY Well, tell me, what's a Walkabout? "Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback."
LOCKE You have no right taking that off my desk.
RANDY So, you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?
LOCKE Not that you would understand, but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal, where one derives strength from the earth. And becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, I'm going, Randy. I've already made a reservation.
GL12 Wow. John you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?
RANDY Helen? Well, what's this Locke, you've actually got a woman in your life.
LOCKE That's none of your business.
RANDY What is it with you Locke? Why do you torture yourself? I mean, imagining you're some hunter? Walkabouts? Wake up, you can't do any of that.
LOCKE Norman Croucher.
RANDY What? Norman what?
LOCKE Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher, double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mt. Everest. Why? It was his destiny.
RANDY That's what you think you've got, old man? Destiny?
LOCKE Just don't tell me what I can't do.
KATE He's hurt. John? Can you hear me? Locke? John you okay?
KATE Locke?
LOCKE I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, Helen, I just got the wind knocked out of me is all.
KATE Helen?
LOCKE What?
KATE You called me Helen.
LOCKE Did I?
LOCKE Which way did that boar go?
KATE Michael's hurt. We have to get him back to camp.
LOCKE Yeah, you take him back to camp. I'm going to get that boar.
KATE What are you talking about?
LOCKE I'm fine. I can do this.
KATE John, you can't.
LOCKE Don't tell me what I can't do.
CHARLIE Did you get it?
HURLEY Dude, quit asking me that.
CHARLIE Sorry. You, you said you knew how to fish.
HURLEY Yeah, off the Santa Monica pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to try and poke one with a sharp stick.
CHARLIE Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, thanks.
HURLEY Anything to keep me far away from that fuselage and that freakin' redneck jerk. Damn it, crap, crap, son of a...
CHARLIE You let me have a go?
HURLEY Knock yourself out. Okay, here comes one. Put your weight into it. Now, you see it? Wait for it, wait... now. . Dude, you've got to try to pin it.
CHARLIE You see how close I was? No, you said I had to corner it.
CLAIRE Excuse me, your name's Sayid, right?
SAYID Yes.
CLAIRE I just found this. It's got your name on it. .
SAYID I thought I'd lost this. Thank you.
CLAIRE Sure.
ROSE His fingers swell.
JACK Sorry?
ROSE Bernard, my husband, his hands swell up whenever we fly.
JACK The altitude.
ROSE He started having me hold onto his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip. Always wore it around my neck for safe keeping. Just until we landed. You know, doctor, you don't have to keep your promise.
JACK Promise?
ROSE The one you gave me on the plane. The one you made me—to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom. I'm letting you off the hook.
JACK Well, you're not going to get rid of me that easily. Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone. You're suffering from Post Traumatic Shock.
ROSE Aren't we all?
JACK Yeah, I guess we are.
ROSE You have a nice way about you. A good soul, patient, caring. I suppose that's why you became a doctor.
JACK Thanks but I was just kind of born into it. Family business.
LOCKE I have never felt so alive. Getting to finally tell Randy off was... life changing. I mean it, now I'm free to do all those things I ever wanted to do. Things that I know I was destined to do, like we talked about Helen.
HELEN That's wonderful John. I'm happy for you, really.
LOCKE I haven't even told you the best part. You remember the authentic aboriginal Walkabout?
HELEN Sure. That's all you've talked about for weeks.
LOCKE Yeah, well, I'm going to do it. I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week. And I've, uh. I bought two tickets. Helen?
HELEN John, we've talked about this. I like you and I've enjoyed talking with you these past few months.
LOCKE 8 months.
HELEN I'm not allowed to meet customers.
LOCKE Customer? Is that what I am to you?
HELEN This isn't really normal. I mean, it isn't what I do. I don't know, maybe you should find a... I don't know... a therapist?
LOCKE I have a therapist.
HELEN John.
LOCKE I thought you understood Helen. You know me better than anyone.
HELEN John, if we talk any longer, I'm going to have to charge you for another hour. That's another 89.95 and...
LOCKE Look, I don't care about the money. I just...
HELEN I'm sorry John, I've got to go.
LOCKE Helen, Helen. Helen!
KATE Hey, hey wait a minute. Rest here for a minute.
MICHAEL I thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest. What are you doing?
KATE Trying to boost the transceiver signal. I'm going to climb this tree and attach the antenna.
MICHAEL You're going to climb that?
KATE Yeah. Don't worry. I've climbed a lot worse.
KATE Locke.
SAWYER Hey, uh...
CLAIRE Hey.
SAWYER These were, um. I found these the other day when I was... Aw hell, just, just take it. 
CLAIRE Thank you.
WALT What is that?
WALT Oh, I get it. It's like toothpaste.
SUN 
WALT Chia?
WALT Dad!
HURLEY So, like, what happened out there?
WALT Dad!
MICHAEL Hey, hey!
WALT Your leg's all messed up. Does it hurt?
MICHAEL It's okay. It's not as bad as it looks.
SAWYER The mighty huntress returns. What's for dinner, hon-
KATE Not now.
WALT So, it was like a boar fight?
MICHAEL Not too much of a fight. It was more like me getting gored.
WALT So, um, where's Mr. Locke?
BOONE I don't think that hunt went very well. The bald guy never came back.
SHANNON Wait, they didn't bring back any food at all?
BOONE Did you hear what I just said? Somebody might have died out there.
SHANNON Well, we're all going to die if somebody doesn't do something.
CHARLIE There you are. As promised, you and I will be dining of fresh catch of the day.
SHANNON Oh, my fish!
CHARLIE I hope you don't mind al fresco. It was no problem. You know what, that one actually gave me a hell of a tussle, but you have to get inside the mind of the fish, you know.
BOONE I don't believe you.
CHARLIE I got it in the shallows, I cornered it.
SHANNON What's the matter? Can't stand to see me fending for myself?
BOONE I'm sorry about this, seriously.
CHARLIE No, no, it's okay.
SHANNON What are you apologizing to him for?
BOONE For you. For using him—using this poor guy like you use everyone else.
SHANNON Oh, whatever.
BOONE Somewhere in that twisted little brain, you think this proves that you can take care of yourself.
SHANNON I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?
BOONE That's low Shannon, even for you.
SHANNON Oh, go rescue a baby bird or something.
JACK Rose, after the sun goes down, we're going to burn the fuselage. It's just something that we have to do. There's going to be a memorial service back at the camp for those—for those who didn't make it. For everyone to say goodbye.
ROSE I'd like to be there for that.
JACK Okay. . Maybe if you'd like to say something, you know, about your husband.
ROSE What?
JACK I'm just saying if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard.
ROSE Doctor, my husband is not dead.
JACK Rose, he was in the tail section of the plane. It broke off in mid-flight. I'm sorry, but everyone who was in the rear of the plane's gone.
ROSE They're probably thinking the same thing about us.
ROSE Doctor? You coming?
KATE I'm sorry. I guess I should've gotten a warranty.
SAYID I suppose I'll just try again. Of course, I have no welding iron, no rivets, scorched wiring. And it seems I must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what it is I'm actually doing. 
KATE Sayid, I'll try it again.
SAYID We'll try it again.
JACK Kate.
SAYID Excuse me. 
KATE Hey.
JACK You okay?
KATE Is this when you say "I told you so?"
JACK No, I'm not big on rubbing it in.
KATE Locke, um. Locke's gone. That thing, it was moving in his direction. There wasn't time. What's going on?
JACK The fuselage is ready to go. Some of the others decided, um … I guess there's going to be some words said over the fire...
KATE That's good.
JACK ... names read, I think.
KATE I just don't think they're ready to hear about some of the things that we've...
KATE Jack? Jack?
JACK Locke.
CLAIRE Judith Martha Wexler from Denton, TX, guess she was going to catch a connecting flight. Um, she wore corrective lenses and she was an organ donor, or at least would have been. Steve and Kirsten, I don't know their last name, but they were really in love and were going to be married. At least, wherever they are now, they're not alone.
CLAIRE ... video store receipt lists his overdue charges for Willie Wonka and A Little Princess. Looks like he hadn't traveled much... as far as I can tell from his passport.
KATE You seen Jack?
CLAIRE ... Wollstein, Harold, seat 23C.
CLAIRE That's all we have on Harold, his name on a boarding pass... I just wish there was something more... Goodbye, Harold.
MICHAEL Nice work.
LOCKE What?
CLAIRE Millicent Louise D'Agostino
MICHAEL The boar. Nice work, you know, killing it.
CLAIRE ...Teaneck, NJ.
MICHAEL Just thought I should say something. So that thing, the monster, whatever. She said it was headed right towards you. Did you see anything? Get any kind of look at it?
LOCKE No.
AGENT The Walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. It's trekking across vast stretches of desert, rafting bloody treacherous waters.
LOCKE Look, you've got no idea who you're talking to. I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. I probably know more than you on the subject.
AGENT In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone...
LOCKE Look, I booked this tour a month ago, you've already got my money. Now, I demand a place on that bus.
AGENT You misrepresented yourself...
LOCKE I never lied.
AGENT By omission, Mr. Locke. You neglected to tell us about your condition.
LOCKE My condition is not an issue. I've lived with it for 4 years. It's never kept me from doing anything.
AGENT Look, unfortunately it is an issue for our insurance company. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people.
LOCKE Hey, don't talk to me about fair.
AGENT I can get you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. That's the best I can do.
LOCKE No. I don't want to go back to Sydney. Look I've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus, right now, I can do this.
AGENT No, you can't.
LOCKE Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. . You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever. This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. (yelling) I'm supposed to do this, dammit. Don't tell me what I can't do. Don't tell me what I can't...
CLAIRE Millicent Louise D'Agostino. Teaneck, New Jersey.
