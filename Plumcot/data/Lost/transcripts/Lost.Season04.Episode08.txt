john_locke Thank you all for your patience. I know it's taken me a few days to... figure out our next move, but I didn't want to do anything until I knew more about our situation. You deserve to know everything that I do, so... no more secrets. As you all know, Miles here and three of his people came to the Island about a week ago. So I brought him up from the boathouse to share with us exactly why they're here.
miles_straume We're here for him.
hugo_reyes Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago.
james_ford Well, all right then. Problem solved. How soon do we turn him over?
john_locke We can't turn him over.
james_ford And why the hell not?
ben_linus Because once they have me, their orders are to kill everyone else on the Island.
claire_littleton Wait. So... what, he's one of us now? You're—you're gonna protect him? He tried to kill you, John.
hugo_reyes Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.
ben_linus It's Michael.
hugo_reyes What?
ben_linus My spy on the freighter is Michael.
james_ford I'm sorry. You mean the same guy that killed two women in cold blood to set this little bastard free? And then sold all of us out so he could get off the island? That Michael?
john_locke Yes, James. That Michael.
captain_gault The rules of desertion... still apply to everyone.
captain_gault Nobody leaves this ship without my say-so! I'm not beating these men to scare you! I beat them to save your lives! Do you remember what happened to the last two men who took off in this boat?
captain_gault You remember what happened to Minkowski? As soon as we get the engines fixed, we're back in the hunt. In the meantime, everybody just hold on. Johnson!
michael_dawson Yes, sir.
captain_gault Clean this mess up.
michael_dawson Yes, sir.
sayid_jarrah Hello, Michael.
michael_dawson Not now, man.
sayid_jarrah Yes. Right now.
sayid_jarrah Why are you on this boat?
michael_dawson I'm here to die.
james_ford Hey!
james_ford That's a nice meetin', John, but I thought there wasn't gonna be more secrets.
john_locke What are you talking about?
james_ford I'm talking about the 3 million bucks your buddy here asked for.
james_ford Well?
john_locke Yeah. Miles offered his loyalty in exchange for the money. But as I haven't seen a bank on the island, I didn't think it worth mentioning.
james_ford Somethin' funny?
miles_straume Linus will find a way to get it.
james_ford And how will he do that?
miles_straume He wants to survive. And considering a week ago you had a gun to his head, and tonight he's eating pound cake... I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.
claire_littleton It's fine.
karl_martin Okay, thanks.
alex_rousseau Bye.
claire_littleton Bye, guys.
alex_rousseau Bye.
ben_linus Alex?
ben_linus May I have a word with you?
danielle_rousseau I think we've heard enough from you for one night.
ben_linus I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to listen to a little more.
alex_rousseau It's okay. What do you want?
ben_linus This is a map to the Temple.
ben_linus It's a sanctuary. It may be the last safe place on this island.
karl_martin How come we don't know about this?
ben_linus Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it? The rest of our people are already there. If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.
karl_martin If it's safe, why don't we all go — Hurley, Claire, the baby?
ben_linus Because the Temple's not for them, Karl. It's only for us. These people that are coming — they know who I am, Alex. They're here to capture me. They'll kill anybody that gets in their way. If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter, they would use you to get to me. We don't have much time.
karl_martin Maybe he's right.
danielle_rousseau I agree. We should go.
alex_rousseau These people — you said they're dangerous. More dangerous than you?
ben_linus Yes. But your mother will protect you. Okay, now go.
sayid_jarrah Where is he?
CREW-MEMBER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Engine room.
sayid_jarrah You sure?
CREW-MEMBER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Yeah.
sayid_jarrah He's in the engine room.
michael_dawson I don't understand, It should be working.
jeff Gaskets are all corroded.
michael_dawson Can I help you?
sayid_jarrah The captain sent us down to help with the repairs.
michael_dawson Oh, thanks. We're okay. Hey, Jeff, man, you know what? We need a pressure valve. You mind grabbing one from the, uh, supply room?
jeff Not at all.
michael_dawson You shouldn't be here.
michael_dawson Hey! Uhh! Aah!
desmond_hume Hey Sayid, what are you doing?
sayid_jarrah Why are you here?
michael_dawson Listen, if they see me talking to you—
sayid_jarrah Then talk quickly!
michael_dawson You won't understand it!
sayid_jarrah I'll understand perfectly, Michael. You just start from the beginning and explain how you came to be on this boat.
michael_dawson I'm sorry
libby_smith I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, Mr. Dawson.
michael_dawson It's... what happened to me?
libby_smith You were in a car accident. It's a miracle you're alive.
michael_dawson How badly am I hurt?
libby_smith Shh. You just need to rest now.
libby_smith It's a cold night.
michael_dawson Uhh!
libby_smith I brought you some extra blankets.
michael_dawson Aah!
nurse Ah. Let's get some light in here. Now, I thought I heard someone shout, and something tells me it wasn't him. You okay? You're lucky to be alive. E.M.T. say they found you in a wrecked car with a note pinned to your chest. You didn't have any I.D. on you. Want to tell me your name? Yeah, I didn't think so. You want me to call Walt?
michael_dawson What?
nurse The note pinned to your chest. It was written to "Walt." You want me to call him?
michael_dawson No.
nurse Okay, then.
michael_dawson Hey, ma.
michael_dawson Can I... come in?
mrs_dawson MOTHER No. You know the answer to that.
michael_dawson I wanna see him.
mrs_dawson MOTHER No.
michael_dawson Just let me talk—
mrs_dawson MOTHER I don't know what you said to that boy, but whatever it was, he doesn't want to see you.
michael_dawson Please, ma. He's my son. I have a right—
mrs_dawson MOTHER I thought you were dead! They said your plane crashed in the middle of the ocean, but you show up here fine and dandy, only I can't tell anybody about you or Walt, can't call you by your real names. He barely talks to me, but he does wake up screaming in the middle of the night, and I'm the one that's got to tell him it's gonna be okay. So until you can explain to me where you were for over two months and what happened... you gave up your rights.
michael_dawson Will you, uh... will you tell him I love him?
mrs_dawson MOTHER Yeah.
gus What can I do for ya?
michael_dawson How much can I get for that?
gus Why is there Chinese writing all over it?
michael_dawson It's Korean, man — the guy who gave it to me.
gus You don't look like you speak Korean. I'll give you $300 for it.
michael_dawson I'm not looking for money.
gus What are you looking for?
michael_dawson I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.
michael_dawson Come on. Let's just get this done. Help me just get this done.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Excuse me, sir. You got the time?
michael_dawson No, man. No.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Come on, Michael.
tom_friendly How about for an old friend?
tom_friendly Manhattan, huh? We let you leave one island, you just go to another one.
michael_dawson Uhh!
tom_friendly Will you just relax? I just came here to—ooh!
michael_dawson Uhh!
tom_friendly Now are you ready to talk? Like adults?
michael_dawson Yeah.
tom_friendly Enough!
michael_dawson Do it. Go ahead, do it!
tom_friendly You'd like that, wouldn't you?
michael_dawson How do you find me?
tom_friendly We're the ones who sent you home, Michael. Did you honestly think we weren't gonna keep tabs?
michael_dawson What do you want?
tom_friendly Your help.
michael_dawson Why would I help the son of a bitch who kidnapped my son?
tom_friendly We gave him back to you in one piece, Mike, you're the one who lost him. You told him, didn't you? You couldn't carry the guilt of what you did to those two women all by yourself, so you shared it with a 10-year-old kid. Is that why you want to kill yourself, Michael? Because that's the way he looks at you now? Because he knows you're a murderer?
michael_dawson Go away!
tom_friendly I got some bad news for you, amigo. You can't kill yourself. The Island won't let you!
michael_dawson What'd you say?
tom_friendly No matter how bad you want to, no matter how many different ways you try, it won't happen.
tom_friendly Give it a shot if you don't believe me. You got more work to do, Mike. When you figure that out, I'm in the penthouse at the Hotel Earle.
female_anchor ANNOUNCER Let's give a warm Hollywood welcome to your host...
GAME#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 SHOW HOST ...our jump-ball category... literature. I hope you stayed awake during high school English. All right...
michael_dawson Ahh...
GAME#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 SHOW HOST ...Slaughterhouse-Five?
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 CONTESTANT Um, is it Kurt Vonnegut?
GAME#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 SHOW HOST Correct! And triple your puzzle points in the next round—can you give us the name of the book's protagonist?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 We interrupt this program for a news bulletin.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 ANCHOR The wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 has been found. This footage confirms the airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 ANCHOR At these tremendous depths, there is little hope of recovering any remains. Investigators are equally skeptical about the chances of retrieving Oceanic 815's black box. The real story behind what happened to this fateful airliner may have been lost along with the 324 passengers onboard. But even with this tragic discovery, the victims' families were hoping today...
tom_friendly I didn't expect you that fast.
tom_friendly Mm.
arturo Is this the guy who hit you with the champagne bottle?
tom_friendly Yeah, but I had it comin'.
tom_friendly Arturo, Michael and I have some business we have to attend to. Would you get some air?
arturo Of course.
arturo Ciao.
tom_friendly Help yourself to the chow.
tom_friendly Don't make it to the mainland too often—
tom_friendly —so when I do, I like to indulge myself.
michael_dawson So you people can just... come and go?
tom_friendly Some of us. You want a drink?
michael_dawson What I want is for you to tell me what my plane is doing at the bottom of the ocean.
tom_friendly That's not your plane. It's a phony. A man named Widmore put it down there, and he staged the whole wreck.
michael_dawson Staged? Why would he stage a—
tom_friendly Because he doesn't want anyone else finding where the real plane ended up... except for him.
michael_dawson I'm supposed to believe this?
tom_friendly Did the bullet bounce off your skull, or did the gun just jam on you?
michael_dawson Prove it.
tom_friendly Sorry?
michael_dawson Prove that this guy, Widmore, did what you say he did. Prove it.
tom_friendly That's the cemetery in Thailand where Widmore dug up the 300-odd corpses he needed. And the purchase order for the old 777 he bought through a shell company, and the shipping logs for the freighter he used to drop the whole mess down a trench deep enough to guarantee that no remains are ever gonna be identified. Do you have any idea what it would cost to bring those bodies up?
michael_dawson Whatchyou want from me, man?
tom_friendly In a few days, a freighter is porting in Fiji. It's Widmore's boat. We have reason to believe he's finally found the coordinates of the Island, and he's heading right for it. So congratulations, Michael. Your shore leave is over. You just got a job on that boat. Meet Kevin Johnson.
tom_friendly You're joining the crew in Fiji as a deckhand.
michael_dawson You want me to go undercover? Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?
tom_friendly Because if Widmore finds the Island, it's good night for everybody on it. He'll kill them all without thinking twice. You wanna redeem yourself for what you did? This is your only chance. You can save all their lives.
michael_dawson No. I can't. I can't go back to that island.
tom_friendly I didn't say you were going back to the Island. You're not going on that boat so you can swab decks, Michael.
tom_friendly You're going so you can kill everyone onboard.
george_minkowski Hey. You our engineer?
michael_dawson Nah. Just a deckhand.
george_minkowski Well, we're all equals on this boat... as long as you play decent hold'em. I'm George... Minkowski.
michael_dawson Kevin Johnson.
george_minkowski Ah, nice to meet you, Kevin. All right, well, why don't you go check in with Naomi over there? And, uh, I'll be seeing you. Welcome.
naomi_dorrit Okay. You're good to go. Thanks.
michael_dawson Uh... I'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.
naomi_dorrit Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure. So you're from the States, yeah?
michael_dawson New York.
naomi_dorrit Yeah, I could tell from the accent.
michael_dawson Manchester?
naomi_dorrit How'd you guess? You can head onboard. Oh, uh, one of these crates was delivered for you.
naomi_dorrit I'll have it delivered to your berth?
michael_dawson Yeah. Thanks.
naomi_dorrit Welcome aboard, Kevin.
miles_straume Your name isn't Kevin.
miles_straume Don't worry. Eighty percent of the people on this boat are lying about something. Orange?
michael_dawson No, thanks.
michael_dawson Yeah?
tom_friendly How was your trip?
tom_friendly I figure flying can't be too much fun for you.
michael_dawson What do you want?
tom_friendly You get your care package?
michael_dawson Yeah.
tom_friendly Wait a day or two until you're out in the open sea, then you're good to go.
naomi_dorrit You can stow your gear downstairs, all right? Welcome aboard, Keamy.
tom_friendly Oh, you met some of 'em now. Got some names and faces, and you're gettin' cold feet, huh?
michael_dawson Yeah, actually, I am.
tom_friendly Well, here are a few more names for ya—Sun, Sawyer, Jack, Claire, her baby. And the only way you're gonna save their lives is if you man up and get on that boat. Or maybe you wanna come back and explain to your kid how you let all of them die, too. It's game time. Are you in or out?
michael_dawson I'm in.
tom_friendly Good, then ditch your phone and go do your job.
naomi_dorrit Sorry, Frank, but I'm going first and that's all there is to it.
frank_lapidus No offense, but I was flying these things when you were still in grade school. If anybody's gotta go first, it should be me.
naomi_dorrit Yeah, I need you here to transport the science team, Frank.
frank_lapidus What the hell are you gonna be doing?
naomi_dorrit That's need-to-know. You don't.
frank_lapidus So much for the fairer sex, huh?
frank_lapidus Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.
michael_dawson Kevin Johnson. Deckhand.
frank_lapidus So what's your story, Kevin?
michael_dawson Sorry?
frank_lapidus How'd you end up on this tub?
michael_dawson Um... looking for a little adventure.
frank_lapidus Ah, adventure. Yeah. Well, how do you like this for adventure? You ever hear about Oceanic 815?
michael_dawson Yeah.
frank_lapidus What would you say if I told you the plane they found in that trench wasn't Oceanic 815?
michael_dawson Then what is it?
frank_lapidus You know those nuts that think the moon landing was faked? Well, this is like that... only real. That's why I signed up for this trip, because the owner of this boat believes me. Charles Widmore. He believes that 815 is still out there somewhere. (Whispering) I mean, can you imagine what would happen... if we found some of those people alive?
martin_keamy Pull!
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Whoo!
martin_keamy Pull!
martin_keamy Pull!
martin_keamy Another clip.
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Good job.
martin_keamy Pull!
martin_keamy Kill shot!
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Yeah!
michael_dawson Hey.
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Whoo!
michael_dawson What are you guys doing?
martin_keamy What's it look like we're doing? We're shooting things. Pull!
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Whoo.
michael_dawson I, uh... thought we were going on a rescue mission.
martin_keamy Uh... don't you have something to mop up?
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Yeah.
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 Come on. Let's go.
martin_keamy Pull!
martin_keamy Pull!
michael_dawson You can do this, man. You can do this. 7... 1... 7-7-6. Okay. Okay.
CASS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode08 ELLIOT ...but it's getting better...
libby_smith Don't do it, Michael.
michael_dawson I love you, Walt.
george_minkowski What, are you going Nicholson on us?
michael_dawson What?
george_minkowski You know, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, when he's bouncing that ball against the wall? Next thing you know, you're gonna go after your wife with an ax.
michael_dawson I'm not married, man.
george_minkowski Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you got a call.
michael_dawson A call?
george_minkowski Yeah. From the mainland. They patched it through to the radio room.
michael_dawson It's gotta be a mistake, man. Nobody even knows I'm here.
george_minkowski Well, you're the only Kevin Johnson onboard, so somebody knows you're here. Said he really needs to talk to you. His name's Walt.
george_minkowski Yeah, here you go.
michael_dawson Hey, uh ... it's kind of personal. Mind if I take this alone?
george_minkowski Take your time, Kev. You just push this yellow button (indicates a switch from "Channel A" to "Channel B") and, uh, turn this knob on the console .
michael_dawson Got it. Okay.
michael_dawson Walt?
ben_linus I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in New York.
ben_linus So I'm afraid you're stuck with me. Michael? Are you still there?
michael_dawson You put me on this boat, talked me into blowing it up, and when I push the damn button, a flag pops up.
ben_linus You actually activated the bomb?
michael_dawson It's not a bomb! It's a... it's a joke.
ben_linus There are people on your boat who are innocent. They have no idea that the man they work for is a monster, a killer without conscience or a greater purpose. I had to show you the difference between him and me. When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win, but I will not kill innocent people.
michael_dawson Ana Lucia and Libby... they were innocent.
ben_linus You killed them, Michael. No one asked you to... I don't blame you, Michael. We did have your boy. And what wouldn't a man do for his son?
michael_dawson What do you want... from me?
ben_linus I want you to compile a list of names... every person on your boat. When I call again, you'll give me that list. Then you will disable the radio room you're sitting in. When the crew is disoriented by their lack of communication, you'll take out the engines too. That way, the boat can never get to this island, and your friends will be safe. Will you do that for me, Michael?
michael_dawson Yeah.
ben_linus Then consider yourself one of the good guys.
sayid_jarrah So you're telling me... that you're working for Benjamin Linus?
michael_dawson Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
michael_dawson Hey! Aah!
desmond_hume Hey, Sayid.
michael_dawson Guys!
michael_dawson Hold it! Uhh! Let me go! What are you doing?!
sayid_jarrah Shut your mouth!
captain_gault What the hell is this?
sayid_jarrah This man is not who you think he is. He was a passenger on Oceanic Flight 8-1-5. I spent two months with him on the island before he betrayed us. This is the man who sabotaged your radio room. He destroyed the ship's engine, and his name isn't Kevin Johnson. It's Michael Dawson, and he's a traitor.
danielle_rousseau We stop here and drink. Two minutes, then we keep moving.
alex_rousseau What's wrong?
karl_martin Nothing.
alex_rousseau Karl.
karl_martin I don't know. I just have a bad feeling about this. What if your dad is... playing us?
alex_rousseau Look, I don't like taking orders from my dad any more than you do. But I know he doesn't want me to get hurt.
karl_martin Well, at least we've got something in common.
alex_rousseau I promise not to tell if you won't.
karl_martin Uhh!
danielle_rousseau Alex!
alex_rousseau Karl?
danielle_rousseau Alex!
alex_rousseau Karl! Karl, Karl! No!
danielle_rousseau Come on.
alex_rousseau No! No!
danielle_rousseau Come on! He's gone.
alex_rousseau Karl!
danielle_rousseau Alex!
alex_rousseau No! No, no, we have to get Karl. Karl!
danielle_rousseau He's gone.
alex_rousseau Karl!
danielle_rousseau He's gone! He's gone! Listen to me.
alex_rousseau No.
danielle_rousseau I need you to take my hand. On the count of three, we're going to run.
danielle_rousseau Can you do that with me? I love you. I love you very much, Alexandra.
danielle_rousseau Are you ready?
danielle_rousseau One...
danielle_rousseau Two...
danielle_rousseau Three!
alex_rousseau Wait! Wait! Don't! I'm Ben's daughter! I'm his daughter!
