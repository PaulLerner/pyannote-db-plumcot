HURLEY 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed and dead, 16, 23, 42...
KATE Hurley, you okay?
HURLEY Huh? Yeah, awesome. I just have to pee. Great idea, dude, go look into the burning death hole.
KATE What is it?
JACK It doesn't matter what it is. We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so we could be safe. That plan is not going to work. We'll never get everyone down in time.
KATE Water.
LOCKE It's shallow. It sounds like a puddle.
KATE 40 feet down?
LOCKE 50 tops. If we could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage -- rig up a harness...
JACK John, we're leaving now.
HURLEY Yes, good idea. Let's do that.
LOCKE We all went through a lot to get here, Jack.
JACK The ladder's broken. You going to lower 40 people down there one by one? They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do, so let's forget about the harnesses.
KATE Jack?
JACK What?
LOCKE Why don't we all just calm down here.
JACK Look, if you want to go exploring in the morning that's fine, but tonight we're done. I'm going to go get the dynamite that we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves. How about you pack it up, John?
LOCKE Sure, of course.
JACK Okay.
LOCKE Why don't you want to go down there, Jack?
EMT Female, late 20's, no ID, she coded twice on the way over here.
NURSE Where's the other one?
EMT Right behind us. They're on their way -- Fire Department had to use the jaws.
INTERN What do we got here?
NURSE Female, late 20s...
INTERN What the hell is that?
JACK Piece of the steering column. All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady. Page my father.
INTERN Already did.
JACK Tell me.
EMT Her tire blew, car jumped the divider, went head-on with an SUV.
NURSE BP's dropping.
JACK Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?
EMT Yes, alone.
JACK Where's the driver of the SUV?
EMT #2 Adam Rutherford, 57, chest trauma, no breath sounds.
JACK Tube Mr. Rutherford while I...
INTERN I can't intubate, you've got to.
NURSE Dr. Shephard, her BP's 80 over 60.
NURSE #2 Dr. Shephard, his breathing's deteriorating.
JACK Okay, need a syringe -- big one. You, hold pressure. 
NURSE 88 over 52, no radial pulse.
JACK I know. I know -- sac's flooded. Where's that...
NURSE Right here. Got it?
JACK Yep.
NURSE #2 Doctor, we're losing him.
NURSE BP stabilizing.
NURSE #2 Time of death 815am.
JACK Okay, get me a blood gas and a C-spine. Get her up to ICU and keep her immobilized.
SARAH I want to dance at my wedding.
INTERN Did you hear that?
NURSE Sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay. Just relax.
INTERN What did she say?
JACK She said she has to dance at her wedding.
CHARLIE Okay, no one is out there. No one is coming.
N.D. Survivor But the -- but the French woman said...
CHARLIE The French woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know. I mean, I mean, it was all bollocks. It's a ghost story. She set the fire herself. What?
SAYID Nothing.
SHANNON Has anyone seen Vincent -- the dog? Anyone seen him? Has anyone seen the dog?
REDSHIRT No.
SAYID Where are you going?
SHANNON I lost the damn dog.
HURLEY Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man?
LOCKE Why wouldn't I light the fuse?
HURLEY Ah, maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling "don't do that?"
LOCKE Well, you've got a point there. I guess I was just excited to get inside. I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went all the way out to the Black Rock -- and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch. And we did it so that we could get inside, Hugo.
JACK And to save everybody's lives.
LOCKE And to save everyone's lives.
JACK Or, maybe it was just our destiny, right, John?
LOCKE Maybe.
KATE Guys, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.
SHANNON Vincent!
SAYID This is not a good idea.
SHANNON I saw him 5 minutes ago. Besides, you're the one who said there isn't anyone out here.
SAYID I said we didn't see anyone. The dog will come back on his own. He always does.
SHANNON Watching that dog was the one thing anyone has ever asked me to do. If something happens to him...
SAYID When was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted.
SHANNON I can't tell that kid that I lost his dog because I was exhausted.
SAYID I'll circle around behind him.
SHANNON Okay.
SAYID Vincent!
SHANNON Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, where are you?! Sayid! Sayid!
SHANNON Walt?
SHANNON What are you doing here?
SAYID Shannon! What is it? What?
KATE Why do you want to get down there so bad?
LOCKE -ly. Why do I want to get down there so badly. Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?
KATE Why, because you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine?"
LOCKE Well, look at the bright side. The damage is done.
KATE The bright side?
LOCKE And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really. Then again, 5 hours ago I was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke. Did you see it, Kate? Then I guess we're both crazy. Wonder what Jack thinks he saw?
HURLEY You should go ahead, man -- don't want Locke making time with your girl. Joke, dude.
JACK I'm not really in the mood, Hurley.
HURLEY Really? Wow, usually you're, like, Mr. Haha. There you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure the Others are coming to, like, eat us all -- and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but you do get to sleep in every morning.
JACK Uh-huh. And the numbers?
HURLEY What?
JACK "The numbers are bad" -- that's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.
HURLEY Yeah, that's kind of a long story.
JACK I've got time.
HURLEY You'll think I'm crazy.
JACK Try me.
HURLEY Awhile ago I was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy, Leonard -- and all the time I knew him all he ever said were these numbers -- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 -- over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So, when I got out -- well, actually a couple of months after I got out -- I was buying a frozen burrito and I thought, hey, I should play the lottery. And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head so I played them. And I won 114 million dollars. That's when it started happening -- my grandpa died, my house caught on fire, the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor -- well, actually meteorite. Okay, so tonight I see the same freaking numbers on the hatch thing -- just written on the side -- and that's why I tried to stop it -- because that thing is cursed, man.
JACK You were in a psych ward?
HURLEY I'm not crazy.
JACK I'm not saying you are.
HURLEY So, what? That's it? That's all?
JACK What do you want me to say?
HURLEY How about you believe me, man?
JACK Hurley, they're numbers.
HURLEY What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
JACK Bedside manner.
HURLEY Yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude.
SARAH What happened to him?
JACK Just try to relax, okay?
SARAH The car that I hit -- the other driver was older.
JACK He died in the ER.
SARAH I can't feel anything.
JACK I know.
SARAH What's happened to me?
JACK You have a fracture-dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae -- your back is broken. Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and that has to be stopped. I'm going to perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible. But even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at "extremely unlikely".
SARAH Oh.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Dr. Shephard, may I have a word, please.
JACK So, what did I do wrong?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD You did something wrong?
JACK You're frowning.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD My face is always this way.
JACK Dad, hey, c'mon, let's hear it.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD You might want to try handing out some hope every once in awhile. Even if there's a 99 percent probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed, folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 percent chance that things are going to be okay.
JACK Her spine's crushed. I tell her that everything's going to be okay -- that's false hope, dad.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Maybe. Maybe, but it's still hope.
SHANNON I know what I saw! It was him! It was Walt!
SAYID Shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group.
SHANNON I heard whispers.
CLAIRE Where?
SHANNON Everywhere.
CHARLIE What -- what whispers? Who?
SHANNON I don't know -- Them.
SUN Do you think something happened to the raft?
SAYID Nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband, with Sawyer...
SHANNON Sayid, I know what I saw.
CHARLIE They're back.
JACK Uh, Locke found, uh, a hatch in the ground about a half a mile from here. We left to -- to blow it open so that we could hide inside -- so all of us could hide inside, in case... But that doesn't matter now because it's not going to work. There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
CHARLIE Jack, where's Dr. Arzt?
JACK Um, he didn't make it.
SHANNON Did you see them? Did you see the Others?
CHARLIE Hey, Shannon, there are no Others. We've already had this conversation.
SHANNON What the hell would you know about it -- just because you didn't see anything?!
CHARLIE There's no one out there.
SHANNON You don't know!
CHARLIE You're just making up rubbish!
JACK Hey! Everything's going to be okay. Let's just take it easy. We're going to be alright. We're going to stay here tonight, okay, together. We've still got 4 guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances. We're all going to be safe as long as we stay together. The sun comes up in 3 hours and we're all going to be here to see that happen. I promise. John, what are you doing?
LOCKE I'm getting some cable.
JACK What for?
LOCKE It's for the hatch. I'm going in.
JACK Do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John?
LOCKE I doubt it. In fact, you're right. The safest thing is to stay here -- wait for morning -- wait for these Others, to see if they ever show up -- wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help -- but me, I'm tired of waiting. 
KATE So, do you believe it?
JACK Believe what?
KATE That everything's going to be okay?
JACK Yeah, I do.
KATE Kind of unlike you -- the whole glass half-full thing.
JACK There's a glass?
KATE You did a good thing saying what you said -- taking care of everybody and just giving them something to count on. If you weren't here, Jack... I'm going to the hatch. I understand why you can't go. They need you here. I get it. I do. But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. And if he falls and breaks his neck... Live together, die alone, right?
JACK Right.
JACK Your fiance was seriously injured. It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours. I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.
KEVIN She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.
JACK When is it -- the wedding?
KEVIN It's 8 months.
JACK Well, I'm sure Sarah will have recovered by then.
KEVIN Recovered - um, what does that mean?
JACK There will be ongoing physical therapy, but if she works really hard...
KEVIN Well, well, will we be able to, you know, make love?
JACK You need to know that there's a chance Sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.
KEVIN Like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
SARAH Come here. Come here. I want to tell you a little secret. Come on. Closer. It's okay. I know I'm not going to be dancing anymore. I can still roll around at my wedding. And you're invited, okay.
JACK I'm going to fix you.
KATE I expected to find you half way down there by now.
LOCKE I was waiting for you.
KATE So, you want me to go down first?
LOCKE Well, you're lighter. I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy. The shaft might get narrower down there, too.
KATE You left out the part where you just want to see if I get eaten by something.
LOCKE Yeah, well, that too. Not too tight?
KATE Got it. -- Okay. Wait, what do I say if I need to stop?
LOCKE Stop.
KATE Hmm, okay. Let's go.
LOCKE Kate, are you alright?!
KATE Yeah, I dropped the light! Maybe we should... Well, okay then. 1, 2, 3, 4. Stop!
LOCKE What is it?!
KATE John, I think there's something down here!
LOCKE Kate, are you alright?!
LOCKE Kate! Kate! Kate!
HURLEY You're kidding, right? You're going back?
JACK Yeah.
HURLEY What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?
JACK I changed my mind.
JACK Kate! Locke!
JACK Ow, damn it.
DESMOND You alright, brother?
JACK I'm fine. I'm fine.
DESMOND Take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt? You haven't sprained it then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though.
JACK I wasn't trying to catch up.
DESMOND Aye, of course you weren't.
JACK What do you know about sprains, anyway?
DESMOND I was almost a doctor once.
JACK Small world.
DESMOND You a doctor then? So what's your excuse?
JACK Excuse?
DESMOND For running like the devil's chasing you. My excuse - I'm training.
JACK Training for what?
DESMOND For a race around the world. Impressive, I know. So your excuse better be good, brother.
JACK Just trying to work a few things out.
DESMOND Ah, a girl, right?
JACK A patient.
DESMOND Ah, but a girl patient. What's her name?
JACK Her name's Sarah.
DESMOND What'd you do to her then?
JACK Do to her?
DESMOND You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.
JACK I told her -- I made a promise I couldn't keep -- I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't. I failed.
DESMOND Well, right. Just one thing -- what if you did fix her?
JACK I didn't.
DESMOND But what if you did?
JACK You don't know what you're talking about, man.
DESMOND I don't? Why not?
JACK Because with her situation that would be a miracle, brother.
DESMOND Oh, and you don't believe in miracles? Right. Well then, I'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. (He may be saying "lift her up".)
JACK Lift it up?
DESMOND Your ankle. You've got to keep it elevated. It's been nice chatting.
JACK Jack.
DESMOND Jack, I'm Desmond. Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah?
LOCKE I wouldn't do that, Jack.
JACK Where is Kate? What the hell did you...
SARAH Am I alive?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.
SARAH You smell.
JACK Well, thank you.
SARAH Wow, you really smell.
JACK Yeah, I -- I went for a run.
SARAH You smell like you ran far.
JACK I showered. I mean, I guess I just didn't cool. I -- I wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a Tour de Stade.
SARAH What?
JACK It is when you run all the steps in every section of a stadium up and down.
SARAH Why would you do that?
JACK I'm -- I'm intense.
SARAH Did you finish?
JACK No, I hurt my ankle.
SARAH That sucks for you. Is Kevin here, my fiance?
JACK I didn't see him.
SARAH I'm, I'm sure he'll be back in awhile.
JACK Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
SARAH You going to tell me how it went?
JACK Sarah, the -- the damage to your back was extensive. I did everything I could but your spinal column... I just -- I couldn't repair it. You're going to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sarah.
SARAH You're yanking my chain, right?
JACK No.
SARAH Then how come I can wiggle my toes?
JACK Can you feel this?
SARAH Yes.
JACK Can you feel this?
SARAH Yes.
JACK This?
SARAH Yes.
JACK This?
SARAH Yes.
GUNMAN'S VOICE Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
JACK Where's Kate?
LOCKE Jack, it's okay.
GUNMAN'S VOICE I said drop it!
JACK Where's Kate?!
LOCKE She's fine, just put down the...
JACK I'm not putting anything...
GUNMAN'S VOICE Do you want him to die? Put it down.
JACK Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
LOCKE Jack, calm down.
GUNMAN's VOICE Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
JACK You.
