KID What's that?
LOCKE A game. It's my favorite game, actually. I used to play it with my brother. It's called Mouse Trap.
KID How do you play?
LOCKE Well, you start with all these parts off the board. And then, one by one, you build the trap - shoe, bucket, tub - piece by piece it all comes together. And then you wait 'til your opponent lands here on the old cheese wheel. And then if you set it up just right, you spring the trap. Go ahead, kiddo.
LOCKE May I help you, ma'am?
EMILY Yes, um, could you tell me where the footballs are?
LOCKE Aisle 8 for regulation, aisle 15 for Nerf.
EMILY Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.
BOONE You want my opinion?
LOCKE Boone, you've got to have some faith. All we've got to do is break the glass, and then we're in. The trebuchet delivers a half a ton of force.
BOONE Why do they call it a trebuchet? It looks like a catapult.
LOCKE It's called a trebuchet, Boone, because it's a trebuchet.
BOONE I don't get you, man. One minute you're quoting Nietzsche, now all of the sudden you're an engineer. I don't think I can spell trebuchet.
LOCKE There's a 't' on the end.
BOONE I'm serious, John. We've been coming out here everyday for 2 weeks—you never talk about yourself. Everybody's got a story.
LOCKE My story would bore you.
LOCKE 3, 2, 1.
LOCKE This was supposed to work. This was supposed to work!
BOONE John. Your leg, man.
BOONE Are you okay?
LOCKE Yeah, I'm fine.
BOONE The trebuchet—why didn't it work?
LOCKE It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough.
BOONE I don't think that glass is going to break, man. Whatever it's made out of...
LOCKE Everything breaks if you apply the right force.
BOONE So, we're just going to build another one of your inventions, hope it works this time.
LOCKE That's right.
BOONE What if it doesn't?
LOCKE Then the Island will tell us what to do.
BOONE What's that?
LOCKE I should get back there -- salvage those pieces.
BOONE Your leg okay?
LOCKE It's fine.
MAN Hi John.
MAN You alright, John?
LOCKE Hey, hey, hey. Why are you following me?
EMILY I'm sorry.
LOCKE Who are you?
EMILY I'm your mother.
LOCKE Look, miss, I don't know why you think I'm your son, or how you found me, but...
EMILY You're adopted, aren't you?
LOCKE No. No, I was raised in a foster home. Well, several foster homes, actually. Look, I don't mean to be rude -- what do you want from me?
EMILY I want to tell you that you're special, very special. You're part of a design. You do realize that, don't you? That our meeting, me finding you, this is a sign of things to come. Great things.
LOCKE My father, is he still alive?
EMILY Still alive? Oh, John, don't you understand? You don't have a father. You were immaculately conceived.
SAWYER Which one?
SUN That one.
SAWYER You're sure? Because this is the one I've been using and nothing's happening.
SUN I'm sorry it's not helping.
KATE What's not helping?
SAWYER Nothing. Thanks, anyway. Nice garden. 
KATE What was that all about?
SUN He has headaches.
KATE Doesn't he have, like, a truckload of aspirin stashed away somewhere?
SUN He says aspirin didn't help.
KATE Can I ask you a question? Say you're having bad headaches everyday...
JACK You okay?
KATE Yeah, fine.
JACK So, who are we talking about then, Kate?
KATE Sawyer.
JACK Uh-huh.
KATE I just think there might be something really wrong with him.
JACK And what does he think?
KATE He says he's fine, but...
JACK Then he's fine.
KATE Yeah, well, he could be playing it down. There could be some...
JACK Look, Kate, I'd like nothing more than to check the guy out and make sure he's okay. But we both know all I'm going to get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner. And if I'm real lucky, a brand new nickname. I'm just over it.
LOCKE You're late.
BOONE Late for what?
LOCKE Late for work.
BOONE I think I'm done working, John.
LOCKE I'm sorry, what?
BOONE It's useless. You can't open that thing up. You say you can but you can't.
LOCKE No, don't tell me what I can't do.
BOONE Don't you get it? It's a dead end. You're not getting in.
LOCKE That's impossible. We didn't find this by accident. We're supposed to...
BOONE Oh, we're supposed to. We're supposed to find this, right? We're supposed to open it, right? Then tell me something, John, if we're supposed to open it, then why the hell haven't we opened it yet?
LOCKE The Island will send us a sign.
BOONE The Island will send us a sign.
LOCKE All that's happening now is our faith is being tested - our commitment! But we will open it! The Island will show us how!
BOONE What kind of sign will the Island send us? Huh, John?
LOCKE Did you see that? Boone?
BOONE Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
LOCKE No, no, no, please.
BOONE Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
LOCKE Don't take it back.
LOCKE Boone, wake up.
BOONE Huh. What time is it?
LOCKE It's morning, c'mon.
BOONE Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up. What is going on?
LOCKE C'mon, let's go.
FRAINEY Emily Annabeth Locke in 10,000 words or less.
LOCKE So, she's my mother.
FRAINEY I lifted some hairs from her car and matched them with your DNA samples. It's 99% certain. She was institutionalized - a few times.
LOCKE What for?
FRAINEY Nothing criminal or violent. It's a type of schizophrenia. Apparently, if she stays on her meds, she's okay.
LOCKE What about my father?
FRAINEY Here's the thing -- your mother sought you out, so she's fair game. But this guy—maybe he doesn't even know you exist. I've done this enough times to know this stuff isn't meant to be, even though it may feel that way. But this probably won't have a happy ending. So, do you want it, or not?
LOCKE I want it.
EDDIE Your name is?
LOCKE John, John Locke. I'm Anthony Cooper's son.
EDDIE Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.
LOCKE Tell him I don't want anything. My mother is Emily Locke. Please.
EDDIE Just a minute. Yeah, Mr. Cooper, I've got John Locke here -- says he's your son. Yes, sir. Well, you can go on in, sir.
COOPER Well, this is -- awkward.
LOCKE Thank you for seeing me, sir. I'm, uh, John.
COOPER Something tells me I'm going to want a drink for this. You want a drink?
LOCKE Um, yeah, alright, great.
COOPER Scotch okay?
LOCKE Yeah, that's, um, thanks.
COOPER So who found who?
LOCKE I'm sorry, sir?
COOPER Emily, your mother, did she find you or did you find her?
LOCKE She found me.
COOPER How did she look?
LOCKE Alright, I guess.
COOPER Did she say anything about me?
LOCKE She said that I didn't have a father -- that I was immaculately conceived.
COOPER Really? Well, I guess that makes me god, huh? I didn't even know you existed until a year after you were born. She told me she wasn't even going to have the baby, you, at all. Then she drops off the face of the planet. When she turns up again, she's asking for money, telling me she put you up for adoption. You going to drink that, or what? You have a family of your own?
LOCKE No, sir.
COOPER Me neither. I tried it a couple of times, didn't take. Do you hunt?
LOCKE No, no.
COOPER You're not one of those animal rights nut jobs, are you?
LOCKE No. No, sir.
COOPER What are you doing this Sunday?
LOCKE Nothin'.
COOPER You want to go hunting?
LOCKE Um, well, I'd like that. Yeah, I'd like that very much.
LOCKE I had a dream last night. I asked for a sign and then I saw a plane crash, a Beechcraft right out there. It was a dream, but it was the most real thing I've ever experienced. I know where to go now.
BOONE Go for what?
LOCKE To find what we need to open this bastard up.
BOONE Have you been using that wacky paste stuff that made me see my sister get eaten?
LOCKE No, no.
BOONE Because, John, I've got to tell you -- signs and dreams and...
LOCKE Who's Theresa?
BOONE What?
LOCKE Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. You were saying that in the dream.
BOONE How would you know about that?
LOCKE I don't know, Boone, but we're supposed to go to this place. We're supposed to find that plane. Will you come with me?
JACK I was going to ask you how this was going, but it's coming together fast.
MICHAEL The fire wasn't a total loss. We learned a few things from building the first one which is saving us from trial and error. Now it's just trial.
JIN 빨리 묶어서 마무리 하자고요! 고쳐야 돼.
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
JIN 어두워지기 전에!
MICHAEL Yeah, man, I know, now, now, now.
JACK You picking up on a little Korean there, Michael?
MICHAEL Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know how to say faster and idiot.
JACK I hear you're having trouble with your head.
SAWYER What, now she got you making house calls?
JACK You're sensitive to the light, too, huh?
SAWYER You know what? I'm sensitive to you...
JACK Alright, we'll see you.
SAWYER Doc? Sensitivity to the light -- that bad?
JACK Depends.
SAWYER On what?
JACK On what's causing your headaches.
SAWYER It's not like it's a tumor, or something.
JACK What makes you think it's a tumor?
SAWYER I don't.
JACK Great. Okay, then.
SAWYER My uncle. He died of a brain tumor.
JACK Yeah?
SAWYER That run in a family? Tumors?
JACK What type of tumor was it?
SAWYER The type that kills you.
JACK Do you smell anything funny? Brain tumors bring on phantom smells, maybe like something burning.
SAWYER Just headaches.
JACK Well, I'm sure you're fine then. Look, if this is worrying you, there's a couple of tests that I could do.
SAWYER Sorry, Doc, sounds fun, but my insurance ran out.
JACK Insurance ran out. That -- that's a good one.
BOONE I could have mentioned her name out by the hatch one day.
LOCKE Who?
BOONE Theresa. Maybe I was talking to myself.
LOCKE Maybe, but you didn't.
BOONE So, in this dream you saw a plane crash, right?
LOCKE Yeah.
BOONE Okay, the fact that we were all just in a plane crash, you didn't think for one second-
BOONE John, you okay?
LOCKE I'm fine! 
BOONE What is wrong with your leg?
LOCKE I'm fine.
BOONE What?
BOONE Someone from camp hiked all the way out here?
LOCKE Nope.
BOONE Where do you think it came from?
LOCKE Him.
LOCKE Mornin', Eddie.
EDDIE Mornin', Mr. Locke. You gentlemen going to get some birds again?
LOCKE I sure hope so.
LOCKE Anthony?
COOPER You weren't supposed to be here 'til 12.
LOCKE I thought you said 11. What is this?
COOPER It's a dialysis machine. My kidney's failing. Damn doctors say I need a transplant.
LOCKE When?
COOPER Tomorrow if it were up to me. I'm on the donor list, but I'm an old man and it's a long list.
LOCKE How, how long...
COOPER John, the dialysis will be fine for a while. I didn't tell you for this exact reason. I'm not going to let this spoil what's going to be a fantastic day, and neither should you. So, I'll get done here and we'll have a nice lunch and go shoot some birds.
BOONE He's a priest. How long do you think he's been dead?
LOCKE Normally clothing would completely decompose within 2 years, but this is high quality polyester, could be 2 years, could be 10. Gold teeth, obviously well off.
BOONE What kind of money is that?
LOCKE Nigerian naira.
BOONE What is a Nigerian priest doing on an Island in the South Pacific?
LOCKE I'm not so sure he's a priest.
SAWYER You want to keep it down?!
KATE That's it, get up.
SAWYER What?
KATE Get up. You're going to Jack.
SAWYER Do I get a lollipop?
JACK When did the headaches start?
SAWYER A few days ago, a week maybe. Do you have to be here?
JACK Do you have them when you wake up in the morning?
SAWYER Usually they hit me in the middle of the day. What the hell are you doing with that thing?
JACK Checking to see how your pupils respond to changing stimuli.
SAWYER What's that -- that nod?
KATE Would you just let him do his thing?
SAWYER I'm letting him, but I want to know what the hell he thinks I-
JACK I think you should just shut up and relax.
SAWYER What the hell are you doing?
JACK Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
SAWYER What? No.
JACK Taken pills for malaria?
SAWYER Nope.
JACK Have you ever had sex with a prostitute?
SAWYER What the hell has that got to do with anything?
JACK Is that a yes?
SAWYER Yes.
JACK Have you ever contracted a sexually transmitted disease? I'm going to take that as another yes. When was the last outbreak?
SAWYER Go to hell, Doc. 
KATE I know he deserved it, but...
JACK He needs glasses.
BOONE What's going on, John?
LOCKE Nothing.
BOONE You can barely walk, man.
LOCKE It's the wound from the shrapnel.
BOONE That's your right leg, John. What's wrong with your left?
LOCKE I'm fine, now stop asking me.
BOONE That's it. Let's go back.
LOCKE I'm fine.
BOONE No, you're not! Let me get you back to Jack.
LOCKE Jack wouldn't know the first thing about what's wrong with me.
BOONE John, we've got to...
LOCKE No, no.
BOONE What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?
LOCKE I was in a wheelchair.
BOONE What?
LOCKE Paralyzed for 4 years. The plane, our plane, I was in that chair when we took off. But not after we crashed.
BOONE Why were you in a wheelchair?
LOCKE It doesn't matter anymore. But, but, this Island, it changed me. It made me whole. Now it's trying to take it back and I don't know why. But it wants me to follow what I saw.
BOONE What?
LOCKE I know it sounds crazy. 4 weeks ago I wouldn't have believed it myself. But you and I are here for a reason. There's something that we were meant to find, something that's going to help us get into the hatch. I know it. But we've got to keep going.
BOONE Okay. Can you move your legs?
LOCKE Just help me up, son.
COOPER These doves fly a lot faster than you think. So you've got to really lead them. If you have to drop it in high cover...
LOCKE Got him.
COOPER Yeah, you did. Good shot, son. John, your mother, she may be a little crazy, but at least she brought us together. Thank god it happened now, while we still have time. Let's find your bird.
BOONE She was my nanny -- Theresa. She was my nanny. My mother wasn't around much. I needed someone to take it out on. My bedroom was at the top of this huge flight of stairs, and I would sit in bed all day calling her on the intercom. One day she took a bad step, broke her neck. I was six.
BOONE Listen, what the hell is so funny?
LOCKE Look.
BOONE Is that the plane you saw?
LOCKE As best I can tell.
BOONE You really saw it?
LOCKE Yeah, I really saw it.
BOONE How long do you think it's been there?
LOCKE Doesn't matter. What's important is that we found it. What's important is what's inside it.
BOONE What is inside of it, John?
LOCKE You're going to have to climb up there for us and find out.
COOPER You can still change your mind.
LOCKE Nah. They already shaved my back.
COOPER I'm so thankful for you, John.
LOCKE This was meant to be.
COOPER See you on the other side, son.
SAWYER If you're looking for a stool sample, you can forget it.
JACK You've been reading a lot since we came to the Island.
SAWYER Okay, so what?
JACK You, uh, you've got, uh, you've got hyperopia.
SAWYER Hyperopia? That's, uh, what is that?
JACK You're far-sighted.
SAWYER Far-sighted?
JACK Yeah. It can develop later in life, especially when you add a new strain to the eyes like with reading.
SAWYER Blurry.
JACK Better or worse?
SAWYER Worse.
SAWYER Uh-uh, no way.
JACK Sawyer, it's not a fashion show.
SAWYER Har, har, very funny.
HURLEY Dude, it looks like someone steam rolled Harry Potter.
SAWYER You love this, don't you?
JACK You're welcome.
LOCKE Hang on.
LOCKE Boone?! Boone?!
BOONE I'm fine!
LOCKE Boone, what do you see?! Boone?!
BOONE Want to know what's in your damn plane, Locke?!
BOONE Here's your sign!
BOONE They're drug smugglers, Locke. Heroin, that's all that's in here!
LOCKE I don't understand. I don't understand.
LOCKE Boone, Boone, get out!
BOONE Hello. Hello. Anybody out there? Mayday, mayday.
LOCKE Boone, there's no time! Get out now!
RADIO VOICE Is someone there?
BOONE Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?
RADIO VOICE Repeat your transmission, please.
BOONE Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!
LOCKE Boone, get out!
RADIO VOICE We're the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.
LOCKE Get out now!
KATE So, did you know before or after you asked him about his latest outbreak?
JACK Well, I'd answer that, Kate, but, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
KATE Of course. Thank you for helping him. I know it was probably the last thing you wanted to do.
JACK I didn't do it for him.
LOCKE Jack, help!
JACK No, no, no. Put him down up here. Alright, alright, that's it, easy. What happened?
LOCKE There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff out near the place we were hunting.
JACK Okay, I'm going to need some water, shirts, towels, anything that I can use to staunch the bleeding. Kate, now, please!
JACK John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke?! Locke?! Locke?!
NURSE I think what you did was so kind.
LOCKE Where's my father?
NURSE Who?
LOCKE We had the transplant together.
NURSE I didn't know he was your father.
LOCKE We don't have the same last name. Where is he?
NURSE Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon. He went back home. He's under private care.
LOCKE But, that doesn't make any... Why? Did he leave me a message?
NURSE No, not that I know of. You just relax, Mr. Locke. I'm going to get you some juice.
EMILY It was his idea. I'm sorry, John.
LOCKE What are you doing here?
EMILY I needed some money. He's always been good that way. Your father's always been generous.
LOCKE You told me I didn't have a father.
EMILY Well, he said that was the only way you would give it to him. It had to be your idea. He told me where to find you. He, he asked me to go see you. I wanted to see you.
LOCKE This can't be happening. This, this is a misunderstanding. This can't-this can't happen to me. He wouldn't do this to me. He wouldn't do this to me!
LOCKE Eddie, Eddie open the gate.
EDDIE Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests.
LOCKE I'm not a guest.
EDDIE I'm sorry, John.
LOCKE Eddie, open the gate.
EDDIE I'm sorry, I'm going to need you to move your car.
LOCKE I know you're watching me. You can't do this.
EDDIE John, please. Move your car.
LOCKE I've done everything you wanted me to do, so why did you do this to me?!
