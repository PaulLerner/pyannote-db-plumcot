david_reyes You got that thing running yet, buddy?
young_hurley HURLEY Naw, but I got your tools all set.
david_reyes Let's see if we can get this thing started, okay?
young_hurley HURLEY I thought we needed a new carburetor?
david_reyes Well, maybe we don't. Come on, slide behind the wheel. Let's fire this up.
david_reyes What's the matter? Go ahead.
young_hurley HURLEY It's stupid. Without a new carburetor it's not going to work.
david_reyes Having hope is never stupid. You've got to believe good things will happen and then they will. You understand what I'm saying? In this world, son, you've got to make your own luck. Alright, come on.
young_hurley HURLEY Well, what do you want to fix today?
david_reyes We're going to have to put that on hold for a little while because, um, I've got to go to Vegas. You know, I've got some work out there.
young_hurley HURLEY What about the road trip?
david_reyes The Grand Canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. Hey, I've got something for you.
young_hurley HURLEY Um, I'm not supposed to, mom says.
david_reyes Live a little, Hugo. It's just a candy bar. Alright, I'll be back before you know it. Hold down the fort? You're my man? Alright.
young_hurley So then, the Others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which I did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to Eko -- they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then, I've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby.
charlie_pace Bloody hell.
young_hurley Dude, you okay?
charlie_pace Peachy.
young_hurley Really? Because you've kind of been moping...
charlie_pace Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley. Okay?
young_hurley You can tell me anything.
charlie_pace Desmond told me I was going to die. He told me has these flashes -- visions, whatever -- and in them I always die. So this is the part where you tell me it is ridiculous, don't be daft, he's a nutter.
young_hurley I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault.
charlie_pace Your fault?
young_hurley I'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude.
charlie_pace Vincent? Is that an arm?
young_hurley Here, Vincent. Come here. I think we need to get that.
charlie_pace Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest.
young_hurley Okay, if I'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody.
young_hurley Vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent.
young_hurley Awesome.
tricia_tanaka It's everyone's fantasy -- winning the lottery -- untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes, winner of a record 140 million dollars, outside Mr. Clucks Chicken in Diamond Bar which will be having its grand re-opening tomorrow. So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is why did you buy Mr. Clucks?
young_hurley Uh, I like chicken.
tricia_tanaka Um, also with us is Hugo's former boss, and now employee, Randy Nation. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes? Um, okay, so, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak?
young_hurley Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend, Starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
tricia_tanaka Cut! What the hell was that?! It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes, do you know what that is?
young_hurley Yeah. Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.
tricia_tanaka Um, do you mind if we go inside and shoot some B-roll?
young_hurley Oh, I don't know.
randy Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
tricia_tanaka Okay, let's go. Ugh, god I hate this. I always get the stupid stories...
young_hurley Hey, you sure it's okay?
randy Yeah, relax.
young_hurley The safety guards are on the fryers?
randy Those fryers are stone cold, alright? We don't even start cooking until tomorrow.
young_hurley Do you hear something?
tricia_tanaka And then pan through the...
paulo Well, we are out of DHARMA Oat Bars.
nikki_fernandez Already?
paulo Yep.
nikki_fernandez Did you check behind the powdered milk?
paulo Yes, it's not there.
sunhwa_kwon Will you pass me the box of cereal? Will you pass me the box of cereal?
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 말을 하는지 모르겠어.
sunhwa_kwon From now on I will only speak to you in English. It's how you will learn.
jinsoo_kwon 아, 왜 이래.
sunhwa_kwon It will be hard at first.
jinsoo_kwon 싫다니까?
young_hurley Hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey!!
claire_littleton Hurley, what is it?
paulo Is it the Others?
claire_littleton Hurley, are you okay?
paulo What's going on man?
young_hurley Car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
nikki_fernandez You found a car?
young_hurley And we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on.
paulo Why do we need to start a car?
young_hurley Because it'll be fun. We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it. Especially you, dude. So who's with me?!!
paulo Well, I've got to cut some bananas. Sorry.
charlie_pace I don't think so, Hurley.
young_hurley Come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming?!
young_hurley Thanks, dude. You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? Come on.
james_ford Are we there yet?
kate_austen If we are where I think we are then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about 5 minutes.
james_ford Try to contain your excitement, Freckles.
kate_austen Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.
james_ford Maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke-- Ow, ow, ow.
kate_austen What happened?
james_ford I stepped on something. Son-of-a-bitch!
kate_austen Looks like a dart.
james_ford How the hell did it get out here?
kate_austen Alright, just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm going to pull it out. On the count of 3. Ready? 1 -- .
james_ford Ow!!! I thought you said "3"?
kate_austen Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought I would spare you. You know, all you have to do is say sorry. You could start again -- give each other a clean slate.
james_ford Slate. Like on Little House?
kate_austen What?
james_ford Little House on the Prairie? Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school.
kate_austen You call it Little House?
james_ford I had mono when I was a kid -- missed 2 months of school -- we only got one channel in my trailer.
kate_austen What are we even talking about?
james_ford We ain't talking about nothing.
kate_austen James?
james_ford And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
kate_austen So that's how it's going to be? Welcome home, Sawyer.
james_ford Welcome home, Kate.
carmen_reyes Hugo! Hugo, is that you? Oh my god, what happened?
young_hurley Tricia Tanaka is dead.
carmen_reyes What?
young_hurley Mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone.
carmen_reyes That's crazy.
young_hurley It's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. Ow!!
carmen_reyes It was an accident.
young_hurley It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to Australia.
carmen_reyes Again with Australia.
young_hurley That's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me.
carmen_reyes Hugo, Hugo wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed.
young_hurley You can?
carmen_reyes Yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something.
david_reyes Hey, Hugo!
carmen_reyes After 17 years your father has returned.
david_reyes Hey, your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. Just kidding.
young_hurley Poor, Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude.
jinsoo_kwon Hurley! 이것 봐. In, In.
young_hurley Totally. Let's check it out.
young_hurley Dude, Roger was on a beer run.
jinsoo_kwon 시체 꺼내자.
young_hurley I suck at charades. You want to what?
jinsoo_kwon 아냐, 아냐.
young_hurley Oh, you want to take Roger out? And turn it over. I understand!
young_hurley Okay, on 3. 1-2-3.
young_hurley We'll get that later.
charlie_pace So, when's it going to happen?
desmond_hume When's what going to happen?
charlie_pace Don't play stupid with me, brother.
desmond_hume I was drunk. Now if I said anything...
charlie_pace I have a right to know when I'm going to die.
desmond_hume It doesn't work like that.
charlie_pace What doesn't work like that?
james_ford Hey, Oliver Twist, where the hell's my stuff?
charlie_pace What stuff?
james_ford Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
desmond_hume Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
james_ford You drank it?!
desmond_hume Well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us.
charlie_pace Yeah, there was.
james_ford You, the Munchkin, and who else?
jinsoo_kwon 이렇게, 응? 이렇게.
young_hurley Oh, I got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty.
jinsoo_kwon Crafty?
young_hurley Yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... crafts. Nevermind.
james_ford Hey, where the hell's my stuff? What are you all doing?
young_hurley Dude! You're alive!! You're alive.
james_ford Yeah, yeah, Snuffy. Good to see you, too. I'll be damned, you all found yourselves a hippy car.
young_hurley Pretty cool, huh?
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer.
james_ford Jin-bo. How are you going?
jinsoo_kwon Good see you.
james_ford Well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics.
young_hurley What about Jack and Kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
james_ford Kate's with me, but the Doc -- they've still got him.
young_hurley Okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
james_ford Well, what a relief.
young_hurley Naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign.
james_ford Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.
young_hurley Uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
james_ford Now why would I do that?
young_hurley Because there's beer.
sayid_jarrah Why did he say "don't come back?"
kate_austen He sacrificed himself so we could escape. He probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
sayid_jarrah Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt.
kate_austen Yep. They gave Michael a boat. He took off and never looked back.
sayid_jarrah Did you see any other boats?
kate_austen No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
john_locke So they can leave the island?
kate_austen I don't know, John.
sayid_jarrah This zoo where they held you, is that where they live?
kate_austen We escaped with one of them -- a kid named Karl -- he says that they live on this island. He could have taken us there but Sawyer let him go.
sayid_jarrah Why?
kate_austen You're going to have to ask Sawyer.
sayid_jarrah Kate, where are you going?
kate_austen I don't care what Jack said. They've got him and we've got to get him back. I owe him that. I'm going to get help.
john_locke Help from who?
david_reyes Now, that's a hell of a Jesus.
carmen_reyes Yes, Hugo's such a good son. He knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
david_reyes Ah, that smells like great lasagna.
carmen_reyes The Tranhs made it themselves. Hugo found them in Bennigans. Now they are our butlers.
david_reyes Something wrong, Hugo?
carmen_reyes Your father asked you a question, Hugo.
young_hurley My father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
david_reyes I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
young_hurley What?!
carmen_reyes All those numbers and curses. Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought you needed a manly influence, a father, to get you stop this nonsense.
young_hurley I'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
david_reyes Well, now that hurts.
young_hurley Well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh? Your services will no longer be needed. Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse.
carmen_reyes Hugo, what are you doing?
young_hurley Getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and I'm starting with him.
carmen_reyes No, Hugo. Your father is staying with us.
young_hurley He's staying with us? Where?
carmen_reyes It's been 17 years, Hugo.
young_hurley What's been 17 years?
carmen_reyes I have needs.
young_hurley No! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
carmen_reyes No you don't.
young_hurley Yeah, I do.
carmen_reyes Why don't you go show your father what you have in the garage? Hugo?
david_reyes I can't believe it. You saved it. You saved it.
james_ford Me first, now, come on.
james_ford What the hell is up with all this recycling?
young_hurley You got me, dude.
james_ford Looks like those DHARMA freaks were building some sort of dirt road. Woo, now we're talking.
jinsoo_kwon 이거 고치려면 시간 많이 걸리겠는데?
young_hurley Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?
james_ford Son-of-a -- what's a head doing back here?
young_hurley Oh, that's just Roger. I'm going to start the car now.
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 아직 하지 마. 엔진부터 먼저 확인해야지.
young_hurley Dude, even if you were speaking English, I wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work.
young_hurley I have hope. This will work.
young_hurley Damn it.
james_ford Hoh, it's flat and it stinks.
young_hurley Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
james_ford Chill out; let the man do his thing.
young_hurley Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before Rocky III, maybe even II. It's probably poison by now.
james_ford Skeletor seems to like it. Bottoms up.
young_hurley That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's Roger Workman.
james_ford It's Work Man, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a DHARMA janitor.
young_hurley Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
jinsoo_kwon 배터리가 완전히 죽었어. 아무래도...
young_hurley Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?
jinsoo_kwon No. No fix.
young_hurley But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running.
james_ford Leave the man alone. He's right, "no fix." Take a look at that mess -- no way it's going to get running. How thick are you?
young_hurley What's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work?
james_ford I don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you?
young_hurley Because we could all use a little hope.
james_ford If it's hope you're looking for ese, you're on the wrong damn island. There sure as hell ain't no hope here.
david_reyes Rise and shine; hit the deck. We're burning daylight; let's go. What's with the earphones?
young_hurley It's for the noise.
david_reyes Well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
young_hurley That is disgusting.
david_reyes Come on, we're going on an adventure. Let's go.
young_hurley I'm not going anywhere with you.
david_reyes Come on, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. I won't stop you, okay?
young_hurley What "one thing?"
david_reyes We're going to break the curse.
young_hurley This is stupid.
david_reyes Just give it a chance, man.
lynn_karnoff Cut the deck please. You've recently come into a great deal of money.
young_hurley You could have seen that on the news.
lynn_karnoff But it hasn't brought you happiness. No, it's brought you great misfortune.
david_reyes She didn't see that on the news.
lynn_karnoff I'm seeing numbers.
young_hurley What numbers?
lynn_karnoff 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers. Great tragedy. I'm sorry.
young_hurley Why? What is it?
lynn_karnoff Death surrounds you; and more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed. Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes.
young_hurley My clothes?
lynn_karnoff A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you. And it must be exorcised.
young_hurley Did my dad put you up to this?
lynn_karnoff What?
david_reyes Hugo, please.
young_hurley I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
lynn_karnoff The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. How dare you!
young_hurley 10,000.
lynn_karnoff Your dad put me up to it.
david_reyes I was just trying to help.
young_hurley Help who?
james_ford Beer.
jinsoo_kwon Beer.
james_ford Bingo. Beautiful. Car.
jinsoo_kwon Car.
james_ford International House of Pancakes. What are you doing over there?
young_hurley I'm praying.
james_ford Praying for what?
young_hurley Help.
james_ford Well, hell, I've got you a little help right here.
young_hurley Dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on.
charlie_pace Not moping -- thinking.
young_hurley Uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found? We're getting it running.
charlie_pace What's the point? Ow! What did you do that for?
young_hurley Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both. Now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die.
charlie_pace That's supposed to convince me to come with you?
young_hurley It is. Because if you don't die, then we win.
charlie_pace Win?
young_hurley Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and I could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man." Let's make our own luck. What do you say?
james_ford I'm sorry.
jinsoo_kwon I'm sorry.
james_ford Okay, nice. Keep it coming.
jinsoo_kwon You were right.
james_ford Okay. That's two. Hit me.
jinsoo_kwon Those pants don't make you look fat.
james_ford Now you got it -- only three things a woman needs to hear.
young_hurley Come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
james_ford What's your problem, Jumbotron.
young_hurley Shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
james_ford Touché. What is Jiminy Cricket doing here?
young_hurley We need another man.
james_ford Another man for what?
young_hurley To push this car, dude.
james_ford Push it? Push it where?
james_ford Oh, this is going to be real good.
david_reyes So, you're going to Australia, huh? Long way to go because of some stupid numbers.
young_hurley I'd really like you to leave.
david_reyes When your mom called me about the lottery I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, I saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money.
young_hurley Well, you're not getting any of it.
david_reyes That's not why I'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not going to break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just -- you need a little hope. We make our own luck, Hugo. You know what I think you should do?
young_hurley What?
david_reyes I think you should give away the money. All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a new carburetor -- work on the Camaro -- you know, just you and me -- take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. Never too late for a fresh start.
young_hurley I'll send you a postcard from Sydney.
david_reyes Hey, I'll -- I'll be here when you get back.
james_ford Are you nuts? You're not going to drive down that.
young_hurley We're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down I'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
james_ford You see those rocks? All you're going to do is crash into those real fast. If you don't roll over first.
jinsoo_kwon Hurley, no.
young_hurley Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; I know it.
james_ford What are you out here for -- watch him crash and burn?
charlie_pace Came to ride shotgun.
james_ford Well, it's your funeral. Come on, let's give 'em their ride.
young_hurley Are you sure you want to do this?
charlie_pace Victory or death.
young_hurley Push!
young_hurley Oh, jeez.
charlie_pace Careful now. Now would be a good time, Hurley. Like right now!
young_hurley There is no curse. You make your own luck.
charlie_pace Hurley!
young_hurley You make your own luck. There is no curse!
james_ford Son-of-a-bitch.
jinsoo_kwon Hurley!
sayid_jarrah Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack why didn't you ask us?
kate_austen Two reasons -- you don't know where to look and you're not motivated. And I don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back?
john_locke You're wrong.
kate_austen Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after--
john_locke Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it it'll lead us right to him.
kate_austen How?
sayid_jarrah Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him.
john_locke So now you know our secret, how about you tell us yours?
kate_austen No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. It's alright! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out!
danielle_rousseau What are you doing here?
kate_austen I came to ask for your help.
danielle_rousseau To do what?
kate_austen I'm heading to the Other's camp, and if I'm going to find it, I need someone who knows the island.
danielle_rousseau What makes you think I have an interest in helping you?
kate_austen Because they had me, and they would have never let me go -- probably would have killed me if I hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape -- she was about 16 years old and her name was Alex. I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
