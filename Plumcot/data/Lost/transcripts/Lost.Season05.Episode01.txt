WIFE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Ah. Mm. Baby's awake.
WIFE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 It's your turn.
RECORD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear / Bitin' on a bullet pullin' out all of his hair
RECORD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
RECORD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Well, you can't make a record if you—
RECORD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you—
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Morning. Here you go, Doc.
dr_pierre_chang I don't need a script. Let's go. I don't have all day.
SOUND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Speed.
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Okay. DHARMA orientation film number two, take one.
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 And... action.
dr_pierre_chang Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for station two, the Arrow. Given your specific area of expertise, you should find it no surprise that this station's primary purpose is to develop defensive strategies and gather intelligence on the island's hostile indigenous population—
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Dr. Chang! Dr. Chang?
dr_pierre_chang Damn it! What the hell?!
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Cut!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Sir, we got a problem down at the Orchid.
foreman Over here. We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs. That's when the drill melted.
dr_pierre_chang The drill melted?
foreman Yeah, yeah. 3 meters in. We went through six carbon drill bits, and the last one just fried.
foreman Then my operator starts grabbing his head and freaking out. We sonar-imaged the wall. There's an open chamber about 20 meters in, behind the rock.
foreman There's something in there. And the only way to get to it is to lay charges here and here and blast through it and take a look—
dr_pierre_chang Under no circumstances! This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy. And that energy, once we can harness it correctly, it's going to allow us to manipulate time.
foreman Right. Okay, so, what? We're gonna go back and kill Hitler?
dr_pierre_chang Don't be absurd. There are rules, rules that can't be broken.
foreman So what do you want me to do?
dr_pierre_chang You're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen...
dr_pierre_chang ...God help us all.
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 All right, get him up.
foreman Come on. Let's go.
dr_pierre_chang Watch yourself!
TANK#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 CARRYING WORKER Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 We need a doctor.
foreman Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
foreman Did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
foreman Let's go, guys.
ben_linus Why don't you close that up now, Jack? Come on. Let's get him in the van. It's out back.
dr_jack_shephard Where are we taking him?
ben_linus We'll worry about that once we pick up Hugo.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley... is locked away in a mental institution.
ben_linus Which should make recruiting him considerably easier than the rest of your friends.
dr_jack_shephard They're not my friends anymore.
ben_linus Oh, that's the spirit.
dr_jack_shephard How did we get here? How did all this happen?
ben_linus It happened because you left, Jack. Now let's get started, shall we?
dr_jack_shephard So once we get Hurley... then what?
ben_linus Then we get Sun, Sayid... and Kate, of course.
dr_jack_shephard I don't see that happening.
dr_jack_shephard When was the last time you saw him? I mean, Locke.
ben_linus On the Island... in the Orchid station, below the greenhouse. I told him I was sorry for making his life so miserable, and then he left. So obviously John's visit to you made an impression. What did he say to make you such a believer?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, Juliet, everyone from the boat... and everyone we left behind—John said that they'd die, too, if I didn't come back.
ben_linus Did he tell you what happened to them after the Island moved?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, he didn't.
ben_linus Then I guess we'll never know.
john_locke What the... Richard? Richard?! Anyone? Anyone?!
neil_ What happened? What was that light?
dr_daniel_faraday We must've been inside the radius.
james_ford What the hell was that?
dr_juliet_burke I don't know.
james_ford Where's the freighter?
dr_juliet_burke Maybe it went down.
james_ford Unh-unh. No way. A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke. Now there's just nothin'?
dr_juliet_burke What about the helicopter?
james_ford It was heading for that boat.
bernard_nadler Rose! Rose!
dr_juliet_burke Bernard!
bernard_nadler Rose! Have you seen Rose?!
dr_juliet_burke No.
rose_nadler Oh, my God! Bernard!
bernard_nadler Rose! Where were you?
rose_nadler I was over... by the church. Wh-what was that sound? What was that light?
bernard_nadler I don't know.
james_ford Just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right? We'll just go back to camp and—
bernard_nadler "Calm down"? "No need to panic"? We can't go back to the camp.
james_ford What the hell are you talking about?
bernard_nadler There is no camp.
bernard_nadler The—the sky lit up, a—and then this. The—the kitchen? Gone. And—and all the tents, all the food and water... gone. Well, everything but us. All of it. It's gone.
dr_daniel_faraday It's not gone.
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel!
dr_daniel_faraday Hey.
dr_charlotte_lewis I thought you were on the freighter.
dr_daniel_faraday No, we never made it. We were on our way out there when it happened.
james_ford What do you mean, the camp's not gone? Who the hell are you anyway?
miles_straume That's Dan. He's our physicist.
dr_daniel_faraday Listen, we have no time. I need you to take me to something man-made, something that was built, any kind of a landmark.
dr_juliet_burke There's a DHARMA station 15 minutes from here.
james_ford You mean the hatch? The one we blew up?
dr_daniel_faraday That's perfect. We should get moving before it happens again, okay?
james_ford Before what happens again? And why is our camp gone?
dr_daniel_faraday Your camp isn't gone. It hasn't been built yet.
aaron Choo choo! Tunnel!
kate_austen Oh, I think Choo Choo knows better than that. He goes into that tunnel, he's never coming back out.
kate_austen Watch your cartoons, Goober. Mommy'll be right back.
dan_norton Ms. Austen?
kate_austen Yes?
dan_norton Hi, I'm Dan Norton of the law firm Agostini & Norton. May we have a moment of your time?
kate_austen And who are you?
dan_norton He's my associate. If I could just come in, I'll be glad to explain—
kate_austen No, you can explain right here.
dan_norton Okay, you got it. Ms. Austen, we're here to get a blood sample from you and one from your son Aaron.
kate_austen Excuse me?
dan_norton Now, I have a court order signed by a judge for you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers—
kate_austen Why?
dan_norton To determine your relationship to the child.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I don't understand. Um, who's the—
dan_norton I'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.
kate_austen Your client?
dan_norton Please, may we come in?
kate_austen Get off my property.
dan_norton If you won't comply, then I'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.
kate_austen Then come back with the sheriff.
aaron Where you going, mommy?
kate_austen We're going on vacation, baby.
kate_austen Say bye-bye, baby.
dr_juliet_burke Why did you jump off that helicopter?
james_ford I told you. We were runnin' out of gas. I wanted to make sure she—(sighs) I wanted to make sure they got back to the boat. Don't matter now anyway, does it?
dr_daniel_faraday Excuse me. I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. Okay? Thanks.
james_ford First things first. Gimme your shirt.
dr_daniel_faraday My shirt?
james_ford Yeah.
dr_daniel_faraday I really think we have far more pressing matters than me giving you a shirt. How about we just keep moving, okay?
james_ford How about we call a time-out so you can tell us what the hell is going on?
dr_daniel_faraday How about you trust me?
james_ford Trust you? I don't know you!
dr_daniel_faraday We really do not have time for me to try to explain. You have no idea how difficult that would be for me to try to explain this—this phenomenon to a quantum physicist. That would be difficult, so for me to try to explain whatever is happening—
dr_charlotte_lewis Oi! What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?
james_ford Shut it, Ginger, or you're gettin' one, too.
james_ford Now talk.
dr_daniel_faraday The Island... think of the Island like a record spinning on a turntable... only now, that record is skipping. Whatever Ben Linus did down at the Orchid station... I think... it may have... dislodged us.
miles_straume Dislodged us from what?
dr_daniel_faraday Time.
dr_juliet_burke So that's why our camp is gone? Because the Island is moving through time?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, either the Island is, or we are.
james_ford What?
dr_daniel_faraday And it's just as likely that we're moving, your people and us. And everyone in your group—you're all accounted for, right?
james_ford Not everyone. ...Locke.
john_locke Is anyone there?!
john_locke Hello?!
john_locke Hello?!
john_locke Hey!
john_locke Uhh!
dr_ethan_rom Who are you?
john_locke Well, listen, listen—
dr_ethan_rom How many others onboard?
john_locke You don't understand. I didn't come on that plane.
dr_ethan_rom Wrong answer.
john_locke No, wait! Stop! Stop! I know you. I know who you are. Your name... your name is Ethan. Your name is Ethan.
dr_ethan_rom Who are you?
john_locke My name is John Locke. I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but Ben Linus appointed me as your leader.
dr_ethan_rom That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
dr_ethan_rom Good-bye, John Locke.
james_ford Great.
james_ford So when are we now, whiz kid?
dr_daniel_faraday We're either in the past... or we're in the future.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Flight 23 to Paris will begin boarding at gate 15. Please have your boarding passes ready.
TICKETING#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 AGENT Evening, ma'am. Where you flying to tonight?
sunhwa_kwon Los Angeles.
TICKETING#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 AGENT Of course. May I see your passport, please?
sunhwa_kwon Mm-hmm.
TICKETING#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 AGENT Excuse me. Could you wait here for just one moment, Ms. Kwon?
sunhwa_kwon Hey! Where are you going?
sunhwa_kwon Open this door. Open this door!
charles_widmore Save your breath.
charles_widmore They only do what I tell them to do.
sunhwa_kwon You. You had me brought in here? Why?
charles_widmore You had the audacity to approach me in broad daylight in front of my business associates... in public. Why did I have you brought here? Because you showed me no respect. I will be respected, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon Fair enough.
charles_widmore Since you seem to be worried about your plane, I'll get right down to business. You mentioned that you and I had... common interests. Why don't you tell me exactly what they might be?
sunhwa_kwon To kill Benjamin Linus.
FEMALENEWS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 ANCHOR The victim was found shot in his car on the grounds of the Santa Rosa hospital, a private mental health care facility outside Los Angeles.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. Let's go get him.
FEMALENEWS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 ANCHOR Police have now identified their suspect in the shooting as a patient at the hospital who escaped earlier this evening—Hugo Reyes.
FEMALENEWS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 ANCHOR Now if that name sounds familiar to you, that's because Reyes was a member of the infamous Oceanic Six. As to why he may have murdered a visitor to the facility where Reyes lived for two years, that remains a complete mystery.
ben_linus Well... looks like we have a change of plan.
hugo_reyes Here she comes, right now.
WAITRESS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Here's your order, sir.
sayid_jarrah Keep the change.
WAITRESS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Thank you.
hugo_reyes Awesome.
hugo_reyes You want a fry?
sayid_jarrah No, thank you.
hugo_reyes You know, maybe if you ate more comfort food you wouldn't have to go around shooting people.
hugo_reyes So that dude you popped outside Santa Rosa—who was he?
sayid_jarrah I don't care. He was armed and he was watching you. That made him an enemy.
hugo_reyes Do you think he was gonna kill me?
sayid_jarrah I'm not taking any risks. After Bentham died—
hugo_reyes You mean Locke.
sayid_jarrah Yes, I mean Locke.
hugo_reyes I need a cool code name.
hugo_reyes So when'd you become so paranoid?
sayid_jarrah If you'd spent the last two years doing the things I was doing, you'd be paranoid, too.
hugo_reyes Oh, yeah? Paranoid like what? What kind of things?
sayid_jarrah I was working for Benjamin Linus.
hugo_reyes Wait. He's on our side now?
sayid_jarrah Listen to me, Hurley. If you ever have the misfortune of running into him, whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.
sayid_jarrah Wait here.
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Is he all right?
SECOND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN I don't know.
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Is he breathing or what?
THIRD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Who is that? Check him out.
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Look out! That guy's got a gun!
SECOND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Run!
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN Get out of here! Call the cops! Hurry!
hugo_reyes Sayid! Whoa. You okay?
sayid_jarrah Get me to the car.
hugo_reyes Dude. Dude. Oh, man. I thought it was supposed to be a safe house. I never should've left the Island.
dr_charlotte_lewis Hey, do you think he's looking for us?
miles_straume Who?
dr_charlotte_lewis Widmore.
miles_straume It took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time. I'll start holding my breath now.
dr_juliet_burke Over here!
dr_daniel_faraday Is this the hatch?
james_ford It was. Blown up, just like we left it.
dr_daniel_faraday Okay. So when we are now... it's now after you and your people crashed on the Island.
james_ford You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again?
dr_daniel_faraday It's possible, yeah.
james_ford Good. I'm going back.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. No, no. It's pointless.
james_ford More pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?
dr_daniel_faraday We don't know when the next flash is coming. By the time you get back to the beach, the camp could be gone again.
james_ford Yeah, but what if it ain't? Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?
dr_juliet_burke We could warn them, stop them from ever flying to that boat.
dr_daniel_faraday That's not the way it works.
james_ford Who says?
dr_daniel_faraday You cannot change anything. You can't. Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.
james_ford Why not?
dr_daniel_faraday Time—it's like a street, all right? We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse, but we cannot ever create a new street. If we try to do anything different, we will fail every time. Whatever happened, happened.
james_ford How do you know so much about this, Danny Boy?
dr_daniel_faraday I know about this because... I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time. I know all this because this journal contains everything I've ever learned about the DHARMA Initiative. This is why I'm here. I know what's happening.
james_ford So how can we stop it?
dr_daniel_faraday We can't stop it.
james_ford Then who can?
john_locke Aah!
john_locke Aah!
john_locke Richard?
richard_alpert Hey, John.
john_locke Richard... what is happening?
richard_alpert What's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Here.
richard_alpert I need to get the bullet out.
john_locke How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
richard_alpert Because you told me there was, John.
john_locke No, no. No, I didn't.
richard_alpert Well... you will.
john_locke It was Ethan who shot me.
richard_alpert Well... what comes around, goes around.
john_locke Aah! When am I?
richard_alpert Well, John, that—that's all relative.
john_locke Wait, wait. When the sky lit up... where did you go?
richard_alpert I didn't go anywhere, John. You went. All right, this—this is gonna hurt. It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? Hold still.
john_locke Uhh!
richard_alpert All done.
john_locke Jeez.
john_locke I don't understand. How—how did you know that I was here? How did you know where to find me?
richard_alpert I wish I had time to explain it, John. But you're gonna be moving on soon, and we need to go over a couple of things before you do.
john_locke "Moving on"? Aah!
richard_alpert Sorry. The first thing, okay?
richard_alpert You're gonna need to clean out the wound every couple of hours and keep as much weight off the leg as you can, all right? The Island'll do the rest, John, all right?
john_locke But I don't—
richard_alpert Second thing—no, no, pay attention. Next time we see each other, I'm not gonna recognize you. All right? You give me this. All right?
john_locke What is this?
richard_alpert It's a compass.
john_locke What does it do?
richard_alpert It points north, John. Look, I wish I had time to be more sensitive about this because it's a lot to swallow, but you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do. So I'm just gonna say it, okay? The only way to save the Island, John, is to get your people back here—the ones who left.
john_locke Jack, Kate... The chopper was headed for the boat. The boat—
richard_alpert No, they're fine, John, and they're already home, so you have to convince them to come back.
john_locke How—how am I supposed to do that?
richard_alpert You're gonna have to die, John.
miles_straume So... what was this thing before you guys blew it up?
dr_juliet_burke A DHARMA station.
miles_straume For what?
dr_juliet_burke There was a man named Desmond living down in it. He was pushing a button every 108 minutes to save the world.
miles_straume Really?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah. Really.
james_ford Son of a...
james_ford ...bitch!
dr_juliet_burke The hatch—it's back. I guess you haven't found it yet.
miles_straume Hey! Where you goin'?
james_ford Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.
dr_daniel_faraday James, wait. Not a good idea.
james_ford The sky can flash all it wants, but I ain't startin' over, Dilbert. I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and starting a fire, and I ain't huntin' damn boar! There's DHARMA food, beer, and clothing in there. And I'm gettin' Desmond to let me in one way or another.
dr_daniel_faraday That's not gonna work, my friend.
james_ford Yeah? Why not?
dr_daniel_faraday Because Desmond didn't know you when he first came out of there. That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.
james_ford That would all be fascinating if I was listening to ya.
dr_daniel_faraday So how do you know Desmond is even in there? Think about it. It could be anybody.
james_ford I don't care who's in there.
dr_daniel_faraday Wait. Wait.
james_ford Open the damn door!
dr_daniel_faraday It won't work.
james_ford Sure it will. Yo, open up! It's the Ghost of Christmas Future!
dr_daniel_faraday No one—no one is gonna answer.
james_ford Open! Open the damn door! Open the door!
dr_daniel_faraday You're wasting your time.
james_ford Open up! I know you can hear me.
dr_daniel_faraday If it didn't happen, it can't happen.
james_ford Open the damn door!
dr_daniel_faraday You can't change the past, James!
james_ford Everybody I care about just blew up on your damn boat. I know what I can't change.
dr_juliet_burke We should get back to the beach. It's been a long day.
miles_straume Why are we going back to the beach if there's nothing to go back to?
dr_juliet_burke So stay here.
miles_straume That chick likes me.
dr_charlotte_lewis What? Wh—what? What's the matter?
dr_daniel_faraday You...
dr_charlotte_lewis Ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed since I was little. Dan, I'm fine.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah. No, no, no, you're—um, of course you're fine. I'm, uh... you know, the sight of blood is...
dr_charlotte_lewis Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're a physicist then, isn't it? Shall we?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, um... my pack. Of course I left my pack back at the hatch crater. I better get it. Why don't you head back with everyone else? And I'll be right behind you.
dr_charlotte_lewis Don't dillydally.
dr_daniel_faraday I wouldn't think of it.
dr_daniel_faraday Please let this work. Please let this work. Please, please, please, let this work.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa. Don't shoot.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode01 Then you'd best explain why you've been bangin' on my door for the last 20 minutes, brother.
dr_daniel_faraday Desmond.
desmond_hume Are you him?
dr_daniel_faraday "Him"? Who?
desmond_hume My replacement.
dr_daniel_faraday No, I'm not.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not. I'm not. I'm...
desmond_hume Do I know you?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah... in a way. But listen, that's not important. What is important, Desmond, is what I'm about to say to you. I need you to listen. You're the only person who can help us because, Desmond... the rules... the rules don't apply to you. You're special. You're uniquely and miraculously special.
desmond_hume What are you talking about?
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, listen to me. Listen! If the helicopter somehow made it off the Island, if you got home—
desmond_hume What helicopter? What are you talking about?!
dr_daniel_faraday Listen, I need you to listen, or people are gonna die. My name is Daniel Faraday, and right now me and everyone else you left behind—we're in serious danger. You're the only person who can help us. I need you to go back to Oxford University. Go back to where we met.
dr_daniel_faraday I need you to go there and find my mother. Her name is—
penelope_widmore Are you all right?
desmond_hume I was on the Island.
desmond_hume I was on the Island.
penelope_widmore You've been off the Island for three years now.
penelope_widmore You're safe now. It was just a dream.
desmond_hume It wasn't a dream, Pen.
desmond_hume It was a memory.
penelope_widmore Desmond, where are you going? Des?
penelope_widmore Desmond? What are you doing?
desmond_hume We're leaving.
penelope_widmore Leaving to go where?
desmond_hume Oxford.
