TARIQ They're getting closer! Move it! Burn those! Shred faster! Hurry up! Sayid! Take these files! Burn them! Keep shredding you cowards! We leave when I say! Stop again, and I'll kill you myself! I'm your commanding officer and you will do --
U.S. SOLDIER #1 Get down! Get the hell down!
SGT. BUCCELLI Get down. Get down. You, no, no, no, drop your gun. On the ground now.
U.S. SOLDIER #2 Freeze! On the ground, now!
U.S. SOLDIER #1 Get the hell down!
SGT. BUCCELLI Who's in charge here? I said, who's in charge?! Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he's dead.
U.S. SOLDIER #1 They don't understand, Sergeant.
SGT. BUCCELLI They understand. Listen up, I'll fire on 3. 1-2...
SAYID 
SGT. BUCCELLI You -- you in charge?
SAYID No, I am not.
SGT. BUCCELLI Who is?
SAYID There is no commanding officer here. He left two hours ago for, for Hillah.
SGT. BUCCELLI Your English is good, Abdul, but you're lying. And that ain't so good.
SGT. BUCCELLI That's him, Sergeant.
SGT. AUSTEN Let's go, hombre. Son, we don't want to be here any more than you do -- your pal, Saddam, had to go marching into Kuwait -- here we all are. Buccelli here says that you speak English. Ever do any translating?
SAYID Formally, no.
SGT. AUSTEN Hell, the fact you know what "formally" means -- we're good. Apache helicopter went down in this sector 2 days ago. Our sources tell us the pilot was captured. It's very important that we get this pilot back. We know that he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander -- a man named Tariq. Do you know him?
SAYID Yes, he was our commanding officer.
SGT. AUSTEN Do you know where he is?
SAYID When the bombing started he fled to Hillah.
SGT. AUSTEN Hillah, huh?
SAYID Yes, that is right.
SGT. AUSTEN Welcome to Hillah.
ANA Where's Jack?
SAYID Why?
ANA There. See?
SAYID Go back, I'll deal with this.
ANA What?
SAYID Go back, Ana Lucia. And don't tell anyone what you saw.
SAYID What are you doing here, Danielle?
DANIELLE Looking for you.
SAYID Where are we going? You said you were looking for me. What was your plan? To hide in the woods hoping I would pass you by?
DANIELLE I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.
SAYID Why? 
DANIELLE We need to keep moving.
SAYID Not until you tell me where we're moving to.
DANIELLE Trust me.
SAYID The last time we met you arrived to warn us the Others were coming which they weren't. In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire's baby. So pardon me for not trusting you.
DANIELLE This place I'm taking you to -- there's something that will help you -- something important. As for trust, take this. If I'm lying it's yours to use.
SAYID How much further?
DANIELLE Not far.
SGT. AUSTEN Ask him where he took the pilot.
SAYID 
TARIQ 
SAYID He says he does not know.
SGT. AUSTEN Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday. Hell, probably in this room. Tell him if we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free.
SAYID 
TARIQ 
SGT. AUSTEN What's he saying?
SAYID He says he does not know.
SGT. AUSTEN I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday, son. Now, if you don't help me out here, someone else will take over. And that someone -- he won't play nice at all.
SAYID I am sorry. He does not know.
SGT. AUSTEN Okay, you had your chance. Guards, lock him back up.
SAWYER This is unbelievable. Hey! Hey, you hear that thing? You hear that frog -- that frog? You want to help me find it?
SAWYER What, we ain't friends anymore?
SAWYER What do you got there, Rerun?
HURLEY Nothing. 
SAWYER Yeah, well, you've got a spot of nothing on your chin there. "DHARMA Initiative ranch dressing"? You know you're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it?
HURLEY Well, actually in the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years.
SAWYER Well, well, look at who's got a secret stash?
HURLEY Please, dude, you can't tell.
SAWYER What, that you stole food from the group? Now, why would I want to do that?
HURLEY Come on, man, please?
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
HURLEY Dude, it's just a tree frog.
SAWYER Have you seen it?
HURLEY Yeah.
SAWYER Tell you what -- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dipping. We got a deal?
SAYID How much further? Danielle?
DANIELLE We're here.
SAYID And where exactly is here?
SAYID What is that for, Danielle?
VOICE Help me! Hey, somebody here!
DANIELLE Wait.
VOICE Help!
DANIELLE Sayid, listen to me.
VOICE Hey! Hey, over here! Please, help me.
VOICE Help me!
DANIELLE Don't believe a word he says.
VOICE Hey!
DANIELLE He's one of them.
VOICE I have no idea what she's talking about. She's crazy.
SAYID How long has he been up there?
VOICE Since last night. Please, just cut me down. My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. Please.
DANIELLE He's lying.
SAYID I'm going to cut him down.
DANIELLE Don't.
GALE Thank you.
DANIELLE You're making a serious mistake.
SAYID It's okay, it's okay. You're alright. You're alright. Hold on. Take it easy.
GALE No.
SAYID Wait. Danielle, don't!
SAYID You could have killed him.
DANIELLE If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him.
SAYID You shot this man with no provocation.
DANIELLE He is one of them. Tie him up. You should take him to your doctor. He's no good to you dead.
SAYID And then what?
DANIELLE You talk to him, Sayid. As I recall that is what you do. But know this -- he will lie -- a long time. He will lie.
INMAN I want to talk to you about your buddy -- Tariq. Uh, look, I get it. You're a man who values loyalty. Even doing a little translating for us -- you feel like you're doing the wrong thing. I get that, and I respect it. This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit. He was the head of the chemical warfare battalion in the North. He personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village. You recognize it, don't you? You had relatives in that village didn't you, Sayid? So, you know what sarin gas does. No discrimination -- the entire marketplace -- innocent women, children.
SAYID Enough -- please.
INMAN Loyalty is a virtue. But unquestioning loyalty -- I don't think that's you.
SAYID Why should I believe you?
INMAN How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village? We liberated your personnel file, and Tariq's. All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family.
SAYID Tariq will never talk to you.
INMAN That's why you're going to have to make him talk to you.
SAYID John, John wake up.
LOCKE What?
SAYID Come out here.
LOCKE Minnesota, huh?
SAYID That's the question, isn't it?
GALE Where am I?
SAYID Who are you?
GALE Henry, Henry Gale. Ah, my back.
SAYID We're going to take it out, but first I want you to relax. How did you get to this island?
GALE 4 months ago, we crashed, my wife and I.
SAYID Crashed in what?
GALE A balloon. We were trying to cross the Pacific.
SAYID Your wife, where is she?
GALE She died. She got -- she got sick 3 weeks ago. We were staying in a cave off the beach. Ah, my shoulder. At least untie my arms.
JACK What the hell's going here?
SAYID Rousseau trapped him in the jungle. She believes he's an Other.
GALE An other what?
JACK You shot him with an arrow?
SAYID Do I have a bow?
JACK Hey, hey, you with me? What, you were just going to let him bleed to death?
SAYID I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them. And his wound is far from life threatening.
LOCKE We should let Jack treat him first, then we'll get our answers.
SAYID Jack, do not untie him.
HURLEY This is how people get killed in scary movies.
SAWYER If this was a scary movie I'd be with a hot chick not you, Barbar.
HURLEY It's Babar.
SAWYER How about you shut up, Hammo? Or your ranch disorder's going to be the new lead item on the coconut internet.
HURLEY Fine, go ahead. Tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing -- the fat guy likes to eat. Yeah, I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. You think I don't know that? At least people like me. You know what? Find the damn frog by yourself.
SAWYER Hurley, wait, wait. Hey, Hurley! -- Look, man, I'm sorry, alright. This frog is killing me. You've got to help me out -- please.
LOCKE So, what do you think?
SAYID What do you think, John?
LOCKE I think he's pretty convincing.
SAYID Yes, he is.
LOCKE The real problem is there's no way we can be sure he's telling the truth.
SAYID That is not necessarily true. Does Jack have the combination to the armory?
LOCKE For now he does.
SAYID How long would it take for you to change it?
LOCKE If you're angry -- looking for someone to punish...
SAYID Why would I need to punish anyone? I want to find out who he is. I want the truth. And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it. So how long, John, to change the combination?
LOCKE Couple minutes, tops.
SAYID Then I suggest you get started.
SAYID Did he say anything while--
JACK No, he didn't. He was in shock.
LOCKE We can't just leave him laying here, Jack. If people see him it'll create a panic.
JACK Yeah, well, where do you think we should put him?
SAYID I say we put him in the armory, secure.
LOCKE Better to err on the side of safety, Jack. At least until we can be sure.
JACK Okay. For now.
JACK We can pull that cot in here. He shouldn't be on his back.
LOCKE Good idea.
JACK Sayid, hey, what the hell are you doing?! Sayid! Sayid!
SAYID What needs to be done.
TARIQ 
SAYID 
TARIQ 
SAYID 
SAYID The pilot was executed 2 days ago. He's buried in a field 4 kilometers from here. I can take you there.
JACK Damn it. Sayid, open the door! Sayid, answer me!
LOCKE Jack.
JACK Why isn't this combination working, John? Did you change it?
LOCKE Yeah.
JACK Why would you do that?
LOCKE You were raising an army.
JACK What?
LOCKE And why you didn't ask me to help -- well, that's your business -- but there's only one reason to raise an army, Jack. And that's because we're at war. And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door -- that's a part of it, too.
JACK What if he's telling the truth, John?
LOCKE What if he's not?
SAYID Get up.
GALE What is happening?
SAYID Here, let me help you. You said you've been here for 4 months.
GALE What?
SAYID You said you came to this island 4 months ago, yes?
GALE Where am I?
SAYID Please, answer my question.
GALE Yeah, yes we landed 4 months ago. Maybe more. Who are you?
SAYID And you were in a cave for all that time?
GALE Off the beach on the North shore of the Island.
SAYID How far from this beach to where you were captured?
GALE I don't know.
SAYID How many days' walk?
GALE 2 -- 2 days.
SAYID Why did you stay on the beach for so long?
GALE Why wouldn't we? We wanted to be there for fly-overs. We had an emergency beacon, a transmitter.
SAYID What kind of transmitter?
GALE An ADF beacon. We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted. Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not. Please, please just -- tell me your name.
SAYID Your wife, what is her maiden name?
GALE Murphy.
SAYID Where did you meet her?
GALE University of Minnesota.
SAYID How did she die?
GALE She got sick.
SAYID She got sick?
GALE It started as a fever. After 2 days she was delirious. Then she died. I don't know why you're asking me all these questions. I don't know why you're treating me this way -- why I have to explain to you who I am when you don't tell me who you are.
SAYID I was 23 years old when the Americans came to my country. I was a good man. I was a soldier. And when they left, I was something different. For the next 6 years I did things I wish I could erase from my memory -- things which I never thought myself to be capable of. But I did come to learn this -- there was a part of me which was always capable. You want to know who I am? My name is Sayid Jarrah, and I am a torturer.
SAWYER Where is it?
HURLEY There it is.
SAWYER Gotcha.
HURLEY Dude, nice catch.
SAWYER Well, I'll be damned. All that noise from this tiny critter.
HURLEY It kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had. Its name was Stuart. It ran off when I was 10. Well, that's what mom said. I kind of think she threw him out.
SAWYER Well, you're a happy little fella, ain't ya?
HURLEY I have an idea. Why don't I take him -- far from here -- 2 beaches away? Then maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog. That way he won't keep you up anymore, and everyone's happy.
SAWYER Yeah, that's one idea. Here's another.
HURLEY Dude.
SAWYER I hear with a little ranch they taste just like chicken.
LOCKE Give you a hand? Jack, I know this isn't--
JACK Shut up.
JACK Where are the pliers?
SAYID Tell me about this balloon.
GALE What?
SAYID This balloon that brought you here with your wife. Tell me about it.
GALE What do you want to know?
SAYID Everything.
GALE She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide. And when she's up in the air 550,000 cubic feet of helium and a 100,000 of hot air keep her up. And if you could look down on her you'd see a big yellow smiley face on top.
SAYID Why would you travel in that way?
GALE Because I was rich. Because -- it was my dream. And Jennifer thought it would be neat.
SAYID You "were" rich?
GALE I guess I'm thinking of things in the past tense now. How's that for optimism?
SAYID What did you do to become so rich?
GALE I sold my company.
SAYID What kind of company?
GALE Mining.
SAYID What did you mine?
GALE We mined non-metallic minerals. I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties.
SAYID Give me your hands. Give me your hands!
SAYID Where is she buried?
GALE What?
SAYID Listen to me. You said you buried your wife. Tell me where.
GALE What are you going to...?
SAYID Where!!
GALE In the jungle. By the balloon, in the jungle.
SAYID How deep? How deep did you dig the grave?
GALE I don't -- it was...
SAYID How deep? How many shovelfuls of earth? Did you use your hands? How long did it take you?!
GALE I don't remember.
SAYID You would remember! You would remember how deep! You would remember every shovelful, every moment! You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside. You would remember if you buried the woman you loved! You would remember -- if it were true!
GALE Did you -- did you lose someone? Did you lose someone here on the Island? Did you lose someone, too? What happened to her?
SAYID It was an accident. It was an accident. The woman responsible thought she was someone else -- someone coming to hurt her -- someone like you!
GALE Just, just... This is all a mistake. Slow down here, okay. Hurting me isn't going to bring her back.
SAYID You know what I lost! Tell me how long!
GALE No, no! Help! Help me!
SAYID Tell me who you are!
JACK Sayid! Sayid!
LOCKE Jack.
JACK Open it. Open it now, John!
LOCKE Jack, this has to happen.
JACK  Open that damn door, you understand me! You open it now.
LOCKE No.
JACK Now!
GALE What do you want me to say? Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it! Just, please.
SAYID I want you to tell me the truth!
JACK Open the door.
LOCKE Let go of me, Jack.
JACK Or what? You want to push the button? Open the door.
JACK It's under a minute now, John. You better think fast.
LOCKE You wouldn't.
JACK What? I wouldn't what?
LOCKE If we don't... You would risk everyone's lives?
JACK You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it's yours now. You're the one who won't risk it, you. Me? I don't think anything's going to happen when we get down to zero.
LOCKE Jack!
JACK You want to see what's going to happen? Let's just see what's going to happen.
SAYID Who are you?!! Who are you?!!
LOCKE Okay.
JACK Okay.
LOCKE Okay, right 15, left...
JACK You think I'm stupid? You open it!
SAYID He's lying!
JACK Not like this.
GALE I'll tell you whatever you want.
SAYID He's lying! He's lying!
JACK That's enough!
JACK What the hell was that?
SAYID He is one of them.
JACK Yeah? Did he tell you that?
SAYID No.
JACK Then how do you know?
SAYID Because I know. He is one of them.
JACK I think that Rousseau thought that about you once, Sayid. If I'm not mistaken she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them.
LOCKE He is.
JACK What?
LOCKE He is one of them. To Rousseau, we're all Others. I guess it's all relative, huh?
SGT. AUSTEN You got a wife, kids?
INMAN I'll take him. It's over. We're pulling out, not going to Baghdad. So your man Saddam gets to stay in power which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ. Guess you're lucky you have a new skill set you can use.
SAYID What you made me do no human being should ever have to do to another.
INMAN 
SAYID I will never do that again.
INMAN Yeah. Good luck to you, Sayid. Bus fare back to Ramadi. Let's move out.
SAYID There is a man down in the Hatch. A stranger captured by Rousseau. I beat him. I beat him badly.
CHARLIE Why are you telling me this, Sayid?
SAYID Jack asked me how I knew -- knew for sure that this man was lying. How I knew for sure that he was one of them -- one of the Others. I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him. -- But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack, or even Locke, because both of them have forgotten.
CHARLIE Forgotten? What?
SAYID That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead. That Claire was taken and kept for days during which god only knows what happened to her. That these people -- these Others -- are merciless, and can take any one of us whenever they choose. So tell me, Charlie, have you forgotten?
