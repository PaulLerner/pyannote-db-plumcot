VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Over here. Jack!
john_locke Where's Jack? We need the doctor.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 He's right there. Right there.
charlie_pace What happened?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Jack!
john_locke Doctor!
charlie_pace Claire?
michael_dawson Is she alive?
walt_lloyd What happened?
charlie_pace Is she alright?
dr_jack_shephard Where did you find her?
john_locke About a mile north. We were looking for the dog.
dr_jack_shephard Was she conscious?
john_locke She collapsed in my arms.
charlie_pace Did she say anything?
hugo_reyes Charlie, man! Is she injured?
walt_lloyd Is she alright?
dr_jack_shephard Everybody needs to back off, okay? Just give her some air. . Claire, can you hear me? Wake up now. Hey, Claire, Claire. Wake up now. . Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Claire? It's okay. It's okay.
charlie_pace Claire. You're safe.
claire_littleton Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you people?!
claire_littleton I don't understand. I don't know any Ethan. I don't remember. I don't remember any of you. I don't remember any of this.
charlie_pace What do you remember?
claire_littleton Um, I was on a plane flying to LA from Sydney.
dr_jack_shephard Claire, we were all on that plane. It crashed here -- on this Island. That was almost a month ago.
claire_littleton No, I'm, I'm due.
dr_jack_shephard Your baby's fine. He's kicking, everything's normal. Okay?
claire_littleton Well, if it's been almost a month then why hasn't somebody come to get us?
jinsoo_kwon 도대체 무슨 일이 일어나는 거지?
sunhwa_kwon 저도 모르겠어요.
jinsoo_kwon 저 여자… 괜찮을까?
sunhwa_kwon 제 생각엔 괜찮은 것 같아요.
jinsoo_kwon 애기는?
sunhwa_kwon 애기도 무사하겠죠.
boone_carlyle You think she escaped?
john_locke You were right beside me, Boone, you know as much as I do.
boone_carlyle Well, where did she come from? I mean, we were out pretty deep. Nothing's out there. She didn't say anything at all about Ethan?
john_locke Apparently she doesn't even remember Ethan.
boone_carlyle The guy pretends to be one of us -- he drags her through the jungle for almost two weeks -- she doesn't remember him?
john_locke Apparently.
boone_carlyle You think he's around?
john_locke I sure hope not.
charlie_pace Claire, here's your journal. It might help. And this is where you sleep. It's quite cozy, isn't it? When he -- Ethan -- when he took you away, he took me, too. The others came after us. They got me back, but you, you were gone.
claire_littleton Who is he, Ethan?
charlie_pace Ethan? Ethan's the bad guy.
claire_littleton So, we were together when...
charlie_pace Yeah.
claire_littleton Why did he leave you?
charlie_pace Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning. You've had enough for one day.
claire_littleton Ah, I won't be sleeping.
charlie_pace Oh, lucky for me. I'm not much of a sleeper myself. Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.
claire_littleton We're friends?
charlie_pace Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.
tommy How's that feel, mate?
charlie_pace Sodding fantastic.
tommy Good, 'cause, uh, we're almost out.
charlie_pace But we're not out yet. Carpe Diem, my friend.
tommy Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.
charlie_pace Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.
tommy Well, is it Latin for I've got a pile of money so we can score vast quantities of illicit substances?
charlie_pace No.
tommy I suppose you ought to clean up then. It's time to put you to work.
tommy Miss Lucy Heatherton, 22, and right in oh so many wonderful ways. Just graduated from Oxford, lives in Knightsbridge with her dear old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton who, my friend, is bloody loaded.
charlie_pace How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me, Tommy.
tommy Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace of the legendary rock band Drive Shaft?
charlie_pace Absolutely.
charlie_pace Seriously, ladies. I demand you stop buying me more drinks. I'm a man of high moral standing. Your obvious plans to take me home and ravish me will not work, saucy sirens. I believe in monogamy. I will not be shared like a common curry.
lucy_heatherton Are we that obvious?
charlie_pace Dreadfully. Call yourself ladies? Jane Austen would be ashamed. I personally...
sayid_jarrah The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant. Are we supposed to believe that she escaped from him?
charlie_pace What are you getting at?
sayid_jarrah Ethan infiltrated us. Whoever he is and wherever he comes from, he's intelligent. Who's to say he didn't even send Claire?
charlie_pace You're off your head, mate! That-
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Then tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia and such a selective brand of it?
dr_jack_shephard Okay, it's rare. But she's been through a major trauma. It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.
john_locke And the chances of that memory returning?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
charlie_pace You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want. I'm actually going to go spend some time with her. I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.
charlie_pace Oi, Jin. You heading back to the caves? 안녕?
jinsoo_kwon 안녕.
charlie_pace Safety in numbers, right? Of course, you have no idea what I'm talking about. How nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn. It's quite beautiful, really. You take care of your wife. Everything else is someone else's problem. No need to be involved in the decision-making process. No tree-shaking behemoths, French transmissions, just sweet, bloody ignorance. You don't know how lucky you are, you know. Must be nice. You wake up and...
charlie_pace What?
dr_ethan_rom Charlie, I want her back.
charlie_pace What? I...
dr_ethan_rom I want you to bring her back.
charlie_pace What did you do to her? What did you do?!
dr_ethan_rom You bring her here. If you don't, I'm going to kill one of them. And then, if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow, I'll kill another, and another, and another. One every day. And Charlie, I'll kill you last.
charlie_pace What do we do? We go out and we bloody kill him!
john_locke Calm down, Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset and...
charlie_pace Forget the others. He's out there right now, Locke.
dr_jack_shephard I think he's right. The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire, and what, we just wait for that to happen? We tracked him once before, we can track him again.
john_locke You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out. He bested you physically. He hung you from a tree. Running into the jungle unarmed is not going to get the job done.
charlie_pace So what does get it done?
john_locke We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat. We post some sentries here and back at the caves.
dr_jack_shephard Tell a select few? He does what he says he going to do and that blood's on our hands.
john_locke Okay, Jack, we tell everyone. But, you want to protect them, you need to start thinking defense.
dr_jack_shephard We move everybody off the beach, back up into the caves.
john_locke What if Ethan isn't alone? What if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep to the slaughter in a confined space where they can roll in and take us all in one fell swoop.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, John. Obviously, you have a plan. So, let's hear it.
sunhwa_kwon 도대체 무슨 일이 있었냐구요?
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 일이 있었냐구? 내가 어떻게 알아?
sunhwa_kwon 아니 다른 사람들은 어떻게 이해를--
jinsoo_kwon 다른 사람들? 내가 다른 사람들 때문에 이렇게 된건데.
claire_littleton The others are avoiding me.
charlie_pace Sorry?
claire_littleton No one will talk to me. You know, it just feels like something is going on.
charlie_pace Anything coming back?
claire_littleton After the crash, no. Some of this stuff's probably better forgotten anyway.
charlie_pace Well, I don't know about you, but the rest of us have been having a wonderful time. We even built a golf course.
claire_littleton You're sure there's nothing going on?
charlie_pace Absolutely.
claire_littleton Okay.
lucy_heatherton You're quite enamored with yourself, aren't you?
charlie_pace Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date and you want to appear demure, but, you know, if you want to invite me back for sex don't say tea, say sex.
lucy_heatherton Do you want tea, or not?
charlie_pace I'd love some.
lucy_heatherton Brilliant.
charlie_pace So where is the old man?
lucy_heatherton I don't know. I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.
charlie_pace Oh, yeah? Do you two get on?
lucy_heatherton Dad's quite cool, actually. He was rather proud when I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.
lucy_heatherton It was Winston Churchill's. Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire. Hey, you should meet him.
charlie_pace Winston? No thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.
lucy_heatherton My father. He's coming back tomorrow. You should come round for dinner.
charlie_pace I'd love to.
lucy_heatherton Excellent.
kate_austen You look hungry.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
kate_austen Locke told us what happened. Why do you think he wants her back?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
kate_austen Maybe it's time you use that key you've been wearing around your neck. There are 4 nine millimeters in the Marshal's case and-
dr_jack_shephard Uh-uh. No. I hand them out, someone hears something out in the jungle and gets scared, the chances of us shooting each other are much higher than of us shooting him.
kate_austen We're beyond sharpening knives here, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I am not putting guns in untrained hands.
john_locke Trip it!
sayid_jarrah Not bad.
john_locke 4 of these around the perimeter will do the job.
sayid_jarrah I have fires prepared at 20 meter intervals.
john_locke Excellent.
sayid_jarrah Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty. I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.
boone_carlyle I'll take a shift.
sayid_jarrah Okay.
john_locke Absolutely, we're counting on you, Boone.
charlie_pace Maybe we should move her.
dr_jack_shephard She's safer here.
charlie_pace What about the mountain? There could be another cave?
dr_jack_shephard She's safer here, Charlie.
charlie_pace Nobody's safe!
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
charlie_pace It's my fault he took her. I was responsible. I should have taken care of her. I should...
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, nothing's going to happen to her, okay?
charlie_pace Yeah, okay.
FRANK#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Well, Charlie, I think my lovely daughter would agree that you're the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.
charlie_pace My condolences, sir.
FRANK#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you, but I was in a band once myself, you know.
charlie_pace Oh.
lucy_heatherton They were called the Protestant Reformation.
FRANK#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Yes. Ouch. Dreadful, huh?
charlie_pace You gave it up then?
FRANK#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way. Her mom, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying, but I was wanting to be more practical, responsible, I guess. You know, a man has to provide, take care of his family. A man has to think about the future.
lucy_heatherton And, of course, your band was bloody awful.
FRANK#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode15 Yes, there was that, too. Small detail. So, are you working on a new album, Charlie?
charlie_pace We're in a bit of a hiatus right now. Liam, my brother, just had a daughter. So, you know, we're taking some time off. Quite a lot of time off, actually. It's been a year since we were together. I'm thinking of doing a solo project. Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch and there's been some problems with royalties. The fact of the matter is, sir, uh, I think that Drive Shaft might be dead.
tommy You took a sodding what?!
charlie_pace A job, Tom.
tommy A job doing what?
charlie_pace Selling copiers.
tommy You took a job selling copiers?
charlie_pace I like her.
tommy She's a moose.
charlie_pace Don't say that.
tommy Are you off your bleeding chump, man? I've been getting you off on my skag for over a week now on spec. Spec means speculation.
charlie_pace Yes, I know what speculation means.
tommy In this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan and steal something of value which I can, in turn, sell. And by the time the poor helpless bird realizes it's missing it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace could be responsible for such larceny, and the bloody party continues.
charlie_pace Look, I -- I don't think Liam's coming back. I have to think about my future.
tommy Your future?
charlie_pace Yeah.
tommy Really?
charlie_pace Yes.
tommy When do you start this job?
charlie_pace Monday.
tommy Today's Friday, isn't it? After a weekend without a fix, Monday should be bloody wonderful. Let's see how the future treats you then, hey, Charlie.
john_locke Over here -- through the tree line -- something tripped the alarm.
sayid_jarrah I think we found another missing castaway.
boone_carlyle What happened?
sayid_jarrah Is he alive?
boone_carlyle Oh, god.
sayid_jarrah How did he get past us?
hugo_reyes I thought those guys had a full on perimeter set up?
kate_austen Locke said it didn't matter -- he came in from the water.
hugo_reyes You sure it wasn't an accident? I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something.
kate_austen His neck was broken, both his arms, all the bones in his fingers.
hugo_reyes Yeah, okay. Got it.
james_ford So, Steve drew the short straw.
hugo_reyes Dude, that was Scott.
hugo_reyes Scott Jackson worked for an internet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize two week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. Sorry, I kept calling you Steve, man. Um, amen, I guess. I...
all@ PEOPLE Amen.
hugo_reyes I don't know how to end these.
claire_littleton Hi. Why is everyone staring at me?
shannon_rutherford I'm not staring at you.
claire_littleton What's your name?
shannon_rutherford Shannon.
claire_littleton Shannon, you're staring.
shannon_rutherford You mean nobody's told you?
claire_littleton Told me what?
claire_littleton Why? Why did you lie to me?!
charlie_pace Okay, look...
claire_littleton Yeah, what else didn't you tell me?
charlie_pace I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything you could do.
claire_littleton Nothing I could do? Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie? I'm already in the dark.
charlie_pace Sorry. I just wanted to take care of you.
claire_littleton I can take care of myself.
lucy_heatherton Look at you. Charlie Pace, respectable businessman.
charlie_pace You didn't have to buy me this suit, Lucy.
lucy_heatherton Mmhm. And what did you intend on wearing for your first day of work?
charlie_pace I have shirts... with buttons.
lucy_heatherton You okay?
charlie_pace Yeah, just a bit nervous.
lucy_heatherton Don't be. Dad's put the fix in. He's already demanded they buy two copiers to boost your confidence.
lucy_heatherton Have you memorized the manual?
charlie_pace Backwards and forwards.
lucy_heatherton Say something impressive.
charlie_pace Uh, the Heatherton C815 copy center's leading scan offerings combine the benefits of document capture with instant delivery anywhere, anytime.
lucy_heatherton Anywhere?
charlie_pace Anytime, baby.
lucy_heatherton You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine. You're going to do great. I believe in you. Oh, almost forgot, wait here.
charlie_pace Okay.
lucy_heatherton Alright, now, I know you'll protest, but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these.
charlie_pace Oh, Lucy.
lucy_heatherton You're welcome.
charlie_pace Okay, well. I'm going to be late -- the bus.
lucy_heatherton The bus? Are you daft? I'm driving you.
charlie_pace Oh, no, Lucy. I'd rather you didn't.
lucy_heatherton No argument. Have everything you need?
charlie_pace Yeah.
lucy_heatherton Then let's get you to work.
dr_jack_shephard John, want to take a walk?
dr_jack_shephard What do you think happens after the sun sets tonight?
john_locke Oh, if we don't bring Claire to him? Rhetorical, Jack. Same thing happens tonight as happened last night.
dr_jack_shephard You think you can track him?
john_locke Well, I'm sorry?
dr_jack_shephard We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie. Do you think you can pick up the trail?
john_locke Maybe, but I wouldn't.
dr_jack_shephard Wouldn't?
john_locke Jack, I'm not a cold man. I feel for the loss of one of our own, but nothing fundamental is changed. Wherever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf. He has the advantage. To him we're nothing more than a bunch of scared idiots with sharp sticks.
dr_jack_shephard What if I told you I had a way to get the advantage back?
john_locke Then I would ask what way might that be, Jack?
john_locke Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.
dr_jack_shephard I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these?
charlie_pace Are you insane?
dr_jack_shephard It's the best chance we have, Charlie.
charlie_pace No bloody way!
sayid_jarrah If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him. And the only way do that is by giving him what he wants.
charlie_pace You have no idea what you're talking about. This guy, he will kill all of you. You can't protect her...
claire_littleton Charlie, I can talk for myself.
charlie_pace Claire, they want to use you as bait.
claire_littleton I don't remember Ethan. I don't remember what he did to me. But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else, I have to do that.
charlie_pace I'm coming with you. You said there were 4 guns.
john_locke You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?
dr_jack_shephard Alright, we should do this. Let's figure out a game plan. Alright, Sayid, you're the soldier. Locke, you're the hunter. . .
charlie_pace Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C815 using one your technical manuals.
john_locke Charlie's right.
dr_jack_shephard About what?
john_locke We have 4 guns, we should have 4 men.
james_ford Help? Moi?
dr_jack_shephard You know how to handle a gun, or not?
james_ford Well, I know at least one polar bear that seems to think so. Where'd you get the hardware, Hoss?
kate_austen I want to come.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, we're out of guns. And no one goes out there unarmed.
james_ford How much ammo you got?
dr_jack_shephard 100 rounds give or take.
james_ford All 9's, right? 9 millimeters -- the guns?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, why?
james_ford Because, if the lady wants to come... Lifted this off the Marshal back in the old days. Remember him, don't you? Surly guy, kind of square of jaw, carries a Sig 9.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I remember you shot him. And missed.
james_ford Yeah, well, bygones. And hell, 5 guns are better than 4.
sayid_jarrah He'll be surrounded at 5 points. Everyone will be in visual contact with you. Make sure you stay in the area I've shown you. And remember, guns are a measure of the last resort. We want him alive.
john_locke Over here! Over here! Jack's got him! Hold your fire. Don't shoot. We want him alive. Claire! You alright?
james_ford Over here!
sayid_jarrah Hey, hold your fire!
james_ford Easy.
james_ford Winner by a knockout. Nice one, Doc. Now, maybe somebody can tell me just who or what this son-of-bitch is! Uh, uh, uh, jungle boy. Not even for one second.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie?!
dr_jack_shephard Why did you do it, Charlie?
charlie_pace Because he deserved to die.
dr_jack_shephard He could have told us where he came from, what he wanted with Claire, why he...
charlie_pace Do you really think he would have told us anything, Jack? I wasn't going to let that animal anywhere near her again. Ever.
charlie_pace Lucy, I'm sorry. I've been having some problems. If I could just explain...
lucy_heatherton Leave, Charlie.
charlie_pace Lucy, I made a mistake.
lucy_heatherton You made a mistake? My father's sales manager comes here to my house to return a cigarette case that the EMTs pulled from your suit pocket at the bloody hospital, and it still smells of your sick.
charlie_pace I didn't mean to.
lucy_heatherton Oh, you meant to, Charlie. You meant to from the start. You're a liar! I believed you and you lied! I thought you wanted to -- you said -- you selfish bastard!
charlie_pace Lucy, if I can just explain.
lucy_heatherton Tell me one thing, and don't you dare lie to me. I get why you pretended to like me. I understand why you stole, because you're a junkie. But I don't understand why you took the job. Why did you take the job, Charlie?
charlie_pace I guess I -- I wanted to be respectable. I wanted you to think that I could take care of you.
lucy_heatherton You'll never take care of anyone.
claire_littleton I remember peanut butter. Why do I remember peanut butter?
charlie_pace It was imaginary peanut butter, actually.
claire_littleton I don't know what happened to me. I'm scared. I want to trust you. Goodnight, Charlie.
charlie_pace Goodnight, Claire.
