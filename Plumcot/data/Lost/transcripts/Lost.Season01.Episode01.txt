claire_littleton Help! Please help me! Help me, please help me!
dr_jack_shephard All right, get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!
claire_littleton Help me, please. I'm having, I'm having contractions.
dr_jack_shephard How many months pregnant are you?
claire_littleton I'm, I'm nearly eight months.
dr_jack_shephard How far apart are they coming?
claire_littleton I don't know, a-a few just happened.
john_locke Hey! Hey, hey, hey, get away from there!
gary_troup What?
dr_jack_shephard Listen to me! Look at me! You're going to be okay, do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, you! Come here! I need you to get this woman away from these fumes! Take her over there. Stay with her. If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.
hugo_reyes Oh, you got to be kidding me.
dr_jack_shephard I'll be right back, okay?
claire_littleton Thank you.
hugo_reyes Hey! What's your name?
dr_jack_shephard Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Stop! Her head's not tilted far back enough. You're blowing air into her stomach.
boone_carlyle You sure?
boone_carlyle That's exactly what I was doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.
boone_carlyle Maybe we should do one of those hole things. You know, stick the pen in the throat?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
dr_jack_shephard Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!
dr_jack_shephard Big deep breaths. Take breaths!
dr_jack_shephard Move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! The wing!
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard You? . Stay with her.
hugo_reyes Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
boone_carlyle I didn't know which one would work best.
dr_jack_shephard They're all good. Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me. Did you ever use a needle?
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard Did you ever … patch a pair of jeans?
kate_austen I, uhm, I made the drapes in my apartment.
dr_jack_shephard That's fantastic. Listen, do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
kate_austen And with what?
dr_jack_shephard With this.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.
kate_austen You want me to sew that up?
dr_jack_shephard It's just like the drapes, same thing.
kate_austen No, with the drapes I used a sewing machine.
dr_jack_shephard No, you can do this. I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind.
kate_austen Of course I will.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you. It's for your hands. Save me some for the, for the wound.
kate_austen Any color preference?
dr_jack_shephard No. Standard black.
boone_carlyle Come on.
sayid_jarrah Hey you. What's your name?
charlie_pace Me? Charlie.
sayid_jarrah Charlie. We need help with the fire. No-one will see it if it isn't big.
charlie_pace Okay, I'm on it. What's your name?
sayid_jarrah Sayid.
charlie_pace Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.
kate_austen I might throw up on you.
dr_jack_shephard You're doing fine.
kate_austen You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
dr_jack_shephard Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
kate_austen If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
dr_jack_shephard No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.
sayid_jarrah You think they would have come by now.
charlie_pace Huh? Who?
sayid_jarrah Anyone.
shannon_rutherford As if I'm going to start eating chocolate.
boone_carlyle Shannon, we may be here for a while.
shannon_rutherford The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where they are, they're coming. I'll eat on the rescue boat. . I'll. Eat. On. The. Rescue. Boat.
hugo_reyes Hungry?
claire_littleton Yeah, thanks.
hugo_reyes Anymore, uh... you know, baby stuff?
claire_littleton No. I'm-I'm okay.
hugo_reyes Well, hang in there.
claire_littleton Yeah, you too.
michael_dawson You sure you're warm enough?
jinsoo_kwon 내 옆에서 없어지면 안 돼. 내가 어디로 가든지 꼭 따라와. 알겠지? 다른 사람 신경쓰지 말고 우린 같이 있어야 돼.
kate_austen Do you think he's going to live?
dr_jack_shephard Do you know him?
kate_austen He was sitting next to me.
dr_jack_shephard We must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. Hit an air pocket. Dropped, maybe, 200 feet. The turbulence was … I blacked out.
kate_austen I didn't. I saw the whole thing. I knew that the tail was gone, but I couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the, the front of the plane broke off.
dr_jack_shephard Well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in.
kate_austen Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's intact, we might be able to find a transceiver. Send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
kate_austen How do you know all that?
dr_jack_shephard Took a couple flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
kate_austen I saw some smoke. Just through the valley. If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.
dr_jack_shephard I don't know your name.
kate_austen I'm Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Jack.
shannon_rutherford What was that?
charlie_pace That was weird, right?
walt_lloyd Is that Vincent?
michael_dawson It's not Vincent.
claire_littleton Did anybody see that?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
shannon_rutherford Boone!
charlie_pace Terrific.
cindy_chandler So, how's the drink?
dr_jack_shephard It's good.
cindy_chandler That wasn't a very strong reaction.
dr_jack_shephard Well, it's not a very strong drink.
cindy_chandler Shhh. Just don't tell anyone.
dr_jack_shephard This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations.
charlie_pace Excuse me.
cindy_chandler Sir, excuse me!
rose_nadler Guess he really had to go.
cindy_chandler Sir, excuse me!
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
dr_jack_shephard It's normal.
rose_nadler Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
dr_jack_shephard Well, he sounds like a very smart man.
rose_nadler Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry it's going to be over...
michael_dawson It didn't sound like an animal. Not exactly, I mean.
rose_nadler That sound that it made, I keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it.
shannon_rutherford Really? Where are you from?
rose_nadler The Bronx.
charlie_pace Might be monkeys. It's monkeys, right?
james_ford Sure it's monkeys. It's Monkey Island.
hugo_reyes Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island.
sayid_jarrah We're on an Island.
kate_austen You ready?
dr_jack_shephard Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
kate_austen I'm coming.
dr_jack_shephard Well, you're going to need better shoes.
michael_dawson Whatever it was … it wasn't natural.
charlie_pace Does anyone have any sun block?
shannon_rutherford Yeah, I do.
charlie_pace Ah. Cool.
hugo_reyes So, I was just looking inside the fuselage … It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh … b-o-d-y-s?
michael_dawson What are you spelling, man? "Bodies"?
walt_lloyd B-o-d-i-e-s.
sayid_jarrah That sounds like a good idea.
shannon_rutherford No! They'll deal with it when they get here.
dr_jack_shephard We go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver, to send a distress signal, help the rescue team. (To Boone) You're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded. If the guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm, but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?
boone_carlyle Yeah, got it. What about the guy with the leg? The, the tourniquet.
dr_jack_shephard I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He … he should be all right.
boone_carlyle Yeah. Cool. Good job.
charlie_pace I'll come with you. I want to help.
dr_jack_shephard I don't need any more help.
charlie_pace No, it's cool, I don't really feel like standing still, so. Excellent.
kate_austen May I ask you something?
charlie_pace Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
kate_austen Have we ever met, anywhere?
charlie_pace No, that would be unlikely.
kate_austen Hum.
charlie_pace I look familiar, though, right?
kate_austen Yeah.
charlie_pace Can't quite place it?
kate_austen No, I can't.
charlie_pace Yeah. I think I know.
kate_austen You do?
charlie_pace You all everybody … You all everybody! You've never heard that song?
kate_austen I've heard it. I just don't know what the hell it is—
charlie_pace That's us. Drive Shaft. Look, the ring—second tour of Finland. You've never heard of Drive Shaft?
kate_austen The band?
charlie_pace Yeah, the band.
kate_austen You were in Drive Shaft.
charlie_pace I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.
kate_austen Seriously?
charlie_pace Yeah, Charlie. Track 3, you know, I do backing vocals.
kate_austen My friend Beth would freak. She loved you guys.
charlie_pace Give me Beth's number, I'll call her, I'd, I'd love to.
dr_jack_shephard Hey—
charlie_pace Does she live nearby?
kate_austen Have you ever heard of Drive Shaft?
charlie_pace You all everybody... You all every...body.
dr_jack_shephard We've got to keep moving.
kate_austen They were good.
charlie_pace They are good. We're still together. In the middle of a comeback.
charlie_pace Hey guys, is this normal? Kind of ... day turning into night, you know? End of the world type weather. Is this—guys?
hugo_reyes I don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
claire_littleton There it is again.
rose_nadler Oh my god.
dr_jack_shephard Well? Let's do this.
charlie_pace Let's get this trans…
dr_jack_shephard Transceiver.
charlie_pace Transceiver thing and get out of here.
dr_jack_shephard Come on! Come...
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
kate_austen Yeah. You?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
charlie_pace I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. Okay?
dr_jack_shephard Hey. You don't have to come up here.
kate_austen No, I'm good.
kate_austen So, what does a transceiver look like?
dr_jack_shephard Complicated walkie-talkie.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Can you hear me? I need that water. Here. Here you go. Hey.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 How many survived?
dr_jack_shephard At least 48. Does anything feel broken?
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. It's probably a concussion.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 How long has it been?
dr_jack_shephard Sixteen hours.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 Sixteen? Has anybody come?
dr_jack_shephard Not yet.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 Six hours in, our radio went out. No-one could see us. We turned back to land in Fiji. By the time we hit turbulence, we … we were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 We have a transceiver.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Good, that's what we were hoping. Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 No, no. I'm okay. It's okay. Transceiver's right there. It's right there.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Charlie?
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 It's not working.
kate_austen Charlie?
kate_austen What were you doing in the bathroom?
charlie_pace What?
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 What the hell was that?
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
kate_austen It's right outside.
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode01 What, what's right outside?
dr_jack_shephard Shhhh.
charlie_pace What the hell just happened?
kate_austen Jack, come on!
charlie_pace Just leave it!
charlie_pace Hey!
dr_jack_shephard Okay, let's run.
kate_austen J-J-J... Jaaaack! One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
charlie_pace Kate!
kate_austen Where the hell is Jack?
charlie_pace I don't know!
kate_austen Did you see him?
charlie_pace Yeah, he pulled me up!
kate_austen Where is he?
charlie_pace I don't know!
kate_austen How can you not know?
charlie_pace We got separated! Look, I … I fell down, and he, he came back for me, that thing was just…
kate_austen Did you see it?
charlie_pace No. No! But it was right there. We were dead! I was. An-And then Jack came back, and he, he pulled me up. I don't know where he is.
kate_austen We have to go back for him.
charlie_pace Go back? There? Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
kate_austen Then don't come.
charlie_pace Kate!
charlie_pace I heard you shout. I heard you shout "Jack". I'm Charlie, by the way.
charlie_pace What is that?
charlie_pace What is...
dr_jack_shephard It's the pilot.
kate_austen Did you see it?
dr_jack_shephard No. It was right behind me, but... I dove into the bushes.
charlie_pace Guys? How does something like that happen?
