CHRISTIAN Look here and here. You can see it's rotting out the spinal area, and plus all this extra dural growth -- I'm surprised it hasn't caused permanent ischemia.
ANGELO Digli di smettere di bisbigliare. Non sono un idiota. 
GABRIELA He says you don't need to talk in whispers. He knows he doesn't have a chance.
CHRISTIAN Your father appreciates candor.
GABRIELA We both do.
CHRISTIAN Well, then tell him I'm very sorry but he's not a candidate for surgery.
GABRIELA Papà, lui è come gli altri. Non lo farà. 
CHRISTIAN The way the tumor is situated on the spine, it's just not possible to remove it.
ANGELO Non ci proverà? Perché? 
GABRIELA He wants to know why you won't try.
CHRISTIAN Because what your father is looking for is not a surgical procedure. What he is looking for is a miracle.
ANGELO Signore, non sono venuto fino a qui per lei. Sono venuto qui per suo figlio. 
GABRIELA He said, "I did not come all this way for you, sir. I came for him .
JACK Ms. Busoni, I, uh...
GABRIELA You fixed someone with a crushed spinal column -- an impossible surgery -- and now she walks, yes? I consulted many medical journals before making this trip here.
CHRISTIAN Then you should know it's a very different case under very different circumstances.
GABRIELA But a miracle, right?
JACK Look, everything that my father's saying -- the risks, the unlikelihood -- he's absolutely right.
GABRIELA But will you try?
JACK I'll have to admit him in the next couple of weeks, run some tests.
ANGELO La ringrazio... tantissimo. 
JACK Locke!
JACK John.
MICHAEL Stay in there. Stay...
JACK Michael, what are you...?
MICHAEL Stay in there, Jack!
JACK Hey, whatever's going on...
MICHAEL Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son, and nobody is going to stop me, okay?! Okay, that is my right! That is a father's right!
JACK There's another way to go about this...
MICHAEL Get in the damn room!
JACK You going to shoot me, Michael?!
MICHAEL No, but I'll shoot your damn computer. Nothing is not what you think it is anyway. You don't understand, man. You don't have any idea. Now get in there!
JACK Michael, Michael, listen, we can do this together, okay? I'll come with you.
MICHAEL No, I have to do it. Now. I have to do it alone.
LOCKE What happened?
JACK Michael knocked you out. Look over here 
LOCKE Why would he...?
JACK He went after Walt. You feel nauseated, sick?
LOCKE No, I'm okay.
JACK Good. Give me a boost up.
LOCKE It's no use. I bolted it shut from the inside.
JACK You what?
LOCKE No point in changing the combination if you can get in through the air vent.
JACK That's really good thinking, John. You want to tell me why you let Michael in here?
LOCKE He wanted a gun -- for shooting practice.
JACK Shooting practice?
LOCKE The button. How long was I out?
JACK 20 minutes.
LOCKE We're on shift for the next 4 hours. There's nobody coming down here.
JACK Yeah, well, better hope Sawyer shows up to get his band-aid changed.
KATE Morning.
SAWYER Did you just throw a banana at me?
KATE Couldn't find any rocks.
SAWYER There are nicer ways to wake a man up, Freckles.
KATE Come on, it's time to go get your bandages changed.
SAWYER Why can't you do it for me?
KATE Because I'm not your nurse, and Jack's got the bandages.
SAWYER Of course he does. You want to give me a hand?
SAWYER Thanks.
KATE Come on.
SAWYER This place still creeps me out.
KATE You'll get used to it. Where is everybody? Jack! John!
SAWYER Maybe they went out for ice cream.
KATE Shhh. Jack!
JACK In here, in the armory. Michael locked us in here.
SAWYER What'd he say?
KATE I got it.
SAWYER Hope you got the combo, Doc.
LOCKE Right two times to 25.
SAWYER 25, got it.
LOCKE Left two times to 29. Right once to 40.
SAWYER Howdy, boys.
LOCKE What are you doing, Jack?
JACK Going after him. .
SAWYER Hey, what...? What happened?
LOCKE Michael went after Walt.
SAWYER Went after Walt?!
JACK Pulled a gun on me, put us both in there, and went after Walt. Hey, what are you doing?
SAWYER What does it look like? I'm coming with you.
JACK You're still on antibiotics.
SAWYER It's a good thing I'm traveling with my doctor, then.
GABRIELA How is he?
JACK I thought you'd gone home.
GABRIELA My home is a hotel room. I like it more here.
JACK I think you need to find a better hotel.
GABRIELA You didn't answer my question.
JACK His counts aren't where I'd like them to be.
GABRIELA You've been doing tests for a month now, Jack.
JACK I'm thorough.
GABRIELA I have a confession to make. I don't believe in miracles.
JACK Yeah, I guess I'm not too sure about them, either.
GABRIELA I bet your wife feels differently. Your wife, she's the woman you fixed, isn't she?
JACK Yes.
GABRIELA I'm thorough, too. She must be a very special person to let you work until 430 in the morning.
JACK I completely lost track of... I've got to... Will you excuse me?
GABRIELA Yes, of course, go. And Jack, thank you.
JACK Yeah, of course.
GABRIELA Good night.
JACK Good night.
SARAH Hey, how is he?
JACK Hey, sorry to wake you.
SARAH I had to get up anyway. So how is he?
JACK About the same. Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to... I just got...
SARAH Hey, that's the price of being a miracle-worker. 
JACK Where are you going?
SARAH I have to go to the gym and then I've got some papers to grade. I didn't want to say anything until I knew either way, but, um, I was late, so, I got a pregnancy test.
SARAH Don't worry. It's negative.
JACK Do you, um, want to talk about it?
SARAH What's to talk about?
JACK Sarah, I...
SARAH See you later, Jack.
JACK Well?
LOCKE Well, I can't tell you it's definitely Michael's, but it looks like his boot print.
KATE There's one over here, too.
LOCKE That sounds like a trail.
KATE You got a gun for me?
JACK You're not coming.
KATE Excuse me?
JACK You're not coming. Someone has to be here to take care of the button.
KATE So why should that person be me? I can track, carry a gun...
JACK You're not coming! You're staying. Alright?
JACK Let's go.
SAWYER What'd she do to you?
JACK What?
SAWYER Kate, what'd she do?
JACK She didn't do anything.
SAWYER Right, yelling at her because she wanted to help get Mike back makes a lot of sense.
JACK Why don't you go back and see if I hurt her feelings?
SAWYER I'm just saying.
JACK Yeah, I know, you love her.
SAWYER What'd you say?
JACK What?
LOCKE Does any of this look familiar from when you were coming back?
SAWYER Well, yeah, there's my favorite leaf. How could I forget this place?
JACK What's wrong?
LOCKE When you came across the island what side was the ocean on? You came from the east, Michael's heading north.
SAWYER What the hell's that supposed to mean?
JACK It means he's not going back to where you came from. He's heading somewhere else.
SUN 오늘 햇볕이 너무 따가워요. 
JIN 필요 없어. 
SUN 알아요. 그래도 그냥 쓰고 있어요. 
JIN 무슨 일이 있나봐. 
SUN Hello, Hurley.
HURLEY Hey. Cool hat, dude. 
SUN Is Kate alright?
HURLEY Uh, yeah. I guess Michael took off.
JIN 뭐라고 하는 거야? 
SUN What do you mean he took off?
HURLEY He stole some guns and he went all commando. He said he was going after Walt. Later dudes, gotta get to the hatch.
SUN 지금 뭐 하는 거에요? 
JIN 금방 떠났다니까 충분히 따라잡을 수 있을거야. 
SUN 당신 아무데도 못 가요. 못 간다니까? 여기서 한 발짝도 움직이지 마! 당신이 뗏목 타고 나갔을 때... 내가 얼마나 걱정했는 줄 알아요? 살아있는지, 죽었는지도 모르고... 정말 미쳐버리는 줄 알았어! 다시는 그러고 싶지 않아요. 
JIN 마이클은 내 친구야. 
SUN 나는 당신 아내에요. 
SAWYER Hey, Doc, you want to slow down -- take a break a minute?
LOCKE Good idea.
JACK He still heading north?
LOCKE Yep.
JACK Do you think he's lost?
LOCKE Doesn't seem to be. Trail's as straight as the interstate. The path of a man who knows where he's going. Where are you going, Jack?
JACK What?
LOCKE Well, let's say we catch up with him -- Michael. What are you going to do?
JACK I'm going to bring him back.
LOCKE What if he doesn't want to come back?
JACK I'll talk him into coming back.
LOCKE This is the second time he's gone after Walt. He knocked me out, he locked us both up. Something tells me he might be past listening to reason.
JACK What? You think we should just let him go -- write him off?
LOCKE Who are we to tell anyone what they can or can't do?
JACK It's not too late to go back. The tumor's aggressive, but your father could lead a very normal life for at least another year.
GABRIELA Go back? Go back where? Home? Have you changed your mind, Jack?
JACK No. No.
GABRIELA Is that it? Even if you don't succeed, you're giving us a chance. That's all we wanted.
JACK I'll come out and check on you before I scrub in.
GABRIELA Okay.
CHRISTIAN Am I interrupting?
GABRIELA No, I was just leaving. I'll see you in the morning.
JACK I'll see you in the morning. 
CHRISTIAN ITR reports need to be signed by you as Chief Resident.
JACK What?
CHRISTIAN Careful. There's a line, son. You know it's there. And pretending it's not -- that would be a mistake.
JACK Guess you would know.
CHRISTIAN It may be okay for some people, Jack. But not for you.
SAWYER Are you sure Mike went this way?
LOCKE Why do you ask?
SAWYER Oh, I don't know, Mr. Clean, I probably would have gone around Mt. Vesuvius.
LOCKE Why'd you pick that name?
SAWYER Ain't it obvious? All you need's an earring and a mop.
LOCKE No, your name. Why'd you pick Sawyer?
SAWYER What do you mean, pick?
LOCKE After the census Hurley gave me the flight manifest. Your name is James, right? James Ford.
SAWYER What's it to you?
LOCKE Just an interesting name to choose, is all. Who'd you get it from?
SAWYER Who says I got it from anybody?
JACK Michael!
LOCKE Jack, get down.
JACK Michael!
LOCKE Jack! Jack!
JACK Michael! Michael!
LOCKE Jack. 
JACK What? He's close.
LOCKE Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone you want them coming back?
SAWYER Personally, hell, yeah.
JACK You said these people were two days across the island.
SAWYER Yeah, and they took Cindy less than a mile from our camp.
LOCKE Over here. 
JACK Shell casings. How many?
LOCKE 3, Michael's.
SAWYER You boys deaf? I heard at least 7 shot. You heard it, Daniel Boone, what's your count?
LOCKE Yeah, 7 sounds about right.
SAWYER It's getting dark. Which way did Mike go?
SAWYER What?
JACK You out here for Michael, or -- is this pay back for getting shot?
SAWYER Why are you out here, Doc? You got your reasons and I got mine.
CHRISTIAN Jack. Jack!
JACK I had it!
CHRISTIAN I know, son.
JACK I got it! I got it all! I mean, I had it!
CHRISTIAN He was a sick old man on a table for 7 and half hours. His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.
JACK I've got to go tell her.
CHRISTIAN Yeah, well, I've already done that. Lest you forget, I am still Chief of Surgery.
JACK Where is she?
CHRISTIAN Maybe you should go home.
JACK Where is she?
CHRISTIAN She's gone. Jack, go home.
GABRIELA Jack?
JACK Gabriela, my father told me that you'd gone. I, uh -- I, uh --
GABRIELA Thank you. Thank you for trying. 
JACK I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
GABRIELA It's okay.
JACK I, I'm... I can't. 
SAWYER What do you mean you lost it?
LOCKE He's a man, not a boar. The sign's more subtle. I need light to follow it.
JACK  Here, light.
LOCKE I think we'd better head back.
SAWYER What?
JACK Just find the trail, John.
LOCKE I've lost the trail.
JACK You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
LOCKE Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running in the jungle toward the sound of gunfire because I don't care about Michael. 
JACK Don't turn around on me, John.
LOCKE You're not going to get him to come back and you know it.
JACK You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
TOM You're exactly right, Jack! But if I were you, I'd listen to Mr. Locke.
JACK Who are you?
SAWYER He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft. 
TOM Why don't you point the gun down?
TOM It'd probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides, gentlemen.
JACK Where's Michael?
TOM Don't worry about Michael. He's not going to find us.
JACK What do you want?
TOM Why don't you build us a fire, John? I think it's time we all had a talk.
HURLEY Geronimo Jackson?
CHARLIE Well, hooo, as an expert in all things musical -- I've never heard of these guys, shocking as that may be. Geronimo Jackson?
HURLEY This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.
HURLEY So what do you think's the story with that Libby chick?
CHARLIE The story?
HURLEY She's kind of cute, right? You know, in a I've-been-terrorized-by-the-Others-for-40-days kind of way.
CHARLIE Yeah, there is that.
HURLEY I think I have a chance with her. I mean, it's the classic desert island scenario. If I ever had a shot, this is it.
CHARLIE Do you think Claire's missed me yet?
HURLEY Dude, it's been a day.
SAYID This music is quite depressing.
HURLEY We can change it, dude. Did you ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?
SAYID I'm afraid not. Where's Jack and Locke?
HURLEY Oh, they went after Michael.
SAYID Michael?
CHARLIE Yeah, he's run after Walt again. Everyone's gone to bring him back.
SAYID Who's everyone?
HURLEY Everyone -- Jack, Sawyer, Locke. Oh, and Kate.
TOM Just sit down, Jack. Nobody's going to hurt you. I come in peace.
LOCKE How do you know our names? 
JACK You took Walt.
TOM Walt's fine. He's a very special boy.
JACK Look, you said you wanted to talk. Talk.
TOM Let me ask you something. How long you been here on the island?
JACK 50 days.
TOM Oooo, 50 days. That's what -- almost 2 whole months, huh? Tell me, you go over a man's house for the first time, do you take off your shoes? Do you put your feet up on his coffee table? Do you walk in the kitchen, eat food that doesn't belong to you? Open the door to rooms you got no business opening? You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said "Since the dawn of our species man's been blessed with curiosity." You know the other one about curiosity don't you, Jack? This is not your island. This is our island. And the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it.
JACK I don't believe you.
TOM You don't believe what?
JACK I think you've got one guy up there with a gun. I think there's more of us than there are of you. I think if you had any real strength, you wouldn't have had to send a spy -- Ethan.
TOM That's an interesting theory. Light 'em up!
TOM We've got a misunderstanding, Jack -- your people, my people. So listen carefully. Right here, there's a line. You cross that line, we go from misunderstanding to something else. Now, give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
JACK No.
LOCKE Jack, maybe...
JACK No!
TOM I hoped it wouldn't come to this. Bring her out, Alex!
TOM She was following you. Like I said -- curiosity. 
TOM Don't. -- Jack, the decision you gotta make right now is this -- can you live with the fact that I shot this woman right in front of you when you could have saved her life by giving up and going home? Or are you going to give me your guns, turn around and walk away. It's your call, Jack.
SAWYER You touch a hair on her head, I'll...
TOM Shut up! I'm going to count to 3. 1, 2...
JACK Stop.
TOM Now them.
TOM Give me the other one, too.
SAWYER You and me ain't done, Zeke.
KATE Jack, I, uh...
JACK You alright?
KATE Yep.
SUN 혼자 여기서 뭐해? 
JIN 잠이 오지 않아서... 
SUN 사람들은 돌아 왔어요? 
JIN 아직... 자기야. 이래라저래라 하는거 내가 제일 싫어하는 거 알지? 
SUN 지난 4년 동안, 난 항상 그렇게 살아왔어요. 당신이 싫은 것처럼, 나도 싫어. 
JIN 그래. 당신도 그랬을 거야. 
KATE I was just trying to help, Jack. When you told me not to go, I just... I made a mistake. Hey, could you just talk to me for a second. -- I'm sorry.
JACK Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
JACK Hey.
SARAH Hey. How did it go?
JACK He died.
SARAH I'm sorry.
JACK Yeah, me too. Who was over?
SARAH My mom.
JACK The bridge game okay?
SARAH Oh yeah, she's on a streak. Did you eat?
JACK Yeah. No, it's uh, it's late. I'm fine.
SARAH You don't have to do that.
JACK It's therapeutic -- cheaper than a shrink.
SARAH How did the daughter take it? What's her name, Gabriela?
JACK She kissed me. Yeah, she... she kissed me and I kissed her back. I, I don't know. I don't know how it happened. I made a mistake. I made a mistake and this is my fault. It's my fault that you and me... I haven't been here. Sarah, I mean, we don't even talk anymore. I hate what's happening to us and I promise you that things are going to be different. I'm going to, I'm going to work less. I'm going to be here for you. Okay? I'm going to fix this. We're going to go back to the way things were. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix this.
SARAH Jack. Jack, I'm leaving you.
JACK What?
SARAH I was already leaving you. That's why my mother was here. She was helping me pack. I've been seeing someone -- someone else. I have to... I can't stay.
JACK Sarah.
SARAH You, you will always need something to fix. -- Goodbye.
LOCKE See ya, James.
SAWYER Don't beat yourself up, Freckles. If he'd told me to stay behind, I'd have done the same damn thing.
LOCKE What's the matter? What's the matter with your little foot? Hi. Hi.
CLAIRE Who's that? 
LOCKE Uh-oh, you don't like old Uncle Johnny.
CLAIRE What is he doing to your toe?
ANA Hey, go away. I barely have enough food to feed myself. Here.
JACK I see you found a new friend.
ANA Progress. I hear you were out looking for Michael.
JACK Yeah.
ANA He ran off looking for his kid again? Not much you can do about that then.
JACK Is it true that you killed one of them?
ANA One of who?
JACK Them. Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
ANA I was a cop.
JACK Can I ask you something?
ANA Shoot.
JACK How long do you think it would take to train an army?
