DAVID Morning.
JACK Morning.
DAVID I made breakfast.
JACK You know, technically, opening a box of cereal is not making breakfast.
DAVID So, you're coming to the concert tonight, right?
JACK Absolutely... Is your mom coming, too?
DAVID Yeah... Why?... You're not gonna get all weird, are you?
JACK Why would I get weird?
DAVID Just don't get weird.
JACK I won't.
CLAIRE Morning.
JACK Morning.
DAVID Morning... You want some cereal?
CLAIRE Um, sure. Thanks.
JACK How you feeling?
CLAIRE Uh, pretty good. I mean, he kicks like crazy at night, so...
JACK Jack Shephard.
MAN Hello, Mr. Shephard. Uh, this is Oceanic Airlines calling to inform you that we've, um, we've located your missing cargo.
JACK My father's coffin--you found it?
MAN Yes, sir. It will be arriving in Los Angeles by the end of the day.
JACK That's, uh, that's great news. Thank you.
MAN Of, course, sir. We at Oceanic are very sorry it's taken so long. Good day, sir.
JACK It's the best I could do, and it's gonna hurt a bit.
JACK The bullet went straight through, but if I don’t do this, it's gonna get infected.
KATE 
JACK I'm sorry.
KATE They had a little girl, you know. Her name was Ji Yeon... Jin hadn't even met her yet... Locke did this to them. We have to kill him, Jack.
JACK I know.
JACK We should get going, now.
HURLEY Go where?
JACK Before Sayid died, he said that Desmond was in a well. If Locke wants Desmond dead, then we're gonna need him.
TEENAGE GIRL Welcome back, Mr. Locke. It's good to see you.
LOCKE Thank you. You, too.
BEN Hey! Don't you dare! It's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke. Someone call the police right now!
BEN I saw what you did. I'm making a citizen's arrest.
DESMOND Do not get in my way.
BEN Don't you--
BEN I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!
DESMOND I'm not here to hurt him, I'm here to help him let go.
BEN Who are you?
DESMOND You wanna know who I am?
MILES You sure this is a shortcut, huh?
BEN I lived in these houses a long time, Miles. I think I can remember how to get there.
MILES Well, I lived in these house 30 years before you did; otherwise known as last week...and I have no idea where the hell we are.
BEN Guess it's a good thing, you're following me.
RICHARD You mind if ask how much explosive you have access to, Ben?
BEN More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
RICHARD Been a long time. You sure it's still there?
BEN It's C-4, Richard. I put some thought into hiding it.
MILES Let me guess--cookie jar.
BEN Don't be ridiculous... It's in my secret room behind the bookcase.
BEN What's wrong?
MILES It's just--I--you know, I get wonky around dead stuff.
BEN Do you have something you wanna share with us, Miles?
MILES I-I don't think...
BEN What is it?
RICHARD It's Alex... It's your daughter... After you left, I buried her.
BEN Thank you, Richard.
MILES What's that? A secreter room?
BEN It's where I was told I could summon the monster. That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.
BEN Okay. Richard, it's your idea. Are we looking to cripple the plane or blow it to hell?
RICHARD Blow it to hell.
BEN Then we'd better take it all.
RICHARD Don't move! Show me your hands.
ZOE Calm down. It's-it's okay.
BEN Who the hell are you?
WIDMORE She's with me.
WIDMORE Hello, Benjamin... May I come in?
BEN What are you doing here?
WIDMORE Put the gun down, Benjamin. Go to the dock. Take our equipment from the outrigger and then sink it.
ZOE You got it.
BEN She's not going anywhere. If you don't answer me, I swear--
WIDMORE If you shoot me then your last chance of survival will be gone. Go. He won't do anything.
WIDMORE What are you doing here, Richard?
RICHARD We're getting explosives to destroy the plane on the other island.
WIDMORE Why would you want to do that?
BEN None of your damned business.
WIDMORE I've had that plane rigged with explosives since I got here. As usual, Benjamin, I'm three steps ahead of you.
BEN How did you get back here, Charles?
WIDMORE Jacob invited me.
BEN That's a lie. You’ve never even seen Jacob.
WIDMORE I most certainly have. He visited me, not long after your people destroyed my freighter. He convinced me of the error of my ways; and told me everything I needed to know for this exact purpose.
BEN What purpose?
ZOE Charles?
WIDMORE Yes.
ZOE It's Locke. He's coming.
WIDMORE Has he seen you?
ZOE No, I don't think so. Our boat is still there. I didn't have time to--
WIDMORE Run! Get back here as fast as you can. If you don't want to die, we need to hide.
NURSE This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.
BEN It's Doctor Linus, actually.
NURSE I'll go get you an ice pack.
JOHN Dr. Linus? Are you all right? I heard there was a--an incident in the parking lot.
BEN I guess I got into a fight.
JOHN A fight? With who?
BEN I saw the man that ran you down, Mr. Locke. He was back. I approached him, and he just attacked me. And then the strangest thing happened. While he was beating me, I think--I think I saw something. What are you doing?
JOHN I'm calling the police.
BEN You may not want to do that. 
JOHN Well, why wouldn't I want to?
BEN The man told me that he wasn't trying to hurt you. He told me that he was trying to get you to let go.
OFFICER L.A.P.D.
BEN And for some reason, I believed him.
OFFICER Hello, L.A.P.D.
BEN Do you have any idea what he was talking about, Mr. Locke? Does that mean something to you?
OFFICER Hello? L.A.P.D.
DESMOND Excuse me... Um, I'd like to see a detective, please.
SAWYER What's with the getup? Somebody die?
MILES The benefit at my dad's museum. The concert I've been telling you about all week? Ring a bell?
SAWYER Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about.
MILES You can still be my date, if you want to.
SAWYER That red-headed chick that hates me gonna be there?
MILES Charlotte? Yeah.
SAWYER Yeah, pass.
OFFICER Detective Ford, this guy's got something to tell ya.
SAWYER Yeah?
DESMOND Um...there was a hit and run a few days ago at Washington Tustin High School and then this morning, one of the teachers there was--was beaten badly by the--by the same suspect.
SAWYER Yeah? And?
DESMOND I'm the suspect.
SAWYER Thanks for saving the taxpayers the trouble of hunting you down.
DESMOND You're welcome. Good afternoon.
DESMOND And how are you doing today?
KATE Terrific.
JACK Any idea exactly where this well is?
SAWYER Sayid said it was close to our camp, about an hour away... If Locke wanted Desmond dead, why didn't he just kill him?
JACK Who knows? Maybe it's one of his rules.
SAWYER The bomb on the sub...you said he couldn't kill us.
JACK I've been wrong before.
SAWYER I killed them, didn't I?
JACK No. He killed them.
KATE You all right?
HURLEY Yeah. I'm fine.
KATE Okay.
HURLEY Ahh!
YOUNG JACOB Give me the ashes.
HURLEY What? Who are you?
YOUNG JACOB Give me the ashes you took from Ilana's things after she died. I know they're in your pocket.
HURLEY Why?
YOUNG JACOB Because they're mine.
HURLEY What do you want them for?
HURLEY Hey!
JACOB Hello, Hugo.
HURLEY Dude...I've been waiting for you to show up. Where you been?
JACOB Doesn't matter. I'm here now.
HURLEY Did you see a kid run by here with your ashes?
JACOB My ashes are right there in that fire... When it burns out, you'll never see me again.
HURLEY Uh, what?
JACOB You should get your friends... We're very close to the end, Hugo.
ZOE Charles, let's go.
WIDMORE There's no time. Linus has a hidden room, come on... What are you waiting for?
BEN I'm not interested in hiding. He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway. I'd rather have it over with.
MILES These are both great plans, but I'm gonna go with surviving... If you need us, we'll be running through the jungle.
BEN Miles, wait. Give me your walkie-talkies.
WIDMORE Why?
BEN Because I asked. Thank you. In case I need you...
WIDMORE He's gonna kill you. You know that.
BEN Then I guess this is goodbye.
BEN Care to join me outside while I wait for the inevitable?
RICHARD I-I'm gonna talk to him. I know this man. All he wants is for me to join him, and if I can get him to leave with me, maybe that'll give the rest of you a chance.
MILES Good luck with that.
RICHARD Ugh!
LOCKE Just the man I was looking for.
BEN Well, you found me.
BEN Can I get you a glass of lemonade?
LOCKE I need you...to kill some people for me, Ben.
BEN And...why would I do that?
LOCKE Because once I leave this island, you can have it all to yourself.
BEN All right.
LOCKE Good... Now whose outrigger is that down at the dock?
BEN I believe it's Charles Widmore's.
LOCKE And do you know where I might find him?
BEN He's hiding in my closet.
ALEX Oh, my God. Hey, Dr. Linus.
BEN Hello, Alex.
ALEX Oh, my God. What happened?
BEN I found myself confronting someone that had a bit of a temper.
ALEX What? Why would someone want to hurt you? You're, like, the--the nicest guy ever.
BEN Guess they had me confused with somebody else.
ALEX Well, you shouldn't be driving. My mom’s waiting for me over there. Let us give you a ride home.
BEN Oh, no, I'm not going to be any trouble to you.
ALEX Dr. Linus, please... You've got one hand. You look like Napoleon.
BEN Excellent point.
ALEX Hey, Mom! Is it okay if we give Dr. Linus a ride home?
ROUSSEAU Of course. After everything you have done for my daughter, a ride is the least we can do. I'm Danielle.
BEN Benjamin Linus.
ALEX Hey, Mom, can Dr. Linus come over for dinner? It's coq au vin night.
BEN Oh, that's really not necessary--
ROUSSEAU No, we insist. Even if we have to kidnap you. Here, please.
ROUSSEAU Do you mind getting that plate? Dr. Linus...thank you. It's so nice to be able to cook for someone other than Alex.
BEN If you don't mind my asking, where is her father?
ROUSSEAU He died when Alex was 2.
BEN Oh.
ROUSSEAU That's probably why she's so attached to you.
BEN Excuse me?
ROUSSEAU All the interest you've taken in her. All the help you've given...you're the closest thing to a father she's ever had.
ROUSSEAU Are you... are you all right?
BEN I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.
ROUSSEAU Oh, I'll put in less next time.
BEN After you... Charles and his lady friend are in here... She's armed. But I'm guessing that's not a problem for you.
LOCKE Wait out here... You don't need to see this.
BEN I want to see this.
BEN Sorry, Charles.
LOCKE What a pleasant surprise. How nice to be able to talk without those fences between us. And who might you be?
ZOE Zoe. My name is Zoe. I--
WIDMORE Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.
WIDMORE Why would you do that?
LOCKE You told her not to talk to me. That made her pointless... Now, Charles, it's clear you're not afraid to die. So, there's only one way to motivate you to tell me what I want to know. Soon, this will all be over. I'll get what I want. And I'll finally leave this island. And when I do, the first thing I'm going to do is kill your daughter...Penny.
WIDMORE You'll kill her whether I talk to you or not.
LOCKE No, I won't. I give you my word.
WIDMORE And I'm supposed to take your word?
LOCKE You tell me why you came back here and I won't hurt your daughter.
WIDMORE I brought Desmond Hume back here because of his unique resistance to electromagnetism. He was a measure of last resort.
LOCKE What do you mean, "last resort"?
WIDMORE I'm not saying any more in front of him.
LOCKE Well, then whisper to me. Hmm?
BEN He doesn't get to save his daughter.
LOCKE Ben...you never cease to amaze me. Fortunately, he had already told me what I needed to know. So, no harm done.
BEN Good... Did you say there were some other people to kill?
JACOB Hello, Kate... James... Jack.
HURLEY He's right there by the fire, he says hello...
JACK I heard him.
HURLEY What, you can see him?
JACK Yeah, I can see him.
HURLEY Kate? Sawyer? You, too? 
KATE So, you're the one who wrote our names on the wall.
JACOB I am.
KATE Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah--you wrote their names on the wall?
JACOB Yes.
KATE Is that why they're dead?
JACOB I'm very sorry.
KATE You're sorry?
HURLEY Kate.
KATE No, I wanna know why. I wanna know that Sun and Jin and Sayid didn't die for nothing.
JACOB Come and sit down and I'll tell you what they died for... I'll tell you why I chose them...and why I chose you. And then I'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting this island, because by the time that fire burns out, one of you is gonna have to start doing it.
WOMAN P.A. VOICE Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4. Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4.
JOHN You got a minute?
JACK Mr. Locke, yes. Yes, come on in.
JOHN Is that your son?
JACK Yes, that's, uh, last Thanksgiving.
JOHN He looks just like you.
JACK Don't tell him that... So, what can I do for you, Mr. Locke?
JOHN Dr. Shephard, you and I were on the same plane from Sydney. You gave me your card, and...the next day I threw it away, no offense.
JACK None taken.
JOHN Anyway...then a few days later I get hit by a car. And of all the doctors in Los Angeles, I ended up with you. Then a-after you save my life, you still want to fix me and I still don't wanna be fixed. Okay. Then...the man who ran me down shows up at my school today, again. He beat up a teacher in the parking lot. But, do you know what he said to him? He said that he wasn't there to hurt me, he was there to help me "let go," which is exactly the same thing that you said to me the last time we saw each other.
JACK I'm sorry. Are--are you saying that I sent this man to run you down?
JOHN No. No. No. No. No. But --but what if all this...maybe this is happening for a reason. Maybe you're supposed to fix me.
JACK Mr. Locke, I want to fix you, but I think you're mistaking coincidence for fate.
JOHN You can call it whatever you want, but here I am. And I--I think I'm ready to get out of this chair.
JACOB I don't really know where to start.
HURLEY How about why you brought us to the Island?
JACOB I brought all of you here because I made a mistake. A mistake I made a very long time ago, and now, because of that there's a very good chance that every single one of you and everyone you've ever cared about is going to die.
SAWYER What mistake?
JACOB You call him "The Monster." But I'm responsible for what happened to him. I made him that way. And ever since then he's been trying to kill me. It was only a matter of time before he figured out how, and when he did, someone would have to replace me. And that's why I brought you all here.
SAWYER Tell me something, Jacob. Why do I gotta be punished for your mistake? What made you think you could mess with my life? I was doin' just fine til you dragged my ass to this damn rock.
JACOB No, you weren't. None of you were. I didn't pluck any of you out of a happy existence. You were all flawed. I chose you because you were like me. You were all alone. You were all looking for something that you couldn't find out there. I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you.
KATE Why did you cross my name off of your wall?
JACOB Because you became a mother. It's just a line of chalk in a cave. The job is yours if you want it, Kate.
JACK What is the job?
JACOB There's a light at the center of the Island. You have to make sure it never goes out. That's how you protect it.
SAWYER Your monster friend said there is nothing to protect it from.
JACOB Hmm. You have to protect it from him... You must do what I couldn't. What I wasn't able to do.
JACK You want us to kill him? Is that even possible?
JACOB I hope so, because he is certainly going to try to kill you.
HURLEY So...how you gonna pick?
JACOB I'm not going to pick, Hugo. I want you to have the one thing that I was never given--a choice.
KATE And if none of us chooses it?
JACOB Then this ends very badly.
JACK I'll do it... This is why I’m here. This is... this is what I'm supposed to do.
JACOB Is that a question, Jack?
JACK No.
JACOB Good... Then it's time.
SAWYER And I thought that guy had a God complex before.
KATE James.
SAWYER Yeah, I know.
HURLEY I'm just glad it's not me.
JACOB Do you remember that bamboo field you woke up in when you first got here?
JACK Yeah.
JACOB Beyond that field, across the ridge, is the heart of the island. That's where the light is... That's where he's trying to go. And that's what you have to protect.
JACK Past the bamboo? There's nothing out there.
JACOB Yes, there is, Jack. And now you'll be able to get there... Do you have a cup?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, actually I do.
JACOB Nam non accipimus hoc quasi vulgarem potionem, sed ut ille sit quasi unus mecum.
JACOB Drink this.
JACK How long am I gonna have to do this job?
JACOB As long as you can.
JACOB Now, you're like me.
SAWYER All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume. Little lady next door is Austen. It's been real nice having y'all...but you're shipping off to county. So best of luck and Vaya con Dios.
AUSTEN You could still let me go.
SAWYER Why the hell would I do that?
AUSTEN Because I told you I was innocent. And you believe me.
SAWYER Doesn't matter. Still can't let you go, I'm a cop.
AUSTEN You don't seem like a cop to me.
SAWYER Nice knowin' ya.
MAN 1-F-21 responding.
DESMOND Think it's time to leave.
KATE What?
DESMOND I said, I think it's time to leave. You ready to get out of here?
KATE I'm sorry. Who are you?
SAYID He's a crazy person who turned himself in.
KATE What'd you turn yourself in for?
DESMOND I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.
SAYID You see what I mean?
DESMOND All right. I'm crazy. But do you want to get out of here or not?
KATE So, what, are you just gonna tell the driver to stop?
DESMOND The driver already knows where to stop. But when that happens you're gonna have to give me your trust.
SAYID Our trust?
DESMOND That's right? Because after I set you free, I'm gonna ask each of you to do something, and you're gonna have to promise me that you'll do it. So what do you say?
SAYID Oh, absolutely, I promise.
DESMOND How about you?
KATE Okay, sure.
DESMOND All right, then.
ANA LUCIA Who's Hume?
DESMOND That's me.
ANA LUCIA Where's your friend with my money? Otherwise I'm gonna have to say I shot all of you trying to escape.
DESMOND Don't worry. He'll be here.
DESMOND All right here he comes.
HURLEY Sorry I'm late, dude.
DESMOND Don't worry about it.
HURLEY Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana Lucia was gonna be here.
ANA LUCIA Do I know you, tubby?
HURLEY Oh, no. We never met. Anyways, here's your money. A hundred twenty-five grand, right?
ANA LUCIA Yeah, that's right. Nice not knowing you.
HURLEY She's not coming with us?
DESMOND No, she's not ready yet.
HURLEY I brought you my Camaro. The keys are under the floor mat. Everything else you need's in the trunk.
DESMOND All right, good... Um, you know where you're taking them, yeah?
HURLEY Absolutely.
DESMOND All right, well, we should get going. Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.
KATE What do you mean, I'm with you?
DESMOND We... are going to a concert. Let's go.
BEN Hey, can I ask you something?
LOCKE Shoot.
BEN If you can turn yourself into smoke whenever you want, why do you bother walking?
LOCKE I like the feel of my feet on the ground. Reminds me that I was human... We're here.
BEN Are you thirsty?
LOCKE This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.
BEN What's the matter?
LOCKE I sent Sayid to kill Desmond, and obviously, he didn't.
BEN Looks like someone helped him out.
LOCKE No, Ben. Someone helped me out.
BEN What did Widmore say to you?
LOCKE He said Desmond was a fail-safe. Jacob's last resort in case, God forbid, I managed to kill all of his beloved candidates. One final way to make sure that I never leave this place.
BEN Then...why are you happy that he's still alive?
LOCKE Because I'm gonna find Desmond, and when I do, he's gonna help me do the one thing that I could never do myself. I'm gonna destroy the island.
