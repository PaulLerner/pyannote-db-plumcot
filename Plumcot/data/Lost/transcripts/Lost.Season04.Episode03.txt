dr_jack_shephard Did Ben ever mention knowing anyone off the island? You're sure of that?
dr_juliet_burke No.
miles_straume Look, this is real simple. Do you know where he is or don't you?
dr_jack_shephard What do you want with him?
miles_straume I want to locate him.
miles_straume The people who hired me told me his name’s Benjamin Linus, I don't know anything else. They gave me the picture, that's all they told me.
miles_straume They told me "find him," and for what they're paying me I don't need to know anything else, do you?
dr_jack_shephard Okay, you want Ben. He's with Locke, and your friend—
miles_straume Charlotte.
dr_jack_shephard Charlotte. John's got her, too. And we know where they're headed.
miles_straume Locke’s the guy who killed Naomi. Give me back my gun, Shepherd.
dr_jack_shephard You want your gun back? I want answers.
dr_jack_shephard You don’t trust me, I don't trust you.
miles_straume You're supposed to be dead. But am I asking a million questions? No. We both have the same problem, this Locke guy.
kate_austen Even if Locke has your friend, you can’t just waltz in there and grab her. They're armed.
miles_straume Well how 'bout that? So are we! So why don't we move out?
sayid_jarrah You're not going anywhere. Will that helicopter fly?
frank_lapidus It's what she does.
sayid_jarrah Then you can take me to your ship.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, wait a second.
sayid_jarrah We did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we?
sayid_jarrah Well?
frank_lapidus We burned a lot of fuel coming in, it can't carry much weight. I'll take three of you.
miles_straume In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took Charlotte prisoner.
sayid_jarrah I can bring her back. Safely. And if I do, will you take me to the ship?
frank_lapidus Absolutely. You bring Charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Good morning.
sayid_jarrah Good morning.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Long walk to the next hole. Want a ride?
sayid_jarrah Thank you, but no. My ball is right here.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 You know, you are the first person I have seen out here all morning.
sayid_jarrah I believe we are paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 That we are.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Is this your first time in the Seychelles? Uh-uh, I'd use the 5-iron.
sayid_jarrah I think I'll stick with the 7.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Tell you what. Fifty Euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.
sayid_jarrah Let's make it 100.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Eccelente. Amazing, huh? How a wager makes just about anything more fun.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Not bad, not bad. So, what do you do for a living, my friend?
sayid_jarrah I do nothing.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Nothing? That doesn't pay for a vacation here.
sayid_jarrah I was the recipient of a large settlement.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Corporate merger?
sayid_jarrah Actually, a plane crash. Oceanic Airlines flight 8-1-5. I'm Sayid Jarrah, one of the Oceanic Six.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Ah, that's— that's amazing. I remember reading all about it.
sayid_jarrah Take your shot, my friend.
sayid_jarrah It appears you were right about the 5-iron.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 1 Well, uh, enjoy your round, don't worry about the wager. All in good fun.
sayid_jarrah No, you won. Allow me to pay you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 No, it's fine. Thank you, it's—
sayid_jarrah I insist, Mr. Avellino.
sayid_jarrah Ist frei?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 Wohin möchten Sie gehen?
sayid_jarrah "Is it free" was the full extent of my German.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 What are you looking for?
sayid_jarrah I love Europe. Everyone speaks English. I'm looking for Potsdamer Platz.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 You don't need a map. It's one block down right across the street.
sayid_jarrah Thank you.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 I'm Elsa.
sayid_jarrah Sayid.
WAITER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 Kann ich Ihnen etwas bringen?
sayid_jarrah Could I have an espresso, please.
WAITER#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 Ja, sofort.
elsa What sort of business brings you to Berlin?
sayid_jarrah I'm a headhunter. A corporate recruiter. What do you do?
elsa My employer is an economist. He works in emerging markets. Actually, I don't really understand what he does; which doesn't matter, since all I do is shop for him. If this goes off, I'm at his side instantly. Which is wonderful, since he's only in Berlin once or twice a year.
sayid_jarrah Which is why you are enjoying a luxuriously long mid-day coffee.
elsa Yes.
sayid_jarrah Danke.
elsa Do I... know you from somewhere?
sayid_jarrah I'll tell you exactly where you know me from... if you let me take you to dinner.
elsa Mm... This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight. 800. Well — if you can find it.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Hello?
sayid_jarrah I made contact.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Good.
sayid_jarrah Take a look at this.
sayid_jarrah Naomi had it with her.
sayid_jarrah She was looking for Desmond. Whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it. Maybe Desmond can shed some light on this.
dr_jack_shephard How long would it take to get to the beach and back?
dr_juliet_burke A couple of hours.
dr_jack_shephard You mind?
dr_juliet_burke Anything I can do to help.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, so how are we going to do this?
sayid_jarrah You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.
dr_jack_shephard And what kind of mission is that?
sayid_jarrah I'm going to make Locke release Charlotte. And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.
dr_jack_shephard As opposed to the way I'd do it.
sayid_jarrah The last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
sayid_jarrah That's not good diplomacy.
miles_straume Hey, Jarrah, you think you're going after Charlotte without me?
sayid_jarrah Of course not.
miles_straume Oh. Well, good.
sayid_jarrah Is there anything else?
miles_straume Yeah, give me my gun back.
sayid_jarrah We leave in 10 minutes.
james_ford You ready to give us the name, Gizmo?
john_locke He's not going to tell you who his spy is on their boat, James.
james_ford Yeah, why not?
john_locke Because that's the only thing keeping him alive.
james_ford Well here's an idea Why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe, send that little piggy to market.
james_ford And if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef. Now why don’t we do that?
john_locke Because then we'd have to carry him.
claire_littleton Hey, John, how much further is it? I need to feed Aaron.
john_locke It should be here, the cabin.
hugo_reyes Maybe we got turned around. It could be anywhere.
john_locke No, it was here.
james_ford Well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?
ben_linus John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
john_locke I guess I was mistaken. It doesn't matter, the plan's the same. We keep moving. The Barracks aren't far.
danielle_rousseau If her team is with Jack's group, they know we're going to the Barracks.
james_ford Yeah, and Red here was wearing a vest. Which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gun fight.
hugo_reyes If all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go? I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide. Why do we need to take prisoners?
john_locke We're keeping her because she’s gonna be valuable.
hugo_reyes How's she going to be valuable?
dr_charlotte_lewis He means as a hostage, love.
hugo_reyes Nuh uh, no, that's not what I signed up for.
john_locke What did you sign up for, Hugo?
hugo_reyes Look, I'm just saying that if we let her go, they'll look at is as a sign of good faith.
john_locke They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be.
hugo_reyes I'm just trying to come up with some kind of compromise—
john_locke We're beyond compromise. And right now, Hugo, I'm making the decisions. Is that going to be a problem for you?
kate_austen Kinda sucks, huh?
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
kate_austen Being told not to come along. Now you know what it feels like to be me.
dr_jack_shephard Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and go anyway?
kate_austen Touché.
dr_jack_shephard You should go with them, Kate.
kate_austen Are you serious?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen What, don't you trust Sayid?
dr_jack_shephard I don't trust Locke.
kate_austen So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to Naomi?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer won't let him.
kate_austen Got room for one more?
miles_straume Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.
sayid_jarrah Gun's a last resort, Kate.
kate_austen You give Locke that same speech?
miles_straume Hey. Let's move out.
frank_lapidus Hey, this guy Sayid — where's he from?
dr_jack_shephard Iraq.
frank_lapidus Iraq? He's just gonna go and work everything out? What was he, a diplomat?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, he was a torturer.
sayid_jarrah Naomi, were you close to her?
miles_straume Nope. Met her on the boat.
sayid_jarrah You don't seem particularly affected by her death.
miles_straume Sure I'm affected. She was hot and I dug her accent.
kate_austen Nice.
sayid_jarrah And this woman, Charlotte. You don't really care about her, do you?
miles_straume Define care.
sayid_jarrah So much for camaraderie.
miles_straume Yeah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns? Actually, I do care about Locke. Maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half.
sayid_jarrah There was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us... or kill us.
miles_straume And which side did you land on?
sayid_jarrah I let you know when I decide.
elsa You look fantastic.
elsa This is why I wanted to take you to the opera.
sayid_jarrah If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother?
elsa You know what? I'm not bringing it. If tonight's the night he calls, so be it.
sayid_jarrah I'll carry it. If he does call, I don't want you fired over me. You should tell your employer that there is newer technology.
elsa Well, I've tried. He's very old-fashioned. You know how bosses can be. Do you have a boss?
sayid_jarrah Everyone has a boss, Elsa.
sayid_jarrah Come on, we don't want to be late.
elsa Why are you still here? When we met, you said you would only be in Berlin for one week.
sayid_jarrah The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.
elsa Oh. Right. I was hoping it was because of me.
sayid_jarrah Let's go. Strauss awaits.
dr_jack_shephard What's his story?
frank_lapidus Daniel?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
frank_lapidus Couldn't tell ya. Half the stuff he says goes way over my head; the other half goes way, way over.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, uh, Frank? Could I, uh, sorry to interrupt. May I please use the phone, just for a second?
frank_lapidus For what?
dr_daniel_faraday I just wanna call Regina on the boat. I figured since we're waiting, I could just, you know, try to—
frank_lapidus What is it, Daniel?
dr_daniel_faraday I'd just like to do an experiment. Just, uh...
frank_lapidus Sure. You just keep it to that science stuff, alright?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah.
frank_lapidus If Minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, thank you.
regina Hello?
dr_daniel_faraday Regina? Hey, hi, it's Dan. Hang on.
dr_daniel_faraday Can you hear me?
regina Yeah.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, hang on.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm all, yes, I'm all set here, I have a fix. Are you locked in?
regina Getting your signal pretty clear.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh, okay, great, then. OK. Fire the payload.
regina Payload away.
frank_lapidus Don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.
regina Forty kilometers to beacon. Thirty-five kilometers to beacon. Thirty kilometers to beacon. Twenty-five kilometers to beacon. Twenty kilometers to beacon.
regina Fifteen kilometers to beacon. Ten kilometers to beacon.
dr_daniel_faraday Regina?
regina Five kilometers to beacon.
dr_daniel_faraday Huh.
regina Zero.
dr_daniel_faraday I don't have it.
regina That's weird.
dr_daniel_faraday That is far more than weird.
miles_straume What's with the swing set? These people have daycare?
kate_austen You think they're here yet?
sayid_jarrah Let's find out.
kate_austen It's coming from in there.
kate_austen Hurley, what happened?
hugo_reyes They left me.
hugo_reyes Locke's gone off the reservation, man. I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said Walt was the one who told him to kill the other chick, and, and he—
sayid_jarrah Walt?
hugo_reyes Dude, don't ask. I was, like, just trying to argue with him, so he would just like, you know, chill, but—
miles_straume How about you stop babbling and just tell us what happened to them? Where are they?
hugo_reyes Who are you?
miles_straume Where the hell did they go, Tubby?
hugo_reyes Oh, awesome. The ship sent us another Sawyer.
sayid_jarrah Hurley, where did they go?
hugo_reyes Look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know.
kate_austen So they all left, all together?
hugo_reyes Yeah, they were freaked. Locke said the people on the ship were here to rescue Charlotte and then kill us. So... are you?
miles_straume Not yet.
sayid_jarrah Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?
hugo_reyes Um, Locke said they were gonna go by Ben's house before they took off.
sayid_jarrah Why would they go there?
hugo_reyes For all I know, they could have locked Ben up in a closet too.
miles_straume Where's Ben's house?
dr_jack_shephard Mind if I ask you a question?
frank_lapidus Shoot.
dr_jack_shephard The Red Sox really win the Series?
frank_lapidus Hey, don't get me started on that, alright? My dad's from the Bronx. I bleed Yankee blue.
dr_jack_shephard I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh. It's the payload! It's finally here.
dr_jack_shephard What is that?
dr_daniel_faraday It's a rocket.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh, no, no.
dr_daniel_faraday Thirty-one minutes.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh, no. This is not good.
frank_lapidus Your friends are back.
desmond_hume Well... look at that.
sayid_jarrah Look for anything that shows where they might have gone. I'll start in here.
kate_austen Sayid!
john_locke Don't worry, Kate's fine.
john_locke Good job, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Sorry, dude.
danielle_rousseau Sorry, Sayid, nothing personal.
sayid_jarrah Where's Locke?
hugo_reyes He's talking to that angry Chinese guy.
sayid_jarrah I'm not going to hurt you, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break dancing thing you do with your legs. I think I'll hang back here.
ben_linus Well... I guess they're running out of jail space.
ben_linus I lost a dollar, you know.
sayid_jarrah How did you manage that?
ben_linus I bet John that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
sayid_jarrah What do you know about friendship?
ben_linus I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
kate_austen So what, I'm your prisoner?
james_ford If that sorta thing turns you on.
kate_austen What are you doing here with Locke?
james_ford I'm not with him.
kate_austen Yeah, you are, James.
james_ford Then what are you doing with Jack?
kate_austen I went with Jack because I believe he can get us off this island.
james_ford I guess that's the difference between us.
james_ford I ain't looking to leave.
kate_austen Why not?
james_ford 'Cause, I ain't got nothin' back there for me.
kate_austen And what's here that's so much better?
james_ford Why do you want to go back, Kate? Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here. So if you think there's anything waiting for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don’t know how the world works. Look around us, Freckles. We've got roofs over our heads. Electricity, showers, beds.
kate_austen Yeah, how long, Sawyer? How long do you think we can play house?
james_ford Why don't we find out?
john_locke Iced tea.
john_locke I thought you might be thirsty.
ben_linus I'm thirsty.
john_locke I'm sorry about, um, all the theatrics, but uh, I didn't know how many of you there'd be, or whether you'd be armed. I covered my bases.
sayid_jarrah What have you done with Miles and Kate?
john_locke Kate's with Sawyer. And Miles is somewhere else. He's fine. All I did was ask him some questions.
sayid_jarrah Did he answer any?
john_locke No.
sayid_jarrah Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?
john_locke Not particularly.
sayid_jarrah Then why don't you turn her over to me?
john_locke Why would I do that?
sayid_jarrah I agree that these people are liars and they're certainly not here to rescue us. But if I return safely with Charlotte, they'll take me to their ship. It's our best chance of finding out who they are and what they really want.
john_locke Well, then, I can save you a lot of trouble, Sayid, because Ben says he's got a spy on the boat.
sayid_jarrah Who?
ben_linus It's a secret.
sayid_jarrah Forgive me, but the day I start trusting him is the day I would have sold my soul. Give me Charlotte! Allow me to do things my way. Or war is coming, which we will both be powerless to stop.
john_locke Why would I give you Charlotte for nothing?
sayid_jarrah Oh, I think you misunderstood me. I never expected you to give her to me for nothing.
elsa Should we get dressed?
sayid_jarrah No.
elsa Well, we're going to have to get out of this bed at a certain point.
sayid_jarrah Why?
elsa Well, for one thing, because I know that eventually you're going to have to go to that job of yours — you know, the one that you never talk about.
sayid_jarrah There's nothing to talk about, it's just a job.
elsa I know nothing about you. I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, what happened to you. But what about life now, what about you? That's what you do when you're in love, right? You...
sayid_jarrah In love?
elsa Yeah.
sayid_jarrah Okay. No more secrets. What do you want to know?
elsa He's here. My boss. I, um, I have to go.
sayid_jarrah Now? Where?
elsa Hotel Adlon. Where's my dress?
sayid_jarrah Elsa? You have to leave Berlin.
elsa What?
sayid_jarrah You can't be here anymore.
elsa What do you mean? Why would I—
sayid_jarrah People will be asking questions soon. About what happened to your employer. And you can't be around to answer them.
elsa My employer? This... this is about my boss? Who are you?
sayid_jarrah This has nothing to do with how—
elsa The café? You meant to meet me there? You used me to get to my boss. What did you say, "people will ask what happened to him"?
sayid_jarrah It's best you don't know.
elsa You gonna kill him? You're gonna kill him?! Do you even know him?!
sayid_jarrah His name is on a list.
elsa A list?! What list?! You have a list?!
sayid_jarrah It's my employer's.
elsa And who is that?!
sayid_jarrah It doesn't matter who he is!
elsa You just kill people 'cause they're on a list? Innocent people?
sayid_jarrah The man you are working for is not an economist.
elsa You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty, not ten. No, I didn't kill him. He's not going to give up the name now.
elsa Why should I keep him alive? No. He had no idea. All right, all right. I'll bring him to you. Leave the hotel. I'll meet you at the safe house.
elsa What do you think you're do—
desmond_hume Hey. I'm gonna ask you one last time. Why was Naomi carrying this picture of me?
frank_lapidus Look, man, you gotta understand something. She was senior management. It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together. She stayed on her own.
desmond_hume Look, Naomi told me you people were hired by her! So you look me right in the eye and tell me you've never seen or heard of Penelope Widmore.
desmond_hume Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth; I'll find someone who will. See, when that takes off, I'm on it.
dr_juliet_burke He's back.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?
sayid_jarrah She decided to stay.
frank_lapidus What happened to Miles?
sayid_jarrah I traded him.
frank_lapidus Traded him?
sayid_jarrah I promised you Charlotte, here she is.
frank_lapidus You cheated.
sayid_jarrah Did I?
frank_lapidus Yes, you did. Lucky for you that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.
dr_charlotte_lewis Hey.
dr_daniel_faraday You all right?
dr_charlotte_lewis Yeah.
frank_lapidus All right. That gives us room for one more. Charlotte?
dr_charlotte_lewis Go back? With all the fun I'm having here? No, I've got work to do.
frank_lapidus Seat's yours if you want it, Daniel.
dr_daniel_faraday I... no, thank you. I think I should probably just stay with Charlotte.
frank_lapidus All right.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, Frank. Frank? Just one thing. Just be sure that you follow the same exact bearing that we came in on. No matter what. By that, I mean no matter what. Just — just stay on it.
frank_lapidus Roger that.
dr_jack_shephard Be careful.
sayid_jarrah I don't have to talk you out of coming.
dr_jack_shephard As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control.
sayid_jarrah Wish me luck.
dr_jack_shephard Good luck. Send me a postcard.
sayid_jarrah You said we have room for one more?
frank_lapidus Yeah, why?
sayid_jarrah We should bring Naomi home.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Take your shirt off.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Is she dead?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Why didn't she kill you?
sayid_jarrah She was trying to get information from me.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 What sort of information?
sayid_jarrah She wanted to know who I worked for. She wanted to know about you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode03 2 Of course she did.
ben_linus Why are you crying? Because it hurts? Or because you were stupid enough to care for her? These people don't deserve our sympathies. Need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?
sayid_jarrah You used that to recruit me into killing for you.
ben_linus Do you want to protect your friends or not, Sayid? I have another name for you.
sayid_jarrah But they know I'm after them now.
ben_linus Good.
