TREVOR Comes fully equipped.
TREVOR I'm telling you, it's a steal at $400.
TREVOR What, you gotta check with your husband?
WOMAN It's just me.
BOY Mommy?
BOY Can I have a quarter for the vending machine?
WOMAN Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.
TREVOR I thought you said it was "just me."
WOMAN I meant my husband's out of the picture. It's just me and my son.
TREVOR I don't know. Most of the other tenants--they don't like noise.
WOMAN He's very quiet.
TREVOR I'm gonna need two months up front.
WOMAN Here, honey.
WOMAN Hey, no running! You hear me, Miles?
MILES Mom! Mommy! Help!
MILES Mommy!
LARA Miles?
LARA Miles, what happened?
MILES Mommy!
TREVOR Oh, God. Mr. Vonner.
LARA What were you doing in here?
MILES He... he was all alone. He was scared. His chest hurt. He kept calling out for Kimberly.
TREVOR Kimberly? That's his wife. No, she died last year. Now, how would you know that?
MILES I heard him.
LARA Miles, what are you talking about?
MILES He's still talking right now.
LARA Honey... he's dead.
MILES I told you! I can hear him! I can hear him!
SAWYER Miles, you there? Pick up.
MILES Jim, where the hell are you?
SAWYER I'll fill you in later. Right now I need you to take care of something.
MILES Like what?
SAWYER The security tapes from the pylon camera feeds. They need to accidentally get erased.
MILES Erased? Why?
SAWYER I ain't got time for questions, Miles. Just do it.
MILES Okay. Okay. Uh, which ones?
SAWYER Look on your monitors.
SAWYER You see us?
MILES Yeah. You're on number 4. Is that Kate? What the hell are you doing out there?
SAWYER Just erase number 4. And if anyone asks, I'm off the grid. I'm looking for the escaped Hostile.
MILES You mean your pal Sayid?
SAWYER Damn it, Miles! You gonna help me or not?!
MILES Yeah, yeah. I got it.
SAWYER All right. I owe you one.
SAWYER All right, I want you to go back and and find Juliet, see if anyone's noticed yet if Little Ben's gone missin'.
KATE What are you gonna do when they find out?
SAWYER Do my best to cover it up. In case you haven't noticed, I'm Head of Security.
SAWYER All right, I'll see you back there.
HORACE Where's LaFleur?
MILES Uh, he's, uh, out looking for the escaped prisoner. I tried to get him on his walkie, but...
MILES Uh, he must be out of range.
HORACE Damn it. All right. Then it's gonna have to be you. Jim already knows about this, but I'm gonna bring you into the circle of trust. Can I trust you, Miles?
MILES Absolutely, Horace.
HORACE Okay. Good. I need you to take this out to Radzinsky at grid 3-34.
HORACE He's gonna give you something in return. I want you to bring it back to me with no questions asked. You understand?
MILES Um... we're not supposed to be in 3-3-4. Isn't that Hostile territory?
HORACE Welcome to the circle of trust.
RADZINSKY Stop right there!
RADZINSKY Miles?! What are you doing out here?! I was expecting LaFleur.
MILES LaFleur's busy. Horace sent me instead. I'm in the circle of trust.
RADZINSKY Get out!
MILES I'm supposed to give you this. And he said you had something for me.
MILES What happened to him?
RADZINSKY He had an accident.
MILES What kind of accident?
RADZINSKY He fell into a ditch.
MILES Is that a bullet hole in his head? The ditch had a gun?
RADZINSKY It doesn't matter what happened to him... because knowing that is not your job--your job is to do what I tell you to.
RADZINSKY Take him back to Horace now, Miles.
MILES Okay... so what really happened?
MILES I need to see her.
MILES Ma?  It's me.
LARA Miles.
MILES I'm--I'm sorry that... I couldn't make it by sooner.
LARA It's okay. You're here now. Why did you come, Miles?
MILES I need you to tell me why I'm this way... how... how I do the things I do. And I need to know why you won't talk to me about my father.
LARA Because he never cared about us... never cared about you.
MILES I need to know where he is, Ma.
LARA It doesn't matter where.
MILES It does matter.
LARA Miles, please.
MILES I have a right to know!
LARA He's dead.
LARA Your father... kicked us out when you were just a baby. He didn't want anything to do with us. So the less you knew about him, the better.
MILES Why didn't you just tell me?
LARA Because it was over. Your dad has been dead a long time.
MILES Where's his body?
LARA Somewhere you can never go.
HORACE Pierre, if it was caused by the electromagnetism, we need to know. You wanna see it now? Y--yeah, he just got back. I'll send him out with it right away. Okay!
HORACE Did you bring the package?
MILES "Package"? You mean the corpse?
HORACE Yeah. Now I need you to bring it out to Dr. Chang at the Orchid.
MILES Listen, man. I'm security. If you just need somebody to drive the van, can't someone from the motor pool do it?
HORACE If I wanted someone from the motor pool, I would have asked them. And since LaFleur decided to disappear, you're all I've got. So just bring it out to Dr. Chang, and we'll all call it a day. Okay?
MILES Hey! What the hell are you doing?! That's my van!
HURLEY Nah, dude, I just signed it out.
MILES Doesn't matter. It's mine.
HURLEY Well, where you going?
MILES The Orchid.
HURLEY Me too. I made lunch for the crew. Sandwiches. Want one? Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo.
MILES You're waiting for the next van.
HURLEY Why? We're going to the same place. Why don't we carpool? It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet, so maybe we can prevent it. ...Wait a sec. Are you on some kind of secret mission?
MILES Just get in.
KATE Hi.
JULIET Hey.
JULIET How'd it go?
KATE We gave him to them--to the Others.
JULIET Anyone see you?
KATE I don't think so.
JULIET Did James help?
KATE Yes. Thank you so much for sending him.
JULIET Of course.
ROGER Hey.  I got here as soon as I could. All the vans were out, so I had to ru--
ROGER Where's Ben? Did he...
JULIET No! No, Roger.
ROGER Then where is he?
JULIET Roger, I--I'm so sorry. I--I was gone for ten minutes. I--I--I don't know.
ROGER What? You--you said he was dying. How could he be gone?
JULIET I don't know! I'm--Roger--
ROGER What is she telling me, that he just got up and walked out?
KATE I don't know. I just got here--
ROGER You're his doctors! You're supposed to watch him!
JULIET I know. I know. Roger, if we just calm down--
ROGER Don't tell me to calm down! Somebody came and took my boy out of here?!
JULIET I know. I am so sorry.
ROGER I'm going to Security.
JULIET Well... here we go.
STEREO Got on board a westbound 747...
HURLEY How do you spell "bounty hunter"?
MILES What are you doing, writing your memoirs?
HURLEY It's personal.
HURLEY Dude... did you just... you know?
MILES What?
HURLEY You know. It stinks. Did you...
MILES No.
HURLEY Well, it wasn't me.
MILES So roll down your window.
HURLEY Nah, man, there's something foul in here. It's coming from back there.
MILES Maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.
HURLEY Unh-unh. That's not possible.
HURLEY Okay, maybe it is possible. Pull over. I gotta check.
MILES Forget it. You're imagining things.
HURLEY I gotta check. If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick.
HURLEY Will you pull over?!
HURLEY Dude, there's a body bag back here. With a body in it.
MILES That's traditionally what you put in a body bag.
HURLEY Yeah, well, who is he? What happened?
MILES Don't worry about it and don't tell anybody you saw him.
HURLEY Dude, what happened to him?
MILES His name's Alvarez. He was digging a hole and thinking about some chick named Andr√©a. Then he felt this sharp pain in his mouth, which turned out to be a filling from his tooth being yanked right out of its socket and... blowing through his brain. Then he was dead.
HURLEY How does a filling get blown through someone's head?
MILES Got me. Can we go now?
HURLEY How do you know all this?
MILES Because... I know.
HURLEY Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?
MILES I just know.
HURLEY You can talk to dead people.
MILES Can we please just go?
HURLEY Don't worry, dude. Your secret's safe with me. You wanna know why?
MILES No.
HURLEY 'Cause I can talk to 'em, too.
MILES If you don't mind, Mr. Gray, can you tell me what happened to him?
MR. GRAY Last Labor Day weekend, drunk driver ran the light. That was that.
MILES Where is your son buried?
MR. GRAY We cremated him, scattered the ashes on the football field at school.
MILES For what I do, it's much better if there's a body.
MR. GRAY Oh, but your ad said you could communicate with the dead anytime, anywhere.
MILES I--I know what my ad says, Mr. Gray, but it--
MR. GRAY Please. I just want you to ask him... did he know that I loved him?
MILES It's gonna cost extra.
MR. GRAY Of course.
MR. GRAY Thank you.
MILES Uh... okay, now... please give me your hands.
MILES I want you to concentrate on Russell. Just get a picture of him in your head. Can you do that?
MR. GRAY Yeah. Okay.
MR. GRAY Did it work?
MILES Your son says he knew that you loved him. He always knew.
MR. GRAY Thank you.
MILES I'm sorry for your loss.
NAOMI Excuse me. Miles Straume?
MILES Yeah.
NAOMI Hi. My name's Naomi Dorrit.
NAOMI My employer's been following your work for some time now, and he's interested in retaining your rather unique services.
NAOMI There's a restaurant not too far from here. Would you like to hear what I have to say?
MILES Yeah. Absolutely.
KATE Hi, Roger.
KATE You okay?
ROGER Let me see... Well, my son got shot and now he's disappeared, so... I think I'm pretty far from okay.
KATE You know, I'm sure... things are gonna work out.
ROGER Well, thanks for the pep talk.
KATE I just have a feeling he's gonna be okay.
ROGER What do you mean, a feeling?
KATE I just don't think that you should give up hope.
ROGER Do you know something? Do you know what happened to my son?
KATE No, I don't.
ROGER Wait a minute. Why are you so interested in my kid?
KATE You know, I'm sorry I came over here, all right? I was just trying to help.
ROGER Oh, you're trying to help, huh? You wanna help, Kate?! Well, why don't you just mind your own business?
STEREO Love / Love will keep us together...
HURLEY I don't know why you just won't admit it. You can trust me. I talk to lots of dead people.
MILES So, you have conversations with them, like they're your pals?
HURLEY Sure, all the time. Sometimes we even play chess.
MILES You actually see them?
HURLEY Of course. Why wouldn't I?
MILES Because that's not how it works.
HURLEY Aha! You wouldn't know how it works unless you can do it.
MILES What I can do has nothing to do with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit. It's a... feeling... a sense. When somebody's dead, their brain stops functioning, which means there's no more talking. There's just who they were and whatever they knew before they died.
HURLEY That's how it works for me.
MILES Great. I'm happy for you.
HURLEY You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.
MILES We're here. Now shut the hell up and deliver your damn sandwiches.
DR. CHANG What's he doing here?
MILES Um, he came to deliver lunch to the work crew.
DR. CHANG Lunch? Your instructions were to come alone.
HURLEY Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about the body.
DR. CHANG He knows?
MILES I'm sorry, sir. He--he was rooting around in the back, and he saw it.
HURLEY Dude. I can keep a secret.
DR. CHANG Well, you'd better... "Hurley", 'cause if you think working in the kitchen is bad--
HURLEY I like the kitchen.
DR. CHANG Well, how do you feel about polar bear feces? Because if you breathe one word of this, I'll have you shipped to Hydra Island so you can weigh turds for their ridiculous experiments.
HURLEY Gross.
DR. CHANG You two! Get the package inside.
DR. CHANG And you? Stay here till I get back. You think you can handle that?
MILES Yes, sir.
FIRST DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN What the hell's he got, Jimmy Hoffa in here?
SECOND DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN I don't know.
FIRST DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN Lift him. 
HURLEY Dude, that guy's a total douche.
DR. CHANG Don't... You are not qualified to be touching that!...
MILES That douche is my dad.
DR. CHANG What the hell do you think you're doing? What are you doing?!
MILES You did say you were taking me out to dinner.
NAOMI No, I said I was taking you to a restaurant.
MILES You wanna tell me what's back here, sweetheart?
NAOMI Your audition.
MILES Look, whatever you got going on here, this isn't really my thing.
NAOMI From what I understand, Miles, if the price is right, this is exactly your thing.
NAOMI So what can you tell me about this man?
MILES His name's Felix. He was... on his way to deliver something to, uh...
MILES A guy named... Wid-more.
NAOMI Deliver what?
MILES A bunch of papers, photos, pictures... of... empty graves. A purchase order... for an old airplane.
MILES So... did I pass?
NAOMI I'm leading an expedition to an island, and on the island is a man that will be very difficult to find. That's why I need you.
MILES Need me for what?
NAOMI This island has a number of deceased individuals... residing on it, and as this man is the one responsible for their being deceased, we believe they can supply invaluable information as to his whereabouts.
MILES As much as hunting down a mass murderer sounds really safe, uh, I'm--I'm gonna pass. Thanks for the audition.
NAOMI My employer is willing to pay you $1.6 million.
MILES When do we leave?
HURLEY So anyway...
MILES I don't want to talk about it.
HURLEY Are you kidding me? How weird is it that your dad is that dude from all those movies? Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle. Was that, like, a stage name?
MILES What part of "I don't want to talk about it" isn't sinking in?
HURLEY Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me? How long have you known he was your dad?
MILES Third day we were here, I was on line at the cafeteria, and my mother got in line behind me. That was my first clue.
HURLEY But all those DHARMA dudes end up dead. Don't you wanna... save him?
MILES I can't save him! They're gonna get killed no matter what I do, so why bother?
DR. CHANG I need you to take me to Radzinsky at the work site. Immediately. You... Hurley--you say a word...
HURLEY Polar bear poop. Got it.
MILES What happened to the body?
DR. CHANG What body?
ROGER This room is on my rounds. What are you doing here?
JACK I figured I'd cover for ya. I heard what happened to your son.
ROGER Which part--that he got shot or that someone kidnapped him from the Infirmary?
JACK Then what are you doing here at work?
ROGER What else am I gonna do? Sit around and pray that those idiots are gonna find my boy? So you can get outta here.
ROGER You came in here a couple days ago with that woman Kate, right?
JACK Yeah.
ROGER You know her at all?
JACK Why?
ROGER 'Cause she's got some... kinda weird thing for my kid. First, she shows up at the infirmary and gave him blood. But then when he goes missing, she comes to me and she says, "Don't worry. He's gonna be okay." I'm gonna tell you somethin', man. I'm beginning to think that she's got something to do with this. I should go to Horace, report her. What do you think?
JACK I think, Roger, that, uh, that you've had a hell of a day, and that... it's given you a very good excuse to go out and get drunk. Maybe that's put some--some crazy ideas into your head. I know that woman--Kate. She's my friend, and she would never do anything to hurt your son.
ROGER Sure.
HURLEY So I'm new here, Dr. Chang. What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?
DR. CHANG It's classified.
HURLEY Oh, really? You can't tell anyone? Not even your wife?
DR. CHANG No.
HURLEY What about your kids?
DR. CHANG I have a 3-month-old son, so, no, I haven't told him.
HURLEY 3 months? Wow! Congrats. What's his name?
DR. CHANG Miles.
HURLEY Small world! That's your name, too. Right, Miles?
MILES Yeah.
HURLEY So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang? Like Miles Davis?
DR. CHANG My wife is.  I like country.
HURLEY So you two have been here for... three years now. Must be pretty tight, huh?
MILES Dr. Chang and I... don't exactly travel in the same circles.
DR. CHANG I wasn't aware there were circles.
HURLEY Great. We should all... get together for a beer sometime. How awesome would that be?
DR. CHANG Stop here.
DR. CHANG You don't need to wait. I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.
HURLEY Dude, what is this place? And what's up with all the secrecy?
MILES Don't know. Don't care.
WORKER Hey, Glenn! What's the serial number that goes on the hatch lid?
GLENN 4, 8...
GLENN 15...
GLENN 16...
GLENN 23...
GLENN Hold on a minute. It's smudged.
HURLEY 42.
GLENN 42.
MILES How the hell did you know that?
HURLEY 'Cause they're building our hatch.
MILES What hatch?
HURLEY The one that crashed our plane.
MILES Thanks.
MAN IN VAN Hey, Miles.
MILES Do I know you?
MAN IN VAN Miles! My name's Bram.
MILES You owe me a fish taco.
BRAM Sorry about that, but your apartment's being watched. And we had to try our best to talk you out of working for Charles Widmore.
MILES I have no idea who that is.
BRAM He's the man who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week. And, my friend, you do not want to get on that boat. Do you know what lies in the shadow of the statue?
MILES No, can't say that I do.
BRAM Then you're not ready to go to that island. But if you come with us--all those things you've spent your life trying to find out? You'll know. You'll know who you are, Miles--why it is you have a gift, and most of all, you'll know about your father.
MILES I don't know where you've been getting your intel, but I stopped caring about my father a long time ago. What I do care about is money. So, I'll tell you what. You want me to pass on going to the Island? It's gonna cost you double what they offered--$3.2 million.
BRAM We're not paying you anything. All the money in the world isn't gonna fill that empty hole inside you, Miles.
MILES That's sad, isn't it?
BRAM Toss him!
BRAM You're playing for the wrong team!
MILES Yeah? What team are you on?
BRAM The one that's gonna win.
HURLEY That hatch they're building? There's gonna be an accident, then they're gonna have to build a computer with a button you have to push so the world doesn't end.
HURLEY So your dad... is he around... you know, when we came from? The future?
MILES No.
HURLEY Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?
MILES How is it awesome?!
HURLEY Because you get to hang out with him, you know, get to know him better and stuff.
MILES Ch.
HURLEY And don't bother thanking me, but he was totally down for that beer, dude. You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you, or you can change your own diaper or--
HURLEY Whoa!
MILES Listen up, 'cause we're only gonna have this conversation once. Okay? I don't want to "hang out" with my dad. I don't want to "know him better"... "and stuff".
HURLEY Why not? Did he beat you up when you were little or something?
MILES He wasn't even around when I was little, you dimwit! I never knew him, until now. Why am I even telling you this?
HURLEY 'Cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.
MILES I'm not in pain! It doesn't matter. My father is dead! He's gone! He never cared about me, and nothing I can do will ever change that.
HURLEY But he's not gone. We just dropped him off.
MILES You want to get into my business?
MILES Let's get into yours!
HURLEY Give that back to me.
MILES How about we read your little diary?
HURLEY It's not a diary! It's personal!!
MILES Let's see what's going on--
HURLEY Give that--give that back to me.
MILES --in that piece of granite you call a head.
HURLEY Give it back!
MILES "Exterior--Hoth. A little spy robot thingy zips through the atmosphere and crashes into the snowy planet below. That's when Chewbacca shows up and blasts it away with his crossbow laser. He shakes his fury fist in the sky in triumph. Chewbacca--Raaar."
HURLEY It's "furry." "Furry fist." I need a spell-check.
MILES What the hell is this?
HURLEY I'm writing Empire Strikes Back.
MILES Uh... I'm sorry. What?
HURLEY It's 1977, right?
HURLEY So Stars Wars just came out. And pretty soon, George Lucas is gonna be looking for a sequel. I've seen Empire, like, 200 times, so I figured I'd make life easier and send him the script... with a couple improvements.
MILES That has gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
HURLEY Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad.
JULIET James. You're back.
SAWYER Barely. You ever had one of those days you feel like the little Dutch boy with your finger in the...
SAWYER Doc. Hey. What's going on?
JACK Ben's father thinks that Kate had something to do with his son going missing.
SAWYER Why the hell would he think that?
JULIET Because she talked to him, tried to make him feel better.
JACK Her heart was in the right place.
SAWYER Yeah, well, where was her head?
JACK I had a talk with Roger. I don't think he's gonna say anything to anyone for now. Just wanted you to know.
JACK Thank you.
JULIET Mm.
SAWYER Yeah? Well... thanks for filling me in, Doc.
JACK No problem.
PHIL Hey, boss.
SAWYER Hey.
PHIL We got a development. You better come to the office.
SAWYER Phil, I've been running around the jungle all day, so whatever developments you got can wait a while.
PHIL I know who took the kid.
SAWYER Yeah? Who's that?
PHIL You.
SAWYER Got a perfectly good explanation for what you saw on that tape.
PHIL I sure as hell hope so.
SAWYER You talk to Horace yet?
PHIL No. I thought that after three years of working together, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt--
SAWYER Get some rope.
MILES Mr. Gray? I hope you don't mind. Your gate was open.
MR. GRAY Mr. Straume. Of course. Of course. No problem. What, uh, what brings you by?
MILES Well, sir, uh... I'm about to go on a boat trip for a while, and... I wanted to give this back to you.
MILES I lied to you, Mr. Gray. I wasn't able to talk to your son.
MR. GRAY Why are you telling me this? You could have just let me go on believing what you said.
MILES That wouldn't have been fair to your son.
MR. GRAY I'm sorry?
MILES If you needed your son to know that you loved him, you should've told him when he was still alive.
HURLEY Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to your dad, dude.
MILES Don't worry about it.
HURLEY I used to hate my dad, too.
MILES Yeah?
HURLEY He left when I was 10. But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance. We got to be the best of friends, and although I may never see him again, I miss him. And I know he feels the same.
MILES My dad didn't leave when I was 10. I--I was a baby. I never knew him. And I don't want to. It's not happening.
HURLEY That was Luke's attitude, too.
MILES What?
HURLEY In Empire, Luke found out Vader was his father, but instead of putting away his lightsaber and talking about it, he overreacted and got his hand cut off. I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost? Another Death Star was destroyed, Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc, and we got the Ewoks. It all could've been avoided if they'd just, you know, communicated. And let's face it. The Ewoks sucked, dude.
DR. CHANG Wow! Oh, wow!
LARA Hello? Oh, one moment. It's for you.
DR. CHANG Hello? All right. I'll be right there.
DR. CHANG Miles! I need you.
MILES You do?
DR. CHANG Sub's here from H.Q. I need your help bringing them in.
MILES Sure. New recruits?
DR. CHANG No, uh, scientists from Ann Arbor. Get your van, and let's get to the dock.
MAN Hey, can I get a hand with this?
MILES Yeah, yeah, sure.
MILES Dan.
FARADAY Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
