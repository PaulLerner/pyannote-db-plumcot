MR. PAIK 이거 네가 그랬어? 선화야. 이 발레리나 네가 깨뜨린 거니? 그럼 누가 깨뜨렸어? Did you do this? Sun -- did you break the ballerina? Then who did?
YOUNG SUN 일하는 아줌마. 
MR. PAIK 네 말 대로 아줌마가 그랬다면 당장 조치를 취해야겠지. 내 말 알아듣겠니?  선, 누가 깨뜨렸지? 
YOUNG SUN 일하는 아줌마가 그랬어요. 
MR. PAIK 알았다. 
JIN 문 열어봐. 
SUN 괜찮아요, 그냥 입덧하는 거예요. 
SUN 진수씨! 
JIN 우리 가야해. 지금 당장! 사이드한테 얘기해.
SUN My husband says it's time to leave.
JIN 그들은 오지 않을거야.
SUN He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming. It's been over a day since we lit the fire. They should be here by now.
SAYID Jack knows we're out here. He's counting on our signal. Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke. If he's North of us, the mountains would block his view.
SUN 우리가 보내는 신호를 보지 못한 것 같아요.
SAYID We need to sail forward along the coast, clear the mountains, and start another signal fire.
SUN 돛을 해변쪽으로 돌려서 다시 한 번 신호를 보내쟤요.
JIN No!
SAYID I told Jack I would light a fire. I'm not abandoning him.
SUN 사이드 말은 우리가... 
JIN 사이드?  사이드가 임신했어? 정신차려! 
SUN My husband thinks we have to do as he says because he's the only one who knows how to sail. But he's wrong. I can help you sail the boat.
JULIET Are you feeling any better? I made the soup myself, but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it.
BEN You never made soup for me.
COLLEEN Am I interrupting something?
JULIET Would it really matter if you were?
COLLEEN We have a situation -- Ryan radioed in -- the Iraqi found the decoy village.
BEN Good, it's what we wanted.
COLLEEN Ryan followed him back to the shore and they have a sailboat.
BEN How?!
COLLEEN I have no idea.
JULIET So they have a boat -- sailing in circles will keep them busy.
COLLEEN They could find us. Ben?
BEN I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team?
COLLEEN Within the hour.
BEN Then don't waste time talking to us. Hey Colleen, I want that boat.
KATE Nice alarm clock.
SAWYER I've woken up to worse. Want half a fish biscuit?
SAWYER What's this?
PICKETT Lunch -- we're going to need you to keep up your strength.
SAWYER Is that right?
COLLEEN Danny, wait!
PICKETT Hold up.
COLLEEN They have a boat. (There's more whispering that's inaudible.)
PICKETT Okay, be careful out there.
PICKETT What are you looking at?
JIN 돛에가서 손 좀 보고 올게. 
SUN 진수씨, 당신 말을 듣지 않은 거 미안해요. 사이드가 보는 앞에서. 
JIN 그러니까 내 말을 처음부터 들었어야지. 당신은 그러면... 왜 왔어? 
SUN 당신이랑 떨어져 있기 싫어서 왔을 뿐이예요. 
JAE What's wrong?
SUN What's wrong is I'm married.
JAE Right. That.
SUN 재혁 씨, 안 되요. 안 되겠어요. 미안해요. ]
JAE 선화 씨, 잠시만요. ]
SUN 재혁 씨, 너무 아름다워요. 전 이거 받을 수 없어요. 남편이 어디서 났냐고 물으면... 
JAE I don't want to share you anymore. Your English is excellent now. You can go to America.
JAE Does anyone know you're...
SUN No!
JAE 너네 뭐지? 내가 누군줄... What are you doing here? Get out of my--
JAE 회장님, 제가 뭐라 말씀... 
MR. PAIK 옷 입어. 
PICKETT Alright, here's the jig -- see these rocks, here? That's where you two come in. You're going to chop them loose. And you're going to haul them out of here.
KATE You expect me to work in this dress?
PICKETT Well, it's up to you? You can take it off if you want.
SAWYER How dare you?
PICKETT Now, if you need anything -- you raise your hand. You get 10 minutes for lunch.
SAWYER I got a question, boss.
PICKETT No questions.
SAWYER She got to ask a question.
PICKETT If you try to run off, you will be shocked.
SAWYER Shot?! We don't even get a warning?
PICKETT Shocked. I said, shocked. If you talk to each other you're going to be shocked. If you touch each other, you're going to be shocked. If you're slacking, you're going to get shocked. Matter of fact, if you do anything at all that pisses me off, you're going to get shocked. Okay? Let's get to work.
KATE I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.
PICKETT Now, that was a quarter charge. You got any more questions?
PICKETT As soon as you're able to walk -- the wheelbarrow's right over there.
JIN 부르셨습니까, 회장님? 
MR. PAIK 들어오게. 앉지. 문제가 생겼네. We have a problem.]
MR. PAIK 이 놈한테 내 것을 도둑 맞았어. 자네가 이 문제를 해결해주길 바라네. 
JIN 뭘 도둑맞으셨는데요? 
MR. PAIK 그건 중요치 않아. 
JIN 알겠습니다. 다시는 그러지 못하게 전하겠습니다, 회장님. I'll deliver a message.]
MR. PAIK 그 정도로는 부족해! 아예 없애버려!
JIN 그렇게 할 수 없습니다. 
MR. PAIK 할 수 없다니 무슨 소리야? 
JIN 회장님, 이건 제가 할 일이 아닌 것 같은데요. 
MR. PAIK 자넨 내가 시키는 대로만 하면 돼! 
JIN 그러면 더 이상 회장님 밑에서 일할 수가 없습니다. 그만두겠습니다. ]
MR. PAIK 누구 맘대로 그만둬! 이 놈이 날 망신시켰어! 자네는 내 딸과 결혼했지? 그러니까, 자네는 내 아들이나 다름없네. 내 망신이 바로 자네의 망신 아닌가? 난 자네가 나서서 우리 가족의 명예를 되찾아 주길 바라네. 
SUN 진수 씨, 여기 올라와 봐요.
SUN Why should there be a dock all the way out here?
JIN Others.
SAYID The dock's decaying. It's overgrown. It looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time. Whoever built it -- they're not here now.
SUN 누가 만든지 모르겠지만, 한동안 사용하지 않았대요.
SAYID Let's bring the boat in. We'll tie it to the dock and build a fire on the beach. The visibility's excellent. Jack will be able to see us for miles around.
JIN Safe?
SAYID Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.
PICKETT Hey! Get back to work.
SAWYER Whatever you say, boss.
ALEX Hey, careful. Don't let them see you talking to me. Are they keeping you in the cages? Did you see another guy in there with you -- about my age, named Karl?
KATE No. Just Sawyer and me.
ALEX You're not even supposed to be in that cage.
KATE What are you talking about? Who are you?
ALEX Where'd you get that dress?
KATE They gave it to me.
ALEX It's mine. You can keep it. It looks better on you anyway.
KATE Wait.
SAWYER Are you having fun yet, Freckles?
KATE Quit staring at my ass.
SAWYER Give me something else to stare at.
PICKETT Hey! Shut up!
SAWYER Yes sir, boss.
SAYID Thank you.
SUN What else can I do?
SAYID Help your husband. We need as much wood as we can find.
SUN We're building quite a large fire.
SAYID We have to make sure Jack will see the smoke.
SUN Why are you lying to me, Sayid?
SAYID And what would you know about lying, Sun?
SUN You're putting our lives in danger. 
SAYID I'm fairly certain our friends have been captured. There are tracks all over the dock. They're fresh -- as recent as yesterday.
SUN You said this dock was abandoned.
SAYID That would be part of the lying you mentioned.
SUN You're not building this fire for our people; you're building it for the Others.
SAYID I suspect that when they see the smoke they'll send a scout party to investigate. By then it will be night. When they arrive, I'll ambush them. I'll take two of them hostage, and I'll kill the rest.
SUN Two?
SAYID One to make the other cooperate.
SUN What do you need me to do?
SAYID I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.
SUN Why?
SAYID Because once the fire is lit it will be too late to go back.
SUN 이제 와요? 
JIN 오늘 어땠어? 
SUN 그냥 그랬어요. 
JIN 아버님이 오늘 이상한 말씀 하시던데? 
SUN 뭐요? 
JIN 난생 처음으로 나를 아들이라고 부르셨어. 
SUN 갑자기 왜요? 
JIN 아버님만의 상술이시지. 
SUN 그래서 당신 그 일 할 거예요? 
JIN 해야 돼. 
SUN 당신이 그럴 필요 없어요. 하지 마요. 
JIN 당신 생각처럼 그게 그렇게 쉽다고 생각해? 
SUN 우리 아무도 없는 곳으로 가서 처음부터 다시 시작해요. 우리 둘만 가서... 
JIN 다시 시작? 우리가 도망가면 당신 아버지가... 
SUN 아빠가 찾을 수 없는 곳으로 가면 되잖아요. 나도 당신이 그런 일 하는 거 너무 싫어. 당신도... 
JIN 나도 너무 싫지만 이게 다 당신을 위해서야! 다 당신과 결혼한 대가겠지. 
SUN 나도 당신이랑 결혼해서 치른 대가가 있는 거 몰라요?  진수씨, 어디가요? 
JIN 일하러 가. 
JIN Gun.
SAYID I don't think I understand.
JIN 자기야. 나도 여기서 무슨 일이 일어나는지 다 알아. 이건 잭을 위한 신호가 아니고, 그놈들을 유인해서 죽이려고 하는 거지?
SAYID What is it?
SUN He knows what we're doing. He knows it's a trap.
JIN 서로 영어로 하면 모르는 줄 알지? 당신이 생각하는 것보다 나 잘 알아들을 수 있어.
SUN He says he understands English better than I think he does.
JIN 나 다 알아.
SUN He knows I betrayed him.
JIN Gun.
SAYID Can you handle one of these? It's an automat...
JIN 보트에 가서 기다려. 어서 가.
SAYID I think you'd be safer on the boat. Sun, if by chance they get past us -- there's another gun. It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter.
SUN If they get past you, that means my husband is dead. And I won't care anymore.
SAYID As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.
SAWYER Back off!
JULIET James!
JULIET Put the gun down. Right now. Put the gun down.
JAE 잠시만요! 
JIN 내가 누군 줄 알아? 응? 내가 왜 여기 왔는지 알아? 
JAE 정말 미안합니다. 
JIN 내가 왜 왔는지 알면 뭘 할지도 알겠군. 
JAE 미안합니다. 미안합니다. 
JIN 넌 한국을 떠나. 내 말 알아듣겠지? 여길 떠나서 다시 돌아오지 마. 이름도 바꾸고 다시 새 인생을 살아. 만약 여기 왔다는 소리가 들리면 그 땐 넌 끝이야! 알았어? 이제 너는 이 세상 사람이 아니다. 
SAYID I don't think they're coming.
SUN I want you to let me off this boat.
COLLEEN I can't do that.
SUN Why not?
COLLEEN It's not my decision to make. Do you realize there are 5 of my friends up there?
SUN Lower your voice.
COLLEEN Okay. 
SUN Stop; or I'll shoot.
COLLEEN No you won't, Sun. I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon; and I know you're not a killer. But despite what you may think, I'm not the enemy. We are not the enemy. But if you shoot me, that's exactly what we'll become. 
SUN Stop! I will -- I'll shoot you.
MR. PAIK 네가 여기 있으면 안되겠다. 
SUN 아버지, 여긴 웬일이세요? 
MR. PAIK 이 젊은이 아버지와는 사업 관계로 아는 사이다. 아마 베란다에서 뛰어내렸다지? 얼마나 치욕스러웠으면. 이제 그만 이제 남편이 있는 너의 집으로 돌아가. 
SUN 아버지. 진수씨한테 얘기하실 거예요? 
MR. PAIK 이제와서 무슨 소용이 있다고. 
JIN 당신이 없으면 내가 어떻게 살지 몰라.  당신하고 우리 아이. 
SAYID I'm sorry I dragged you into this. And please communicate to your husband that next time I will listen to him. We should go. We have a long walk ahead of us.
JIN 가자.
KATE Are you okay?
SAWYER Never better.
KATE What the hell were you thinking?
SAWYER I couldn't help myself -- you just looked so damn cute swinging that pickaxe. Chain gang looks good on you, Freckles.
KATE Sawyer.
SAWYER Two of those guards got some real fight in them. The rest of them, I'm not so much worried about. That heavy-set guy -- he packs a hell of a punch. The shaggy-haired kid's got some kind of martial arts training, but I think I could take him if I had to. Oh, FYI -- those zapper things got a safety on them.
KATE Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle?
SAWYER I'm guessing most of these boys have never seen any real action. But that blond who had a gun pointed at you? She would have shot you -- no problem.
KATE Why'd she call you James?
SAWYER Because that's my name. I noticed something else, too. You taste like strawberries.
KATE You taste like fish biscuits. So what do we do now?
SAWYER Well, Shortcake, now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake.
SAWYER Sooner or later, they're going to let their guard down. And when they do, we're going to be there to put them in their place.
BEN Hello, Jack. You know what's crazy, Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry that I lied to you about who I was; but, hell, do you blame me? I mean, let's face it, if I had told you I was one of those people that you and your friends have been calling Others all this time it would have been right back to Sayid and his -- fists. Wouldn't it?
JACK What do you want from me?
BEN I want for you to change your at--perspective. And, the first step in doing that would be for me to be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so -- Hi, my name is Benjamin Linus and I've lived on this island all my life. You're not going to shake?
BEN Bring it in, please.
JACK Where are Kate and Sawyer?
BEN They're fine; and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now.
JACK You can tell me anything you want.
BEN Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm going to make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate; we send you home.
JACK Cooperate with what?
BEN When the time is right, I'll tell you...
JACK You tell me now.
BEN Patience, Jack. Patience.
JACK Home -- is that where you sent Walt and Michael?
BEN Yes.
JACK If you could leave this island why would you still be here?
BEN Yes, Jack, why would we be here?
JACK You're lying. You're stuck here just like we are. You don't have any...
BEN Your flight crashed on September 22nd, 2004. Today is November 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. Yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush; Christopher Reeve has passed away; the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. What?
JACK If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should have picked somebody else besides the Red Sox.
BEN No, they were down 3 games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won 8 straight.
JACK Sure. Sure, of course they did.
BEN That's home, Jack. Right there, on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me -- if you trust me -- if you do what I tell you when the time comes -- I'll take you there. I will take you home.
