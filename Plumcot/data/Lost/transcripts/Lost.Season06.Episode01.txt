cindy_chandler So how's the drink?
dr_jack_shephard Uh... it's good.
cindy_chandler That's not a very strong reaction.
dr_jack_shephard Well, it's--it's not a very strong drink.
cindy_chandler Don't tell anyone.
dr_jack_shephard It'll be our secret.
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.
cindy_chandler Please return to your seats and keep your seat belts fastened.
rose_nadler It's normal. My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.
dr_jack_shephard Sounds like a smart man.
rose_nadler You be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry--
rose_nadler You can let go now.
rose_nadler It's okay. You--you can let go.
dr_jack_shephard Looks like we made it.
rose_nadler Yeah. We sure did.
seth_norris Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks. We just hit a pocket of rough air. It should be a smooth ride from here on out.
bernard_nadler Remind me to hold it next time, will ya? I almost died in that bathroom.
bernard_nadler Now I know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.
rose_nadler I missed you.
bernard_nadler I missed you, too, beautiful.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me.
desmond_hume Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat? The stewardess said it was empty.
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I'm at the window.
desmond_hume Oh, right. Listen, mate, do you mind if I sit here? It's just the fella next to me has been snoring ever since we took off from Sydney.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, no problem.
desmond_hume Thanks, brother. Something wrong?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, you just... Do I know you from somewhere?
desmond_hume Well, I'm not sure. Desmond.
dr_jack_shephard Jack.
desmond_hume Nice to meet you, Jack... or to see you again.
dr_juliet_burke Aah! No! No!
james_ford Juliet!
dr_juliet_burke Aah!
james_ford I got you. No, don't let go!
dr_juliet_burke Aah!
james_ford Juliet! No!
dr_juliet_burke Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
kate_austen Aah!
kate_austen Hello?
kate_austen Hello?!
miles_straume Hey!
miles_straume Hey! Hey! Kate!
miles_straume It's okay. It's me, miles. It's okay.
kate_austen What happened?
miles_straume What?
kate_austen Where are we?
miles_straume I can't--I can't hear you. Are your ears ringing?
miles_straume What is it?
kate_austen We're back.
miles_straume Back where?
kate_austen No.
miles_straume Is that the construction site?
kate_austen No. That's the Swan hatch... after Desmond blew it up.
miles_straume Guess we're not in 1977, huh?
kate_austen Jack? Jack. Can you hear me? Jack!
dr_jack_shephard What happened? Where are we?
kate_austen At the hatch.
dr_jack_shephard What? They built it?
kate_austen Yeah. They built it.
kate_austen Sawyer!
dr_jack_shephard Uhh!
james_ford You were wrong! That's the damn Swan hatch--blown up just like we left it before we started jumping through time! You said we could stop it from ever gettin' built! That our plane would never crash on this Island!
kate_austen Stop it!
james_ford This ain't LAX!
kate_austen Stop it!
james_ford You blew us right back where we started! Except Juliet's dead. She's dead, you son of a bitch, 'cause you were wrong.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer... I'm sorry. I thought we were supposed to... I thought it would work.
james_ford Well, it didn't!
dr_jack_shephard You in line?
marshal_edward_mars No, I'm just waiting for my friend.
kate_austen Oh!
dr_jack_shephard Whoa.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I didn't...
dr_jack_shephard It's okay.
kate_austen I didn't see you there.
dr_jack_shephard It's okay.
marshal_edward_mars Let's get back to our seats, sweetheart.
marshal_edward_mars Mmm. Lasagna.
marshal_edward_mars No. No knife and fork for you, honey.
kate_austen What do you think I'm gonna do, stab you and run?
marshal_edward_mars Hey, watch we're you're going, buddy.
james_ford Sorry. My bad.
dr_leslie_arzt Say it. Come on, please? Just once.
hugo_reyes I really don't want to, dude.
dr_leslie_arzt I love those commercials. Come on. Just do the Australian accent, and I'll leave you alone.
hugo_reyes All right. Fine. All right. Oi! Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!
dr_leslie_arzt You know who this is? This is--this is the owner of Mr. Cluck's Chicken. And he's--and he's back here riding coach with the rest of us yutzes! Huh?
james_ford How about that?
dr_leslie_arzt Hey, um, do you mind me asking, how exactly did a guy like you get to own a major corporation?
hugo_reyes I won the lottery and I like chicken, so I bought it.
dr_leslie_arzt Oh. Good. Good for you.
james_ford You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.
hugo_reyes Yeah? Why not?
james_ford Cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not.
hugo_reyes Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.
james_ford It's not, huh?
hugo_reyes Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me. I'm the luckiest guy alive.
hugo_reyes What just happened?
jinsoo_kwon I found a flashlight.
hugo_reyes Dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night. What happened?!
jinsoo_kwon I think we moved through time.
hugo_reyes How do you know that?
jinsoo_kwon White flash. Headache. Can't hear. Happened to me before.
hugo_reyes What about Jack and everyone else? Did they move through time, too?
jinsoo_kwon I don't know. They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.
jinsoo_kwon And then I heard gunfire--
hugo_reyes Shh!
james_ford You said that our plane would never crash on this Island!
hugo_reyes You hear that, dude? It's Sawyer.
jinsoo_kwon Stay here with Sayid.
dr_jack_shephard The bomb must've gone off.
james_ford You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
james_ford That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!
jinsoo_kwon Jack! Sayid needs help.
dr_jack_shephard Where is he?
jinsoo_kwon With Hurley at the van. Two minutes away.
dr_juliet_burke Help.
jinsoo_kwon He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.
dr_juliet_burke Help me.
james_ford So what do you say, doc? Got another great idea to save Sayid? Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
kate_austen Hey, shut up!
dr_juliet_burke Help.
james_ford Juliet!
dr_juliet_burke James?
kate_austen Oh, my God.
james_ford Juliet!
hugo_reyes Oh, God. Oh, God, this is gross.
hugo_reyes Don't worry, dude. Everything's gonna be fine.
sayid_jarrah When I die... what do you think will happen to me?
hugo_reyes Just--just try not to talk, dude.
sayid_jarrah I've tortured more people than I can remember. I murdered. Wherever I'm going... it can't be very pleasant.
hugo_reyes Sayid, come on.
sayid_jarrah I deserve it.
hugo_reyes Hello? Jin?
hugo_reyes Jin!
hugo_reyes I've got a gun!
hugo_reyes And I know how to shoot it!
jacob Hello, Hugo. You got a minute?
jinsoo_kwon 저 사람들을 뭘 쳐다봐?
sunhwa_kwon 아니... 그냥 너무 행복해보여서요.
jinsoo_kwon 단추 채워라.
boone_carlyle You're wasting your time, man. This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.
john_locke Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, we could survive a water landing. And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough to keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts...
john_locke What?
boone_carlyle No, it's just impressive you know that. So what were you doing in Australia? Business or pleasure?
john_locke Pleasure. You?
boone_carlyle I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship that it turns out she didn't want to get out of. So... here I am. So what, you were just Down Under for vacation?
john_locke Actually, I went on a walkabout.
boone_carlyle Really? Like--like Crocodile Dundee?
john_locke No, not exactly. But--but, uh, it was pretty intense. We--we spent ten days in the Outback and, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives. We slept under the stars and made our own fires, hunted our own food.
boone_carlyle Wow. I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.
boone_carlyle You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
john_locke Why would I pull your leg?
boone_carlyle This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.
john_locke You can stop staring at the fire. Jacob's gone. He's gone.
ben_linus Why didn't he fight back? Why did he let me just kill him?
john_locke I guess he knew that he was beaten. Ben... I want you to go outside and tell Richard that I need to talk to him.
ben_linus Talk to him about... what?
john_locke That's between me and Richard.
richard_alpert There's no other reason.
bram No, that's not how it's gonna be.
richard_alpert You have to--you're not going in there.
richard_alpert No
richard_alpert Just back up a little. Okay?
sunhwa_kwon Who are they?
frank_lapidus Other than the fact that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us, all I know is they knocked me out and dragged my ass to some cabin, which they promptly burned, then... brought me here along with the dead guy in the box. They say they're the good guys.
frank_lapidus I'm not buying it either.
richard_alpert Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully. No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.
ilana_verdansky Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.
richard_alpert Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue doesn't mean you're in charge.
ilana_verdansky Then who is?
ben_linus Richard.
richard_alpert Ben. What happened in there?
ben_linus Everything's fine. John wants to speak to you.
ilana_verdansky Is Jacob all right?
ben_linus I'm sorry. Who are you?
richard_alpert Answer her question, Ben.
ben_linus Well, of course Jacob's all right. They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.
richard_alpert John wants to talk to me?
ben_linus That's right.
ben_linus Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.
richard_alpert Well, I'm happy to talk to John. But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.
james_ford Hang on, Juliet! We're comin'!
dr_jack_shephard Jin! Flashlight!
james_ford If we can move this beam, I think I can get down there.
james_ford It's too heavy... we need something to pull it. Jin! The van. There's chains in it. Go get 'em!
hugo_reyes Where you goin', dude? And what are you doin' here? I mean... I meet you in a taxi and you know everything about me and you give me a plane ticket which just so happens to get me back on this Island. How'd you know that was gonna happen?
hugo_reyes Hello? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?
hugo_reyes Look, my friend Jin is gonna be here any second so you better stop ignoring--
jacob Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.
hugo_reyes Why not?
jacob Because I died an hour ago.
hugo_reyes Sorry, dude, that sucks.
jacob Thanks.
hugo_reyes How'd you die?
jacob I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.
hugo_reyes You want me to do something crazy again, don't you?
jacob No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Well that's why Jin went to go get Jack...
jacob Jin can't help him. You need to take Sayid to the Temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there.
hugo_reyes The Temple? I'm supposed to know what that is?
jacob Jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the French team. Through that opening you can get into the Temple. You still have that guitar case I gave you?
hugo_reyes Yeah...
jacob Bring it.
hugo_reyes Who are you, dude?
jacob I'm Jacob.
jinsoo_kwon Hurley! Help me with Sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help.
jinsoo_kwon Come on, we have to go!
hugo_reyes Jin, if I asked you to take me to where there's, like, a hole in the wall... where you went with the French team... would you know what I was talkin' about?
jinsoo_kwon Yes.
hugo_reyes Good.
dr_jack_shephard I'll get the chain.
james_ford Juliet!
kate_austen Stop it! Stop, Sawyer! The van is here, the chains are coming.
james_ford She ain't makin' any more noises...
kate_austen No, she knows we're here. She's probably just resting.
james_ford Juliet!
james_ford If she dies, I'll kill him.
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about, but if there is a doctor onboard could you please press your call button?
cindy_chandler Sir? You're a doctor?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
cindy_chandler Could you come with me please?
cindy_chandler We appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom about half an hour ago and he's not responding when we knock.
cindy_chandler This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there--"
EMPLOYEE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode01 Well, I think he tampered with the lock, it's... it's jammed or something, I don't know.
sayid_jarrah Can I be of assistance?
sayid_jarrah Excuse me.
dr_jack_shephard He's not breathing.
james_ford What's goin' on back there, Earheart?
cindy_chandler Everything's fine sir, please just stay in your seats.
james_ford ...yeah, looks peachy.
dr_jack_shephard ...Sir, I'm gonna need your help.
sayid_jarrah What can I do?
dr_jack_shephard I need ya to hold this over his mouth... hold it there and do not let any air escape.
sayid_jarrah OK, now?
dr_jack_shephard Yes, now.
dr_jack_shephard Somethings blocking his air passage. I'm gonna have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp - a razor...
dr_jack_shephard I gotta pen.
sayid_jarrah A pen!?
cindy_chandler It's regulation, there's nothing sharp.
dr_jack_shephard A pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damnit.
dr_jack_shephard I got it, I got it. Relax, just relax, breathe.
charlie_pace Am I alive?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, you're alive.
charlie_pace ...Terrific.
dr_jack_shephard You got it?
james_ford Okay Jin! We're good down here! ...hit it!
james_ford Gimme the flashlight.
james_ford Juliet! Okay...I'm comin... Juliet? Hey, I'm here, come on baby, come on wake up.
dr_juliet_burke Hi.
james_ford Hey.
dr_juliet_burke Wh-Wh-Where are we?
james_ford Don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you outta here, okay?
dr_juliet_burke It didn't work, we're still on the Island.
james_ford It's okay, It's okay, I just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay?
dr_juliet_burke No, I hit the bomb and you're still here.
james_ford You what? ...You hit the bomb? Why?
dr_juliet_burke I wanted you to be able to go home. I wanted to make it so you never came to this damn Island ...it didn't work.
james_ford Don't you worry about that. You're gonna be OK. I'm gonna get you outta here and we're all gonna go home together, you hear me?
kate_austen Sawyer!?
dr_jack_shephard Even if I could get the bullet out, bleeding won't stop, there's nothing I can do for him.
hugo_reyes There's somethin' I can do. There's a temple, if we can get Sayid there we can save him.
miles_straume And you know this how?
hugo_reyes This guy Jacob told me just before we got here.
dr_jack_shephard Who's Jacob?
hugo_reyes Does it matter? Can you fix Sayid, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No.
hugo_reyes Then you're gonna have to let me do it.
richard_alpert Ben, you need to talk to me. I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there. What happened to Jacob.
richard_alpert You and I have known each other for 30 years Ben, I'm asking you this as a friend.
ben_linus You wanna know what happened Richard? Why don't 'cha go inside and find out.
richard_alpert What are ya doin?
bram We're goin in, and he's comin' with us.
john_locke Where's Richard?
ben_linus He's not coming.
john_locke Then who is that behind you?
bram Where's Jacob?
john_locke Jacob is dead.
bram Who are you?
john_locke Don't worry about me. Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are, what? Jacobs bodyguards? And that you came all the way to this Island to protect him? Well I have good news, Jacob burned up, right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free.
bram Kill him! Spread out! Get him! ...where is he?
john_locke I'm sorry you had to see me like that.
kate_austen Sawyer!? Is she ok?
james_ford Working on it!
james_ford Okay, okay, I got'cha, I got'cha. Don't worry.
dr_juliet_burke We can get coffee some time.
james_ford I gotta get you outta here.
dr_juliet_burke We can go dutch.
james_ford Juliet...it's me.
dr_juliet_burke ...James.

dr_juliet_burke I have to tell you something, it's really really important.
james_ford You tell me... you tell me...
james_ford Juliet? You tell me ...oh...oh my god
james_ford You did this.
charlie_pace Should'a let that happen man, I was supposed to die.
cindy_chandler Don't take it personally, some people just don't know how to say thanks.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me, do you know what happened to the guy that was sitting next to me?
rose_nadler Um, we were asleep.
seth_norris Ladies and Gentlemen, captain Norris here, we're now beginning our final descent into Los Angeles international airport, I'm happy to tell you it's a beautiful day in Los Angeles, 72 degrees, 6 miles visibility and winds outta the south-west at 5 miles an hour.
