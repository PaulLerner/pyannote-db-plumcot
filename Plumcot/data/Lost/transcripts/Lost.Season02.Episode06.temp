SHANNON You thirsty, dog? Yeah, you're always thirsty, aren't ya? So drink.
SAYID Come on, gather your things.
SHANNON Where are we going? Sayid?
SAYID Right over here.
SHANNON Where are we going?
SAYID What do you think?
SHANNON Does it have an inside?
SHANNON When did you do this?
SAYID It's all yours.
SHANNON Thank you.
SAYID You're quite welcome.
SAYID I'm sorry.
SHANNON You need to carry that all the time?
SAYID I only carry it because I have someone to protect.
CINDY Ana, it's got to be over an hour. Shouldn't we start moving again?
ANA Let them rest a little while longer.
CINDY Yeah, but what if they come?
SAWYER She's lost.
ANA I'm not lost.
SAWYER Then tell me, Ponce de Leon, which way are we supposed to go?
ANA Alright then, genius, where would you go?
SAWYER Hey, I'm with you -- sit tight and wait for Mr. Eko to show up and guide us.
ANA If your friend didn't run off, Eko would still be here now, wouldn't he? You sure didn't have any problem leaving him behind, though, huh?
SAWYER Mike only cares about himself and his kid, and neither's got squat to do with me.
MICHAEL Glad you feel that way.
SAWYER Didn't expect to see you again.
JIN  걸을 수 있겠어?
SAWYER Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know. My arm's about to fall off.
ANA You okay?
EKO Yes, but we have to go. I saw them.
CINDY What?
BERNARD What do you mean, you saw them?
CINDY How many were there?
LIBBY Did you see the kids?
ANA Libby.
EKO We need to go. Now.
ANA Alright. We're moving out. Now.
SHANNON So, does all this -- the tent, flowers -- mean that we're serious now?
SAYID Quite definitely not. I do this for all the girls I meet on deserted Islands.
SHANNON Don't go anywhere.
SAYID Where are you going?
SHANNON To get some water.
SAYID Let me. I'll be right back.
SHANNON That was quick.
SAYID There's nothing -- no one there.
SHANNON I am telling you I saw Walt.
SAYID It was a dream, Shannon.
SHANNON He was here. I saw him. He went into the tent.
SAYID I was only gone a few moments. You must have fallen asleep.
SHANNON This was not a dream! I saw Walt!
SAYID Then where is he?
CHARLIE Hey, what's going on?
SAYID Nothing. It's just a dream; everything's fine.
SAYID Shannon...
CLAIRE What's wrong?
CHARLIE Shannon had a nightmare. Why's he up?
CLAIRE I woke him.
CHARLIE Woke him?
CLAIRE I heard screams -- I got worried. Why, would you rather I had left him over there alone?
CHARLIE You heard screams so woke up the baby and ran toward them?
CLAIRE Okay, it sounded like she needed help.
CHARLIE Well, he's going to need feeding now. He's going to be up all night and fussy all day.
CLAIRE Sorry.
CHARLIE Alright, well, no harm done -- give him here then. I got him.
SAYID Wait. Wait! Come back with me; let's talk about this.
SHANNON Do you believe me? No. I know what I saw.
SHANNON Beautiful, Sophie. Okay, can you bring your shoulders down for me a little -- extend up, good -- and finish. Very nice, ladies.
SOPHIE Did my papa see me?
SHANNON I think so. Wonderful, alright, thank you for a great class today, ladies.
NORA He wants me to be his au pair, can you believe that?
SHANNON Au pair, my ass.
NORA Live in my big house, take care of my kids -- next thing you know it's Oh, I'm so sorry; I did not know you were in the shower. What a perve!
SHANNON Hello.
SABRINA Shannon, your father's been in an accident. I'm on my way to St. Sebastian's, I'll meet you there.
DOCTOR Mrs. Rutherford?
SABRINA Yes.
DOCTOR Why don't we talk down here?
SABRINA Doctor, my husband, Adam, how is he?
DOCTOR Your husband was in a head-on collision with an SUV. He suffered massive internal injuries. He stopped breathing at the site of the accident. I'm afraid we were unable to resuscitate him. I'm so sorry.
SABRINA May I see him?
DOCTOR Of course. Would your daughter like to come?
SABRINA Step-daughter. Come on, Shannon.
ANA How much further to their camp?
EKO A day -- maybe more, maybe less.
ANA Thanks for being so specific.
SAWYER Damn it!
SAWYER Okay, okay. I'm fine.
LIBBY You want to let me just take a look at your shoulder?
SAWYER What, are you a doctor?
LIBBY A clinical psychologist.
SAWYER You're a shrink? Well, maybe you ought to talk to my shoulder.
LIBBY How'd you get shot, anyway?
SAWYER With a gun.
MICHAEL He got shot when they took my kid.
SAWYER It's bad, right?
LIBBY Yeah, it's bad. But it's not real bad. C'mon, you're going to be okay. Let's go.
SAWYER I got it. I'm alright. I'm fine.
BERNARD Let me give you a hand, okay?
HURLEY Um, tell me again why we're doing this here when there's a dryer in the hatch?
ROSE I don't like the hatch.
HURLEY Oh, it's because of the doomsday button, isn't it?
ROSE Well, who needs a dryer when we've got sun and fresh air? We wouldn't want to spoil ourselves, now would we?
HURLEY Yeah, spoiled.
SHANNON Hey, do you guys know where Michael and Walt left the stuff they didn't take with them on the raft?
HURLEY What kind of stuff?
SHANNON Their clothes.
HURLEY I think their stuff's still on the beach back where their tent is.
SHANNON Thanks.
ROSE Poor thing, it can't be easy losing the one person you love on the Island.
SHANNON Here, smell this, that's his, right? Come on, get a good whiff of it. You're always trying to run off and find him? Then find him. Find Walt.
SHANNON Good dog. Find Walt.
CLAIRE I know I woke you and I'm very, very sorry; but please, staying awake for 8 hours straight -- isn't that just cruel and unusual punishment?
LOCKE How's that cradle treating you?
CLAIRE The cradles great. It's the baby that's the problem.
LOCKE What's wrong?
CLAIRE He just won't sleep.
LOCKE May I?
CLAIRE Sure.
LOCKE Babies like the feeling of being constricted. It's not until we're older that we develop a desire to be free. There.
CLAIRE You know, I think everybody knows more about my baby than me.
LOCKE Everybody?
CLAIRE Charlie read me the riot act last night for waking him. And as mad as it made me -- turns out he was right. You know, it's like we're playing mum and dad to this baby. Yet, I don't remember marrying him. No, seriously. I mean, we're practically strangers, him and me. For all I know, Charlie could be some religious freak.
LOCKE Yeah, I seriously doubt that.
CLAIRE Then why is he carrying around a Virgin Mary statue?
LOCKE What?
CLAIRE You know, one of the little statues? He says he found it in the jungle.
LOCKE Hmm, how about that?
BOONE Death sucks, doesn't it?
SHANNON Boone!
BOONE Hey. I'm so sorry, Shannon.
SHANNON You came back.
BOONE Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?
SHANNON I'm 18, Boone. Your mom's going to freak.
BOONE It's a wake. I mean, seriously, who doesn't serve booze at a wake? Scotch? To your dad. Maybe after all this you'll come visit me in New York.
SHANNON I won't have to visit if I get that job at the Martha Graham dance company. I'll be living there.
BOONE Right. Internship. 
SHANNON I know it's like a 1 in 3000 chance, but I may get it.
BOONE Absolutely. Have you spoken to my mother?
SHANNON She's going through her thing and I'm going through mine.
BOONE Have you two been getting along?
SHANNON She hates me.
BOONE Just try to talk to her.
SHANNON From day one she resented my relationship with him, my dad.
EKO We need a break.
ANA 5 minutes!
EKO Here.
ANA What are you looking at?
EKO We have to cut inland.
ANA What? Into the jungle? They said their people were on the beach. If we keep walking...
EKO The beach goes into a peninsula ahead. It may not be passable.
ANA May not?
EKO May not.
ANA You're doing this to get the cowboy back faster, aren't you? You would risk our lives to help him?
EKO It's the only way I know.
ANA I liked you better when you weren't talking.
CLAIRE I can't believe he's still asleep.
LOCKE Swaddling works every time.
CLAIRE Uh-huh. Hey, do you want to hold him?
LOCKE That's okay.
CLAIRE Put your arms out. It's okay.
LOCKE He smells good.
CLAIRE He does, doesn't he?
LOCKE Yeah.
CHARLIE Oh.
LOCKE Hello, Charlie.
CHARLIE Hello.
CLAIRE Hey, John just taught me a new trick swaddling.
CHARLIE That's excellent. I just came to take him so you could have your walk.
LOCKE Well, great timing, yeah. I've got to get going.
CLAIRE Well, thanks for your help, John.
LOCKE Welcome.
CLAIRE What?
JIN 나한테 기대.
JIN 나한테 기대.
SAWYER I'm fine.
JIN 기대라니까! 내가 부축해 줄게.
SAWYER I'm fine.
JIN 기대라니까!
ANA Shhhh - shut up.
MICHAEL What? They can't talk at all?
ANA If he talks he's going to get us all killed.
MICHAEL By what? Them? I thought they lived a day back that way?
ANA How about you shut your mouth and get your buddy over here moving?
MICHAEL What happened to you people? You want us to take you back with us? Fine. But you want me to keep quiet then you need to tell me why I have to.
ANA They came the first night that we got here. They took three of us. Nothing happened for two weeks, then they came back. They took nine more. They're smart, and they're animals, and they could be anywhere at any time. Now we're moving through the jungle -- their jungle -- just so you can save your little hick friend over here. And if you think that one gun and one bullet is going to stop them -- think again. So shut your mouth and keep moving.
MICHAEL They took my son.
ANA They took a lot of things.
SAYID I know what it is to lose someone you care deeply about.
SHANNON You really think that this is all about Boone? I saw Walt, Sayid.
SAYID Then why are we sitting at Boone's grave.
SHANNON Just go back, Sayid.
SAYID Where are you going?
SHANNON To find him.
NORA It came.
SHANNON Oh my god.
NORA Open it.
SHANNON I can't open it.
NORA You what?
SHANNON You open it.
NORA You have been waiting 6 months for this letter -- no way I'm opening it.
SHANNON I got it!
NORA You got it?1
SHANNON I got it!!
NORA Oh my god, you're going to New York!
SHANNON Hello. This is her. Uh, that's impossible. Okay, are you sure? Of course, I will certainly do that. Sorry.
NORA What?
SHANNON My rent check bounced.
NORA But you're, like, rich.
SABRINA I'm sorry, I would have offered you something to drink, but I have to be at a meeting in 10 minutes.
SHANNON Yeah, um, my checks are bouncing.
SABRINA Well, that's what happens when you make withdrawals and don't make deposits, Shannon.
SHANNON When do I get the money dad left me? The money from the will.
SABRINA There was no will.
SHANNON What?
SABRINA Shannon, your father and I had a living trust. Everything passed to me. I'm afraid there was nothing specifically designated for you.
SHANNON Why would he do that?
SABRINA Well, maybe he just wanted you to find your own way. We all have to work, Shannon. Most of us are the better for it.
SHANNON I can work. I just -- I just got this really prestigious internship. And I'm not going to make any money for a while but I'm going to be working like 16 hours a day.
SABRINA The only thing I've ever seen you do 16 hours a day straight is sleep.
SHANNON I just need to get to New York. I need just something -- something to get started. I'll pay you back.
SABRINA This week it's an internship -- last year it was what -- interior design? You'll never pay me back. And you'll only hate yourself even more.
SHANNON I really want this, Sabrina. I can do this.
SABRINA I'm sorry, Shannon. You're on your own.
CHARLIE Oh, double-6's, how nice for you.
LOCKE Lucky. I hope you didn't get the wrong idea seeing me with the baby?
CHARLIE What wrong idea would that be?
LOCKE You and Claire are close, and you spend a lot of time with Aaron -- I just wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
CHARLIE Did she tell you we had a fight?
LOCKE She didn't say it was a fight.
CHARLIE She was going to give it up, you know -- for adoption. Did she tell you that?
LOCKE Yeah, when I built the cradle.
CHARLIE Ah, of course, when you built the cradle.
LOCKE Why do you ask?
CHARLIE She's got a bit to learn about being a mum -- responsibility and all.
LOCKE Hmmm, now that's an interesting thing to say -- for a heroin addict.
CHARLIE Recovering addict.
LOCKE Recovering. It's your turn.
BERNARD Here, let me help you.
JIN 아냐, 아냐.
MICHAEL I got it.
JIN 나 혼자도 할 수 있어.
MICHAEL I said I got it, man. Take a break.
JIN 안 쉬어도 돼.
SAWYER What? You suddenly give a damn about me? Leave me alone. Both of you. I got it.
MICHAEL Hey, hey, hey Okay. Hey, Sawyer, hey you okay?
SAWYER I would have left you behind.
MICHAEL Shut up, man. Don't try that.
SAWYER I did leave you behind.
MICHAEL Yeah, well, good thing I ain't you. No, no, hey, Sawyer. Sawyer, hey.
JIN Water! Water!
LIBBY Here you go. Here, here.
MICHAEL What's the matter with him?
LIBBY Well, the fever -- he's got an infection -- he's dehydrated.
ANA We gotta keep moving.
MICHAEL What?
ANA We gotta keep going.
JIN 소이어를 두고 갈 순 없어!
ANA You wanna stay, that's fine. But we're rolling out.
BERNARD We can't just leave him, Ana.
LIBBY Maybe if we just rest a little while, he'll regain consciousness.
ANA Rest? Here? Do you remember what happened to us? What they did to us? You remember Goodwin?
CINDY Ana's right, maybe we should just push on.
MICHAEL Hey, you know what? I don't remember Goodwin. And I'm really sorry about whatever happened to him, but I don't care. Mr. Eko, can you help me make a stretcher? And Bernard, I need 4 sticks -- sturdy ones -- about 5 feet long.
BERNARD Yeah, got it.
ANA You're going to carry your friend.
MICHAEL Yeah, we're going to carry him.
SAYID Why are you doing this, Shannon?
SHANNON I didn't ask you to follow me.
SAYID No, you'd rather be out here alone and get lost or hurt.
SHANNON I don't need your help, Sayid.
SAYID Walt is not out here. You're following a Labrador, not a Bloodhound -- in an effort to find a boy who's on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
SHANNON He's not on the raft.
SAYID What are you talking about?
SHANNON We found the bottle on the beach.
SAYID The bottle with the messages that they brought with them?
SHANNON I know he's out here somewhere. I saw Walt. And the raft is gone, and he is all alone.
SAYID Shannon.
MICHAEL F*** me...
ANA Cindy. Cindy? Where's Cindy?
BERNARD She was just here.
ANA Cindy! Cindy!
BERNARD I don't know, she was...
LIBBY Did they take her?
MICHAEL How could she just be gone?
BERNARD Cindy! Cindy!
ANA I'm going after her.
EKO No, we stay together -- we split up, we give them what they want.
ANA This is all your fault. We never should have gone through the jungle. You risked our lives to save him and he's already dead. This one's on you.
MICHAEL What the hell is that?
LIBBY Oh, god.
ANA Run!
BOONE Hey.
SHANNON Hey.
BOONE She said no. She knew why I asked for the money.
SHANNON Can I crash at your place in New York for just a little while -- until I get on my feet.
BOONE I'm leaving New York. She offered me a job.
SHANNON You're going to work for your mother?
BOONE It's a really good job, Shannon. Look, this is all I have right now, but my trust fund's going to kick in at the end of the month. And after that I can absolutely keep you afloat.
SHANNON Thank you, but I'm going to figure out a way to make my own money.
BOONE But who knows when that's going to be, just take it.
SHANNON Why, you don't think I can do it?
BOONE I didn't say that.
SHANNON Do you believe I can, or don't you, Boone? Okay, you know what, I really want you to just take your money -- go work for your mother -- I don't want it...
BOONE Shannon, it's just money...
SHANNON Just take it, alright!
BOONE I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
SHANNON I don't want your money!
SAYID Shannon! Are you okay?
SHANNON Do not help me up.
SAYID Let's go back.
SHANNON Why don't you believe me? I need you to believe in me.
SAYID I do believe in you.
SHANNON You don't! No one does. They think that I'm some kind of joke. They think I'm worthless.
SAYID Shannon, you are not worthless.
SHANNON You say that now, but you don't -- you're just going to leave me. I know as soon as we get out of here you're just going to leave me.
SAYID I will never leave you. I love you and I believe you.
SHANNON You do?
SAYID I believe you.
WALT Shhh.
SHANNON Do you see him?
SHANNON Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt!
SAYID Shannon!
SHANNON Walt! Wait!
SAYID Shannon!
SAYID Shannon! Shannon.
