MICHAEL Walt! Walt!
REDSHIRT Stay away from the gas! Stay there!
REDSHIRT_#2 Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Ahh, my leg! Ah! Ah!
JACK Hey you, just give me a hand! You, come on! Come over here, give me a hand! On the count of three One, two, three.
CLAIRE Help! Please help me! Help me, please help me!
JACK All right, get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!
CLAIRE Help me, please. I'm having, I'm having contractions.
JACK How many months pregnant are you?
CLAIRE I'm, I'm nearly eight months.
JACK How far apart are they coming?
CLAIRE I don't know, a-a few just happened.
LOCKE Hey! Hey, hey, hey, get away from there!
GARY What?
JACK Listen to me! Look at me! You're going to be okay, do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still!
JACK Hey, you! Come here! I need you to get this woman away from these fumes! Take her over there. Stay with her. If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.
HURLEY Oh, you got to be kidding me.
JACK I'll be right back, okay?
CLAIRE Thank you.
HURLEY Hey! What's your name?
JACK Jack.
JACK Stop! Her head's not tilted far back enough. You're blowing air into her stomach.
BOONE You sure?
BOONE That's exactly what I was doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
JACK Yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.
BOONE Maybe we should do one of those hole things. You know, stick the pen in the throat?
JACK Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
JACK Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!
JACK Big deep breaths. Take breaths!
JACK Move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! The wing!
JACK You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah.
JACK You? . Stay with her.
HURLEY Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
BOONE I didn't know which one would work best.
JACK They're all good. Thanks.
JACK Excuse me. Did you ever use a needle?
KATE What?
JACK Did you ever … patch a pair of jeans?
KATE I, uhm, I made the drapes in my apartment.
JACK That's fantastic. Listen, do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
KATE And with what?
JACK With this.
JACK Look, I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.
KATE You want me to sew that up?
JACK It's just like the drapes, same thing.
KATE No, with the drapes I used a sewing machine.
JACK No, you can do this. I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind.
KATE Of course I will.
JACK Thank you. It's for your hands. Save me some for the, for the wound.
KATE Any color preference?
JACK No. Standard black.
BOONE Come on.
SAYID Hey you. What's your name?
CHARLIE Me? Charlie.
SAYID Charlie. We need help with the fire. No-one will see it if it isn't big.
CHARLIE Okay, I'm on it. What's your name?
SAYID Sayid.
CHARLIE Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.
KATE I might throw up on you.
JACK You're doing fine.
KATE You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
JACK Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
KATE If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
JACK No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.
SAYID You think they would have come by now.
CHARLIE Huh? Who?
SAYID Anyone.
SHANNON As if I'm going to start eating chocolate.
BOONE Shannon, we may be here for a while.
SHANNON The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where they are, they're coming. I'll eat on the rescue boat. . I'll. Eat. On. The. Rescue. Boat. 
HURLEY Hungry?
CLAIRE Yeah, thanks.
HURLEY Anymore, uh... you know, baby stuff?
CLAIRE No. I'm-I'm okay.
HURLEY Well, hang in there.
CLAIRE Yeah, you too.
MICHAEL You sure you're warm enough?
JIN 내 옆에서 없어지면 안 돼. 내가 어디로 가든지 꼭 따라와. 알겠지? 다른 사람 신경쓰지 말고 우린 같이 있어야 돼. 
KATE Do you think he's going to live?
JACK Do you know him?
KATE He was sitting next to me.
JACK We must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. Hit an air pocket. Dropped, maybe, 200 feet. The turbulence was … I blacked out.
KATE I didn't. I saw the whole thing. I knew that the tail was gone, but I couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the, the front of the plane broke off.
JACK Well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in.
KATE Why?
JACK Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's intact, we might be able to find a transceiver. Send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
KATE How do you know all that?
JACK Took a couple flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
KATE I saw some smoke. Just through the valley. If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.
JACK I don't know your name.
KATE I'm Kate.
JACK Jack.
SHANNON What was that?
CHARLIE That was weird, right?
WALT Is that Vincent?
MICHAEL It's not Vincent.
CLAIRE Did anybody see that?
HURLEY Yeah.
SHANNON Boone!
CHARLIE Terrific.
CINDY So, how's the drink?
JACK It's good.
CINDY That wasn't a very strong reaction.
JACK Well, it's not a very strong drink.
CINDY Shhh. Just don't tell anyone.
JACK This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations.
CHARLIE Excuse me.
CINDY Sir, excuse me!
ROSE Guess he really had to go.
CINDY Sir, excuse me!
CINDY Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
JACK It's normal.
ROSE Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
JACK Well, he sounds like a very smart man.
ROSE Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
JACK Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry it's going to be over...
MICHAEL It didn't sound like an animal. Not exactly, I mean.
ROSE That sound that it made, I keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it.
SHANNON Really? Where are you from?
ROSE The Bronx.
CHARLIE Might be monkeys. It's monkeys, right?
SAWYER Sure it's monkeys. It's Monkey Island.
HURLEY Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island.
SAYID We're on an Island.
KATE You ready?
JACK Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
KATE I'm coming.
JACK Well, you're going to need better shoes.
MICHAEL Whatever it was … it wasn't natural.
CHARLIE Does anyone have any sun block?
SHANNON Yeah, I do.
CHARLIE Ah. Cool.
HURLEY So, I was just looking inside the fuselage … It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh … b-o-d-y-s?
MICHAEL What are you spelling, man? "Bodies"?
WALT B-o-d-i-e-s.
SAYID That sounds like a good idea.
SHANNON No! They'll deal with it when they get here.
JACK We go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver, to send a distress signal, help the rescue team. (To Boone) You're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded. If the guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm, but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?
BOONE Yeah, got it. What about the guy with the leg? The, the tourniquet.
JACK I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He … he should be all right.
BOONE Yeah. Cool. Good job.
CHARLIE I'll come with you. I want to help.
JACK I don't need any more help.
CHARLIE No, it's cool, I don't really feel like standing still, so. Excellent.
KATE May I ask you something?
CHARLIE Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
KATE Have we ever met, anywhere?
CHARLIE No, that would be unlikely.
KATE Hum.
CHARLIE I look familiar, though, right?
KATE Yeah.
CHARLIE Can't quite place it?
KATE No, I can't.
CHARLIE Yeah. I think I know.
KATE You do?
CHARLIE You all everybody … You all everybody! You've never heard that song?
KATE I've heard it. I just don't know what the hell it is—
CHARLIE That's us. Drive Shaft. Look, the ring—second tour of Finland. You've never heard of Drive Shaft?
KATE The band?
CHARLIE Yeah, the band.
KATE You were in Drive Shaft.
CHARLIE I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.
KATE Seriously?
CHARLIE Yeah, Charlie. Track 3, you know, I do backing vocals.
KATE My friend Beth would freak. She loved you guys.
CHARLIE Give me Beth's number, I'll call her, I'd, I'd love to.
JACK Hey—
CHARLIE Does she live nearby?
KATE Have you ever heard of Drive Shaft?
CHARLIE You all everybody... You all every...body.
JACK We've got to keep moving.
KATE They were good.
CHARLIE They are good. We're still together. In the middle of a comeback.
CHARLIE Hey guys, is this normal? Kind of ... day turning into night, you know? End of the world type weather. Is this—guys?
HURLEY I don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
CLAIRE There it is again.
ROSE Oh my god.
JACK Well? Let's do this.
CHARLIE Let's get this trans…
JACK Transceiver.
CHARLIE Transceiver thing and get out of here.
JACK Come on! Come...
JACK You okay?
KATE Yeah. You?
JACK Yeah.
CHARLIE I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. Okay?
JACK Hey. You don't have to come up here.
KATE No, I'm good.
KATE So, what does a transceiver look like?
JACK Complicated walkie-talkie.
JACK Hey! Can you hear me? I need that water. Here. Here you go. Hey.
PILOT How many survived?
JACK At least 48. Does anything feel broken?
PILOT No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
JACK Yeah. It's probably a concussion.
PILOT How long has it been?
JACK Sixteen hours.
PILOT Sixteen? Has anybody come?
JACK Not yet.
PILOT Six hours in, our radio went out. No-one could see us. We turned back to land in Fiji. By the time we hit turbulence, we … we were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place.
PILOT We have a transceiver.
JACK Good. Good, that's what we were hoping. Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
PILOT No, no. I'm okay. It's okay. Transceiver's right there. It's right there.
JACK Where's Charlie?
PILOT It's not working.
KATE Charlie?
KATE What were you doing in the bathroom?
CHARLIE What?
PILOT What the hell was that?
JACK Kate.
KATE It's right outside.
PILOT What, what's right outside?
JACK Shhhh.
CHARLIE What the hell just happened?
KATE Jack, come on!
CHARLIE Just leave it!
CHARLIE Hey!
JACK Okay, let's run.
KATE J-J-J... Jaaaack! One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
CHARLIE Kate!
KATE Where the hell is Jack?
CHARLIE I don't know!
KATE Did you see him?
CHARLIE Yeah, he pulled me up!
KATE Where is he?
CHARLIE I don't know!
KATE How can you not know?
CHARLIE We got separated! Look, I … I fell down, and he, he came back for me, that thing was just…
KATE Did you see it?
CHARLIE No. No! But it was right there. We were dead! I was. An-And then Jack came back, and he, he pulled me up. I don't know where he is.
KATE We have to go back for him.
CHARLIE Go back? There? Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
KATE Then don't come.
CHARLIE Kate!
CHARLIE I heard you shout. I heard you shout "Jack". I'm Charlie, by the way.
CHARLIE What is that?
CHARLIE What is...
JACK It's the pilot.
KATE Did you see it?
JACK No. It was right behind me, but... I dove into the bushes.
CHARLIE Guys? How does something like that happen?
