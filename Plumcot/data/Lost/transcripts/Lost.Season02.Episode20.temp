KATE Michael, Michael. What's wrong with him? Michael. Michael? Jack, where are you going?
JACK Maybe they just let him go?
KATE Let him go? He's alone. They didn't just push him out into the jungle, Jack! He's alone!
JACK Okay, let's go.
PARTNER See ya, Ana Lucia.
CAPTAIN You look tired.
ANA Yeah, thanks. What?
CAPTAIN Where were you last night?
ANA Home.
CAPTAIN All night?
ANA Yeah, cooked myself some dinner, watched some TV.
CAPTAIN What'd you watch? Let's go for a drive.
CAPTAIN Remember Jason McCormack? Found him in a parking lot just after three in the morning. He was dead an hour before anyone saw him. Crime scene pulled a gun from the dumpster -- registration was filed off, no prints, no witnesses. He was executed.
ANA Any idea who did it?
CAPTAIN Yeah, Ana, you did. This man confesses to shooting you in cold blood, and you refuse to ID him, so we had to cut him loose. A week later he shows up with five bullets in his chest because you shot him in cold blood.
ANA Guess I should get a lawyer.
CAPTAIN Look, we both know that this is going to be a dead-end investigation. But, Ana, if you did this -- if you did this -- you have to let me help you.
ANA Yeah, thanks, mom; but I don't need your help.
CAPTAIN You don't want my help; you're going to have to get it from somewhere else. You're a police officer, Ana. If you don't respect me, at least respect that.
ANA Then I quit.
ANA Hey, Henry, what do you say? How long are you going to keep up this hunger strike, Henry? I ever tell you I was a cop? I've been around a lot of killers in my life. You know what surprises me most about them? How much they love to talk. But you're different, Henry. Hmm? Quiet.
GALE 
ANA What was that?
GALE 
ANA If you're going to say something; you're going to have to speak up.
GALE You killed two of us -- good people who were leaving you alone. You're the killer, Ana Lucia.
LOCKE I guess he decided to start talking, huh?
ANA Hey, Mike, tequila-tonic.
CHRISTIAN Long day, huh? Good to see you again. You, uh, wanded me at security. Another one, please. So, how does one get into wanding?
ANA One stops being a cop.
CHRISTIAN What a coincidence, I just stopped being a doctor.
ANA Why'd you quit?
CHRISTIAN I didn't. My son ratted me out for drinking on the job. Thank you. Lost my license. Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.
ANA No, no, it's just that I don't think parents and their kids should work together -- too many issues.
CHRISTIAN I'll drink to that.
ANA So, where you headed?
CHRISTIAN Sydney. Sydney, Australia. You want to come? I'm serious.
ANA Why would I go to Sydney with you?
CHRISTIAN Maybe fate has just thrown the two of us together, you know. Two drinks in an airport bar --
ANA Why would fate do that?
CHRISTIAN Same reason fate does anything -- so that we can help each other out. You do need help, right? Unless you don't. What I'm doing down there could be a little dangerous and I need someone to protect me -- a bodyguard. It's perfect for someone who stopped being a cop.
ANA I don't even know your name.
CHRISTIAN Oh, let's not use real names. I'll tell you what -- why don't you pick a name for me and then I'll pick one for you.
ANA You look like a Tom.
CHRISTIAN Tom, what an excellent name. And you should be a -- Sarah. Australia.
LIBBY What happened?
ANA I cut myself shaving. The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.
LIBBY You okay?
ANA I'm fine; but he won't be.
LIBBY Hey, Ana?
ANA What?
LIBBY Don't do anything stupid.
GALE If you've come to apologize, I forgive for hitting me with your crutch. I'm so glad my head didn't break it.
LOCKE Why?
GALE Now that's a broad question.
LOCKE Why'd you try to hurt Ana Lucia, but not me?
GALE I'm not sure I know what you're getting at, John.
LOCKE I was trapped under that blast door, helpless. You could've crushed my skull, but you didn't do a thing. Why didn't you?
GALE Because you're one of the good ones, John.
LOCKE What? Good what?
GALE None of this matters. I'm dead anyway. The doctor's gone to make a trade and we both know he'll come back empty-handed and then I've lost my value. So either Jack comes back here and kills me or my people find out where I'm being held and they do it.
LOCKE Why would your own people want to kill you?
GALE Because the man in charge -- he's a great man, John, a brilliant man -- but he's not a forgiving man. He'll kill me because I failed, John. I failed my mission.
LOCKE What mission?
GALE When that woman caught me in her trap I was on my way here, John. I was coming for you.
KATE Locke!
JACK Locke, get out here! Locke! Locke!
KATE John!
SAWYER Hey, I've been knocking those things down for 20 minutes. Get your hands off of my damn mangoes.
ANA I didn't figure you for the fruit picking type.
SAWYER What do you want?
ANA I need a gun.
SAWYER Well, here's an idea -- why not go to your buddy, Jack? He's got himself a gun. Oh, that's right, he's still traipsing around the jungle with Kate.
ANA If you've got a problem because he's making time with your girlfriend, don't take it out on me, man. How about you just give me a gun?
SAWYER Here's another idea -- scram. You heard me, now git.
CHRISTIAN Sarah. Sarah, open the damn door. Good, you're up. It's time -- protection duty. Come on, let's go.
ANA After four days of drinking and doing nothing -- now, in the middle of the night, you're ready to go?
CHRISTIAN That's exactly right. It's time, come on. Fate's calling, Sarah.
CHRISTIAN This is it, pull over right here.
ANA This is what you needed protection for -- the suburbs?
CHRISTIAN Stay in the car.
ANA Should I keep the meter running?
CHRISTIAN I just want to see my daughter. She's my daughter and I have every right to see her!
LINDSEY No, you don't have a right! Now get out!
CHRISTIAN I pay the mortgage on this house... I want to see my daughter!
ANA What the hell is wrong with you?
LINDSEY Don't you ever come back here!
CHRISTIAN I was just having a conversation with the lady.
LINDSEY You need help!
HURLEY Dude, nice hole.
SAYID What is it, Hurley?
HURLEY Hey, man, remember that radio we made? I'm thinking maybe I could get it to play some music. You know, for Libby.
SAYID Well, it worked only once and then just for a minute. I've tried several times since and only gotten static.
HURLEY Here's the thing -- even that would be good -- because then Libby would be like, "it's the thought that counts" -- and I'll score major points. Especially when she sees me holding it over my head.
SAYID And why would you hold a static generating radio over your head?
HURLEY They didn't have "Say Anything" in Baghdad? It's awesome. This dude, like, gets his boom box and he holds it over his head outside this chick's window and he plays some Peter Gabriel song for her and bam, the girl's, like, his. I mean, after her dad goes to jail. But then he gets her.
SAYID I think I get the idea.
HURLEY You should really check it out sometime. I mean, if we ever, you know, get off this island.
SAYID If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometers from here. You could take her there.
HURLEY You think she'd like that?
SAYID I took Shannon there once.
JACK Michael. Michael.
LOCKE So, it worked?
JACK What are you talking about, John?
LOCKE Your deal -- the trade. If they gave us Michael...
JACK They didn't give us anything.
LOCKE So, it was just a coincidence that he came wandering out?
JACK I was shouting; he heard my voice. What, they just let Michael go hoping we would keep up our end of the bargain? You think they're on the honor system?
KATE Hey.
JACK Hey.
SAWYER Come out, come out whoever you are. I know you're there. Don't make me come in after you. Well, well, well, what have we got here? Was little red riding hood going to follow the big bad wolf back to his big old stash-o-guns?
ANA Why don't you give me that one, right there?
SAWYER I ain't going to gimme you nothing. We've been through this, Lucy.
SAWYER What you gonna do now, Muchacha?
CHRISTIAN We need some damn music in here.
ANA Who is she?
CHRISTIAN Who is who?
ANA That woman.
CHRISTIAN She is a very long story, Sarah.
ANA It's Ana Lucia.
CHRISTIAN Well, I'm still Tom.
ANA You're pathetic, that's what you are.
CHRISTIAN You bet your sweet ass I am.
ANA Why are you here?
CHRISTIAN I'm here because I can't apologize to my son. He tried to help me, so I thanked him by cutting him off. I thanked him by hating him. You came here for the same reason I did, kiddo. You ran away. My, my, look what fate has delivered up this time. Come on, let's go have a drink or ten and be pathetic together. What do you say?
ANA No. No.
CHRISTIAN It's your call. 
SAWYER Hey, I'm walking here!
ANA Wait, don't. Let's just get the hell out of Sydney. Let's just go. Let's go back.
CHRISTIAN I can't ever go back. See ya, kiddo.
ANA What?
SAWYER Don't you want my phone number?
ANA You tell anyone about this and I'll kill you. 
SAWYER I guess that takes cuddling off the table.
LIBBY Hey there. How's it going?
HURLEY This isn't what it looks like.
LIBBY And, what does it look like?
HURLEY It looks like something that... it's not. Aw, man. I'm so busted.
LIBBY Hurley, I'm not here to tell you how to act around food.
HURLEY Naw, I'm not busted for that. I'm busted for something else. I was packing a picnic because I was kind of hoping that you'd want to go with me. You know, as an 'us' thing. But, it was a surprise.
LIBBY Really? That's very sweet.
HURLEY So, you want to go?
LIBBY Where to?
HURLEY Can that part still be a surprise?
ANA Hey, you're back.
JACK Hey.
ANA So, the Others -- they didn't show up?
JACK No. Michael's back, though. What happened here?
LOCKE My fault. I left the tap on in the bathroom sink and Ana wiped out and hit her head on the bathroom counter. And I'm sorry, again.
ANA Yeah, don't worry about it.
KATE Jack? Jack. I think he's waking up.
JACK Hey, Michael.
MICHAEL Jack?
JACK Hey, man.
MICHAEL Wait a minute... how did I get...?
JACK Wait, try to take it easy, okay. You're back in the hatch. We found you out in the jungle last night.
MICHAEL Oh, my head.
LOCKE Welcome back.
MICHAEL Hey, John. I found them. After I left I hiked North back to where we were . I hiked to the beach -- followed the shore line. A day later I saw one.
LOCKE What did he look like?
MICHAEL He was dirty, worn clothing, no shoes, simple. Just like the rest of them.
JACK Like the rest of them?
MICHAEL Yeah, his people -- the Others. I followed him back to his camp. They live in tents -- canvas tents and teepees. They eat dried fish. They're worse off than we are.
KATE How many of them were there?
MICHAEL I counted 22.
JACK And, the boat?
MICHAEL I didn't see it.
JACK Did you see Walt?
MICHAEL No. But I know he's there.
ANA What about everyone else they took? Cindy -- did you see any other kids?
MICHAEL No, no, no kids, no. But I think they were in the same place as my boy. They have a hatch.
JACK How do you know that they...
MICHAEL There's a set of metal doors leading underground. What else could it be?
JACK And you think that's where they're keeping the kids?
MICHAEL They keep it guarded 24/7. Two guards, two guns. And two guns is all I saw. They're barely armed. Most of them are old and half of them are women. I wanted -- I couldn't save him. So I came back to tell you -- tell you that we can take them. As soon as I get my strength back, I will take us back there. And we are going to get my boy back.
JACK You were right.
LOCKE Right about what?
JACK About Henry -- what you and Sayid did to him when you first found him. You were right. I don't like how you did it, but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.
LOCKE Well, you did what you thought was right at the time you thought it, Jack. I just hope that next time you decide to do something you include me. And something tells me that's going to be soon.
JACK You heard Michael. We can take them.
LOCKE Our friend with the beard told us not to cross the line.
JACK These people are liars, John. Why should we take their word on anything?
LOCKE I couldn't agree more. So, now what?
KATE Where are you going?
LOCKE To get our guns back from Sawyer.
JACK We're going to need you to help convince him.
KATE Who's going to take care of Michael?
ANA I'll stay. You guys go ahead.
JACK You sure?
ANA Give Sawyer my best.
JACK Alright, we'll be back soon.
HURLEY Watch your head. Almost there.
LIBBY You ever watch the Flintstones?
HURLEY Sure, I used to watch it all the time when I was in the hospital -- when I broke my hip.
LIBBY Well, did you ever notice how Fred would run by the same thing over and over again? Third time past this tree.
HURLEY Uh, that's a different tree.
LIBBY Hurley, it's okay if you're lost.
HURLEY Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me? We're right about to walk on the most excellent secret beach on the Island, and -- surprise!
LIBBY Uh, Hurley, this is our beach. There's Jin. Hey, I'll tell you what -- why not have the picnic here? Come on, give me the blankets.
HURLEY Blankets?
LIBBY You don't have any blankets? How about drinks? Okay, I'll tell you what, I will handle the blankets. You just track down Rose and Bernard. I saw them pull wine from the pallet, okay?
HURLEY Oh, wine. Groovy. Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough I'll remember where I know you from.
LIBBY Yeah, okay. 
JACK Sawyer, put the book down.
SAWYER It's not a book, it's a manuscript. I'm about to be the first and only guy to find out who done it. I think I've got it figured out. Cool your damn jets and walk around the coconut trees; I've got, like, ten pages left.
SAWYER Hey!
JACK You want to figure it out?
SAWYER What is your problem, Doc?!
JACK It's time to give us the guns back.
SAWYER You burn the ending of my book and now you want...
LOCKE Where are they, James?
SAWYER You too, Brutus?
KATE Just take us there, Sawyer, alright? Quit playing around.
SAWYER What, did you bring her along for a sympathy vote? She ain't in my head, Doc. Why don't you two just go play in the jungle, huh?
JACK Take us to the guns, now.
SAWYER Ah, that bitch. She stole my damn gun -- Ana Lucia.
JACK Why would she need a gun?
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
LOCKE Jack, I need to tell you something.
ANA Pick it up. Cut yourself loose.
GALE What?
ANA Just do it.
GALE Why?
ANA You know why.
GALE He kept saying you were misunderstood.
ANA What are you talking about?
GALE Goodwin. Yes, he told us all about you, Ana -- how he thought you were worthy, and that he could change you. But he was wrong. And it cost him his life.
ANA He was going to kill me.
GALE Was he?
ANA Are you done?
GALE Yes, Ana, I'm done.
GALE So, this is it, huh?
ANA Yes, Henry. This is it.
JACK I want you to listen to me, okay, because I'm asking you a favor, Crissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral. And I'm asking you a favor. In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there , and I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Crissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because -- because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just -- I need to bury my father.
ANA That was an airplane. No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney. That's right, Australia. I -- I don't know, I -- I made a mistake, mom. You knew, so I got as far away from you as I could. But now -- I want to come home, mom.
CAPTAIN So come home.
ANA I'm on Oceanic flight 815.
CAPTAIN I'll be there when you land, mija.
MICHAEL Where is everybody?
ANA What you said got them worked up. They went to get all the guns back from Sawyer.
MICHAEL Sawyer? Sawyer has all the guns?
ANA Long story.
MICHAEL At least he didn't get that one.
ANA Yeah. Too bad I can't use it.
MICHAEL Use it on what?
ANA We caught one of them -- the Others. He's locked up in there.
MICHAEL How long has he...?
ANA Over a week.
MICHAEL And you're what -- taking care of him?
ANA He tried to kill me today, so I wanted him dead. I couldn't do it. I couldn't even kill him. I looked at him and he -- I can't do this anymore.
MICHAEL Then let me do it. They're animals. I've seen these people and they are animals. They took my son -- right out of my hands -- they took my son and -- I'll do it. Give me the gun. I'll kill him. Because that's what they do. What's the combination?
ANA 18 right, 1 left, 31 right.
MICHAEL I'm sorry.
ANA For what?
LIBBY Michael?!
