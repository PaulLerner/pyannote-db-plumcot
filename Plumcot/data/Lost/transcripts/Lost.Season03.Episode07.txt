dr_ethan_rom Hello.
rachel_carlson Oh, I fell asleep.
dr_juliet_burke With candles burning -- it's real safe. We don't have to keep doing this, you know.
rachel_carlson Are you saying that because you don't think it's going to work? Or, because you're afraid he'll find out?
dr_juliet_burke Lift up your shirt.
dr_juliet_burke Okay.
rachel_carlson Some doctor you are.
dr_juliet_burke I'm not doing this as your doctor. I'm doing it as your sister. I don't like you being here alone. Come stay with me.
rachel_carlson I like living on the beach.
dr_juliet_burke This is Miami, Rachel -- everything's on the beach.
dr_jack_shephard You have about an hour's head start before they come after you. Take a walkie, take Sawyer. Go.
kate_austen Wait, where are you? Where are you?
dr_jack_shephard Kate, listen to me, just listen to me. Do you remember what I told you on the beach? Do you remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up? Do you remember it?!!
kate_austen Yes, yes, I remember!
dr_jack_shephard When you get safe, you radio me and you tell me that story.
kate_austen Jack, please.
dr_jack_shephard If I don't get a call from you in the next hour I'm going to know something went wrong and he dies!
kate_austen I can't leave without you!
dr_jack_shephard Yes you are. Go.
kate_austen Jack, I can't!
dr_jack_shephard Go! Now!
kate_austen No, I can't!!
dr_jack_shephard Kate, damn it, run!!!
tom_friendly Juliet, stop the bleeding and stitch him up.
dr_jack_shephard She's not a surgeon; she can't fix this.
dr_juliet_burke He's right.
kate_austen Sawyer, let's go! Sawyer!!
tom_friendly Then what the hell do you suggest we do?
dr_juliet_burke Go get Danny, then find Austen and Ford and bring them back.
dr_jack_shephard No, you do that and Ben dies.
dr_juliet_burke Go.
dr_jack_shephard You think I'm lying?! You think this is a bluff?! I will let him die!
dr_juliet_burke No, Jack, you won't. Go, get them back. If you have to, kill them.
dr_juliet_burke Hello.
DIANA#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode07 Dr. Burke?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
DIANA#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode07 This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience. I'm calling to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
dr_juliet_burke Two o'clock, right?
DIANA#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode07 Two o'clock. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you that he's very much looking forward to meeting you.
dr_juliet_burke Me too. Thank you.
DIANA#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode07 Goodbye.
edmund_burke These are the main labs... (unintelligible) ...this little baby here took most of last year's grant. You don't really want to talk about that now do you?
edmund_burke Hello, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke Hey. Hey, Ed.
edmund_burke Why exactly are you here?
dr_juliet_burke Uh, I, um -- today's lab work -- I got home and I realized I inverted some numbers.
edmund_burke And it couldn't wait until the morning?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode07 Uh, Edmund?
edmund_burke Oh, I'm sorry. How rude of me. Juliet, this is Sherry. Sherry, this is Juliet, my ex-wife. Juliet's leaving.
dr_juliet_burke I am.
edmund_burke Jules? Could you please turn off the lights?
dr_juliet_burke You haven't thought this through, Jack. Your plan's not going to work.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? Why's that?
dr_juliet_burke Your friends aren't going to make it back to your side of the island because we're not on that island. We're on a smaller island two miles offshore.
tom_friendly Afraid so.
dr_juliet_burke So why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful resolution?
dr_jack_shephard A peaceful resolution?
dr_juliet_burke That's right.
dr_jack_shephard Is that what you call asking me to kill Ben while on the operating table? Make it look like an accident?
dr_juliet_burke That's ridiculous.
dr_jack_shephard She wants Ben to die. She said if I did it that she would protect me!
dr_juliet_burke Tom! He's lying! I don't know what you're trying to do, Jack, but...
tom_friendly ENOUGH! Juliet, get out.
dr_juliet_burke Tom, he's lying!
tom_friendly You said you can't stitch him up -- then you don't need to be in here. Go Julie.
dr_juliet_burke Don't let him fool you. He'll never let a patient just die.
danny_pickett Hey! Hey, can anybody hear me?!
ivan What happened?
danny_pickett Open the cage.
ivan Where's--?
danny_pickett Just open the damn cage!
kate_austen That's our island?
james_ford What, you didn't believe me when I told you before?
kate_austen We need a boat.
james_ford Yeah, a couple of towels and buffet lunch.
kate_austen We'll just keep following the beach. There's got to be one around here somewhere. How else would they get back and forth?
james_ford Why don't you stop and ask for directions?
kate_austen Jack, are you there?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
kate_austen Are you okay?
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine.
james_ford Tell him I said hi -- get to the point!
kate_austen Jack, we need a boat. We need some way to get off this island.
dr_jack_shephard You heard her. How do they get off this island?!
james_ford What's he doing?!
dr_jack_shephard Kate? Kate?!
dr_jack_shephard Kate?
alex_rousseau This way.
danny_pickett Jason, you alright?
danny_pickett Over there! Over there!
alex_rousseau Come on, get inside. Get inside, go.
danny_pickett Come on. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Shh, shh. What? Where'd they go?
ivan That way.
james_ford Nice to meet you, Sheena.
tom_friendly Is it true?
dr_jack_shephard Is what true?
tom_friendly What you said -- did Juliet really ask you to kill him?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, and in about 40 minutes she's going to get her wish.
ben_linus Hey, that's not helping anything. Now, could somebody please get Juliet?
sherry Juliet, Edmund wants to see you in his office.
dr_juliet_burke Do you work here?
sherry I'm the new research assistant.
dr_juliet_burke Of course you are.
edmund_burke I want in.
dr_juliet_burke In on what?
edmund_burke I know what you're doing, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke I'm not really sure what...
edmund_burke I read your notes. I know what you took from the lab. The only thing I don't know is who's your guinea pig.
dr_juliet_burke Ed, I've been doing my research in my own lab, on my own time. I don't really see how--
edmund_burke It's your sister, isn't it? Look, Jules, there's two ways this plays out. One is your research is potentially genius. And the other -- it raises some very serious ethical questions. Maybe even criminal concerns. But if you collaborate with me, based on my reputation, all this is viewed as cutting edge science. And we will win prizes and drink champagne. And do a lot of good for people. Why don't I give you some time to think about it?
tom_friendly Juliet, Ben's awake.
dr_juliet_burke How?
tom_friendly Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon, not an anesthesiologist. Ben's asking for you.
james_ford This a hobby of yours, Underdog -- digging holes?
alex_rousseau Yep. That and basket weaving. Want one?
james_ford Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?
alex_rousseau No, but I've got a boat.
kate_austen Can we use it?
alex_rousseau Yeah, but we've got to hurry.
james_ford Hold on a second, sister. You just happen to find us in the woods? You just happen to have a boat, and you're going to let us use it, huh?
alex_rousseau There's something we need to do first.
james_ford Oh, gee.
alex_rousseau My boyfriend is being held prisoner. If you help me rescue him, I promise you I'll get you back to the other island.
james_ford Your boyfriend -- his name happen to be Karl?
alex_rousseau Yeah.
james_ford Aw, sheee, come on.
dr_jack_shephard I stopped the surgery.
ben_linus I know. I've been able to hear you for a few minutes now. It's very clever of you. I should have seen it coming.
dr_jack_shephard Are you in pain? I can...
ben_linus No, but thanks all the same.
ben_linus I'd like to speak to Juliet alone, please, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I'm sorry.
ben_linus Please, I'm asking you one gentleman to another. It won't hurt you to give me three minutes, will it? Knowing I have only 27 left?
dr_jack_shephard If you touch him, if you try...
dr_juliet_burke I won't.
dr_jack_shephard You've got three minutes.
tom_friendly I'm Tom, by the way.
tom_friendly They've got history.
dr_juliet_burke I would like you to go back in there, put Ben under, and finish the surgery.
dr_jack_shephard And why would I want to do that?
dr_juliet_burke Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.
richard_alpert Thank you for taking the time to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke. Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon. We're just outside of Portland. Uh, these shots might seem a little cheese-ball, but our people really are this happy. Now why? Because we're privately funded. Privately funded means freedom. We organize trips every week in and around the Portland area which is just awesome for hiking and biking and river running.
dr_juliet_burke Look, when you -- your company -- reached out to me I was flattered. But I don't really know why you would want me.
richard_alpert Is it true that you successfully impregnated a male field mouse?
dr_juliet_burke He didn't carry to term.
richard_alpert Mind if I ask you something?
dr_juliet_burke Sure.
richard_alpert What do you see?
dr_juliet_burke Well, that's a human womb, obviously. Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium I would say that the woman was somewhere in her seventies.
richard_alpert Well, actually, she's 26.
dr_juliet_burke What happened to her?
richard_alpert What if I told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out? We think you're special, Dr. Burke. And we want you to lead a team of highly trained people because we think you're just that good.
dr_juliet_burke I can't.
richard_alpert Why can't you?
dr_juliet_burke My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I...
richard_alpert He wouldn't want you to have this opportunity?
dr_juliet_burke No, he doesn't want me to have anything. He would never give the okay. It's...
richard_alpert Maybe we could reach out to him on your behalf?
dr_juliet_burke Don't bother.
richard_alpert There must be something that he would respond to.
dr_juliet_burke If he were hit by a bus. How about that? That would work. How totally inappropriate.
richard_alpert No, no, no.
dr_juliet_burke No, I, uh -- I'm sorry, but I've wasted your time.
richard_alpert Dr. Burke, please -- no, you don't...
dr_juliet_burke No, I'm sorry. Whatever you think I am, I'm not. I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert. I'm a mess.
dr_juliet_burke Oh, hell.
alex_rousseau Karl's got to be in there.
james_ford What, you mean you ain't sure?
alex_rousseau It's the only place I haven't looked.
kate_austen You know the guard?
alex_rousseau Yeah, his name's Aldo.
james_ford Aldo? Okay, Lollipop, you want to tell me how we're going to get by him with one gun and no bullets?
kate_austen I've got an idea.
james_ford Of course you do.
alex_rousseau Open the door!
aldo Alex? What the hell are you doing?
alex_rousseau They must have gotten out of their cages. I caught them in the jungle. Now open up, Aldo!
aldo Whoa! Whoa! Just stop! Alex, you're not supposed to be here. If your dad finds out, he's going to kill me.
alex_rousseau My dad was the one who told me to bring them here -- to you. Look, maybe you should call him. I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.
aldo Danny, I need Ben.
danny_pickett Why?
aldo Listen, I've got Alex here. She's got Austen and Ford with her.
danny_pickett Damn it, whatever she says, don't believe it. Hold them right there. I'm on my way.
james_ford Don't get mad at me just because you were dumb enough to fall for the old Wookiee prisoner gag.
alex_rousseau Where's Karl?
aldo I have no idea what you're talking about.
kate_austen Shoot him in the knee.
james_ford What?
kate_austen Give me the damn rifle. We don't have time for this. I'll do it.
aldo Whoa! Whoa! Okay, alright! He's at the end of the hall, room 23. Keys are in my back pocket.
james_ford Damn good con, Freckles. I almost believed you were going to shoot that boy.
kate_austen It wasn't a con.
alex_rousseau Here it is!
james_ford Give it to me.
kate_austen Help! Help!
alex_rousseau It's okay; we're here to help.
alex_rousseau Is he okay?
james_ford Look, we got your boyfriend back. Now, where's your damn boat?
danny_pickett Idiot! Where are they?
aldo I don't know. Alex is with them.
dr_juliet_burke Danny! We're letting them go.
danny_pickett Letting them go?
dr_juliet_burke Ben gave the order.
danny_pickett Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
dr_juliet_burke He woke up.
danny_pickett Oh, he woke up, huh?
dr_juliet_burke Shephard won't finish the surgery unless he knows his friends are off the island. Do you want Ben to die?
danny_pickett I know Ben would rather die than let them go.
rachel_carlson Hey. How was the interview?
dr_juliet_burke It's not for me.
rachel_carlson What?
dr_juliet_burke It's fine. We're too far away, anyway. It's Portland.
rachel_carlson Jule, you didn't say no because of me.
dr_juliet_burke Well, why would I want to go all the way to Portland for research that doesn't even work?
rachel_carlson Because it does work. I'm pregnant. I'm pre -- I'm pregnant.
dr_juliet_burke What?
rachel_carlson Look, look. I took a blood test, too. I didn't want to tell you until I was sure.
dr_juliet_burke It worked.
rachel_carlson Yeah.
rachel_carlson My whole life all I ever wanted was to have a baby. And now because of you I can. Oh, God. Now I just need to get healthy. Now I just need to get healthy so I can see the little bugger get into an Ivy League school, you know.
dr_juliet_burke You will. Of course you will. You will.
rachel_carlson Now you can tell that bastard ex-husband of yours what he can do with his ethics.
edmund_burke Because you're insufferable. And you're mean. Well, you asked me for the truth, Mom, and that's the truth.
dr_juliet_burke Ed!
edmund_burke Let me call you later, okay? Okay, bye. Hello, Jules. What's up?
dr_juliet_burke She's pregnant.
edmund_burke Excuse me?
dr_juliet_burke It worked. Rachel's pregnant.
edmund_burke Ju -- Julia, that's -- wow. I need, uh -- I need to see your labs. We'll have to verify the data if we're going to...
dr_juliet_burke No! I'm not interested in publishing, Ed. It's my sister.
edmund_burke Fine, then, if you're not interested why are you concerned--?
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
tom_friendly Yeah, I just don't like blood too much.
dr_jack_shephard Well, then you probably won't want to be looking at that. So, if you really can get off the island why didn't you just take him to a facility? Why all this?
tom_friendly Because ever since the sky turned purple, we've been...
tom_friendly What the hell happened?!
dr_jack_shephard I just nicked an artery.
tom_friendly Isn't that what you already did?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, that was on purpose.
tom_friendly Can you fix it?!
dr_jack_shephard Damn it!
james_ford You got him?
kate_austen I got him.
james_ford Nice ride.
kate_austen Karl, we've got to go now, okay? Can you stand?
alex_rousseau Help me.
kate_austen Okay, can you stand?
james_ford So, you're the boss's daughter, huh? I never saw that coming. Let's go, Cheech; we're going for a little ride.
alex_rousseau Careful.
james_ford Alright, alright, easy. I'm going to put you in the boat, alright?
alex_rousseau Wait, wait. You'll be okay.
karl_martin Danny.
james_ford No, Sawyer.
karl_martin Danny!
kate_austen No!
dr_juliet_burke Danny!
tom_friendly What happened? Is he...?
dr_jack_shephard I can't see.
tom_friendly What?
dr_jack_shephard I can't see. There's too much blood. Alright, get over here. Tom, he's going to die if you don't get over here right now.
dr_juliet_burke Go. Get out of here.
james_ford You heard the lady.
alex_rousseau Let's go.
dr_juliet_burke Not you, Alex. You're staying.
alex_rousseau Why?
dr_juliet_burke We both know your father. The only way he'll let Karl live is if you're here when he wakes up. I'm sorry, Alex.
karl_martin Hey, Alex.
alex_rousseau Hey.
karl_martin I missed you.
alex_rousseau I know. I missed you, too. You have to go away now; but I'll see you real soon.
karl_martin I love you. I have to go sleep now.
dr_juliet_burke Wait.
dr_jack_shephard Easy. Okay, easy.
tom_friendly Wait. Wait!
dr_jack_shephard Hold it steady, damn it. Hold it steady.
kate_austen Jack, are you there?
dr_jack_shephard Alright, hold that up to me. The walkie, hold it up to me.
tom_friendly What about the surgery?
dr_jack_shephard Just do it!! Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?
kate_austen Yeah, I -- we've got a boat. They're letting us go.
dr_jack_shephard Who's letting you go?
kate_austen The blond woman.
dr_jack_shephard So you're safe -- you and Sawyer?
kate_austen Yes, yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Tell me.
kate_austen Tell you?
dr_jack_shephard The first day on the beach -- the day of the crash -- the story that I told you. If you're safe, tell me.
tom_friendly You think this is the best time, doctor?
dr_jack_shephard Shut up!!!
kate_austen You were doing surgery on a girl and you messed up. You made a mistake. You tore something on her back and all the nerves came loose. And you said you were so afraid. And you said the fear was so real. And you didn't know what to do, so you counted to five. And then you weren't afraid anymore. And then it was just gone. And you fixed her. You saved her.
dr_jack_shephard I need you to make me a promise, Kate.
kate_austen Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Promise me that you'll never come back here for me. Don't come back, Kate.
kate_austen Jack, where are you?
dr_jack_shephard Turn it off.
kate_austen Jack! Jack, please, where are you?
james_ford The trades are coming. We've got to go. Let's go.
morgue_employee EMPLOYEE We have some paperwork we need you to sign; but take your time. There's no rush.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Were you able to remove the tumor?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. You'll want to do a biopsy -- see if it's malignant. So what now? I just go back to my cell?
dr_juliet_burke Until they figure out what to do with you.
dr_jack_shephard "They." What did he say?
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry?
dr_jack_shephard Ben. What did he say that made you want to save his life?
dr_juliet_burke It doesn't really matter what he said.
dr_jack_shephard It matters to me. After everything that I have been put through, you owe me an answer. I want to know what he said.
dr_ethan_rom Tissue?
dr_juliet_burke Thank you. Thanks. Have we met?
richard_alpert Hello, Dr. Burke.
dr_juliet_burke Mr. Alpert?
richard_alpert I'm so sorry for your loss.
dr_juliet_burke What are you doing here?
richard_alpert I saw what happened on the news and your office said you were down here. I just wanted to express my condolences in person before I went back up to Portland. This is Ethan. He's one of my colleagues.
dr_ethan_rom It's a pleasure to meet you.
dr_juliet_burke He was hit by a bus.
richard_alpert I know. They say you were there when it happened. You must have been...
dr_juliet_burke No! No. In our interview I said -- I said that I wanted him to get hit by a bus.
richard_alpert Dr. Burke, I realize that you're a little shook up right now, but this is just a tragic accident. You can't blame yourself. I don't even remember you saying that.
dr_juliet_burke Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?
richard_alpert Look, I know the timing is horrible. But we came because we're that serious about getting you to come work with us. Just give us six months. If you need to, you can be back before your sister gives birth.
dr_juliet_burke How did you know that my...?
richard_alpert Well, we're very thorough in our recruitment process.
dr_juliet_burke Can my sister come?
richard_alpert Won't work. We're pretty remote. She wouldn't have access to the treatment that she needs.
dr_juliet_burke But, it's Portland. There's plenty of clinics and...
richard_alpert Well, actually we're not quite in Portland.
dr_jack_shephard I want to know what he said.
dr_juliet_burke I've been on this island for 3 years, Jack. 3 years, 2 months, and 28 days. He said that if I let him live and I helped you -- that he would finally let me go home.
