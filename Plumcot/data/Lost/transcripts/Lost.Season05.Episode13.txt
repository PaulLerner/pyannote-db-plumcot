trevor Comes fully equipped.
trevor I'm telling you, it's a steal at $400.
trevor What, you gotta check with your husband?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 It's just me.
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Mommy?
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Can I have a quarter for the vending machine?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.
trevor I thought you said it was "just me."
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 I meant my husband's out of the picture. It's just me and my son.
trevor I don't know. Most of the other tenants--they don't like noise.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 He's very quiet.
trevor I'm gonna need two months up front.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Here, honey.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Hey, no running! You hear me, Miles?
miles_straume Mom! Mommy! Help!
miles_straume Mommy!
lara Miles?
lara Miles, what happened?
miles_straume Mommy!
trevor Oh, God. Mr. Vonner.
lara What were you doing in here?
miles_straume He... he was all alone. He was scared. His chest hurt. He kept calling out for Kimberly.
trevor Kimberly? That's his wife. No, she died last year. Now, how would you know that?
miles_straume I heard him.
lara Miles, what are you talking about?
miles_straume He's still talking right now.
lara Honey... he's dead.
miles_straume I told you! I can hear him! I can hear him!
james_ford Miles, you there? Pick up.
miles_straume Jim, where the hell are you?
james_ford I'll fill you in later. Right now I need you to take care of something.
miles_straume Like what?
james_ford The security tapes from the pylon camera feeds. They need to accidentally get erased.
miles_straume Erased? Why?
james_ford I ain't got time for questions, Miles. Just do it.
miles_straume Okay. Okay. Uh, which ones?
james_ford Look on your monitors.
james_ford You see us?
miles_straume Yeah. You're on number 4. Is that Kate? What the hell are you doing out there?
james_ford Just erase number 4. And if anyone asks, I'm off the grid. I'm looking for the escaped Hostile.
miles_straume You mean your pal Sayid?
james_ford Damn it, Miles! You gonna help me or not?!
miles_straume Yeah, yeah. I got it.
james_ford All right. I owe you one.
james_ford All right, I want you to go back and and find Juliet, see if anyone's noticed yet if Little Ben's gone missin'.
kate_austen What are you gonna do when they find out?
james_ford Do my best to cover it up. In case you haven't noticed, I'm Head of Security.
james_ford All right, I'll see you back there.
horace_goodspeed Where's LaFleur?
miles_straume Uh, he's, uh, out looking for the escaped prisoner. I tried to get him on his walkie, but...
miles_straume Uh, he must be out of range.
horace_goodspeed Damn it. All right. Then it's gonna have to be you. Jim already knows about this, but I'm gonna bring you into the circle of trust. Can I trust you, Miles?
miles_straume Absolutely, Horace.
horace_goodspeed Okay. Good. I need you to take this out to Radzinsky at grid 3-34.
horace_goodspeed He's gonna give you something in return. I want you to bring it back to me with no questions asked. You understand?
miles_straume Um... we're not supposed to be in 3-3-4. Isn't that Hostile territory?
horace_goodspeed Welcome to the circle of trust.
stuart_radzinsky Stop right there!
stuart_radzinsky Miles?! What are you doing out here?! I was expecting LaFleur.
miles_straume LaFleur's busy. Horace sent me instead. I'm in the circle of trust.
stuart_radzinsky Get out!
miles_straume I'm supposed to give you this. And he said you had something for me.
miles_straume What happened to him?
stuart_radzinsky He had an accident.
miles_straume What kind of accident?
stuart_radzinsky He fell into a ditch.
miles_straume Is that a bullet hole in his head? The ditch had a gun?
stuart_radzinsky It doesn't matter what happened to him... because knowing that is not your job--your job is to do what I tell you to.
stuart_radzinsky Take him back to Horace now, Miles.
miles_straume Okay... so what really happened?
miles_straume I need to see her.
miles_straume Ma? It's me.
lara Miles.
miles_straume I'm--I'm sorry that... I couldn't make it by sooner.
lara It's okay. You're here now. Why did you come, Miles?
miles_straume I need you to tell me why I'm this way... how... how I do the things I do. And I need to know why you won't talk to me about my father.
lara Because he never cared about us... never cared about you.
miles_straume I need to know where he is, Ma.
lara It doesn't matter where.
miles_straume It does matter.
lara Miles, please.
miles_straume I have a right to know!
lara He's dead.
lara Your father... kicked us out when you were just a baby. He didn't want anything to do with us. So the less you knew about him, the better.
miles_straume Why didn't you just tell me?
lara Because it was over. Your dad has been dead a long time.
miles_straume Where's his body?
lara Somewhere you can never go.
horace_goodspeed Pierre, if it was caused by the electromagnetism, we need to know. You wanna see it now? Y--yeah, he just got back. I'll send him out with it right away. Okay!
horace_goodspeed Did you bring the package?
miles_straume "Package"? You mean the corpse?
horace_goodspeed Yeah. Now I need you to bring it out to Dr. Chang at the Orchid.
miles_straume Listen, man. I'm security. If you just need somebody to drive the van, can't someone from the motor pool do it?
horace_goodspeed If I wanted someone from the motor pool, I would have asked them. And since LaFleur decided to disappear, you're all I've got. So just bring it out to Dr. Chang, and we'll all call it a day. Okay?
miles_straume Hey! What the hell are you doing?! That's my van!
hugo_reyes Nah, dude, I just signed it out.
miles_straume Doesn't matter. It's mine.
hugo_reyes Well, where you going?
miles_straume The Orchid.
hugo_reyes Me too. I made lunch for the crew. Sandwiches. Want one? Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo.
miles_straume You're waiting for the next van.
hugo_reyes Why? We're going to the same place. Why don't we carpool? It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet, so maybe we can prevent it. ...Wait a sec. Are you on some kind of secret mission?
miles_straume Just get in.
kate_austen Hi.
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
dr_juliet_burke How'd it go?
kate_austen We gave him to them--to the Others.
dr_juliet_burke Anyone see you?
kate_austen I don't think so.
dr_juliet_burke Did James help?
kate_austen Yes. Thank you so much for sending him.
dr_juliet_burke Of course.
roger_linus Hey. I got here as soon as I could. All the vans were out, so I had to ru--
roger_linus Where's Ben? Did he...
dr_juliet_burke No! No, Roger.
roger_linus Then where is he?
dr_juliet_burke Roger, I--I'm so sorry. I--I was gone for ten minutes. I--I--I don't know.
roger_linus What? You--you said he was dying. How could he be gone?
dr_juliet_burke I don't know! I'm--Roger--
roger_linus What is she telling me, that he just got up and walked out?
kate_austen I don't know. I just got here--
roger_linus You're his doctors! You're supposed to watch him!
dr_juliet_burke I know. I know. Roger, if we just calm down--
roger_linus Don't tell me to calm down! Somebody came and took my boy out of here?!
dr_juliet_burke I know. I am so sorry.
roger_linus I'm going to Security.
dr_juliet_burke Well... here we go.
STEREO#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Got on board a westbound 747...
hugo_reyes How do you spell "bounty hunter"?
miles_straume What are you doing, writing your memoirs?
hugo_reyes It's personal.
hugo_reyes Dude... did you just... you know?
miles_straume What?
hugo_reyes You know. It stinks. Did you...
miles_straume No.
hugo_reyes Well, it wasn't me.
miles_straume So roll down your window.
hugo_reyes Nah, man, there's something foul in here. It's coming from back there.
miles_straume Maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.
hugo_reyes Unh-unh. That's not possible.
hugo_reyes Okay, maybe it is possible. Pull over. I gotta check.
miles_straume Forget it. You're imagining things.
hugo_reyes I gotta check. If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick.
hugo_reyes Will you pull over?!
hugo_reyes Dude, there's a body bag back here. With a body in it.
miles_straume That's traditionally what you put in a body bag.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well, who is he? What happened?
miles_straume Don't worry about it and don't tell anybody you saw him.
hugo_reyes Dude, what happened to him?
miles_straume His name's Alvarez. He was digging a hole and thinking about some chick named Andr√©a. Then he felt this sharp pain in his mouth, which turned out to be a filling from his tooth being yanked right out of its socket and... blowing through his brain. Then he was dead.
hugo_reyes How does a filling get blown through someone's head?
miles_straume Got me. Can we go now?
hugo_reyes How do you know all this?
miles_straume Because... I know.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?
miles_straume I just know.
hugo_reyes You can talk to dead people.
miles_straume Can we please just go?
hugo_reyes Don't worry, dude. Your secret's safe with me. You wanna know why?
miles_straume No.
hugo_reyes 'Cause I can talk to 'em, too.
miles_straume If you don't mind, Mr. Gray, can you tell me what happened to him?
howard_gray Last Labor Day weekend, drunk driver ran the light. That was that.
miles_straume Where is your son buried?
howard_gray We cremated him, scattered the ashes on the football field at school.
miles_straume For what I do, it's much better if there's a body.
howard_gray Oh, but your ad said you could communicate with the dead anytime, anywhere.
miles_straume I--I know what my ad says, Mr. Gray, but it--
howard_gray Please. I just want you to ask him... did he know that I loved him?
miles_straume It's gonna cost extra.
howard_gray Of course.
howard_gray Thank you.
miles_straume Uh... okay, now... please give me your hands.
miles_straume I want you to concentrate on Russell. Just get a picture of him in your head. Can you do that?
howard_gray Yeah. Okay.
howard_gray Did it work?
miles_straume Your son says he knew that you loved him. He always knew.
howard_gray Thank you.
miles_straume I'm sorry for your loss.
naomi_dorrit Excuse me. Miles Straume?
miles_straume Yeah.
naomi_dorrit Hi. My name's Naomi Dorrit.
naomi_dorrit My employer's been following your work for some time now, and he's interested in retaining your rather unique services.
naomi_dorrit There's a restaurant not too far from here. Would you like to hear what I have to say?
miles_straume Yeah. Absolutely.
kate_austen Hi, Roger.
kate_austen You okay?
roger_linus Let me see... Well, my son got shot and now he's disappeared, so... I think I'm pretty far from okay.
kate_austen You know, I'm sure... things are gonna work out.
roger_linus Well, thanks for the pep talk.
kate_austen I just have a feeling he's gonna be okay.
roger_linus What do you mean, a feeling?
kate_austen I just don't think that you should give up hope.
roger_linus Do you know something? Do you know what happened to my son?
kate_austen No, I don't.
roger_linus Wait a minute. Why are you so interested in my kid?
kate_austen You know, I'm sorry I came over here, all right? I was just trying to help.
roger_linus Oh, you're trying to help, huh? You wanna help, Kate?! Well, why don't you just mind your own business?
STEREO#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Love / Love will keep us together...
hugo_reyes I don't know why you just won't admit it. You can trust me. I talk to lots of dead people.
miles_straume So, you have conversations with them, like they're your pals?
hugo_reyes Sure, all the time. Sometimes we even play chess.
miles_straume You actually see them?
hugo_reyes Of course. Why wouldn't I?
miles_straume Because that's not how it works.
hugo_reyes Aha! You wouldn't know how it works unless you can do it.
miles_straume What I can do has nothing to do with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit. It's a... feeling... a sense. When somebody's dead, their brain stops functioning, which means there's no more talking. There's just who they were and whatever they knew before they died.
hugo_reyes That's how it works for me.
miles_straume Great. I'm happy for you.
hugo_reyes You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.
miles_straume We're here. Now shut the hell up and deliver your damn sandwiches.
dr_pierre_chang What's he doing here?
miles_straume Um, he came to deliver lunch to the work crew.
dr_pierre_chang Lunch? Your instructions were to come alone.
hugo_reyes Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about the body.
dr_pierre_chang He knows?
miles_straume I'm sorry, sir. He--he was rooting around in the back, and he saw it.
hugo_reyes Dude. I can keep a secret.
dr_pierre_chang Well, you'd better... "Hurley", 'cause if you think working in the kitchen is bad--
hugo_reyes I like the kitchen.
dr_pierre_chang Well, how do you feel about polar bear feces? Because if you breathe one word of this, I'll have you shipped to Hydra Island so you can weigh turds for their ridiculous experiments.
hugo_reyes Gross.
dr_pierre_chang You two! Get the package inside.
dr_pierre_chang And you? Stay here till I get back. You think you can handle that?
miles_straume Yes, sir.
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN What the hell's he got, Jimmy Hoffa in here?
SECOND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN I don't know.
FIRST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN Lift him.
hugo_reyes Dude, that guy's a total douche.
dr_pierre_chang Don't... You are not qualified to be touching that!...
miles_straume That douche is my dad.
dr_pierre_chang What the hell do you think you're doing? What are you doing?!
miles_straume You did say you were taking me out to dinner.
naomi_dorrit No, I said I was taking you to a restaurant.
miles_straume You wanna tell me what's back here, sweetheart?
naomi_dorrit Your audition.
miles_straume Look, whatever you got going on here, this isn't really my thing.
naomi_dorrit From what I understand, Miles, if the price is right, this is exactly your thing.
naomi_dorrit So what can you tell me about this man?
miles_straume His name's Felix. He was... on his way to deliver something to, uh...
miles_straume A guy named... Wid-more.
naomi_dorrit Deliver what?
miles_straume A bunch of papers, photos, pictures... of... empty graves. A purchase order... for an old airplane.
miles_straume So... did I pass?
naomi_dorrit I'm leading an expedition to an island, and on the island is a man that will be very difficult to find. That's why I need you.
miles_straume Need me for what?
naomi_dorrit This island has a number of deceased individuals... residing on it, and as this man is the one responsible for their being deceased, we believe they can supply invaluable information as to his whereabouts.
miles_straume As much as hunting down a mass murderer sounds really safe, uh, I'm--I'm gonna pass. Thanks for the audition.
naomi_dorrit My employer is willing to pay you $1.6 million.
miles_straume When do we leave?
hugo_reyes So anyway...
miles_straume I don't want to talk about it.
hugo_reyes Are you kidding me? How weird is it that your dad is that dude from all those movies? Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle. Was that, like, a stage name?
miles_straume What part of "I don't want to talk about it" isn't sinking in?
hugo_reyes Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me? How long have you known he was your dad?
miles_straume Third day we were here, I was on line at the cafeteria, and my mother got in line behind me. That was my first clue.
hugo_reyes But all those DHARMA dudes end up dead. Don't you wanna... save him?
miles_straume I can't save him! They're gonna get killed no matter what I do, so why bother?
dr_pierre_chang I need you to take me to Radzinsky at the work site. Immediately. You... Hurley--you say a word...
hugo_reyes Polar bear poop. Got it.
miles_straume What happened to the body?
dr_pierre_chang What body?
roger_linus This room is on my rounds. What are you doing here?
dr_jack_shephard I figured I'd cover for ya. I heard what happened to your son.
roger_linus Which part--that he got shot or that someone kidnapped him from the Infirmary?
dr_jack_shephard Then what are you doing here at work?
roger_linus What else am I gonna do? Sit around and pray that those idiots are gonna find my boy? So you can get outta here.
roger_linus You came in here a couple days ago with that woman Kate, right?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
roger_linus You know her at all?
dr_jack_shephard Why?
roger_linus 'Cause she's got some... kinda weird thing for my kid. First, she shows up at the infirmary and gave him blood. But then when he goes missing, she comes to me and she says, "Don't worry. He's gonna be okay." I'm gonna tell you somethin', man. I'm beginning to think that she's got something to do with this. I should go to Horace, report her. What do you think?
dr_jack_shephard I think, Roger, that, uh, that you've had a hell of a day, and that... it's given you a very good excuse to go out and get drunk. Maybe that's put some--some crazy ideas into your head. I know that woman--Kate. She's my friend, and she would never do anything to hurt your son.
roger_linus Sure.
hugo_reyes So I'm new here, Dr. Chang. What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?
dr_pierre_chang It's classified.
hugo_reyes Oh, really? You can't tell anyone? Not even your wife?
dr_pierre_chang No.
hugo_reyes What about your kids?
dr_pierre_chang I have a 3-month-old son, so, no, I haven't told him.
hugo_reyes 3 months? Wow! Congrats. What's his name?
dr_pierre_chang Miles.
hugo_reyes Small world! That's your name, too. Right, Miles?
miles_straume Yeah.
hugo_reyes So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang? Like Miles Davis?
dr_pierre_chang My wife is. I like country.
hugo_reyes So you two have been here for... three years now. Must be pretty tight, huh?
miles_straume Dr. Chang and I... don't exactly travel in the same circles.
dr_pierre_chang I wasn't aware there were circles.
hugo_reyes Great. We should all... get together for a beer sometime. How awesome would that be?
dr_pierre_chang Stop here.
dr_pierre_chang You don't need to wait. I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.
hugo_reyes Dude, what is this place? And what's up with all the secrecy?
miles_straume Don't know. Don't care.
worker Hey, Glenn! What's the serial number that goes on the hatch lid?
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 4, 8...
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 15...
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 16...
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 23...
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 Hold on a minute. It's smudged.
hugo_reyes 42.
GLENN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 42.
miles_straume How the hell did you know that?
hugo_reyes 'Cause they're building our hatch.
miles_straume What hatch?
hugo_reyes The one that crashed our plane.
miles_straume Thanks.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 IN VAN Hey, Miles.
miles_straume Do I know you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode13 IN VAN Miles! My name's Bram.
miles_straume You owe me a fish taco.
bram Sorry about that, but your apartment's being watched. And we had to try our best to talk you out of working for Charles Widmore.
miles_straume I have no idea who that is.
bram He's the man who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week. And, my friend, you do not want to get on that boat. Do you know what lies in the shadow of the statue?
miles_straume No, can't say that I do.
bram Then you're not ready to go to that island. But if you come with us--all those things you've spent your life trying to find out? You'll know. You'll know who you are, Miles--why it is you have a gift, and most of all, you'll know about your father.
miles_straume I don't know where you've been getting your intel, but I stopped caring about my father a long time ago. What I do care about is money. So, I'll tell you what. You want me to pass on going to the Island? It's gonna cost you double what they offered--$3.2 million.
bram We're not paying you anything. All the money in the world isn't gonna fill that empty hole inside you, Miles.
miles_straume That's sad, isn't it?
bram Toss him!
bram You're playing for the wrong team!
miles_straume Yeah? What team are you on?
bram The one that's gonna win.
hugo_reyes That hatch they're building? There's gonna be an accident, then they're gonna have to build a computer with a button you have to push so the world doesn't end.
hugo_reyes So your dad... is he around... you know, when we came from? The future?
miles_straume No.
hugo_reyes Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?
miles_straume How is it awesome?!
hugo_reyes Because you get to hang out with him, you know, get to know him better and stuff.
miles_straume Ch.
hugo_reyes And don't bother thanking me, but he was totally down for that beer, dude. You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you, or you can change your own diaper or--
hugo_reyes Whoa!
miles_straume Listen up, 'cause we're only gonna have this conversation once. Okay? I don't want to "hang out" with my dad. I don't want to "know him better"... "and stuff".
hugo_reyes Why not? Did he beat you up when you were little or something?
miles_straume He wasn't even around when I was little, you dimwit! I never knew him, until now. Why am I even telling you this?
hugo_reyes 'Cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.
miles_straume I'm not in pain! It doesn't matter. My father is dead! He's gone! He never cared about me, and nothing I can do will ever change that.
hugo_reyes But he's not gone. We just dropped him off.
miles_straume You want to get into my business?
miles_straume Let's get into yours!
hugo_reyes Give that back to me.
miles_straume How about we read your little diary?
hugo_reyes It's not a diary! It's personal!!
miles_straume Let's see what's going on--
hugo_reyes Give that--give that back to me.
miles_straume --in that piece of granite you call a head.
hugo_reyes Give it back!
miles_straume "Exterior--Hoth. A little spy robot thingy zips through the atmosphere and crashes into the snowy planet below. That's when Chewbacca shows up and blasts it away with his crossbow laser. He shakes his fury fist in the sky in triumph. Chewbacca--Raaar."
hugo_reyes It's "furry." "Furry fist." I need a spell-check.
miles_straume What the hell is this?
hugo_reyes I'm writing Empire Strikes Back.
miles_straume Uh... I'm sorry. What?
hugo_reyes It's 1977, right?
hugo_reyes So Stars Wars just came out. And pretty soon, George Lucas is gonna be looking for a sequel. I've seen Empire, like, 200 times, so I figured I'd make life easier and send him the script... with a couple improvements.
miles_straume That has gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
hugo_reyes Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad.
dr_juliet_burke James. You're back.
james_ford Barely. You ever had one of those days you feel like the little Dutch boy with your finger in the...
james_ford Doc. Hey. What's going on?
dr_jack_shephard Ben's father thinks that Kate had something to do with his son going missing.
james_ford Why the hell would he think that?
dr_juliet_burke Because she talked to him, tried to make him feel better.
dr_jack_shephard Her heart was in the right place.
james_ford Yeah, well, where was her head?
dr_jack_shephard I had a talk with Roger. I don't think he's gonna say anything to anyone for now. Just wanted you to know.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Mm.
james_ford Yeah? Well... thanks for filling me in, Doc.
dr_jack_shephard No problem.
phil Hey, boss.
james_ford Hey.
phil We got a development. You better come to the office.
james_ford Phil, I've been running around the jungle all day, so whatever developments you got can wait a while.
phil I know who took the kid.
james_ford Yeah? Who's that?
phil You.
james_ford Got a perfectly good explanation for what you saw on that tape.
phil I sure as hell hope so.
james_ford You talk to Horace yet?
phil No. I thought that after three years of working together, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt--
james_ford Get some rope.
miles_straume Mr. Gray? I hope you don't mind. Your gate was open.
howard_gray Mr. Straume. Of course. Of course. No problem. What, uh, what brings you by?
miles_straume Well, sir, uh... I'm about to go on a boat trip for a while, and... I wanted to give this back to you.
miles_straume I lied to you, Mr. Gray. I wasn't able to talk to your son.
howard_gray Why are you telling me this? You could have just let me go on believing what you said.
miles_straume That wouldn't have been fair to your son.
howard_gray I'm sorry?
miles_straume If you needed your son to know that you loved him, you should've told him when he was still alive.
hugo_reyes Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to your dad, dude.
miles_straume Don't worry about it.
hugo_reyes I used to hate my dad, too.
miles_straume Yeah?
hugo_reyes He left when I was 10. But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance. We got to be the best of friends, and although I may never see him again, I miss him. And I know he feels the same.
miles_straume My dad didn't leave when I was 10. I--I was a baby. I never knew him. And I don't want to. It's not happening.
hugo_reyes That was Luke's attitude, too.
miles_straume What?
hugo_reyes In Empire, Luke found out Vader was his father, but instead of putting away his lightsaber and talking about it, he overreacted and got his hand cut off. I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost? Another Death Star was destroyed, Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc, and we got the Ewoks. It all could've been avoided if they'd just, you know, communicated. And let's face it. The Ewoks sucked, dude.
dr_pierre_chang Wow! Oh, wow!
lara Hello? Oh, one moment. It's for you.
dr_pierre_chang Hello? All right. I'll be right there.
dr_pierre_chang Miles! I need you.
