sayid_jarrah I brought you a present for helping me with the translations. I didn't have a chance to get it gift-wrapped, so -- . I found these in the wreckage and I have no use for them personally.
shannon_rutherford They are actually my size. Well, half a size off, but, I swear this place is actually making my feel swell.
sayid_jarrah Another mysterious force of the Island revealed.
hugo_reyes Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude.
boone_carlyle Yeah.
hugo_reyes You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday, right?
boone_carlyle What about it?
hugo_reyes That's cool, except, how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week, dude.
boone_carlyle It's not like they're domesticated animals.
hugo_reyes Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough?
boone_carlyle We're hunting, alright?
hugo_reyes I hope so, because people need food, man -- solid food. This isn't a game, man.
boone_carlyle I can't believe you ran down that last ball. And then you hit it for a winner.
nicole Lucky shot.
boone_carlyle Yeah, I wish it was luck. Is that my phone? Yeah, hello.
shannon_rutherford Boone, it's me.
boone_carlyle Shannon?
shannon_rutherford Yeah...
boone_carlyle What's the matter?
shannon_rutherford Um, things aren't so good.
boone_carlyle Where are you?
shannon_rutherford Get out of here! Get the hell away from me!
boone_carlyle Shannon? Shannon?
shannon_rutherford Just stay out of here! Get the hell away from me!
boone_carlyle Shannon, what's going on? Alright, Shannon, just hang on, just tell me where you are. I'll come get you.
shannon_rutherford Sydney.
boone_carlyle Sydney?
shannon_rutherford Australia.
boone_carlyle Stay away from my sister.
sayid_jarrah For a moment you seemed to be giving me an order.
boone_carlyle It's just a friendly suggestion.
sayid_jarrah A suggestion?
boone_carlyle Yes, and if I were you I'd listen.
sayid_jarrah What if I don't?
john_locke Boone! Found some fresh tracks down by the stream.
boone_carlyle See you later.
sayid_jarrah You know where to find me.
john_locke You need to put aside your differences with Sayid.
boone_carlyle He's hitting on Shannon.
john_locke He's very competent. We don't want to make an enemy of him. We're going to want him on our side.
boone_carlyle John, people are talking about what we're doing out here every day, especially since we never come back with anything.
john_locke You mean boar.
boone_carlyle Yeah.
john_locke Plenty of fruit and fish to go around. What we're doing here is far more important. Right now, this is our priority.
hugo_reyes So, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard So, Hurley?
hugo_reyes Something kind of important I'd want to ask you about. Um, anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential, right?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
hugo_reyes The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great.
dr_jack_shephard What's the matter?
hugo_reyes Well, it's kind of like, uh, my stomach. I've been having some, um, major digestive issues.
dr_jack_shephard What have you been eating?
hugo_reyes You know, the usual - bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut. Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they might be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied.
dr_jack_shephard Well, it might help if you had a little bit more protein in your diet.
hugo_reyes Dude, what can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein.
dr_jack_shephard You can eat fish. Jin's been catching a lot of them.
hugo_reyes No way, man. That guy has it in for me.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, come on, man.
hugo_reyes I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like right after we, you know, got here, um, the thing with the spikes?
dr_jack_shephard Sea urchin.
hugo_reyes Yeah. And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge.
dr_jack_shephard You're not eating those, are you?
hugo_reyes Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me.
kate_austen I can see you there, you know.
dr_jack_shephard I wasn't hiding, just didn't want to disrupt you from doing whatever it is you're doing.
kate_austen It's not like it's a secret.
dr_jack_shephard Hard to tell with you sometimes.
dr_jack_shephard Huh, gross little, grayish-yellow things.
kate_austen Passion fruit seeds.
dr_jack_shephard What are they for?
kate_austen I'll show you. If you want to see?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen Follow me.
dr_jack_shephard Please tell me you found a coffee bar.
kate_austen Not quite.
dr_jack_shephard When did you do all this?
kate_austen I didn't. It was all Sun. I just wandered into this place the other day when I was out picking fruit.
dr_jack_shephard This is is beautiful. It's great.
kate_austen She planted some herbs and some low growing stuff here. And then she started a grove over there.
dr_jack_shephard Smart. With the boar running out we're going to need as much food as we can possibly get.
kate_austen Maybe it's not running out.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean?
kate_austen Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore.
dr_jack_shephard Why would he do that?
kate_austen A lot of mouths to feed. If the boar's thinning out then why should he feed everyone else at his own expense?
boone_carlyle That glass isn't breaking and the door's sealed shut. I think it's cement. What is that?
john_locke Hmmm?
boone_carlyle The stuff in the bowl - what is that?
john_locke It's for later.
boone_carlyle So, not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing. I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.
john_locke Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.
boone_carlyle We're not going to stare at this for 4 months, are we? How are we going to open it?
john_locke Well, that's what we have to figure out. That's why we're sitting here. I mean, how do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch, no discernible way of opening it?
bryan Yeah?
boone_carlyle I'm looking for Shannon.
bryan Who are you?
boone_carlyle I'm her brother.
shannon_rutherford Boone?
boone_carlyle What's going on?
shannon_rutherford What are you doing here?
boone_carlyle 15 hours. I just spent 15 hours on a plane -- happy to see you, glad you're here -- something like that might work.
shannon_rutherford Listen, this really isn't the best time. Bryan and I were just on our way out to meet some friends. Why don't you give me a call tomorrow? Please?
boone_carlyle Okay. Enjoy your friends.
hugo_reyes Jin! Yo, Jin! Alto. Listen, I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing. But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business with my own tools.
jinsoo_kwon 난 아마추어랑 안 놀아요. 그러니까 저리 가세요. (I have no time for amateurs. Just stay out of my way.)
hugo_reyes You just said something mean, didn't you?
boone_carlyle You know, we're going to have to tell them.
john_locke Tell them what?
boone_carlyle What we found. You know, they're not going to keep believing that we're coming out here hunting. We never go back...
john_locke They're not ready. They won't understand it.
boone_carlyle I don't think I understand it.
john_locke That's the problem.
boone_carlyle Look, at least I've got to tell Shannon.
john_locke Why?
boone_carlyle What do mean, why? Because she's my sister.
john_locke Why do you care about her so much?
boone_carlyle You don't know her, man. She's smart, she's special in a lot of ways.
john_locke Fair enough.
boone_carlyle She's been asking me about this. I can't keep lying to her.
john_locke You mean you can't keep lying to her, or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her?
boone_carlyle Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret.
john_locke You're sure?
boone_carlyle Yes, I'm sure.
john_locke No, I mean, are you sure you want to do this?
boone_carlyle I've got to get her off my back. She keeps asking me about this, she keeps asking me about you, about the whole thing.
john_locke You're sure you've thought through the ramifications?
boone_carlyle Yes.
john_locke So be it.
boone_carlyle Locke, what is this? Do you hear me? Untie me right now.
john_locke Or what?
boone_carlyle I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay? I promise.
john_locke I'm doing this, Boone, because it's time for you to let go of some things. Because it's what's best for you. And, I promise, you're going to thank me for this later.
boone_carlyle Hey, I don't think this is best for me What is that?!
john_locke An untreated wound, out here, is going to get infected.
boone_carlyle You're not going to just leave me here!
john_locke Whether you stay is up to you. The camp is 4 miles due west.
boone_carlyle Which way is west?
john_locke You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation.
boone_carlyle Locke!
boone_carlyle Help, help!
malcolm I'm sorry, Mr. Carlyle, but I'm afraid I can't help you. Unfortunately, sir, we'll need a little more to go on.
boone_carlyle I don't understand this, I'm reporting a crime.
james_ford I'm sitting in this... little bar, minding my own business. And this guy...
boone_carlyle Look, this is a cycle with her, okay. My sister just happens to be attracted to the wrong kind of guy.
james_ford I just gave it back to him. Hey, yo, croc hunter, how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story, huh?! Just what kind of...
malcolm Now, if that were her mate, see, then I could help you. Let's finish taking down the rest of your information. You were saying she's your sister, then why is her name Rutherford, and yours Carlyle? Is she married?
boone_carlyle She was married. She's not married anymore, and that has nothing to do with this. Rutherford is her father's name. Our parents got married when I was 10, she was 8.
malcolm So she's your step-sister?
boone_carlyle That's right.
malcolm No blood relation.
boone_carlyle Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlyle? She owns the largest wedding business in the United States. I'm the COO of the wedding clothing subsidiary.
malcolm Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? Cost $2000 new. It's only been worn once.
boone_carlyle I just want someone to go pay this guy a visit, that's all.
malcolm Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of any physical evidence or a direct complaint from, uh...
boone_carlyle Shannon.
malcolm Shannon. We can't just go barging into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police, not the dating police.
boone_carlyle Bryan, we need to talk.
bryan Yeah?
boone_carlyle I'm not going to waste your time, and I'm not going to waste mine. I want you to break up with my sister.
bryan What?
boone_carlyle I want you to end it. Today. Right now.
bryan Oh, bugger off, mate.
boone_carlyle What you don't understand, Bryan, is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave. Go to her house when she's not there, pack your stuff, and never have contact with her again. Understood?
bryan So you flew all the way over here to bribe me.
boone_carlyle I'm going to give you 25,000 US dollars.
bryan I love her.
boone_carlyle How much?
bryan My love for her -- is worth closer to 50,000.
kate_austen I can't believe we've been here for over 3 weeks. I was on my way to Bali. I travel a lot. I was looking forward to exploring the Island. Somehow I ended up on a flight to LA, instead. Guess that falls under the category -- be careful what you wish for. You understood me. You did, didn't you, you just understood what I said? You speak English?
sunhwa_kwon Please, don't tell anyone.
hugo_reyes Damn it!
jinsoo_kwon 이거, 내 고기니까 먹지 마. (Don’t eat my fish!)
hugo_reyes You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish, I'm out of here.
hugo_reyes Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 일이에요? (What did you do?)
hugo_reyes I stepped in a friggin' urchin! Ow, you understand me?! Do you understand infection, gangrene, amputation?!
hugo_reyes Ow, aw, ow! You've got to do something for me.
jinsoo_kwon 이걸 빼야 되겠네. 촉수를 빼야 돼요. (Just pull out the spines -- pull them out.)
hugo_reyes You're going to have to pee on my foot, man. It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV. Ow, arrgh, no just pee on it man.
jinsoo_kwon (No -- you idiot -- that isn’t going to do anything! That’s for jellyfish stings!)
hugo_reyes You need to pee, pee on it. Pee on my foot. I'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee! Pee on it! Pee on-
john_locke Hi.
sayid_jarrah I didn't hear you.
john_locke Sorry. Sneakier than I give myself credit for.
sayid_jarrah What are you doing out here?
john_locke We were hunting. Boone thought I should take the afternoon off.
sayid_jarrah Boone -- is hunting?
john_locke The boy's eager to learn.
sayid_jarrah You think he'll catch anything?
john_locke Nope. What are you doing out here, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Orienteering. I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps, but...
john_locke There's nothing to make.
sayid_jarrah Exactly.
john_locke Well, you made a compass. I haven't seen one of those since I was a Webelos.
sayid_jarrah What's a Webelos?
john_locke It's half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.
sayid_jarrah And what does a Webelos do?
john_locke Gets badges, mostly. Ties knots, identifies birds. I wasn't the most popular kid. I'll leave you to it. Maybe this will help your cause.
sayid_jarrah Don't you need this?
john_locke Not anymore.
shannon_rutherford Somebody help me!
boone_carlyle Who's that?!
shannon_rutherford Boone!
boone_carlyle Shannon! I'm tied up!
shannon_rutherford What?!
boone_carlyle Can you get over here?!
shannon_rutherford I'm tied up, too!
shannon_rutherford Boone!
boone_carlyle Hold on Shannon, I'm coming!
shannon_rutherford Boone! It's getting closer! Somebody help me! Boone!
shannon_rutherford Please, help!
shannon_rutherford Boone!
shannon_rutherford Boone, help me! Hurry, please!
boone_carlyle I'm trying.
shannon_rutherford Please hurry.
boone_carlyle Go. Come on. In here, in here.
sayid_jarrah Let me ask you something -- which way do you think North is?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry?
sayid_jarrah North? Which way is it?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, okay. The sun's going to set over there, so that makes that West. That'd be North. Yeah.
sayid_jarrah Correct. That's where North should be. Yet that is North.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not...
sayid_jarrah A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of 2 or 3 degrees, but not this.
dr_jack_shephard What are you saying?
sayid_jarrah I'm saying this compass is obviously defective.
dr_jack_shephard Where'd you get it?
sayid_jarrah Locke gave it to me this afternoon.
dr_jack_shephard Locke? Where'd you see Locke?
sayid_jarrah About a mile East of here, walking through the jungle. At least I think it's East.
shannon_rutherford What did you do to him?
boone_carlyle What did I do to who?
shannon_rutherford Locke. What did you do to that psycho to piss him off?
boone_carlyle I didn't do anything to him.
shannon_rutherford What? He just did it because he was bored? Look, I know you guys are...
boone_carlyle Let's go back to camp.
shannon_rutherford You were supposed to come later.
boone_carlyle Do you have any bags? Anything you want to take?
shannon_rutherford You should go back.
boone_carlyle No, Shannon. We're getting out of this country. Is there anything you want to bring with you? What's the matter with you?
bryan Aw, look at this.
boone_carlyle Let's go, please. C'mon. We can go.
bryan Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you -- what's what?
boone_carlyle You set me up. This whole thing was a set up.
bryan She's just getting what she's owed.
boone_carlyle What'd you say?
bryan She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died, kept all her father's money for herself. A sweet mum you got there.
boone_carlyle This isn't the first time, is it? Oh, you've done this before, you little bitch.
bryan That's enough.
boone_carlyle Don't touch me you low life piece of-
shannon_rutherford Bryan, get off of him! Get off of him! Get off!!
dr_jack_shephard Any ships?
john_locke Not yet. But I'm -- patient.
dr_jack_shephard Mind if I join you? It's been awhile since you and I talked, John.
john_locke Well, you're a busy man.
dr_jack_shephard So are you. Where's Boone?
john_locke I haven't seen him today.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? You two have been attached at the hip all week.
john_locke Well, let me just check my hip... Nope, no Boone.
dr_jack_shephard How's the boar hunting going?
john_locke Between you and me?
dr_jack_shephard Always.
john_locke I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley. They're smart animals, and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment.
dr_jack_shephard You mean us?
john_locke The most dangerous predator of all.
kate_austen Does anybody else know?
sunhwa_kwon Only Michael.
kate_austen But not your husband?
sunhwa_kwon Please, I...
kate_austen Don't worry. I can keep a secret.
sunhwa_kwon I took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know -- it's complicated.
kate_austen So why don't you tell him now?
sunhwa_kwon I can't.
kate_austen Why?
sunhwa_kwon Because I love him.
kate_austen I don't...
sunhwa_kwon Have you never lied to a man you've loved?
hugo_reyes You sure you don't speak English? Cuz there's a rumor that you do. -- Your wife's hot.
hugo_reyes Oh, I get it, this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? I eat this you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips and past the gums, yada yada, oh god.
charlie_pace Cheers.
dr_jack_shephard You need a hand?
charlie_pace Yeah, yeah, I'd love one.
dr_jack_shephard Haven't seen you around the caves lately.
charlie_pace I needed a change of scenery.
dr_jack_shephard How are you doing, Charlie?
charlie_pace How am I doing? With week 2 of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
dr_jack_shephard I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal. What do you think his story is?
charlie_pace Who? Locke? The guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin. That was my first impression, anyway. And then he saved my life.
dr_jack_shephard So you trust him?
charlie_pace Trust him? No offense, mate, but if there's one person on this Island I would put my absolute faith in to save us all it would be John Locke.
walt_lloyd C'mon, you want the ball? Go get the ball. Go get the ball. Good boy.
hugo_reyes Dude, did you find your own bag? That's awesome, man.
michael_dawson Yeah.
walt_lloyd Come on, Vincent, over here.
hugo_reyes Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again.
michael_dawson Got some papaya there, huh?
hugo_reyes Yeah. Yippee.
michael_dawson Hey, you mind if I, uh...?
hugo_reyes Knock yourself out. You want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin. Oh hey, thanks. Dude, has this thing already been cleaned? Are you kidding me?
sunhwa_kwon 밥 먹었어요?
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 아직 안 먹었어. 손 씻어야 겠어. 손이 더러워졌어.
dr_jack_shephard They look happy.
kate_austen Happy?
dr_jack_shephard Put out your hand. You'll like it, I swear.
kate_austen Gross little grayish-yellow thingies?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, no, no, no, these are slimy little bluish-black thingies.
kate_austen Guava seeds.
dr_jack_shephard What's a garden without guava?
shannon_rutherford Are you sure we're going in the right direction?
boone_carlyle If you don't want to follow me, don't.
shannon_rutherford I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the nut case who brought us out here. You and Locke weren't hunting, were you? You were doing something else.
boone_carlyle Haven't we been over this before?
shannon_rutherford You're a horrible liar, Boone.
boone_carlyle We weren't doing anything.
shannon_rutherford Why are you keeping secrets for this guy?
boone_carlyle Do you know who this guy is? He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on.
shannon_rutherford What is that supposed to mean?
boone_carlyle It means he's smart.
shannon_rutherford He tied us up, Boone. Why?
boone_carlyle We found something.
shannon_rutherford What?
boone_carlyle While we were out looking for Claire we found this -- this piece of metal buried in the jungle. We've been excavating it. That's what we've been doing.
shannon_rutherford A piece of metal?
boone_carlyle A hatch, buried in the dirt.
shannon_rutherford Like a door?
boone_carlyle Yes, Shannon, that's what a hatch is.
shannon_rutherford Where does it go?
boone_carlyle I don't know. But I told him I wanted to tell you, and that's when he did this.
boone_carlyle C'mon.
boone_carlyle No, Shannon!
boone_carlyle Shannon! Shannon!
boone_carlyle What do you want?
shannon_rutherford Bryan took the money. He's gone.
boone_carlyle So the player got played. It's poetic, don't you think?
shannon_rutherford I knew you'd bring the money. I knew you would.
boone_carlyle You're drunk.
shannon_rutherford You want to know why?
boone_carlyle I guess it doesn't matter, does it? Because you're going to tell me anyway.
shannon_rutherford Because you're in love with me.
boone_carlyle What?
shannon_rutherford You brought the money because you're in love with me.
boone_carlyle You show up here plastered...
shannon_rutherford You've always been in love with me.
boone_carlyle You've always been a self-centered little bitch, but now you're delusional.
shannon_rutherford I've always known it.
boone_carlyle You're sick.
shannon_rutherford No.
boone_carlyle Stop.
shannon_rutherford It's okay.
shannon_rutherford Boone?
boone_carlyle What?
shannon_rutherford When we get back to LA you should just tell your mom that you rescued me -- again, just like you always do. And then we'll just go back.
boone_carlyle To what?
shannon_rutherford To what it was.
boone_carlyle Like it's all up to you.
shannon_rutherford Get dressed.
boone_carlyle Shannon!
boone_carlyle No... Shannon? Shannon? Shan?
boone_carlyle It killed her!
john_locke You made it back.
boone_carlyle That thing killed my sister. It's your fault. You drug her out there.
john_locke Your sister?
boone_carlyle Don't play dumb with me.
john_locke Calm down.
boone_carlyle She died in my arms.
john_locke Why is there no blood on you?
boone_carlyle What the hell just happened to me out there?
john_locke I don't know. I don't know, you tell me. But your sister, Shannon...
boone_carlyle She was dead.
john_locke Is that what it made you see?
boone_carlyle What made me see? That stuff you put on my head -- you drugged me.
john_locke I gave you an experience that I believe was vital to your survival on this Island.
boone_carlyle It wasn't real?
john_locke It was only as real as you made it.
boone_carlyle I saw her -- I saw her die.
john_locke How did you feel? When she died?
boone_carlyle I felt -- I felt -- I felt relieved. I felt relieved.
john_locke Yes. Time to let go. Follow me.
