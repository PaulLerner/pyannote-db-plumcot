LOCKE Save your breath. Nobody's gonna hear you.
LOCKE Dad? What is this?
BEN You tell me. You brought him here.
LOCKE I didn't bring him here.
BEN I'd be careful about getting too close to him, John.
LOCKE Where did you find him? Why did you bring him here?
BEN I already said. We didn't.
LOCKE You want me to ask him how he got here?
BEN Be my guest.
BEN Tom!
BEN I warned you, John.
COOPER Don't you know, John? Don't you know where we are?
LOCKE What did he mean?
BEN I'm afraid we don't have time to deal with that right now, John. We're leaving first thing in the morning, all of us.
LOCKE Where are you going?
BEN We're going to a new place. Well, an old place, actually. Would you like to come with us?
LOCKE Yes.
BEN Good. We're holding Kate a few buildings over from here, maybe you'd like to say goodbye.
SAWYER Hey, where you going?
KATE I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.
SAWYER Fine, let's go to your tent.
KATE Um... its nothing personal, it's just... old habits, you know?
SAWYER Fine, scram.
SAWYER You want me to walk you home?
KATE It's five tents, I think I'll make it.
SAWYER Sure? I gotta pee anyway.
KATE That is so romantic.
SAWYER What the hell are y'all doing?
HURLEY What the hell are you doing?
SAWYER Going to take a leak.
HURLEY Yeah well, so were we.
SAWYER Well alrightey then.
LOCKE Hello, James.
LOCKE Wanna zip your pants up?
SAWYER The hell are you doing here?
LOCKE Looking for you, actually.
SAWYER OK Tarzan, so now that you're back from your blow-up-everything-that-could-get-us-off-the-Island tour, how 'bout you tell me why you joined up with the damn enemy?
LOCKE I didn't join them. I infiltrated them.
SAWYER You're undercover with the Others.
LOCKE That's right.
SAWYER But how 'bout you give me one reason to believe that?
LOCKE Because a few hours ago I snuck into Ben's tent and kidnapped him. I tied him up, dragged him off into the jungle.
SAWYER And you came all the way back here to tell me this because...?
LOCKE Because this is the same man who tortured you, beat you, humiliated you. And I want you to kill him.
SAWYER You want him dead, you kill him.
LOCKE I'm not a murderer.
SAWYER Neither am I!
LOCKE 'Cept for the man you killed in Sydney. They got files on us, James. All of us.
SAWYER Yeah well, their file's got their facts wrong.
LOCKE Then I made a mistake coming to you. Please don't tell anyone that I was here.
SAWYER Hey, stop.
SAWYER I said stop!
SAWYER Dammit! Wait up.
LOCKE There. That ought to do it.
CINDY Thanks. That would have taken me hours to do myself.
LOCKE Glad I could help.
CINDY Don't mind them. They're all just excited you're here.
LOCKE Excited?
CINDY We've been waiting for you.
TOM John. You got a minute?
LOCKE Yeah.
TOM Ben's asking for ya.
LOCKE OK.
JULIET Ben, it's 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband; he was sterile before they got here...
BEN Hello, John. Thanks for coming.
LOCKE What's that?
BEN Juliet is gathering information for us at your former camp. She's determining if any of the women are pregnant. Then we're gonna go in and... take them.
LOCKE Take them?
BEN This is not the first time we've done this, John. Trust me, no one will get hurt.
BEN Could you pass me that please?
BEN Thank you.
BEN I believe I have you to thank for this, John.
LOCKE Me?
BEN A week ago I couldn't move my toes. But the minute you showed up, I started to feel pins and needles. And this is only the beginning, John. I can't wait to show you what this Island can do. But unfortunately, you're not ready, John.
LOCKE Well er, no, I'm ready.
BEN No, John, you're not. You're still crippled by the memories of the man you used to be before you came to this Island. And you'll never be free until you release the hold that your father has over you. Why do you think you brought him here?
LOCKE Oh oh oh, the, magic box, OK Ben, how about you show me—
BEN The magic box is a metaphor, John. I can't show you anything until you can show me that you're ready and willing to be one of us. When people join us here on this Island, they need to make a gesture of free will, of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father.
JACK Hey. When'd you get back?
CHARLIE Jack. Hey. Uh, last night. Well, early this morning.
JACK So, camping huh? What were you guys doing out there?
CHARLIE We figured we'd, er, explore a bit. You know, see what was further down the beach. Male bonding.
JACK Well, next time you go out, sign me up.
CHARLIE Yeah, next time. Sure.
CHARLIE Thanks, Jin. We have to tell Jack.
HURLEY Yeah, I mean shouldn't he check out her wound?
DESMOND Can you give me your word that Jack can be trusted? Now, he spent 10 days with those people and then nothing happened to him? And that woman he's spending all his time with—
CHARLIE Juliet?
DESMOND Aye, Juliet. Two weeks ago she had your friends in cages. Naomi... I mean, you heard everything that she said. If we keep her safe, she's our way off this Island. So given that, do you trust Jack? Or don't you?
DESMOND Right. So you better bring us someone we can trust.
LOCKE You should have put some shoes on.
SAWYER Ya think? So what else is in it?
LOCKE In what?
SAWYER The file they got on me.
LOCKE Not much. That your parents died when you were very young. But it doesn't say why your father shot your mother or why he turned the gun on himself. That must have been hard for you.
SAWYER What else?
LOCKE High school transcripts. Uh, criminal record. All the con jobs you were arrested for. I guess that's why you use an alias, huh? Why did you choose the name Sawyer—
SAWYER How stupid do you think I am, huh?! I've already been conned by Ben once. Maybe you heard about it, bunny with a number painted on it. Think I'm just gonna follow you through the jungle—
LOCKE James, please, you have to, you have to trust me...
SAWYER Where are you taking me? Tell me the truth! What do you want from me?!
LOCKE I'm bringing you there to do exactly what I said. I need you to kill Ben.
SAWYER Why did you come back to get me?
LOCKE I had to.
SAWYER Why me?! Why won't you do it yourself?
LOCKE James, please!
SAWYER Don't call me James! Why won't you do it yourself?!
LOCKE Because I can't! I can't!!! I can't do it! That's why I came back for you.
SAWYER Get up.
SAWYER I'll go to wherever you got him, but then we're bringing him back to our camp. I ain't killing nobody, you understand me?
LOCKE Yeah. I understand. But you'll change your mind. When you hear what he has to say. You'll change your mind.
HURLEY Hey dude.
SAYID Hello Hurley.
HURLEY Can you keep a secret?
SAYID You've already spoken to her?
CHARLIE Yeah. You're gonna wanna hear it for yourself.
SAYID And you haven't told Jack?
CHARLIE No.
SAYID Good.
SAYID My name's Sayid Jarrah. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the Island.
NAOMI Actually, it crashed in the water.
SAYID What's your name?
NAOMI Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.
SAYID Naomi, from where exactly did you take off?
NAOMI A ship. Freighter. About eighty nautical miles west of here. We're part of a search-and-recovery team.
SAYID You told my friends the wreckage of Flight 815 was discovered. Did you mean the partial wreckage?
NAOMI No. They found the entire plane off the coast of Bali. In an ocean trench four miles deep. They sent down cameras in these little robots to survey the wreck. The bodies were all there.
SAYID Well, obviously we're not dead.
NAOMI Obviously.
SAYID So if you weren't looking for us, then who were you looking for?
NAOMI Him.
SAYID Desmond?
NAOMI My company was hired by a woman named Penelope Widmore. I don't know why, I never met her. She gave us a set of coordinates. We'd be conducting a differential GPS grid search ever since.
SAYID You knew about the Island?
NAOMI Island? We were given coordinates in the middle of the bloody ocean. We thought it was a fool's errand. 'Til three days ago. I was flying back for the ship when all of a sudden the clouds cleared and I saw land. The instruments started spinning, I realized I was going down, so... I grabbed my chute and I bailed.
SAYID Did you actually see her helicopter?
DESMOND No.
NAOMI You think I'm lying, mate?
SAYID And I take it you have no means whatsoever of communicating with that freighter of yours?
NAOMI What was your name? Sayid?
SAYID Yes.
NAOMI Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.
SAWYER So Ben. You said I'd kill him when I heard what he's got to say.
LOCKE That's right.
SAWYER Well, you wanna give me a head's up?
LOCKE It's not really my place to tell you.
SAWYER Look, what you read in that file, about the guy in Sydney. I thought he was someone else. I made a mistake; I didn't mean to kill him.
LOCKE Well, who'd you mean to kill?
SAWYER Are we almost there?
LOCKE Almost.
BEN Wake up, John. It's time.
BEN I know it won't be easy. But the quicker the better.
COOPER You're kidding me, right? You expect him to kill me?
BEN John. The hesitation that you're feeling is just the part of you that still feels like he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney. Throwing you out of an eight-story window. Don't you want to be free from him?
COOPER The hesitation he's feeling is because he is a spineless—
LOCKE Shut up!
LOCKE I... I gotta think.
BEN Don't think, John.
COOPER You're wasting your time, bug-eye. Me and him have been through all this. All he wants is his daddy—
LOCKE Shut up! I said shut up!!
COOPER You really haven't figured it out yet, have you?
BEN Let go of him, John.
LOCKE Why are you doing this to me?
BEN You're doing this to yourself. As long as he's still breathing, you'll still be that same sad pathetic little man that was kicked off his walkabout tour because you couldn't walk.
COOPER I'll be here the rest of the week, John, if you change your mind--
BEN I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was.
SAWYER Son of a...
SAWYER Nice place you got here, Locke.
LOCKE Ben's inside in the brig. You ready?
SAWYER Yeah I'm ready.
SAWYER Friends of yours?
LOCKE It's an old slaving ship. Mid-19th century. My guess is they captured the slaves and brought 'em here to try and mine the Island.
SAWYER What's in the boxes?
LOCKE That'd be dynamite.
SAWYER Son of a bitch. You really kidnapped the little bastard. We ain't killing him, Locke.
LOCKE Whatever you say, James.
SAWYER Well well well.
SAWYER Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Open the damn door!
SAWYER Shut up! Open up!
SAWYER I said shut up!
SAWYER Who the hell are you?
HURLEY So is that like a radio?
SAYID It's like a radio, yes. But I've never seen equipment this sophisticated.
HURLEY You can still make it work, right?
SAYID I hope so.
HURLEY And what about the other part? The part about they found the plane and we were all dead.
SAYID One thing at a time.
SAYID There's not a single audible channel. Whatever that interference is, it's blocking our ability to send out our own transmission. If we—
KATE What's that? Is that a radio? Where'd you get it?
HURLEY Uh, the luggage.
KATE What? You just found a radio in the luggage?
SAYID Kate, if I explain, I want you to keep this very quiet.
KATE Keep what very quiet?
SAWYER Locke! Open this damn door! Open it up! I can hear you, you bald bastard!
LOCKE Rousseau.
ROUSSEAU Locke.
LOCKE What brings you to the Black Rock?
ROUSSEAU Dynamite. And you?
SAWYER Open this door! Open up!
LOCKE Crates are right over there.
SAWYER Open this damn door!
LOCKE Be careful, its unstable.
SAWYER Locke! LOCKE!
RICHARD It's beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend on the Island, you just never get tired of this view. We haven't been formally introduced. I'm Richard.
RICHARD You mind if I, join you here?
LOCKE Nah, sure.
RICHARD He wanted to embarrass you.
LOCKE I'm sorry?
RICHARD Ben knew you weren't gonna kill your own father. He put you in front of everyone in our camp just so they could all watch you fail.
LOCKE Why?
RICHARD 'Cause when word got back here that there was a man with a broken spine on the plane who could suddenly walk again, well, people here began to get very excited because that, that could only happen to someone who was extremely special. But Ben doesn't want anyone to think you're special, John.
LOCKE And why are you telling me this?
RICHARD Ben has been wasting our time with novelties like fertility problems. We're looking for someone to remind us that we're here for more important reasons.
LOCKE What do you want from me?
RICHARD I want for you to find your purpose. And to do that, your father has to go, John. And since you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna suggest someone else.
LOCKE Sawyer! Why would Sawyer kill my father? He doesn't even know him.
RICHARD Keep reading.
SAWYER Open this damn door! Son of a bitch!!
SAWYER I'm pointing my gun at you John-boy. You got three seconds to open this door.
LOCKE You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.
SAWYER One! Two!
LOCKE If there were any bullets in that gun, why would you hold a knife to my throat?
SAWYER Ah! Son of a bitch!!
COOPER Guess I didn't raise no dummies.
SAWYER The hell's that mean?
COOPER It means that bald-headed bastard outside the door is my son.
SAWYER Come again?
COOPER My son. As in I'm his father. You do speak English?
SAWYER You're his... How did you get here, to the Island?
COOPER Island? OK. I'm driving down I-10 through Tallahassee when bam, somebody slams into the back of my car. I go right into the divider at 70 miles an hour. The next thing I know, the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney, stuffing me into the back of an ambulance, and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the IV in my arm. And then, nothing. Just, black. And the next thing I know I wake up in a dark room tied up, gag in my mouth, and when the door opens, I'm looking up at the same man I threw out a window, John Locke. My dead son.
SAWYER And he's dead 'cause you threw him out a window?
COOPER No, he survived that. But it paralyzed him, permanently. He's dead because the plane he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.
SAWYER Well, I got bad news for ya, pops, 'cause I was on that plane with your son. He sure as hell wasn't crippled. And we didn't crash in the Pacific, we crashed here on this Island.
COOPER You sure it's an Island?
SAWYER Well, what else is it?
COOPER A little hot for heaven, isn't it?
SAWYER Oh, OK, so we're dead?
COOPER They found your plane on the bottom of the ocean. One minute I'm in a car wreck, and the next minute I'm in a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle. If this isn't hell, friend, then where are we?
SAWYER Why did you throw Locke out a window?
COOPER He was becoming a nuisance. I conned him into giving me one of his kidneys. He never got over it.
SAWYER Conned?
COOPER Yes sir, conned.
SAWYER What's your name?
COOPER Hmm?
SAWYER Your name.
COOPER A conman goes by many names, friend. I've been Alan Seward, Anthony Cooper, Ted MacLaren, Tom Sawyer, Louis Jackson, Paul—
SAWYER Tom Sawyer.
COOPER I was young and Huck Finn was taken. And the ladies loved that one. Made me charming.
SAWYER Well, how about that.
COOPER How about what?
SAWYER Sawyer's my name, too.
LOCKE Ben. What's going on?
BEN We're moving.
LOCKE Moving? Where are we going?
BEN We are not going anywhere, John. You are going to stay behind. You both are going to stay behind.
LOCKE What? You're not taking him?
BEN He's your mess, John. Why would we clean it up?
LOCKE Ben! If you're trying to put me in my place, or embarrass me—
BEN Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?
LOCKE Well, you can't leave me. After everything—
BEN Don't tell me what I can't do, John.
LOCKE But I thought I was... special.
BEN Well, everyone makes mistakes. We're leaving now. We'll leave a trail, one you can track. And John, unless you're carrying your father's body on your back, don't bother.
COOPER What's the matter with you?
SAWYER You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?
COOPER Why?
SAWYER Have you or haven't you?
COOPER Yeah, I've been to Jasper. Don't tell me I'm your daddy...
SAWYER No. You killed my daddy.
SAWYER Read it.
COOPER "Dear Mr Sawyer." What is this?
SAWYER Just read it.
COOPER "You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. And I know what you done. You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away, so he got angry and he killed my mother, and then he killed himself" blah blah blah blah. So what? Is this supposed to be you, you wrote this letter? Hey, wait a second. Did you take my name because you were on some kind of revenge kick?
SAWYER Keep reading.
COOPER Easy, easy, don't get all worked up. Look, I ran that con two dozen times. If your mother was one of the—
SAWYER Mary. Her name was Mary.
COOPER Mary from Jasper, Alabama. Yeah, I remember her. She practically begged me to take her thirty-eight thousand dollars and to rescue her from her sorry little life.
SAWYER You finish the letter.
COOPER Look, I only took her money. It ain't my fault your dad overreacted. If he pulled the old murder suicide, then I'm sure he's down here somewhere. Er, maybe you could take this up with him—
SAWYER FINISH IT!!!
COOPER OK. OK.
SAWYER You wanna go to hell?! You wanna go to hell?!!
LOCKE Thank you.
JACK You missing those cheeseburgers yet?
JULIET Only every second.
KATE Hey.
JACK Hey.
KATE I need to talk to you.
JACK OK.
KATE In private.
JULIET No problem.
JACK Anything you wanna say to me, you can say in front of her.
KATE Not this.
JULIET It's OK.
JACK No no no no, you can stay.
KATE Yeah, you know what, you should stay. Seems only fair considering she's the reason that no one wants to tell you that there's a woman in Hurley's tent who parachuted onto the Island yesterday.
JACK What?
KATE A woman. She jumped from her chopper before it crashed. She says that the boat that she took off from is about 80 miles off the coast and that if she can find a way to contact it, we'll all be rescued.
JACK Why didn't anyone tell me this?
KATE I already told you, because they don't trust you.
JACK How?
KATE How what?
JACK How is she supposed to contact her boat?
KATE Did you hear what I just said? Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends are afraid to...
JACK Kate! How?
KATE She had a phone radio thing, Sayid's trying to get it to work.
JULIET We should tell her.
JACK No.
KATE Tell me what?
JULIET We should tell her.
JACK Not yet.
LOCKE You can go back now.
SAWYER Why did you do this?
LOCKE He ruined my life. And he ruined yours. And he had it coming. Juliet is a mole.
SAWYER What?
LOCKE She's working for Ben. He sent her back to find out which of our women were pregnant. Three days from now, there's gonna be a raid on the beach and they're gonna take them. They say they don't want anyone to get hurt.
SAWYER Why are you telling me this?
LOCKE So you can warn the camp.
SAWYER You warn the camp.
LOCKE I'm not going back.
SAWYER You're going back undercover?
LOCKE No, I was never undercover, James. I'm on my own journey now.
SAWYER Even if Juliet is a mole, they ain't gonna believe me, I've been saying that since she showed up—
LOCKE They'll believe you now.
SAWYER Hey. Is it true?
LOCKE Is what true?
SAWYER That he threw you out a window. That you were a cripple.
LOCKE Not anymore.
