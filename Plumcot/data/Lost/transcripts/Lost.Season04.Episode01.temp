NEWSREADER Almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?
JEFF We're getting reports that the pursuit began near the La Brea area, then travelled to a warehouse in the district south of the ten freeway.
NEWSREADER Can you see how many people are in the car?
JEFF It would appear to be just the one, the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here are pictures of the ten freeway, south of downtown.
NEWSREADER Is that a Camaro, Jeff?
JEFF Yes, yes it looks like a vintage early 70's model.
JACK Damn it.
POLICEMAN Show us your hands!
POLICEMAN Pull down the window, and show us your hands now!
POLICEWOMAN Now slowly open the door with your left hand.
POLICEMAN Get out of the car!
POLICEMAN Turn around, slow!
POLICEMAN 2 On the ground!
POLICEWOMAN Now!
HURLEY Stop! Don't you know who I am? Stop, wait, don't you know who I am? I'm one of the Oceanic six! I'm one of the Oceanic six!!!
DETECTIVE So five minutes before you led ten cruisers on a chase across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until, you see something and freak out. Mr Reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store and it made you run away in a...
HURLEY I wasn't running away from anyone.
DETECTIVE Do you think I care that you're a celebrity? You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighbourhood.
HURLEY I'm not a celebrity.
DETECTIVE Is that why you kept shouting "Hey I'm one of the Oceanic Six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence?
HURLEY Sure.
DETECTIVE I knew somebody on your plane.
HURLEY Really?
DETECTIVE Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez. She was my partner before I made detective. Dark hair. Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her? Maybe you met her on the plane? Before it took off?
HURLEY Sorry, never met her.
DETECTIVE Why don't you watch the tape. Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut, you want one?
HURLEY No thanks.
DETECTIVE When I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.
HURLEY Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
DETECTIVE The hell is wrong with you?
DETECTIVE What are you doing Reyes? Huh, you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? 'Cause if that's what you want, I can make that happen right now, my friend.
HURLEY You can? Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
HURLEY Jack? You there dude? Beach to Jack, come in Jack. Beach to Jack—
JACK Right here, Hurley, what's up?
HURLEY Hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
JACK Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat, they're on their way to pick us up right now.
HURLEY Seriously? It worked?
JACK Seriously, we're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags buddy .
HURLEY Hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
JACK Any luck?
KATE Nothing, no sign of him. (She looks at Naomi lying on the ground) It's like he just disappeared. Why would Locke kill her? He hadn't even met her.
JACK Because he's crazy.
KATE So what if he comes back?
JACK He comes back, I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna get everybody together, the sooner we get back to the beach, the better.
KATE Are we really going home?
JACK Yeah. We're really going home.
SUN I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital.
CLAIRE Oh rub it in why don't you!
SUN Oh, no...
ROSE You ladies need a hand?
CLAIRE No, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know, you must be very proud with Bernard, I hear he's quite the hero.
ROSE But everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, Claire. If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you'd better make sure you treat him real good when we get back.
CLAIRE Rose!
BEN I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex and get as far from here as possible.
ROUSSEAU What?
BEN Listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now, I don't care where you go, just go, I will not have my daughter—
ROUSSEAU She is not your daughter.
HURLEY Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me.
BERNARD Oh yeah, who needs a hundred and fifty million dollars, right?
HURLEY Now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think I'm dead. We get rescued and I go back. I'm gonna be free. (Pauses) I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And I wanna do a cannonball.
BERNARD Hurley. You wanna do a cannonball? Cannonball.
SAYID Are you alright Desmond?
DESMOND We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
SAWYER Easy, Scottie, everything's cool, boat's on the way.
DESMOND What? On the way? No.
HURLEY Hey where's Charlie?
DESMOND No that woman, Naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!
JULIET What?
SAWYER Then who are they?
HURLEY Desmond, where's Charlie?
DESMOND I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack, now!!
JULIET It's alright, we can call him, we have a walkie. It's OK.
DESMOND Where is it, get it.
BERNARD What do you mean the people aren't who they say they are?
HURLEY Where's Charlie?!
DESMOND I'm, I'm sorry brother. I...
KATE That's our ride.
JACK Hello.
MINKOWSKI Hey Jack. This is George Minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some RF interference. We're gonna need to re-jigger some of the settings on your sat phone.
JACK Er sure, ok, just tell me what I gotta tell.
MINKOWSKI How about you put Naomi on.
JACK Naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second, let me see if I...
JACK Where is she?
BEN 
SAWYER Look, we gotta call the Doc.
SAYID Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand.
SAWYER Look, I'm sorry he's dead. But I don't even know what the hell "not Penny's boat" means.
SAYID Calling Jack accomplishes nothing.
JULIET It would accomplish warning him.
SAYID It also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. I've no doubt they're monitoring our communications, if we call Jack...
SAWYER You know what? I got the walkie, I'm making the call. Hey!
HURLEY We better get going.
SAWYER Going where?!
ROUSSEAU I found blood. The girl's trail. Probably crawled away. Can't be more than 10 minutes ahead of us. We should go, now, and find her.
JACK We're taking him with us.
ROUSSEAU Why would we do that?
JACK Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.
JACK Alright, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach. When these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find. OK?
CLAIRE You look worried, Jack.
JACK The only thing I'm worried about is missing our ride home.
KATE I found her trail. She's headed West across the Island.
JACK Rousseau already found it, we're going after her right now.
KATE But, are you sure it's hers?
JACK Unless someone else is bleeding.
KATE But if she didn't want us to find her, then she could have created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in case.
JACK Kate, six hours from now we're gonna be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt, she ran into the jungle, she's not thinking about leaving fake trails.
KATE You're right.
JACK I'll track her down, why don't you get everybody back to the beach.
KATE You got it.
KATE Be careful, OK?
SAWYER The hell's gotten into you, Hugo? They'll all be back in the morning, if you just wait.
HURLEY You don't wait with warnings dude, you warn.
SAWYER And here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.
HURLEY You almost got me that time. How about best out of seven?
NURSE Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?
NURSE Oh by the way, you have a visitor.
VISITOR Mr Reyes. Hello. My name is Matthew Abaddon. I'm an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes?
HURLEY OK.
MATTHEW I'm here, Mr Reyes, because we heard about your recent... episode. Your arrest. Your incarceration here. Frankly, we feel terrible about it. So, on behalf of Oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade.
HURLEY What kind of upgrade?
MATTHEW To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls. Where you'd have your own bathroom. You could see the ocean from there...
HURLEY I don't wanna see the ocean.
MATTHEW No problem.
HURLEY Actually, thanks, I'm... I'm fine right here.
MATTHEW Are you fine Mr. Reyes?
HURLEY What do you mean?
MATTHEW You're in a mental institution.
HURLEY Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
MATTHEW I must have left them at home.
HURLEY Then we're done, dude.
MATTHEW Are they still alive?
HURLEY What?
MATTHEW You heard me.
HURLEY Nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me.
NURSES It's OK, it's OK.
SAWYER Alright there, Hugo?
HURLEY Yeah, dude, I'm fine.
SAWYER You wanna talk about it?
HURLEY Talk about what?
SAWYER Charlie. I mean, you two were buddies, I just thought...
HURLEY We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.
SAWYER I'm gonna head up and tell 'em to slow down.
HURLEY I can keep up.
SAWYER Alright "esé"... Just holler if you need me.
HURLEY Guys. Guys! Guys! Guys!!! Guys!
HURLEY Uh oh.
ROUSSEAU The blood trail ends here.
JACK What do you mean?
ROUSSEAU It ends.
JACK You're telling me she stopped bleeding here?
ROUSSEAU No. I'm telling you that she fooled us. Doubled back.
BEN Better call the boat. Tell 'em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood.
JACK Where is it?
BEN OK, I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one.
JACK What are you talking about?
BEN Kate took it when she hugged you.
BEN She found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.
KATE Hello.
MINKOWSKI Who's this?
KATE Uh, this is Kate.
MINKOWSKI You with Jack?
KATE No, no, he's not here.
MINKOWSKI Where's Naomi?
KATE We're looking for her.
MINKOWSKI What do you mean, you're looking for her?
NAOMI Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
KATE Naomi, listen to me. You're hurt, let me help you.
NAOMI Help me? I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued. And you throw this knife in my back.
KATE No, no, it was not us.
NAOMI Who?
KATE His name is John Locke.
NAOMI Why?
KATE He said that you weren't who you said you were.
KATE I swear to God, we would never hurt you, you know us. Please. We need your help, please help us.
NAOMI Give me the phone.
NAOMI George. It's Naomi.
MINKOWSKI Naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there?
NAOMI I had an accident. I'm hurt.
MINKOWSKI Wha, an accident. What accident? What happened? Naomi? Hello? Hello?
NAOMI I hit a tree branch, when I parachuted in. Took it through my gut.
MINKOWSKI Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?
NAOMI I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me until I could talk to you myself.
MINKOWSKI We've lost our signal and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency?
NAOMI Yeah. Try it now.
MINKOWSKI Clear as a bell. Hang on Naomi, we'll get you back here ASAP, OK?
NAOMI I'm sorry, George. Just tell my sister that I love her.
HURLEY Hello?
HURLEY Help! Help! Help!!!
HURLEY There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
LOCKE Hello, Hugo.
LOCKE You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo. How did you get separated from the group?
HURLEY I just... fell behind, I guess.
LOCKE Is that why you were shouting for help?
HURLEY I got scared.
LOCKE What Desmond said happened down in that station, "not Penny's boat." Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?
HURLEY Jack should never have called those people.
LOCKE I couldn't agree more.
HURLEY It's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us.
LOCKE Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo. Because if we can't talk 'em out of it, then Charlie died for nothing.
SAWYER Where the hell have you been, Hugo?
HURLEY Sorry, I was just er... I got lost.
SAYID What are you doing here?
LOCKE I came here for the same reason you did, to warn Jack about the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, but, I figured I might have better luck with some support.
SAYID You want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.
SUN 진수 씨!
BERNARD Still in one piece.
ROSE Rambo.
BERNARD Ow!
HURLEY I'll tell her.
HURLEY He's dead. Charlie's dead.
CLAIRE No.
PATIENT I'd watch out if I were you.
HURLEY What you talking about, dude?
PATIENT There's a guy over there, staring at you.
HURLEY What guy?
PATIENT That guy.
CHARLIE Hey man. Don't run. Hurley. Just, just, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. Don't do what you did in the store. OK? There's no need to freak out.
HURLEY No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the Ho Hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?
CHARLIE Can we just sit down?
HURLEY I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.
CHARLIE I am dead. But I'm also here.
HURLEY OK, prove it.
HURLEY Alright, OK.
HURLEY Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
HURLEY Then why didn't you tell me?
CHARLIE Because you would have tried to stop me. And since I was gonna do it anyway I thought I would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. You knew I was here to tell you.
HURLEY I'm not listening to this. No, 'cause you're not here.
CHARLIE I am here, you're being a baby.
HURLEY I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open them, you'll be gone.
CHARLIE I am here.
HURLEY One!
CHARLIE Don't do this.
HURLEY Two!
CHARLIE They need you.
HURLEY Three!
CHARLIE They need you, Hugo.
HURLEY Four!
CHARLIE You know they need you.
HURLEY Five!
CLAIRE What, what happened? I mean, how, how did he...
HURLEY He was trying to help us.
JULIET Jack.
LOCKE You're not gonna shoot me, Jack. Any more than I was gonna shoot—
LOCKE It's not loaded.
SAWYER Come on.
JACK Let go of me! Do you know what he did?
SAYID Yes, I know what he did!
LOCKE All I did, all I have ever done, has been in the best interest of all of us.
JACK Are you insane?
LOCKE I know I... I have a lot of explaining to do. But, I never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you there was a traitor in your midst. 
JACK She helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off of this island. You killed Naomi.
BEN Well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet.
KATE Yes, he did.
KATE She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, and she fixed this.
KATE They're on their way.
LOCKE She didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. I'm going to the Barracks. The Others abandoned them. It's the only place on the Island with any form of security right now, it'll have to do until I can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.
JACK No one's going anywhere with you, John. Because they're not crazy.
HURLEY He's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he... I don't know why, but he changed his mind.
HURLEY Because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie.
LOCKE Anyone else? There isn't much time.
BEN Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.
JACK He's all yours.
BERNARD You said you'd never leave the Island. If you wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind you.
ROSE I'm not going anywhere with that man.
KATE What are you doing?
SAWYER Same thing I've always done, Kate. Surviving.
LOCKE You know where to find us when you change your mind.
JACK Do you ever miss?
HURLEY Jack.
JACK Yeah, I was on my way back from a consult. Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse?
HURLEY You're on. So, consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?
JACK Yeah.
JACK H.
HURLEY Reporters leaving you alone?
JACK Yeah. Still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee.
JACK Thinking about growing a beard.
HURLEY You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's H-O. So, what are you really doing here, Jack?
JACK I was just checking on ya, seeing if everything was OK.
HURLEY Checking to see if I was nuts, if I was gonna tell.
JACK Are you?
HURLEY You're up.
JACK Nah, you win. I, uh, I gotta run. It was great seeing you Hurley.
HURLEY I'm sorry. I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.
JACK It's water under the bridge, man.
HURLEY I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back.
JACK Hurley.
HURLEY And it's going to do everything it can—
JACK We're never going back!
HURLEY Never say never, dude.
KATE Are you thinking of Charlie?
JACK Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen?
KATE Thunder's getting louder.
JACK That's not thunder.
JACK Come on.
PARACHUTIST Are you Jack?
