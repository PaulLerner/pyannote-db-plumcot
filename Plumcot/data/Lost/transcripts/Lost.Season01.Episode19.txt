kid What's that?
john_locke A game. It's my favorite game, actually. I used to play it with my brother. It's called Mouse Trap.
kid How do you play?
john_locke Well, you start with all these parts off the board. And then, one by one, you build the trap - shoe, bucket, tub - piece by piece it all comes together. And then you wait 'til your opponent lands here on the old cheese wheel. And then if you set it up just right, you spring the trap. Go ahead, kiddo.
john_locke May I help you, ma'am?
emily_locke Yes, um, could you tell me where the footballs are?
john_locke Aisle 8 for regulation, aisle 15 for Nerf.
emily_locke Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.
boone_carlyle You want my opinion?
john_locke Boone, you've got to have some faith. All we've got to do is break the glass, and then we're in. The trebuchet delivers a half a ton of force.
boone_carlyle Why do they call it a trebuchet? It looks like a catapult.
john_locke It's called a trebuchet, Boone, because it's a trebuchet.
boone_carlyle I don't get you, man. One minute you're quoting Nietzsche, now all of the sudden you're an engineer. I don't think I can spell trebuchet.
john_locke There's a 't' on the end.
boone_carlyle I'm serious, John. We've been coming out here everyday for 2 weeks—you never talk about yourself. Everybody's got a story.
john_locke My story would bore you.
john_locke 3, 2, 1.
john_locke This was supposed to work. This was supposed to work!
boone_carlyle John. Your leg, man.
boone_carlyle Are you okay?
john_locke Yeah, I'm fine.
boone_carlyle The trebuchet—why didn't it work?
john_locke It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough.
boone_carlyle I don't think that glass is going to break, man. Whatever it's made out of...
john_locke Everything breaks if you apply the right force.
boone_carlyle So, we're just going to build another one of your inventions, hope it works this time.
john_locke That's right.
boone_carlyle What if it doesn't?
john_locke Then the Island will tell us what to do.
boone_carlyle What's that?
john_locke I should get back there -- salvage those pieces.
boone_carlyle Your leg okay?
john_locke It's fine.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode19 Hi John.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode19 You alright, John?
john_locke Hey, hey, hey. Why are you following me?
emily_locke I'm sorry.
john_locke Who are you?
emily_locke I'm your mother.
john_locke Look, miss, I don't know why you think I'm your son, or how you found me, but...
emily_locke You're adopted, aren't you?
john_locke No. No, I was raised in a foster home. Well, several foster homes, actually. Look, I don't mean to be rude -- what do you want from me?
emily_locke I want to tell you that you're special, very special. You're part of a design. You do realize that, don't you? That our meeting, me finding you, this is a sign of things to come. Great things.
john_locke My father, is he still alive?
emily_locke Still alive? Oh, John, don't you understand? You don't have a father. You were immaculately conceived.
james_ford Which one?
sunhwa_kwon That one.
james_ford You're sure? Because this is the one I've been using and nothing's happening.
sunhwa_kwon I'm sorry it's not helping.
kate_austen What's not helping?
james_ford Nothing. Thanks, anyway. Nice garden.
kate_austen What was that all about?
sunhwa_kwon He has headaches.
kate_austen Doesn't he have, like, a truckload of aspirin stashed away somewhere?
sunhwa_kwon He says aspirin didn't help.
kate_austen Can I ask you a question? Say you're having bad headaches everyday...
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
kate_austen Yeah, fine.
dr_jack_shephard So, who are we talking about then, Kate?
kate_austen Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard Uh-huh.
kate_austen I just think there might be something really wrong with him.
dr_jack_shephard And what does he think?
kate_austen He says he's fine, but...
dr_jack_shephard Then he's fine.
kate_austen Yeah, well, he could be playing it down. There could be some...
dr_jack_shephard Look, Kate, I'd like nothing more than to check the guy out and make sure he's okay. But we both know all I'm going to get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner. And if I'm real lucky, a brand new nickname. I'm just over it.
john_locke You're late.
boone_carlyle Late for what?
john_locke Late for work.
boone_carlyle I think I'm done working, John.
john_locke I'm sorry, what?
boone_carlyle It's useless. You can't open that thing up. You say you can but you can't.
john_locke No, don't tell me what I can't do.
boone_carlyle Don't you get it? It's a dead end. You're not getting in.
john_locke That's impossible. We didn't find this by accident. We're supposed to...
boone_carlyle Oh, we're supposed to. We're supposed to find this, right? We're supposed to open it, right? Then tell me something, John, if we're supposed to open it, then why the hell haven't we opened it yet?
john_locke The Island will send us a sign.
boone_carlyle The Island will send us a sign.
john_locke All that's happening now is our faith is being tested - our commitment! But we will open it! The Island will show us how!
boone_carlyle What kind of sign will the Island send us? Huh, John?
john_locke Did you see that? Boone?
boone_carlyle Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
john_locke No, no, no, please.
boone_carlyle Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
john_locke Don't take it back.
john_locke Boone, wake up.
boone_carlyle Huh. What time is it?
john_locke It's morning, c'mon.
boone_carlyle Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up. What is going on?
john_locke C'mon, let's go.
frainey Emily Annabeth Locke in 10,000 words or less.
john_locke So, she's my mother.
frainey I lifted some hairs from her car and matched them with your DNA samples. It's 99% certain. She was institutionalized - a few times.
john_locke What for?
frainey Nothing criminal or violent. It's a type of schizophrenia. Apparently, if she stays on her meds, she's okay.
john_locke What about my father?
frainey Here's the thing -- your mother sought you out, so she's fair game. But this guy—maybe he doesn't even know you exist. I've done this enough times to know this stuff isn't meant to be, even though it may feel that way. But this probably won't have a happy ending. So, do you want it, or not?
john_locke I want it.
eddie Your name is?
john_locke John, John Locke. I'm Anthony Cooper's son.
eddie Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.
john_locke Tell him I don't want anything. My mother is Emily Locke. Please.
eddie Just a minute. Yeah, Mr. Cooper, I've got John Locke here -- says he's your son. Yes, sir. Well, you can go on in, sir.
anthony_cooper Well, this is -- awkward.
john_locke Thank you for seeing me, sir. I'm, uh, John.
anthony_cooper Something tells me I'm going to want a drink for this. You want a drink?
john_locke Um, yeah, alright, great.
anthony_cooper Scotch okay?
john_locke Yeah, that's, um, thanks.
anthony_cooper So who found who?
john_locke I'm sorry, sir?
anthony_cooper Emily, your mother, did she find you or did you find her?
john_locke She found me.
anthony_cooper How did she look?
john_locke Alright, I guess.
anthony_cooper Did she say anything about me?
john_locke She said that I didn't have a father -- that I was immaculately conceived.
anthony_cooper Really? Well, I guess that makes me god, huh? I didn't even know you existed until a year after you were born. She told me she wasn't even going to have the baby, you, at all. Then she drops off the face of the planet. When she turns up again, she's asking for money, telling me she put you up for adoption. You going to drink that, or what? You have a family of your own?
john_locke No, sir.
anthony_cooper Me neither. I tried it a couple of times, didn't take. Do you hunt?
john_locke No, no.
anthony_cooper You're not one of those animal rights nut jobs, are you?
john_locke No. No, sir.
anthony_cooper What are you doing this Sunday?
john_locke Nothin'.
anthony_cooper You want to go hunting?
john_locke Um, well, I'd like that. Yeah, I'd like that very much.
john_locke I had a dream last night. I asked for a sign and then I saw a plane crash, a Beechcraft right out there. It was a dream, but it was the most real thing I've ever experienced. I know where to go now.
boone_carlyle Go for what?
john_locke To find what we need to open this bastard up.
boone_carlyle Have you been using that wacky paste stuff that made me see my sister get eaten?
john_locke No, no.
boone_carlyle Because, John, I've got to tell you -- signs and dreams and...
john_locke Who's Theresa?
boone_carlyle What?
john_locke Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. You were saying that in the dream.
boone_carlyle How would you know about that?
john_locke I don't know, Boone, but we're supposed to go to this place. We're supposed to find that plane. Will you come with me?
dr_jack_shephard I was going to ask you how this was going, but it's coming together fast.
michael_dawson The fire wasn't a total loss. We learned a few things from building the first one which is saving us from trial and error. Now it's just trial.
jinsoo_kwon 빨리 묶어서 마무리 하자고요! 고쳐야 돼.
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
jinsoo_kwon 어두워지기 전에!
michael_dawson Yeah, man, I know, now, now, now.
dr_jack_shephard You picking up on a little Korean there, Michael?
michael_dawson Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know how to say faster and idiot.
dr_jack_shephard I hear you're having trouble with your head.
james_ford What, now she got you making house calls?
dr_jack_shephard You're sensitive to the light, too, huh?
james_ford You know what? I'm sensitive to you...
dr_jack_shephard Alright, we'll see you.
james_ford Doc? Sensitivity to the light -- that bad?
dr_jack_shephard Depends.
james_ford On what?
dr_jack_shephard On what's causing your headaches.
james_ford It's not like it's a tumor, or something.
dr_jack_shephard What makes you think it's a tumor?
james_ford I don't.
dr_jack_shephard Great. Okay, then.
james_ford My uncle. He died of a brain tumor.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah?
james_ford That run in a family? Tumors?
dr_jack_shephard What type of tumor was it?
james_ford The type that kills you.
dr_jack_shephard Do you smell anything funny? Brain tumors bring on phantom smells, maybe like something burning.
james_ford Just headaches.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'm sure you're fine then. Look, if this is worrying you, there's a couple of tests that I could do.
james_ford Sorry, Doc, sounds fun, but my insurance ran out.
dr_jack_shephard Insurance ran out. That -- that's a good one.
boone_carlyle I could have mentioned her name out by the hatch one day.
john_locke Who?
boone_carlyle Theresa. Maybe I was talking to myself.
john_locke Maybe, but you didn't.
boone_carlyle So, in this dream you saw a plane crash, right?
john_locke Yeah.
boone_carlyle Okay, the fact that we were all just in a plane crash, you didn't think for one second-
boone_carlyle John, you okay?
john_locke I'm fine!
boone_carlyle What is wrong with your leg?
john_locke I'm fine.
boone_carlyle What?
boone_carlyle Someone from camp hiked all the way out here?
john_locke Nope.
boone_carlyle Where do you think it came from?
john_locke Him.
john_locke Mornin', Eddie.
eddie Mornin', Mr. Locke. You gentlemen going to get some birds again?
john_locke I sure hope so.
john_locke Anthony?
anthony_cooper You weren't supposed to be here 'til 12.
john_locke I thought you said 11. What is this?
anthony_cooper It's a dialysis machine. My kidney's failing. Damn doctors say I need a transplant.
john_locke When?
anthony_cooper Tomorrow if it were up to me. I'm on the donor list, but I'm an old man and it's a long list.
john_locke How, how long...
anthony_cooper John, the dialysis will be fine for a while. I didn't tell you for this exact reason. I'm not going to let this spoil what's going to be a fantastic day, and neither should you. So, I'll get done here and we'll have a nice lunch and go shoot some birds.
boone_carlyle He's a priest. How long do you think he's been dead?
john_locke Normally clothing would completely decompose within 2 years, but this is high quality polyester, could be 2 years, could be 10. Gold teeth, obviously well off.
boone_carlyle What kind of money is that?
john_locke Nigerian naira.
boone_carlyle What is a Nigerian priest doing on an Island in the South Pacific?
john_locke I'm not so sure he's a priest.
james_ford You want to keep it down?!
kate_austen That's it, get up.
james_ford What?
kate_austen Get up. You're going to Jack.
james_ford Do I get a lollipop?
dr_jack_shephard When did the headaches start?
james_ford A few days ago, a week maybe. Do you have to be here?
dr_jack_shephard Do you have them when you wake up in the morning?
james_ford Usually they hit me in the middle of the day. What the hell are you doing with that thing?
dr_jack_shephard Checking to see how your pupils respond to changing stimuli.
james_ford What's that -- that nod?
kate_austen Would you just let him do his thing?
james_ford I'm letting him, but I want to know what the hell he thinks I-
dr_jack_shephard I think you should just shut up and relax.
james_ford What the hell are you doing?
dr_jack_shephard Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
james_ford What? No.
dr_jack_shephard Taken pills for malaria?
james_ford Nope.
dr_jack_shephard Have you ever had sex with a prostitute?
james_ford What the hell has that got to do with anything?
dr_jack_shephard Is that a yes?
james_ford Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Have you ever contracted a sexually transmitted disease? I'm going to take that as another yes. When was the last outbreak?
james_ford Go to hell, Doc.
kate_austen I know he deserved it, but...
dr_jack_shephard He needs glasses.
boone_carlyle What's going on, John?
john_locke Nothing.
boone_carlyle You can barely walk, man.
john_locke It's the wound from the shrapnel.
boone_carlyle That's your right leg, John. What's wrong with your left?
john_locke I'm fine, now stop asking me.
boone_carlyle That's it. Let's go back.
john_locke I'm fine.
boone_carlyle No, you're not! Let me get you back to Jack.
john_locke Jack wouldn't know the first thing about what's wrong with me.
boone_carlyle John, we've got to...
john_locke No, no.
boone_carlyle What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?
john_locke I was in a wheelchair.
boone_carlyle What?
john_locke Paralyzed for 4 years. The plane, our plane, I was in that chair when we took off. But not after we crashed.
boone_carlyle Why were you in a wheelchair?
john_locke It doesn't matter anymore. But, but, this Island, it changed me. It made me whole. Now it's trying to take it back and I don't know why. But it wants me to follow what I saw.
boone_carlyle What?
john_locke I know it sounds crazy. 4 weeks ago I wouldn't have believed it myself. But you and I are here for a reason. There's something that we were meant to find, something that's going to help us get into the hatch. I know it. But we've got to keep going.
boone_carlyle Okay. Can you move your legs?
john_locke Just help me up, son.
anthony_cooper These doves fly a lot faster than you think. So you've got to really lead them. If you have to drop it in high cover...
john_locke Got him.
anthony_cooper Yeah, you did. Good shot, son. John, your mother, she may be a little crazy, but at least she brought us together. Thank god it happened now, while we still have time. Let's find your bird.
boone_carlyle She was my nanny -- Theresa. She was my nanny. My mother wasn't around much. I needed someone to take it out on. My bedroom was at the top of this huge flight of stairs, and I would sit in bed all day calling her on the intercom. One day she took a bad step, broke her neck. I was six.
boone_carlyle Listen, what the hell is so funny?
john_locke Look.
boone_carlyle Is that the plane you saw?
john_locke As best I can tell.
boone_carlyle You really saw it?
john_locke Yeah, I really saw it.
boone_carlyle How long do you think it's been there?
john_locke Doesn't matter. What's important is that we found it. What's important is what's inside it.
boone_carlyle What is inside of it, John?
john_locke You're going to have to climb up there for us and find out.
anthony_cooper You can still change your mind.
john_locke Nah. They already shaved my back.
anthony_cooper I'm so thankful for you, John.
john_locke This was meant to be.
anthony_cooper See you on the other side, son.
james_ford If you're looking for a stool sample, you can forget it.
dr_jack_shephard You've been reading a lot since we came to the Island.
james_ford Okay, so what?
dr_jack_shephard You, uh, you've got, uh, you've got hyperopia.
james_ford Hyperopia? That's, uh, what is that?
dr_jack_shephard You're far-sighted.
james_ford Far-sighted?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. It can develop later in life, especially when you add a new strain to the eyes like with reading.
james_ford Blurry.
dr_jack_shephard Better or worse?
james_ford Worse.
james_ford Uh-uh, no way.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, it's not a fashion show.
james_ford Har, har, very funny.
hugo_reyes Dude, it looks like someone steam rolled Harry Potter.
james_ford You love this, don't you?
dr_jack_shephard You're welcome.
john_locke Hang on.
john_locke Boone?! Boone?!
boone_carlyle I'm fine!
john_locke Boone, what do you see?! Boone?!
boone_carlyle Want to know what's in your damn plane, Locke?!
boone_carlyle Here's your sign!
boone_carlyle They're drug smugglers, Locke. Heroin, that's all that's in here!
john_locke I don't understand. I don't understand.
john_locke Boone, Boone, get out!
boone_carlyle Hello. Hello. Anybody out there? Mayday, mayday.
john_locke Boone, there's no time! Get out now!
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode19 VOICE Is someone there?
boone_carlyle Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode19 VOICE Repeat your transmission, please.
boone_carlyle Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!
john_locke Boone, get out!
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode19 VOICE We're the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.
john_locke Get out now!
kate_austen So, did you know before or after you asked him about his latest outbreak?
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'd answer that, Kate, but, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
kate_austen Of course. Thank you for helping him. I know it was probably the last thing you wanted to do.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't do it for him.
john_locke Jack, help!
dr_jack_shephard No, no, no. Put him down up here. Alright, alright, that's it, easy. What happened?
john_locke There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff out near the place we were hunting.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, I'm going to need some water, shirts, towels, anything that I can use to staunch the bleeding. Kate, now, please!
dr_jack_shephard John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke?! Locke?! Locke?!
nurse I think what you did was so kind.
john_locke Where's my father?
nurse Who?
john_locke We had the transplant together.
nurse I didn't know he was your father.
john_locke We don't have the same last name. Where is he?
nurse Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon. He went back home. He's under private care.
john_locke But, that doesn't make any... Why? Did he leave me a message?
nurse No, not that I know of. You just relax, Mr. Locke. I'm going to get you some juice.
emily_locke It was his idea. I'm sorry, John.
john_locke What are you doing here?
emily_locke I needed some money. He's always been good that way. Your father's always been generous.
john_locke You told me I didn't have a father.
emily_locke Well, he said that was the only way you would give it to him. It had to be your idea. He told me where to find you. He, he asked me to go see you. I wanted to see you.
john_locke This can't be happening. This, this is a misunderstanding. This can't-this can't happen to me. He wouldn't do this to me. He wouldn't do this to me!
john_locke Eddie, Eddie open the gate.
eddie Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests.
john_locke I'm not a guest.
eddie I'm sorry, John.
john_locke Eddie, open the gate.
eddie I'm sorry, I'm going to need you to move your car.
john_locke I know you're watching me. You can't do this.
eddie John, please. Move your car.
john_locke I've done everything you wanted me to do, so why did you do this to me?!
