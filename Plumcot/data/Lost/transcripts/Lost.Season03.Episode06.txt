MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 Police, open the door.
kate_austen Um. Everything's alright in here.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 Ma'am, we have reason to believe that someone extremely dangerous is in the motel. We're conducting a room-to-room search.
kate_austen I'm alone, officer.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 The person could be holding you at gunpoint, forcing you to say that. Please open the door.
kate_austen I don't think I should.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 Then you have three seconds before I break this door down. One... two...
kevin_callis Hey. Wanna get it on?
kate_austen Hell yeah!
kate_austen Hey.
james_ford Hey yourself.
kate_austen What are you doing?
james_ford Throwin' rocks.
kate_austen Thought you had to pull the lever.
james_ford I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.
kate_austen Get me one.
james_ford Psh. What, you trying to keep me feeling productive?
dr_jack_shephard You took these blood tests, made all the notations? How old are the x-rays?
dr_juliet_burke A week.
dr_jack_shephard The tumor on your spine is borderline inoperable. And at the rate it's growing, that borderline goes away in about one week.
ben_linus Oh.
dr_jack_shephard The OR we were in, is that fully equipped?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Anesthesia? Sterile?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
dr_jack_shephard You needed to be in surgery yesterday.
ben_linus Alright, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. I'm ready.
dr_jack_shephard No, I think you misunderstood me. I didn't say I was gonna do it. I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die. You think I believe you people? You think I trust you? That I'm just going to do the surgery, and HOPE that you let me go?!
dr_juliet_burke Jack!
dr_jack_shephard No, don't!
ben_linus Well, Jack. I'm very disappointed in your decision.
dr_jack_shephard Well, Ben. At least you won't have to be disappointed for very long.
kate_austen You shouldn't have come here.
kevin_callis Yeah, you're right. I've made a huge mistake, and I'm just full of regret right now.
kate_austen Seriously. It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.
kevin_callis It's bad luck to see the bride in her dress before the wedding. You, my friend, are naked.
kevin_callis Have you tried it on?
kate_austen I had to hold my breath to get the claspy things to clasp. So, I'm waiting for the very last minute.
kevin_callis Well, it's about twelve hours, right? Might wanna get clasping.
kevin_callis Hey. I know its... it's been fast. But this is right. I know it's real. And I love you, Monica.
kate_austen I love you too, Kevin.
danny_pickett Time for work.
kate_austen What about him?
danny_pickett He's got the day off.
kate_austen Well, if he's not working, neither am I.
danny_pickett Oh, you're not, huh?
james_ford Go, Freckles. Man wants to give me a day off? Let him give me a day off.
kate_austen No Sawyer, we're a team. You break the rocks, I haul 'em.
danny_pickett Alright. Fine.
danny_pickett Lord knows I wouldn't want to break up the team.
nikki_fernandez What happened to him?
john_locke Must have been an animal. Maybe one of the bears.
nikki_fernandez Are we gonna carry him back?
john_locke No. We're gonna bury him here.
desmond_hume Are we?
john_locke The people back in camp... there's just been a few too many funerals lately. Nobody needs to see him like this. I'll slip back to the beach and get a couple of shovels.
sayid_jarrah I'll come with you.
john_locke No I'll be back in an hour.
sayid_jarrah It's not safe to go alone, John!
john_locke I appreciate your concern.
sayid_jarrah So, what killed Eko?
john_locke Folks back at the beach call it "the Monster". I don't really have a name for it. You don't believe in monsters?
sayid_jarrah I believe in what I can see. But obviously you have. So, why don't you tell me what you think it is?
john_locke Might be what brought us here.
sayid_jarrah So, you think that this Monster decided that Eko was meant to die?
john_locke I believe that Eko died for a reason. I just don't know what it is yet.
sayid_jarrah That's why you lied? We're not headed back to the camp, are we, John?
john_locke Sure we are. Just need to take a little detour first.
danny_pickett Where is she?! Someone's on the grid. I want him on the ground , her, too . If he moves, you shoot him!
danny_pickett Yeah, they're here. The doctor get out again? You sure? Well, does he know? How the hell did she get over here?!
alex_rousseau Come on! Get up! Go!
danny_pickett Alex! Alex!
danny_pickett What the hell do you think you're doing?
alex_rousseau What, you gonna shoot me?
danny_pickett You know you're not supposed to be here. So let's just calm down...
alex_rousseau What did you do to him, Danny?! Where is he?! I wanna talk to Ben.
danny_pickett Sure, that sounds like a great idea. So why don't we just lower our little sling-
alex_rousseau WHERE IS HE?! Tell me!
alex_rousseau Get off of me!
danny_pickett Get her out of here. Get her OUT of here!
alex_rousseau Let me go! Listen, whatever they say, don't believe them! They're gonna kill your boyfriend just like they killed mine!
danny_pickett I don't understand. It's supposed to be two weeks.
dr_juliet_burke Our schedule's been moved up.
danny_pickett That's an order?
dr_juliet_burke It's coming from him.
danny_pickett It's stupid.
dr_juliet_burke It's not my call. It's the way it is, Danny.
danny_pickett Alright.
dr_juliet_burke I would like you to put this on, and come with me. Please.
kate_austen You think I'm going to put a hood over my head because you said please?
dr_juliet_burke No Kate. I think you're going to put a hood over your head because the man standing behind me, the one who's burning a hole in my back? That man is going to kill Sawyer. But if you put this on, and you come with me, there's something you can do for us that will save his life.
kate_austen Come in?
suzanne Oh, sweetheart. You're beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
kate_austen How is it out there?
suzanne There are a lot of excited policemen. Don't worry, I've asked them not to shoot their guns in there when you say "I do."
kate_austen You know, mother-in-laws aren't supposed to be so nice.
suzanne Monica, I have something for you.
kate_austen Suzanne, you shouldn't have.
suzanne My mother gave that to me on my wedding day. She told me one day I'd give it to my daughter. But, since I have four boys... here.
kate_austen It's perfect.
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 You know, Kevin's been coming to the church here since he's been about yea high. When I first met you Monica, I was struck by your honesty and devotion to Kevin. When I asked him what he loved most about you, he said "What you see, is what you get." That being said, you've got the rings, vowed your vows, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
dr_juliet_burke Step.
dr_juliet_burke I'll give you two some privacy.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. You Ok?
kate_austen Yeah. You?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm great. Where are they keeping you?
kate_austen Outside. In a cage.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer?
kate_austen He's in a cage, too. They're making us work.
dr_jack_shephard Work? On what?
kate_austen I dunno what it is, but it's big. We're hauling rocks, and...
dr_jack_shephard Hey. Did they hurt you?
dr_jack_shephard Kate, hey. Hey. It's gonna be alright.
kate_austen Jack. You have to do it. This thing that they told you, this operation.
kate_austen She said that if you do it that...
dr_jack_shephard What did they do to you?
kate_austen Jack...
dr_jack_shephard What did they do to you?
kate_austen Nothing!
dr_jack_shephard How did they get you to ask me?! What did they offer you?!
kate_austen Jack, please! Nothing!
dr_jack_shephard Then what are you doing here?!
kate_austen They're gonna kill Sawyer! I'm sorry!
kate_austen I'm so sorry! But she said that if you do it, and you do it soon, they'll let us go!
dr_jack_shephard And you believe them?
kate_austen I have to. Jack? Please...
dr_jack_shephard We're done here.
kate_austen Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Hey! We're done in here!
kate_austen Jack! I'm sorry!
ben_linus Get her out of there.
kate_austen Jack! Jack! Please!
kate_austen Hey, you.
kevin_callis Hey! What's for dinner, gorgeous?
kate_austen It's taco night.
kevin_callis You're making tacos?
kate_austen Yes, and you'd better like em.
kevin_callis Or what?
kate_austen Or no dessert. I'm leaving now, I'll be home soon.
kevin_callis Love you.
kate_austen I love you, too.
marshal_edward_mars Agent Mars.
kate_austen It's me.
marshal_edward_mars Well, I'm glad. I realized this morning that it was the Feast of the Assumption and I was feeling bad. How many holy days have come and gone since you last called? I thought you and I were friends?
kate_austen I don't want to run anymore.
marshal_edward_mars What's his name? Does he know who you are?
kate_austen Edward, please. I know you don't want to spend the rest of your life chasing me. Please, I love this guy. Just let me go.
marshal_edward_mars I'll tell you what. If you can really stay put? Really settle down? Then I'll stop chasing you. But you and I both know that's not gonna happen.
dr_juliet_burke Sawyer. You really care about him, huh?
kate_austen Where is he?
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry you weren't able to help us, Kate.
dr_juliet_burke Danny...
dr_juliet_burke Danny!
danny_pickett Right. Sorry, Jules. You got anything you wanna say to your girl? You best say it tonight.
james_ford And how was your day, honey?
john_locke When the hatch exploded, your prayer stick fell out of a tree right on top of me. So, Sayid and I came out to get it, because it didn't seem right to bury you without it. I'd like to think you died for a reason, Mr. Eko. I just hope that it's not too long before we find out what the heck it might be.
john_locke Rest in peace, Mr. Eko. Thank you for helping me find my...
kate_austen I saw Jack. They brought me in to see him. They want him to do surgery on Ben.
james_ford Who the hell is Ben?
kate_austen Henry. The guy who brought us in. He's sick. And they say that if he does it, they're gonna let us all go.
james_ford And you and me are what, bait?
kate_austen Something like that.
james_ford At least the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.
kate_austen I told him he had to.
james_ford Why the hell would you do something so stupid?!
kate_austen To save your life!
james_ford My life don't need saving!
kate_austen You want to die?! Because that's what's going to happen! Pickett is just waiting for his chance! I've seen him look at you!
james_ford Dammit, Freckles, stay put.
kate_austen And you know what he's going to do! So don't pretend like you don't care!
james_ford Get down, Freckles, we've already been through this.
kate_austen Shut up, James.
kate_austen You don't want Jack to save your life? Then you're gonna save your own. We're getting out of here now.
james_ford Stop it, dammit, Kate!
kate_austen Go! Get out of here, run!
james_ford You're out of your cage. Why don't you run, Kate?! Because me? I ain't running, 'cause there ain't no place to go.
kate_austen What are you talking about?
james_ford We ain't on our island. We're on another island, like Alcatraz, couple miles off shore. So unless you're a mermaid, or you got a boat, there ain't no point.
kate_austen When were you planning on telling me this?
james_ford Never.
kate_austen Why not?! Why wouldn't you?!
james_ford 'Cause I wanted you to believe we had a damn chance.
james_ford What was that for?
kate_austen I don't know. I don't know.
kevin_callis Very nice. OK, now it's your turn. Look under your placemat.
kate_austen What did you do?
kevin_callis Just look.
kate_austen What is it?
kevin_callis You know that honeymoon I've been promising you for 6 months? You are holding in your hand two tickets to Costa Rica. You got your passport ready, baby? Hey. What's wrong?
kate_austen Nothing. I just love you so much.
kevin_callis C'mere.
james_ford Lemme ask you something, Freckles. When Blockhead was beating on me, and you said "I love you." That was just... to get him to stop, right?
james_ford I love you, too.
dr_jack_shephard Who is this? Hello? Hello!
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode06 VOICE Try... the door.
ben_linus If it helps, I was surprised, too.
ben_linus If I were a betting man, I would have picked her and you.
dr_jack_shephard Shut up.
ben_linus Well. I suppose this would be the proverbial nail in my coffin, wouldn't it.
dr_jack_shephard Tomorrow.
ben_linus Sorry?
dr_jack_shephard Tomorrow morning. First thing. And everything I mentioned before. The instruments. The anesthesia. And someone who can hold a damn clamp.
ben_linus Yes. Of course.
dr_jack_shephard I'll get it out, your tumor. And I'll keep you alive. But I need your word. I need what you promised me before. I need to get the hell off this island.
ben_linus Done.
kate_austen Whatcha workin' on?
kevin_callis Just finishing some IRs, and that fugitive recovery in Tampa. Being a cop is just endless paperwork. Thank you, sweetie.
kate_austen What if I told you I was a fugitive? What if I told you I was on the run for blowing up my father, and it was only a matter of time before you found out?
kevin_callis This isn't funny.
kate_austen It's not a joke. I almost had a baby, Kevin. Me, a baby! I can't do this! Taco night?! I don't do taco night!
kevin_callis Ok, calm down, Monica...
kate_austen My name's not Monica! I love you. But I can't stay.
kevin_callis Whoah, hey...
kate_austen Kev...
kevin_callis Something's wrong with me.
kate_austen I drugged you.
kevin_callis You what?
kate_austen I had to. Otherwise they will think you knew. People are going to be asking a lot of questions and I didn't want you to lose your job.
kevin_callis Wait...
kate_austen No, Ke--
dr_jack_shephard This is going to be a very tricky procedure. If I tell you to do something, I need you to do it then and there, no questions asked.
dr_juliet_burke You may find this very hard to believe, but I've always been very good at just following orders.
dr_jack_shephard Is that a yes?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Let's go.
ben_linus Do you get nervous? Before you do surgery?
dr_jack_shephard I used to. Not anymore, no.
ben_linus Whatever happens, everything will be very different, won't it?
dr_jack_shephard No doubt about it.
ben_linus Juliet. Did Alex ask about me?
dr_juliet_burke No. We took her home last night. I don't know where she is now.
ben_linus Well, see you on the other side. I'm ready.
dr_jack_shephard I need you to count down from twenty.
ben_linus 20, 19...
dr_jack_shephard Scalpel.
danny_pickett Let's go.
jason Ben's just gone into surgery.
danny_pickett Ben just put his life in the hands of one of them! Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.
kate_austen Sawyer.
danny_pickett Well, well, well. Look who got out of her cage. You shoulda run when you had the chance. Let's go, James.
kate_austen Don't, please! You don't have to do this.
danny_pickett He's coming with me, and there's nothing you can do about it! Step away!
dr_jack_shephard Hand me another hemostat. Swab again.
dr_juliet_burke What happened? Is he Ok?
ivan His blood pressure's dropping. Should he be bleeding like that?
dr_jack_shephard Nope, no, he shouldn't.
dr_jack_shephard Back away from the table.
dr_juliet_burke Jack...
dr_jack_shephard Back away from the table! Now!
dr_jack_shephard Can you hear me in there?
tom_friendly Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Good. I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac. Now, if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead. Now get in here, and bring that walkie-talkie!
danny_pickett Step away!
danny_pickett You let go, or I do her too!
danny_pickett Let go!
kate_austen Don't you let go! Don't you think about it, Sawyer, you fight! No! Sawyer, NO!!
kate_austen No, NO!! Sawyer, PLEASE! You get your hands off of him!
danny_pickett Get on your knees!
kate_austen Please!! I'll do anything you want!
danny_pickett I want you to watch!
james_ford Close your eyes, Freckles.
kate_austen Stand up!
james_ford Close your eyes!
kate_austen NO! NO! NO!
danny_pickett This is for Colleen. You son-of-a-bitch!
tom_friendly Danny, you there? Pick it up. Pick it up, Danny. Pick it up, dammit!
danny_pickett I'm here, WHAT?!
tom_friendly Are you anywhere near the cages?
danny_pickett Yeah, you could say that.
tom_friendly Give your walkie to Kate.
danny_pickett Now why the hell would I do that?
tom_friendly Because if you don't, the doctor's gonna let Ben die!
danny_pickett What are you talkin' about? What's that beeping?
tom_friendly Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny! Do it. Just do it now!
danny_pickett Let go of her.
kate_austen Jack? Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Kate? You have about an hour headstart before they come after you.
kate_austen Where are you? Where are you?
dr_jack_shephard You remember what I told you on the beach? The day of the crash. You remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up? DO YOU REMEMBER IT?!
kate_austen YES! Yes, I remember!
dr_jack_shephard When you get safe, you radio me, and you tell that story.
kate_austen Jack, please.
dr_jack_shephard If I don't get a call from you in the next hour, I'm going to know something went wrong, and HE DIES!
kate_austen I can't leave without you!
dr_jack_shephard Yes, you are. Go!
kate_austen Jack! I can't!
dr_jack_shephard Go, now!
kate_austen I can't!
dr_jack_shephard Kate, dammit, RUN!
