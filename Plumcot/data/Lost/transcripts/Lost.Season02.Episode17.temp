HELEN So, what did I do to deserve this?
LOCKE What, can't a fella take his girl out for a picnic lunch just because?
HELEN Fella?
LOCKE That's right, fella.
HELEN Where are you taking me?
LOCKE I'm not telling, so just quit asking.
HELEN Can I be of any help?
LOCKE You just read your obituaries and drink your coffee and I'll take care of the everything.
HELEN Don't knock the obits -- the nicest part of the paper. No one ever says anything mean about people once they're dead.
LOCKE Mmm, and here I am thinking the funnies are the nicest part of the paper.
HELEN John? John, what's your father's name?
LOCKE Why?
HELEN Is it Anthony -- Anthony Cooper?
LOCKE Yes, that's right.
HELEN He's dead.
JACK Draw it again -- the map to your balloon.
GALE I was joking. I was making a joke. There's nothing out there besides my balloon. I was just frustrated. It was a stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.
LOCKE It's too late anyway. She's already long gone, Jack.
JACK So, what's done is done?
LOCKE That's right.
JACK Put him back in the armory. 
GALE Why do you let him talk to you like that? Hey, wait, I...
LOCKE Shut up!
GALE John, I'm sorry. John?
ANA Maybe he's wrong. We should search the other side of the cliff.
SAYID We've been searching for 3 hours. This balloon does not exist. Charlie!
ANA Then why did he draw the map?
SAYID You told him you would protect him whether we found this balloon or not. You've given him 2 more days to talk -- to figure how to escape. We're done. Charlie!!
CHARLIE Over here! This way! Sayid!
CHARLIE He said he buried her, right? His wife?
ANA Why isn't it raining here?
JACK Hurley, you seen Ana Lucia?
HURLEY She took off into the jungle with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.
JACK Yesterday -- they say anything about where they were going?
HURLEY Well, that would, like, assume that anyone actually tells me anything. Maybe if I were in the loop I could be more helpful.
JACK There is no loop, Hurley.
CLAIRE Excuse me, Jack. He's been really hot and fussy. Do you mind having a look at him?
JACK Yeah, sure, sure.
HURLEY Loop, dude, loop.
CLAIRE So, the fever's completely gone?
JACK Completely.
CLAIRE You're not just saying that, right? You seem a bit distracted.
JACK No, I'm fine. And so is Aaron.
CLAIRE Thanks.
LIBBY Doctor still in? I was grabbing for mussels in the tide pool -- pissed off a sea urchin.
JACK Well, it doesn't look infected. A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.
LIBBY Yeah, right, Neosporin. I think the current rate of exchange is 10 loads of laundry for a tube.
JACK Right.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 20 minutes to lockdown.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE ... 17 minutes to lockdown.
GALE What was that? John, what's the matter?
HELEN You sure you want to do this? We could just go on that picnic, you know.
LOCKE Soon, I promise.
HELEN Hey, maybe he left you his kidney?
FATHER CHUCK For we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will live with the Lord forever.
FATHER CHUCK We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to you, but we shall never be separated. And now we are united with Christ as we go toward him. Amen.
FATHER CHUCK Do you wish to say anything, John?
LOCKE I forgive you.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE ... please proceed... protocol... please proceed...
GALE John? Hey, you out there? What's that noise? John? What's going on? Talk to me.
LOCKE Will you be quiet!
GALE Tell me what's happening, what the hell is...
LOCKE Will you shut up!!
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
GALE Maybe you should get Jack?
LOCKE I said, shut up!!!
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE 2, 1.
GALE What happened?
HURLEY I bet 4 papayas.
SAWYER You can't bet; I just bet. You can either call or raise or lay 'em down, Muttonchops.
KATE Don't look at me.
JACK Lay 'em down, Hurley. He's got you beat.
HURLEY Dude, I got a killer hand, here.
JACK No, you don't.
HURLEY But you don't even know...
JACK You've a baby straight. He's got the flush.
KATE What about me? What do I got?
JACK Hard to say, but you're just playing for the fun of it.
KATE Well, fun's not bad. You should try it sometime.
JACK Don't call him, Hurley.
SAWYER Hey, Amarillo Slim -- you think because you watch poker on TV you can tussle with the big boys?
JACK I've got to head back to the Hatch.
SAWYER Hatch ain't going nowhere, Doc. How about you put your mangoes where your mouth is?
JACK I guess I could play a hand or two.
GALE Hey, what's going on?
GALE Are you still out there? John? John?
LOCKE I'm here.
GALE What were those noises?! What's wrong?! Did something...
LOCKE Nothing is wrong!
NADIA So what's the verdict, Mr. Locke?
LOCKE The seismic bolting is all first rate; there's no visible mold, no dry rot. It'll all be in my report, but I think you and your husband got a pretty nice house.
NADIA If I had a husband I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.
LOCKE If you'll just sign this invoice.
COOPER Hello, son.
LOCKE What do you want?
COOPER Look, John, I know what I did to you was wrong.
LOCKE You stole my kidney.
COOPER I was dying.
LOCKE You could've asked me. You could have just asked me. What do you want from me?
COOPER I killed myself off because there are 2 men out there who were going to beat me to it.
LOCKE What'd you do, steal their livers?
COOPER No, I took them for 700,000 dollars -- retirement con. I put the money in a safe deposit box, but these 2 guys may be sitting on the bank to see if I show my face -- which is why I need you to go in there and get it for me.
LOCKE You think I'm stupid?
COOPER I want you to take 200 grand of it. It won't make up for what I did to you, but it's the best I can do. I'll be at the Flightline motel -- it's out by the airport -- until tomorrow afternoon. Then I'm gone, money or no money. And, John, if I don't see you again? I'll understand.
LOCKE We're locked in.
GALE What?
LOCKE These blast doors came down. The whole living area is sealed off. I can't get out.
GALE Did you try to pry...
LOCKE Yeah, but I couldn't -- maybe, maybe if the 2 of us.
GALE You want me to help you?
LOCKE Yeah.
GALE And if I do help you get these doors up then you're just going to lock me back in here, aren't you?
LOCKE That's right.
GALE Then I'm going to need your word, John. I'm going to need your word that you won't let your people do anything to me.
LOCKE Well, if you're who you say you are then what are you worried about?
GALE Things have happened to them -- things that I have nothing to do with. But they've got no one to blame except for me. So I'm going to need your word that you'll protect me, no matter what.
LOCKE Who are you?
GALE My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. And I crashed on this island just like you.
LOCKE Alright, you have my word.
HURLEY Dude, you got me.
KATE I'm out.
SAWYER Think you're in my head, Doc?
JACK You've still got 3 papayas -- call or fold.
SAWYER Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand. Pocket queens makes me the set. 
JACK King's wired.
HURLEY Whoa, dude.
JACK But at least I'm not in your head. Well, I guess that's it.
SAWYER What do you mean, "it"?
JACK Sawyer, you're busted. I got it all. It wouldn't really be fair for you to go pick more mangoes.
SAWYER Oh, I've got a hell of lot more than mangoes. You want to play real stakes, name 'em?
JACK It's a pile of fruit, man.
SAWYER And I want it back.
KATE Should I go and get a ruler?
SAWYER Fun time's over, Mongo. Why don't you go hit the buffet?
HURLEY But, I want to...
KATE Come on, Hurley. Let's go leave these boys to their sandbox.
SAWYER One more hand, Doc. What's it going to take?
JACK The medicine you stole from the armory, all of it.
LOCKE Let's go. Harder.
GALE I'm losing it.
LOCKE The tool box. Get the tool box -- that'll hold it.
GALE You sure?
LOCKE Get it! Come on, put it under.
GALE John, John, wait, don't just...
LOCKE You have to stop the door. Put something else under the door. Come on, come on.
LOCKE Stack 'em, stack 'em. You have to stop the pressure. Come on, come on, come on.
GALE Alright, alright, let's get you out. Come on.
LOCKE No, no, stop, stop, stop!
GALE Alright, we'll wait 'til somebody comes down. Alright? It's only a matter of time, yeah?
LOCKE No we don't have time.
LOCKE Honey, put on your Sunday best! I'm taking you out to paint...
HELEN John, we have visitors.
HELEN Um, these men say they knew your father.
BANE Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.
LOCKE I'm sure Helen told you I didn't really know him...
BANE She told me. But I'd like to ask you a couple questions if that's okay.
LOCKE Sure, of course.
BANE Have you seen your father since he died, Mr. Locke?
LOCKE Wh-have-have I...?
BANE Well, we were thinking possibly he's not dead, and maybe you know that? I mean, for his son, you didn't look too shook up at his funeral.
HELEN How dare you? If you had any idea what that man did to him -- what that son-of-bitch...
LOCKE Helen, hey Helen.
HELEN We were there to get past him, to get on with our lives, to let him go. Get out of here.
LOCKE Helen, hey.
BANE Okay. Okay, just one thing before we go. What's in the bag, John?
LOCKE Work papers and stuff. I'm a home inspector.
BANE You won't mind if we take a look?
BANE Well, there you go. Thanks for the coffee, miss. 
LOCKE Helen, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
HELEN Were you lying to those men, John?
LOCKE No, I was scared. I was -- I was scared.
SAWYER So, where'd you learn to play cards, Doc?
JACK Phuket.
SAWYER What the hell were you doing in Thailand? What, you don't think I know where Phuket is? Just because I dropped out in 9th grade don't make me an idiot. Far East, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for a world traveler. That where you got the art on your shoulder?
JACK How about you deal again?
SAWYER What?
JACK This time from the top of the deck.
SAWYER Well, I had to try.
GALE What does it do?
LOCKE We're not exactly sure.
GALE And you push it...
LOCKE Every 108 minutes, yeah.
GALE How soon does this alarm go off?
LOCKE Very -- which is why I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
GALE Grate's bolted shut. I tried it.
LOCKE There's another grate in the pantry. You can get up through there. Take the vent into the dome.
GALE Maybe we should wait.
LOCKE We can't wait; it's going to go off any minute. I trusted you, Henry, now you've got to trust me. That button has to be pushed.
GALE Okay, what do I do?
LOCKE Once you're inside, you'll hear the alarm beeping, and you just have to enter the Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, and then you press execute. It has to be exactly those numbers in exactly that order. Now do you...
GALE 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. I got it.
LOCKE Can you reach it?!
GALE I think so.
LOCKE Be careful!
LOCKE Henry?!
LOCKE Henry?!
LIBBY What's going on?
HURLEY Jack and Sawyer are finally going to beat each other up.
JACK 10 mangoes.
SAWYER Okay, I'll call you with the aspirin and raise you with a bottle of Amoxicilin.
JACK Do you even know what Amoxicilin is?
SAWYER You may have been to Phuket, Doc, but I've been to Tallahassee. Let's just say something was burning and it wasn't from the sunshine.
JACK I'm all in.
SAWYER Well, that's the move of a man who wants me to lay it down.
JACK You're not going to lay it down.
SAWYER I'm not, huh? Why's that?
JACK Because there's a bunch of people watching us right now and you don't want them to see you lose. Again.
SAWYER Well alright, I call. What you got? Pair a 9s? You pushed in with a pair of 9's?!
JACK You got me. Let's see 'em.
JACK Guess it was enough, huh?
SAWYER Son-of-a-bitch.
JACK I'll come get the meds later. 
SAWYER Hey, when I asked you what you wanted for stakes -- why didn't you ask for the guns?
JACK When I need the guns, I'll get the guns.
LOCKE Henry, get up, damn it. Henry! Henry, are you alright?
GALE What happened?
LOCKE Listen to me, you have to get up into the vents and enter the numbers in the computer.
GALE How long was I...
LOCKE Please, you have to go right now; we're running out of time!
GALE Okay, yeah.
LOCKE Be careful!
LOCKE Henry?! Henry, can you hear me?
LOCKE Henry? Henry?
COOPER Yeah, who is it?
LOCKE It's John. Can I come in?
COOPER Yeah, of course.
COOPER Any problems.
LOCKE Nope.
COOPER Your date at my funeral -- she got a name?
LOCKE Helen.
COOPER That's a nice name -- pretty girl, too.
LOCKE I'm, uh, I'm going to ask her to marry me -- tonight, actually.
COOPER Well, good for you. Congratulations.
LOCKE Yeah, thanks.
COOPER Your share -- should buy you a nice honeymoon.
LOCKE I didn't do this for the money.
COOPER Then why did you do it? Well, alright, um -- my plane, I gotta -- I gotta cab waiting. If you don't want the cash, the maid's going to get a hell of a tip. Bye, John.
HELEN Are you him?
COOPER Listen, sweetheart...
HELEN How could you? How could you do this to him? We were moving past this.
LOCKE Helen, wait. Helen, wait, you don't understand. I was going to tell you everything.
HELEN You lied to me.
LOCKE No, please, I can explain.
HELEN You looked me right in the eye and you lied to me! You made your choice, John. You need his love more than mine.
LOCKE No, my choice is you. I was going to -- I love you. No, please. Please, Helen. I love you and I want to spend my life with you and, and I can't live without you. Helen, so -- so, will you marry me?
LOCKE Helen.
LOCKE Henry! Henry!!
LOCKE Please say something.
LOCKE Henry!
LOCKE Henry? Anybody here?
LOCKE Is anybody here? Henry!
LOCKE You came back.
GALE What, did you think I was going to leave you here? Come on, can you stand?
LOCKE I don't -- I think so. Thank you, Henry. Thank you for not leaving me.
GALE You're welcome, John.
KATE Hey, hey, Jack. Wait up. You heading up to the Hatch?
JACK Yeah.
KATE Mind if I join? It's been a while since I had a shower and I was just hoping that...
JACK Actually, the plumbing's busted.
KATE Busted?
JACK Yeah, water's been running muddy. I guess we've got a cracked pipe but it's going to take some time to find it.
KATE Oh, well, I guess I wasted a trip, then.
JACK Well, I'll let you know as soon as we get things worked out down there.
KATE Right. I'm glad you beat Sawyer.
JACK You know what? The Hatch can wait until morning -- if you'd like me to walk you back to the beach.
KATE Do you see that?
JACK Yeah.
JACK It's a parachute.
JACK Wait.
KATE It's food.
CHARLIE What the bloody hell is that?
JACK What'd you find?
GALE I've got you, easy, easy.
GALE Sorry.
LOCKE What did you do -- what did you do to end it -- to make the doors go up?
GALE I did what you told me to. I punched in the code and pressed the execute button, but nothing happened other than that clock flipping back. I was climbing back into the vent when the lights went out. 10 seconds later the doors went up. I didn't do anything.
LOCKE You think it was all just random?
GALE Don't look at me; it's your hatch.
JACK Get away from him.
GALE Wait, you don't...
SAYID Step back, right now.
LOCKE Sayid, it's okay.
JACK I said, "get away"!
LOCKE I let him out -- some kind of lockdown or something -- he, he was helping me.
GALE Couldn't you find my balloon?
ANA Yeah, we found it.
SAYID We did find your balloon, Henry Gale, exactly how you described it. We also found the grave you described -- your wife's grave. The grave you said you dug with your own bare hands. It was all there. Your whole story -- your alibi -- it was true. But still I did not believe it to be true. So I dug up that grave and found that there was not a woman inside. There was a man. A man named Henry Gale.
