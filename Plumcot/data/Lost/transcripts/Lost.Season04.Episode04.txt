john_locke These are the last two eggs.
ben_linus From my own bookshelf.
john_locke Help you pass the time.
ben_linus I've already read it.
john_locke You might catch something you missed the second time around.
ben_linus Why did you move me from the rec room down here?
john_locke I wanted you under my own roof.
ben_linus Where are you keeping your other prisoner? Miles, is it?
ben_linus Oh, you don't wanna share.
john_locke Actually, I was hoping you would share, Ben. Seeing as you claim to have a spy on his ship.
ben_linus I feel for you, John. I really do. You keep hitting dead ends.
ben_linus You couldn't find the cabin, you can't make contact with Jacob — you're so desperate to figure out what to do next, you're even asking me for help. So here we are, just like old times. Except I'm locked in a different room, and you're more lost than you ever were.
john_locke I know what you're trying to do. It's not going to work.
ben_linus Excellent, John! You're evolving!
john_locke Done with your breakfast?
kate_austen What was that all about?
claire_littleton Who knows? It's Locke.
james_ford Mornin', ladies.
claire_littleton Good morning.
kate_austen Mornin'.
james_ford Mmm, the coffee smells good.
claire_littleton Well, why don't I go make you a cup?
james_ford Kinda weird, ain't it? Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs? By the way, I found some clothes about your size, in the closet. So after I kick out Hugo—
kate_austen I'm not moving in with you, James.
james_ford Well. Then why did you stay?
kate_austen That's none of your business.
james_ford Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh? Well, if you're spying for Jack—
kate_austen I'm not spying for anyone.
james_ford So why don't you tell me why—
kate_austen Because I don't trust you.
james_ford This is about the pregnancy.
kate_austen James?
james_ford Yeah.
kate_austen Go home.
james_ford Okay, fine. See you later then.
duncan_forrester You ready?
kate_austen Is there a back entrance?
duncan_forrester Yeah, but you're going in the front door, with your head held high, okay?
kate_austen Yeah. Okay. Let's do this.
duncan_forrester Let us through. Folks, we're not making any statements or answering any questions right now. Thank you.
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode04 MAN IN CROWD We hate you!
bailiff The people vs. Katherine Anne Austen, the honorable Arthur Galzethron presiding.
judge GALZETHRON Bailiff will read the counts. Will the defendant please rise?
bailiff Katherine Anne Austen, you are charged with fraud, arson, assault on a federal officer, assault with a deadly weapon, grand larceny, grand theft auto, and murder in the first degree. Ms. Austen, how do you plead?
kate_austen Not guilty.
judge Thus entered. I will now hear the argument on the bail.
melissa_dunbrook Your honor, we are requesting that the defendant be remanded into custody for the duration of the trial.
duncan_forrester Your honor, my client's been free pending arraignment, now suddenly she's a flight risk?
melissa_dunbrook She's the very definition of a flight risk.
duncan_forrester She is one of the most recognizable faces in America. Where's she going to run?
judge Ms. Austen, based on your prior history, I'm inclined to agree with the people. You are hereby remanded into federal custody for the duration of your trial.
duncan_forrester Your honor—
judge Bailiff, please take the defendant into custody.
duncan_forrester Sorry.
jinsoo_kwon Al-ber-kerke.
sunhwa_kwon Too hot.
jinsoo_kwon New York.
sunhwa_kwon Too many people.
jinsoo_kwon 서울보다 더 많아?
sunhwa_kwon 서울이 어때서요?
jinsoo_kwon 자기야, 이제 우리는 이 섬을 곧 떠날텐데...
jinsoo_kwon I learn English...for you...to live...in...America.
sunhwa_kwon 글쎄... 나는... 내 아기는 내가 자란 한국에서 키우고 싶어요.
jinsoo_kwon 우리 애기.
dr_jack_shephard This is, uh, Charlotte, and Dan. Their helicopter already took Sayid and Desmond back to their freighter. They can make arrangements to get all of us off this island.
sunhwa_kwon Where's Kate?
dr_jack_shephard She stayed with Locke.
john_locke Hello, Kate.
kate_austen You got blood...
john_locke I just killed a chicken. What can I do for you?
kate_austen I want to talk to Miles. Where are you keeping him?
john_locke Why do you need to talk to him?
kate_austen It's personal.
john_locke No.
kate_austen And what gives you the right to decide whether or not—
john_locke You may think this is a democracy, Kate, because of the way Jack ran things, but this is not a democracy.
kate_austen Then I guess that makes it a dictatorship.
john_locke If I was a dictator, I would just shoot you and go about my day. Dinner's at six if you're hungry.
kate_austen Hey Hurley! You bringing that to Miles?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
kate_austen Well, Locke asked me to do it.
hugo_reyes Cool. That dude creeps me out.
kate_austen He's still in the rec room, right?
hugo_reyes No, we moved him to the boathouse that... You just totally Scooby-Dood me, didn't you.
kate_austen Sorry.
hugo_reyes You're not going to let him go, are you?
kate_austen No. No, I promise.
hugo_reyes Just don't tell Locke it was me.
miles_straume So the Arab traded you too, huh?
kate_austen Do you know who I am?
miles_straume Excuse me?
kate_austen Do you know who I am. Do you know what I did?
miles_straume What did you do?
kate_austen Answer the question.
miles_straume Okay. I'll tell you what you wanna know. But you gotta do something for me first.
kate_austen I'm not letting you go.
miles_straume I don't wanna be let go. I'm exactly where I wanna be. What I want, is one minute of someone's time. You bring him to me, and I will tell you everything I know about you.
kate_austen Who?
miles_straume Who do you think?
duncan_forrester You okay?
kate_austen Yeah, I'm fine.
duncan_forrester Listen. The D.A.'s decided to try this case herself. Which means they're gonna do the full-court press. Now we need to start talking about cutting a deal.
kate_austen What kind of deal?
duncan_forrester Honestly, my best guess, I'd say...she'll take a fifteen year sentence, and you serve seven.
kate_austen No way.
duncan_forrester If you go to trial, Kate, you're looking at twenty years on each count, not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge.
kate_austen No.
duncan_forrester Kate, you confessed to your mother that you killed your father. And now, she's their star witness. So you tell me, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to win this thing?
kate_austen Put me on the stand.
duncan_forrester And take a chance with the D.A. crossing you, no. The way I see, we've got one shot at this.
kate_austen What's that?
duncan_forrester We make it about character. Not about what you did or didn't do, but about who you are.
kate_austen What do you mean who I am?
duncan_forrester I want him in the courtroom.
kate_austen Absolutely not.
duncan_forrester We need him, Kate. It will generate tremendous sympathy—
kate_austen Duncan, listen to me. You are not bringing him in here. Alright, you want to make this about me, about my character, fine. You are not using my son.
dr_juliet_burke Maybe you should try a number other than the boat, like 911.
sunhwa_kwon What's wrong?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing. I'm just having some trouble getting a hold of their boat.
sunhwa_kwon You haven't heard from Sayid? You said they left yesterday!
dr_jack_shephard And I'm sure they're fine.
sunhwa_kwon What if Locke was right? What if these people are here to hurt us?
dr_jack_shephard Locke has no idea what he's doing.
sunhwa_kwon Then why is Kate with him?
kate_austen You sure he's got Ben in the basement?
claire_littleton Uh-huh. I saw Rousseau take him in there last night.
kate_austen Does Locke ever go out?
claire_littleton No, he's been in there cooking all day. He invited us all over for dinner.
claire_littleton Oh, can you get Aaron for me?
claire_littleton Just pick him up and rock him a little bit.
kate_austen Um...yeah, I'm just not very good with babies. I wouldn't want him to get more upset.
claire_littleton Here, I got it.
claire_littleton Ohhh...it's okay. There we go, muffin. There we go.
kate_austen You're so good with him.
kate_austen What?
claire_littleton Just...the last thing I thought I'd be good at was being a mum. You know, you should try it sometime.
bailiff Please rise.
bailiff Court is now in session. Please be seated.
duncan_forrester Don't fire me, okay?
kate_austen What?
duncan_forrester We got killed in the opening. I had to do this.
judge Does the defense have a witness?
duncan_forrester Yes we do, your honor. The defense calls Dr. Jack Shephard to the witness stand.
melissa_dunbrook Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness on the basis of relevance.
judge And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection. You have to be aware that this witness did not meet the defendant until after the alleged crimes she's been charged with. He is to be viewed as a character witness only. Proceed.
bailiff Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
duncan_forrester Dr. Shephard. Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if there are any of you who don't read the newspapers or the internet or watch television, how you met the defendant?
dr_jack_shephard Um... on September 22, 2004, Kate uh, Ms. Austen, and I were both passengers on Oceanic Flight 815, which crash-landed on an island in the South Pacific.
duncan_forrester Were you aware that Ms. Austen was a fugitive being transported by a United States marshal on that flight to Los Angeles for trial?
dr_jack_shephard I did learn that eventually, yes.
duncan_forrester From the U.S. Marshal?
dr_jack_shephard No, the marshal died in the crash. I never spoke to him. Ms. Austen told me.
duncan_forrester Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?
dr_jack_shephard No. Never.
duncan_forrester Well, that seems like a reasonable question. Why not?
dr_jack_shephard I just assumed that there had been some kind of mistake.
duncan_forrester And why would you think that?
dr_jack_shephard Only eight of us survived the crash. We landed in the water. I was hurt, pretty badly. In fact, if it weren't for her, I would have never made it to the shore. She took care of me. She took care of all of us. She — she gave us first aid, water, found food, made shelter. She tried to save the other two, but they didn't—
kate_austen Stop.
judge Ms. Austen, please sit down.
kate_austen This has nothing to do with... with anything. This is my trial, and I don't want him to say anything else.
duncan_forrester That's fine. I have no more questions, your honor.
judge Ms. Dunbrook, bear witness.
melissa_dunbrook That was very moving, Dr. Shephard. I only have one question for you. Do you love the defendant?
duncan_forrester Objection!
judge You opened this door, Mr. Forrester, I'm going to allow it.
melissa_dunbrook Doctor Shephard, do you love Ms. Austen?
dr_jack_shephard No. Not anymore.
hugo_reyes So... what do you wanna watch? Xanadu or Satan's Doom?
james_ford I'm reading.
TV#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode04 "They call it Xanadu..."
james_ford Turn that thing down, dammit!
hugo_reyes Sorry.
james_ford Hey.
kate_austen Can I come in?
james_ford Sure. I believe you know my roommate.
kate_austen Hey Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hey Kate.
james_ford Got something in your eye, Hugo? Why don't we talk in the kitchen?
james_ford I know it's in a box, but, uh, it's pretty damn good wine. I tested it. So, how's life in Casa de Claire? Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?
kate_austen No, no, he's a good sleeper.
james_ford Good for you.
james_ford You are terrible at this, Freckles.
kate_austen Terrible at what?
james_ford You already said you didn't stay behind for me. So at least be woman enough to tell me you want to use me for something.
kate_austen I want to use you for something.
james_ford See? Wasn't that hard. For what?
kate_austen For Ben. I want you to help me bust him out.
james_ford Wanna play some backgammon?
john_locke You're on.
john_locke Do you think I know what I'm doing?
james_ford Huh?
john_locke Do you regret following me out here? Are you worried about what we should do next?
james_ford All I know is that I'd be a lot more worried if I was sitting on that beach.
john_locke And the rest of the group, what are they saying?
james_ford I think they're saying "Baa."
james_ford That's the nice thing about sheep. They're predictable. But I ain't so sure about Kate.
john_locke What do you mean?
james_ford I need your word you ain't going to do nothing to her.
john_locke Why would I do anything to her?
james_ford Just give me your word, John. You know what? Forget it.
john_locke No, no, no, alright. You have my word.
james_ford She came to me about an hour ago. Said she wanted my help busting Ben out of your basement.
john_locke Why?
james_ford She talked to that guy... Bruce Lee from the freighter, the guy you've got locked up. He told her to bring Ben down to him for a chat.
john_locke No, that's impossible. She doesn't even know where Miles is.
james_ford What, the boathouse down by the dock? If Hugo knows, everybody knows.
john_locke Are you sure about this?
james_ford Yeah, I'm sure.
james_ford Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going with that?
john_locke Whatever Miles has to say to Ben, he can say to me.
james_ford Son of a bitch.
kate_austen Come on.
kate_austen You got one minute. Go.
miles_straume How about some privacy?
kate_austen Fifty-five seconds!
miles_straume Do you know who I am?
ben_linus Yes.
miles_straume Do you know who I work for?
ben_linus Yes.
miles_straume Then you know he's put a lot of time and energy into finding you. So now I've found you. And I can tell him exactly where you are. Or I can lie, and tell him you were already dead. I'd be willing to do that, for 3.2 million dollars.
ben_linus You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?
miles_straume It's extortion if you want to get technical.
ben_linus 3.2? But why not 3.3 or 3.4?
ben_linus What makes you think I have access to that kind of money?
miles_straume Do not treat me like I'm one of them! Like I don't know who you are, or what you can do!
ben_linus Your friend Charlotte has seen me, she knows I'm alive.
miles_straume I'll take care of Charlotte. You just worry about getting me the money. You have two days.
ben_linus My present situation is a little bit restricted. Can that be amended?
miles_straume Okay. One week, in cash.
kate_austen Time's up.
miles_straume Don't even think about it!
kate_austen I said time's up!
miles_straume Ooh, this is hot.
kate_austen You got your meeting, now I want my answer.
miles_straume We got your name when you called the freighter. Of course we know about you and everybody else on the 815 manifest.
kate_austen Then prove it.
miles_straume Your name is Katherine Anne Austen, and you're wanted for murder, fraud, arson and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember. You're a fugitive. You got caught in Australia and the feds were bringing you back. So yeah, we know. If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island. Who knows, maybe you didn't survive the crash.
kate_austen Come on.
john_locke Go back to your house, Kate.
kate_austen John, this has nothing to do with you—
john_locke Go back to your house, Kate!
claire_littleton Hey. You okay?
kate_austen I couldn't sleep.
claire_littleton Yeah. The beds take a little getting used to.
kate_austen I didn't wake Aaron up, did I?
claire_littleton No. Aaron was born on this island, he can sleep through anything.
claire_littleton John. What are you doing?
john_locke I'd like a moment alone with Kate. Would you excuse us, please, Claire?
kate_austen It's okay.
kate_austen John, I—
john_locke I don't need to know why you did what you did, Kate. I just need to know what they said to each other.
kate_austen Miles told Ben that he would lie to the people he worked for on the boat, tell them that Ben was dead for 3.2 million dollars.
john_locke Hmm.
kate_austen Listen, John. I'm sorry. I asked you where he was—
john_locke You're not welcome here anymore. I want you gone by morning.
duncan_forrester I worked it out so you two could have a few minutes of privacy.
kate_austen I don't need any privacy.
duncan_forrester You need to talk to her, Kate. I'll be outside.
diane_janssen Hello, Katherine. Was it true, what he said? Dr. Shephard. That you're a hero.
diane_janssen Why won't you talk to me?
kate_austen Because, mom, the last time I tried to talk to you, when you got sick? When I risked my life to see you, you screamed for help and called the police!
diane_janssen Please. I don't want to fight with you, Katherine.
kate_austen Why are you here?
diane_janssen Because I... It all changed, when I thought you were dead. My doctors have given me six months to live for the last four years. I don't know how long I'm going to last. So I came here to tell you that I don't want to testify against you.
kate_austen Then don't.
diane_janssen I want to see my grandson.
kate_austen You came here to make a deal?
diane_janssen I just want to meet him.
kate_austen I don't want you anywhere near him. We're finished! We're finished!
james_ford Oh hey, Freckles. You okay? Listen, look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothing. I wanted him to think that you'd fooled me too. No sense in him not trusting both of us.
kate_austen He wants me gone by tomorrow.
james_ford What, he banished you? Well, I unbanish you. You can stay right here. This is my house.
james_ford Okay, me and Montezuma's house. You're gonna be alright. I'll keep you safe.
dr_charlotte_lewis Time. Okay, tell me. What do you remember?
dr_daniel_faraday Uh...queen of diamonds? Then uh...six! Of clubs. Sorry. And then we have the red ten of...hearts, maybe?
dr_charlotte_lewis It's two out of three. It's not bad. It's progress.
dr_daniel_faraday Three cards, Charlotte. Is that progress?
dr_jack_shephard Hey. I've been calling your boat all day. Why isn't anyone answering?
dr_charlotte_lewis We're here, how should we know? If they're not answering, they're probably--
dr_jack_shephard Are you telling me there is only one line on that boat?
dr_charlotte_lewis There is another number that we're only supposed to use in emergencies.
dr_juliet_burke It's an emergency.
dr_jack_shephard Put it on speaker.
regina Yeah?
dr_charlotte_lewis Regina, it's Charlotte.
regina Why are you calling me on this number?
dr_charlotte_lewis Minkowski wasn't answering. The people on the island want to talk to their friends, make sure they're alright.
regina What friends?
dr_charlotte_lewis They left last night! Frank took them up in the helicopter.
regina What do you mean they took off? I thought the helicopter was with you.
john_locke Morning.
miles_straume Listen. I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're wasting your time—
john_locke Open your mouth. Open your mouth.
john_locke Wide. Don't talk, bite down, bite down.
john_locke I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day, I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself. My name is John Locke, and I'm responsible for the well-being of this island. Eventually, Miles, you're going to tell me who you are, you're going to tell me about the people on the boat, and you're going to tell me why you're so interested in Ben. In the meantime, however, you're going to keep your mouth shut. I learned something yesterday. No use in having rules if there's no punishment for breaking them. You'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger. Enjoy your breakfast.
kate_austen Wait, wait, wait a minute. Just slow down.
james_ford Oh, come on! It's not like we ain't never done it before. Now, I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night. I get it. You were sad. But I mean, how can you resist after that whole "I'll keep you safe" thing?
kate_austen No, Sawyer.
james_ford What? What, what'd I say?
kate_austen Forget it.
james_ford Alright. You still think you might be pregnant.
kate_austen I'm not worried. And I'm not pregnant.
james_ford Are you sure?
kate_austen Yeah, I'm sure.
james_ford I mean, whoo!
kate_austen Would it have been the worst thing in the world?
james_ford Yes, yes it would have been the worst thing in the world. What would we have done with a baby?
kate_austen I'm going back to the beach.
james_ford Beach? What, you're leaving? Because of this? That's that? You crawl up in my bed one second, and the next you just—
kate_austen Goodbye, James.
james_ford Don't make this about me, Kate. You didn't want a baby any more than I did. You're just looking for some excuse to split, and now you got one. But it's alright, Freckles, I ain't gonna hold it against you. I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed. Because in about a week, you'll find some reason to get pissed at Jack and bounce right back to me.
judge Ms. Dunbrook? Are the people ready to proceed?
melissa_dunbrook May we approach the bench, your honor?
judge Oh, please.
melissa_dunbrook Unfortunately, your honor, our chief witness, Diane Janssen, the mother of the defendant, is unable to testify because of medical reasons.
judge How long will you need?
melissa_dunbrook I can't say right now.
judge What I'm going to do is grant a recess for lunch, but be ready to proceed with the case after we return. (to all) This court is now in recess.
bailiff All rise.
melissa_dunbrook We have to talk.
melissa_dunbrook My key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday, and now she's got cold feet.
duncan_forrester Quit posturing, and let's get to it. What are you offering?
melissa_dunbrook Four years in.
duncan_forrester No jail time. Kate Austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other people's lives after a plane crash, and nearly starved to death on a deserted island. And after all that, you put this woman on trial for rescuing her mother from an abusive husband. If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time, then you must have a hell of a closing, Melissa.
melissa_dunbrook Alright. Time served plus ten year's probation in agreement that she does not leave the state.
duncan_forrester What does that matter? She can go anywhere she—
kate_austen No, I'll take it.
duncan_forrester No, wait, Kate--
kate_austen Give me something to sign and I'll sign it. And then I walk out the back door. I just...I just want this to be over.
melissa_dunbrook I can do that. Ten years probation, and you stay put.
kate_austen I have a child. I'm not going anywhere.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen How did you know I'd be here?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, your lawyer gave me the heads up. He owed me one.
kate_austen Thank you for saying what you did.
dr_jack_shephard You're welcome.
kate_austen You know, Jack, I've heard you say that story so many times, I'm starting to think you believe it.
dr_jack_shephard I just...I just wanted to tell you that what I said in there...I didn't mean it.
kate_austen Do you want to follow me? Come by for a visit?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, I actually have to get over to the hospital. But um...maybe you and I could grab some coffee together or something.
kate_austen I know why you don't want to see the baby, Jack. But until you do...until you want to, there's no you and me going for coffee. But um...if at anytime you change your mind, come and see us.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Okay.
kate_austen Bye.
dr_jack_shephard Bye.
kate_austen Hello?
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode04 Kate! I'm so glad you're back. He missed you so much.
kate_austen Did you keep him away from the TV?
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode04 Absolutely. I just put him down for a nap.
kate_austen Hey buddy. Hey.
kate_austen Hey.
aaron Hi mommy.
kate_austen Hi, Aaron.
