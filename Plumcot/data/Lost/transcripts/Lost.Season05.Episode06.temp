HURLEY Help! Anyone!
HURLEY Help, Jack!
HURLEY Help! Anyone!
HURLEY Help!
HURLEY Help!
HURLEY Help!
HURLEY Help!
JACK It's okay. You're okay. Relax.
HURLEY Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!
JACK Okay.
HURLEY Oh, my God!
JACK We can stand.
HURLEY What?
JACK We can stand.
HURLEY Oh. Oh, my God. It really happened.
JACK Kate. Kate. Kate, can you hear me?
KATE Oh. Jack?
JACK Are you okay?
KATE Are we...
JACK Yeah. We're back.
KATE What happened?
ELOISE I thought I said all of them.
BEN This is all I could get on short notice.
ELOISE Guess it'll have to do for now. All right. Let's get started.
ELOISE Shall we?
JACK What is this place?
ELOISE The DHARMA Initiative called it the Lamp Post. This is how they found the island.
JACK Did you know about this place?
BEN No. No, I didn't.
JACK Is he telling the truth?
ELOISE Probably not.
ELOISE Aha. Here we go.
ELOISE All right. I apologize if this is confusing, but... Let's pay attention, yes? The room we're standing in was constructed years ago over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy. That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world. The people who built this room, however, were only interested in one.
SUN The Island.
ELOISE Yes. The island. They'd gathered proof that it existed. They knew it was out there somewhere, but they just couldn't find it. Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum on the theoretical notion that they should stop looking for where the island was supposed to be and start looking for where it was going to be.
JACK What do you mean, "Where it was going to be"?
ELOISE Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly, as it turned out, that the Island was always moving. Why do you think you were never rescued? Now while the movements of the Island seem random, this man and his team created a series of equations which tell us, with a high degree of probability, where it is going to be at a certain point... in time. Windows, as it were, that while open, provide a route back. Unfortunately, these windows don't stay open for very long. Yours closes... in 36 hours. 
DESMOND Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the Island? Willingly?
SUN Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?
DESMOND I came here to deliver a message. Daniel Faraday—your son—sent me here. He wanted me to tell you that he and all the people on the Island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. He said you.
ELOISE But I am helping, dear.
DESMOND Consider the message delivered.
ELOISE I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Desmond, but the Island isn't done with you yet.
DESMOND This woman cost me four years of my life—four years that I'll never get back because you told me that I was supposed to go to the Island! That it was my bloody purpose! You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully. These people—they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, and we are just the pieces. Whatever she tells you to do... ignore it. You say the Island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the Island.
ELOISE Jack... the binder in your hands shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates where I believe the Island will be in little more than a day from now. There's a commercial airliner flying from L.A. to Guam. It's going to go right through our window. Ajira Airways, Flight 316. If you have any hope of the Island bringing you back, it must be that plane. You all need to be on it. It must be that flight. If you... want to return, you need to recreate as best you can the circumstances that brought you there in the first place. That means as many of the same people as you are able to bring with you.
JACK And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us? What if we're it?
ELOISE All I can tell you is the result would be... unpredictable.
JACK So that's it? We just get on that flight, and we just hope that it works? That's all?
ELOISE No, that's not all, Jack... at least, not for you.
ELOISE Come on in.
JACK Ben and Sun-
ELOISE Heard what they needed to hear, and this does not concern them. Oh. Here we are. 
JACK What's this?
ELOISE It's John Locke's suicide note.
JACK Uh... I, uh... I didn't know.
ELOISE Well, why would you? Obituaries don't see fit to mention when people hang themselves, Jack.
JACK Why would he kill himself?
ELOISE Ohh... there are many reasons, I'm sure, but the only one that matters is this—he is going to help you get back. John is going to be a proxy. A substitute.
JACK A substitute for who?
ELOISE Jack... who do you think? You need to, as best you can, recreate the conditions of the original flight... which is why you need to give John something of your father's. You have to get something that belonged to your father, and you need to give it to John.
JACK What?
ELOISE That's what you have to do.
JACK My father... is gone. My father has been dead for three years. You want me to... a—and to give it to Locke?! He's in a coffin! This is ridiculous!
ELOISE Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is and start asking yourself whether or not you believe it's going to work. That's why it's called a leap of faith, Jack.
JACK Where's Sun?
BEN She left.
JACK And Locke? I mean... his body? The coffin?
BEN I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport. What did she say to you, Jack?
JACK Nothing that matters. Who is she? Why is she... helping us? How does she know all this?
BEN Thomas the Apostle. When Jesus wanted to return to Judea, knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, "Let us also go, that we might die with him." But Thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... when he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... that he needed to touch Jesus' wounds to be convinced.
JACK So was he?
BEN Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, Jack. 
JACK Where are you going?
BEN Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine—just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, Jack.
JACK Hello? Yeah, this is him. M—he did what?
NURSE This is the fourth time he's left. He's gotta follow the rules, or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.
JACK Yeah, I understand.
MAGICIAN And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!
JACK Hey, Ray.
RAY Hey, Jack.
MAGICIAN As for my next trick, I need someone to pick a card.
JACK Wanna get out of here?
RAY The sooner the better.
MAGICIAN Would you please pick one? Look at it.
JACK You wanna tell me why you took off this time, Ray?
RAY Do I really need to answer that?
JACK Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?
RAY Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.
JACK You packed a bag?
RAY Of course I did. One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away. They won't ever find me either.
JACK Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, Ray.
RAY But what would I do without my magic shows?
JACK Let me help you unpack, Granddad.
RAY So how are you, kiddo? You seeing anyone special? Whatever happened to the girl that you brought by with you that time? The pretty one with all the freckles? What was her name?
JACK Kate. We're not together anymore.
RAY Oh. Well, look at the bright side—more time to come visit me.
JACK I'd love to, Granddad. I really would, but... I think I might be... might be going away for a while.
RAY Where's "away" exactly?
JACK Somewhere better than here.
RAY Touché.
JACK Are these yours, Granddad?
RAY No. Those were your father's. Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died. Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.
JACK These shoes... can I take them?
RAY Be my guest.
JACK Kate? What are you doing here?
KATE Are you still going back to the Island?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.
KATE Then I'm going with you.
JACK Kate... what happened? Where's Aaron? Where—
KATE No, don't ask questions. If you want me to go with you... you'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about Aaron. Do you understand, Jack?
JACK Yes.
KATE Thank you.
KATE Morning.
JACK Morning.
JACK Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice. You still like milk and two sugars?
KATE Yeah, sure. Those don't make much sense for the Island. You might want to consider hiking boots.
JACK Those were my father's. When I went to pick up his body in Sydney, my dad didn't have any nice shoes. My mother wanted to have the funeral as soon as I landed back in L.A. But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet? And so I—I had these old white tennis shoes, and I just said, "Use these. Put these on him." 'Cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me. Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.
KATE So why don't you get rid of 'em? Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?
KATE Go ahead. I- I'll see you at the airport, okay?
JACK Hello?
BEN Hello, Jack. Are you there?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Is everything all right?
BEN Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, and I need you to pick up Locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop, corner of Grand and Hayes.
JACK Why? Wh-what's happened to you?
BEN Just do it. Please.
JACK Are you Jill? Ben sent me.
JILL I know who you are, Dr. Shephard. Come on in.
JILL What's in the bag? Sorry. Ben said to give you the van. I gotta pull it around back. Give me about five minutes. 
JACK Wherever you are, John... you must be laughing your ass off that I'm actually doing this. Because this... this is even crazier than you were. And here. You can have that back. I've already heard everything you had to say, John. You wanted me to go back. I'm going back. Rest in peace.
VOICE ON INTERCOM Attention, passengers on flight...
NABIL Mr. Shephard, if you'll just bear with me. The reason for transporting Mr. Bentham to Guam?
JACK Uh, it was his—these were his wishes. He wanted to be buried there.
NABIL Who will be the recipient of the deceased upon arrival? Is there a funeral home or—
JACK No, it's me. Me. I'll be escorting the body.
NABIL And your relation to the deceased?
JACK He was, uh, a friend.
NABIL Now, Mr. Shephard, I have to inform you that due to the increased security measures , we are required to open the casket and perform a screening. I assure you it's all done with care. Do you understand, Mr. Shephard? Mr. Shephard?
JACK Yes. Yes, I understand.
NABIL Then please sign here. Thank you for flying Ajira Air.
CAESAR My condolences.
CAESAR I'm sorry you lost your friend.

JACK Nothing. And the other people on this plane—what's gonna happen to them?
BEN Who cares?
JACK It's pretty crazy, huh? 
KATE Which part?
JACK Hurley, Sayid... being... on the same plane. How did they end up here?
KATE They bought a ticket.
JACK You don't think that it means something? That somehow... we're all back together?
KATE We're on the same plane, Jack. Doesn't make us together.
MAN OVER P.A. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ajira Air. This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus, and on behalf of the entire flight crew, welcome aboard. Currently we're right on schedule, flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet. So sit back, relax and enjoy the in-flight movie.
JACK Excuse me, ma'am?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Mr. Shephard, can I help you?
JACK Um, I need to talk to the pilot. Frank Lapidus and I are old friends, and if you could just tell him I'm onboard, I'd really appreciate it.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT All right, but you just have to go sit down because you can't be near the cockpit door when it's open.
JACK Sure. I understand.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Captain, I have a passenger named Jack Shephard. He says he knows you. Okay, sir.
LAPIDUS Well, hello, Doc. Small world. What are you doing going to Guam?
JACK What are you doing here, Frank?
LAPIDUS Well, I picked this gig up about eight months ago. I fly this route all the time. Sometimes I take the big birds into New ... Delhi. Is... that Sayid? And Hurley. Wait a second. We're not going to Guam, are we?
JACK How can you read?
BEN My mother taught me. I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing.
JACK What's that?
BEN Waiting for something to happen.
JACK And what is gonna happen?
BEN You tell me, Jack. You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.
JACK Did you know that Locke killed himself?
BEN No. No, I didn't.
JACK They found this stuffed in his pocket. And I've been trying to get rid of it, but it's like it's... following me. I know it sounds crazy, but... it feels like John needs me to read it.
BEN Why don't you then?
BEN Is it because you're afraid?
JACK Afraid of what?
BEN Afraid that he blames you, that it's your fault he killed himself.
JACK Was it my fault?
BEN No, Jack, it wasn't your fault. Let me give you some privacy.
HURLEY Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Fasten your seat belt, ma'am. Sir? Please put on your seat belts. Seat belt, please.
KATE What happened? 
JACK Can you get up?
KATE Yeah. The plane... where's the plane?
JACK I don't know. After that light, I... I woke up in the jungle.
KATE So this is it? It's just us?
JACK I'm not sure. Do either of you remember crashing?
HURLEY Crashing? No. One second, I'm being tossed around. The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.
KATE Where's Sun and Sayid? Where's Ben?
JACK All right. Let's spread out, search the jungle. We come across anybody from the plane, we'll—
RADIO LYRICS Yeah, your kissin', it feels so right / But you had another man...
