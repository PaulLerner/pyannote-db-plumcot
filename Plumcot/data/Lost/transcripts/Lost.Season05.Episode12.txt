MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 What have you done, Richard?
richard_alpert Calm down. Calm down. This has nothing to do with you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 So it's true? You actually brought one of them to our Temple?
richard_alpert He's just a boy, and he was dying.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Then you should've let him die.
richard_alpert Jacob wanted it done. The Island chooses who the Island chooses. You know that.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Yes. Yes, of course. What's his name?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Hello, Benjamin.
young_benjamin_linus BEN What happened?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 You were injured.
young_benjamin_linus BEN How?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 You don't remember?
young_benjamin_linus BEN Where am I?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 You're among friends. We're going to take care of you.
young_benjamin_linus BEN My dad -- Is he here?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 You'll be back to him soon enough.
young_benjamin_linus BEN No. No, I don't want to go back.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Okay, easy. Easy.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Oh! I don't want to go back. I wanna stay. I wanna be one of you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Just because you're living with them doesn't mean you can't be one of us. You should be dead, Benjamin. But this Island... it saved your life.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Who are you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 I'm Charles. Charles Widmore.
john_locke Ben.
john_locke Hello, Ben. Welcome back to the land of the living.
ben_linus My God. You're alive.
john_locke Yes, I am.
ben_linus I knew it. I knew that this would happen.
john_locke Then why are you so surprised to see me?
ben_linus Because it's one thing to believe it, John. It's another thing to see it.
john_locke Then why were you trying to run away to the main Island?
ben_linus I broke the rules, John. I came back to the Island. I was going to answer for what I'd done. I was going back... to be judged.
john_locke Judged? By whom?
ben_linus Well, J-John, we don't even have a word for it, but I believe you call it the Monster.
ilana_verdansky Morning.
ben_linus Hello. What's in the crate?
ilana_verdansky Just some stuff we need to get moved.
ben_linus Need a hand?
bram Oh, thanks. We got it.
ben_linus Okay. Have a great day.
caesar How you feeling, my friend?
ben_linus Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live.
caesar What do you make of him?
ben_linus I'm not sure. What has he told you?
caesar When you were out cold, he was watching over you. And he said you killed him.
ben_linus I killed him? Really? 'Cause he looks fine to me. You know, I don't really remember him from the plane. Do you?
caesar No, I don't.
ben_linus What if... he was already here, before we crashed? If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane. We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged. Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it?
caesar Don't worry, my friend.
caesar I have your back. Caesar.
ben_linus Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. I'm Ben.
TEENAGER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 You want me to do it?
ben_linus Shh.
TEENAGER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 I can do it if you want me to, Ben.
ben_linus Shut up! And stay here, Ethan.
ben_linus Don't! Don't do it.
danielle_rousseau You're the one who infected us, aren't you?! C'est vous qui nous avez infectés!
danielle_rousseau Non! Non! Rendez-moi mon bébé! Non!
ben_linus Shh.
danielle_rousseau Rendez-moi mon bébé!
ben_linus It's okay. It's okay, baby.
danielle_rousseau Ne l'infectez pas, lui aussi! Please, don't take my Alex!
ben_linus Do you want your baby to live?
danielle_rousseau Why are you taking her?!
ben_linus Be grateful you're still alive. Now you listen to me. If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me, I'll kill you. And if you want your child to live, every time you hear whispers, you run the other way.
john_locke What's that?
ben_linus Just something sentimental.
john_locke So this is your old office, huh? I never pictured you leading your people from behind a desk. It seems a little... corporate.
ben_linus Was there something that you needed, John?
john_locke Well, Ben, I was hoping that you and I could talk about the elephant in the room.
ben_linus I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you.
john_locke Yeah.
ben_linus It was the only way to get you back to the Island, along with as many of those who left as possible. You do remember, John--that's why you left in the first place, to convince 'em to come back? But you failed. And the only way to bring them together was by your death, and you understood that. It's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you.
john_locke If all I had to do was die, Ben, they why did you stop me?
ben_linus You had critical information that would've died with you. And once you'd given it to me... well, I just didn't have time to talk you back into hanging yourself. So I took a shortcut. And look at you, John. I was right. You're here. You're back. So are the rest of them. I don't know where yet exactly, but they came. It worked. And that's why I did it, because it was in the best interests of the Island.
john_locke I was just hoping for an apology.
john_locke I've decided to help you, Ben.
ben_linus Help me do what?
john_locke Do what you say you are on your way to do. Be judged.
ben_linus That's not something you want to see, John.
john_locke If everything you've done has been in the best interests of the Island... then I'm sure the Monster will understand. Let's go.
caesar Hey!
caesar What are you doing?
john_locke We're taking a boat.
caesar Where?
john_locke Over to the main Island.
caesar I don't think so, my friend.
john_locke Are these your boats?
caesar Are they yours?
john_locke Caesar, right? I was under the impression these were found here, so I'm just gonna borrow one. I'm happy to leave the other boat for you in case you want to follow us.
caesar "Us"? Are you going with him?
ben_linus He didn't really give me a choice.
caesar I'm sorry, but I'm calling the shots here, and I say you are not taking anything. What you are going to do is to sit down and tell us how you know so much about this Island, my friend.
john_locke You're in the habit of calling people "friend", but I don't think you mean it.
caesar Step away from the boat.
john_locke No. I'm not gonna step away from the boat. I'm gonna take it, and you're gonna let me, my friend.
caesar You're not taking anything.
ben_linus You looking for this?
ben_linus This gentleman and I are taking a boat. Does anyone else have a problem with that?
ben_linus Consider that my apology.
ben_linus Home sweet home.
john_locke Looks like we're not the first ones who decided to tie up here.
ben_linus That would be Sun and Lapidus. I showed 'em where the boats were, and Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle.
john_locke Oh. Is she the one that hurt your arm? I noticed you were favoring it on the way over.
ben_linus No. Someone else hurt my arm.
john_locke You just make friends everywhere you go, don't ya?
ben_linus Well, I've found sometimes that friends can be significantly more dangerous than enemies, John.
john_locke Is that why you shot an unarmed man in the chest?
ben_linus The man was unarmed because I'd stolen his gun--the gun he was going to use to kill you. I couldn't let that happen.
john_locke No sense in me dying twice, right?
ben_linus You're welcome.
john_locke We're going to your old house, aren't we?
ben_linus Yes. It's the only place I can summon it... the "monster." Once it arrives, I'll either be forgiven... or I won't.
john_locke I think you're lying.
ben_linus Lying about what?
john_locke That you want to be judged for leaving the Island and coming back because it's against the rules. I don't think you care about rules.
ben_linus Then what do I want to be judged for, John?
john_locke For killing your daughter.
charles_widmore Well? Did you do it?
ben_linus We had a...
ben_linus ...complication.
charles_widmore I'm sorry. Is that a... baby? Your orders were to exterminate that woman.
ben_linus Why? She's no threat to us. She's insane, Charles. Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child. What was it I was supposed to do?
middleaged_charles_widmore Kill it.
ben_linus It's not an "it". This is a child.
charles_widmore You might find this difficult to understand, Benjamin... every decision I've made has been about protecting this Island.
ben_linus Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?
ben_linus Then here she is.
ben_linus You do it.
john_locke So whose idea was it to move into these houses?
ben_linus Excuse me?
john_locke Well, your people were living in the jungle. And then after you murdered the DHARMA folk, you relocated here. I just wondered if it was your idea.
ben_linus Do you disapprove, John?
john_locke It just doesn't seem like something the Island would want.
ben_linus You don't have the first idea what this Island wants.
john_locke Are you sure about that?
john_locke That was your house, wasn't it?
ben_linus Yes, and that's Alex's room.
john_locke Well, I suppose you better go over there and check it out.
ben_linus Sun?
frank_lapidus What are you doing here?
ben_linus This used to be my house. I saw a light turned on. What are the two of you doing in here?
sunhwa_kwon That was taken in 1977.
ben_linus Are you trying to tell me that your friends were in the DHARMA Initiative?
sunhwa_kwon You don't know about this?
ben_linus Of course not. Where did you get this? Who gave this to you?
frank_lapidus We met some crazy old man outside.
sunhwa_kwon He said his name was Christian. He told us to come in here and wait.
ben_linus Wait for what?
sunhwa_kwon He said if I ever wanted to see my husband again, I had to wait here for John Locke.
frank_lapidus But considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath.
ben_linus Well, you might want to look outside.
sunhwa_kwon What you're saying, it's... impossible.
john_locke But here I am. I don't know how, I don't know why, but I'm sure there's a very good reason for it.
frank_lapidus As long as the dead guy says there's a reason, well, then I guess everything's gonna be just peachy. And forget about the fact that the rest of your people are supposedly 30 years ago... now the only ones who are here to help us are a murderer and a guy who can't seem to remember how the hell he got out of a coffin. Sun, please, let's just go back to the plane, see if I can fix the radio, and maybe we can get some help.
john_locke If you leave with him, you'll never find your husband again. I'm all the help you need.
sunhwa_kwon Are you saying you know how to find them? How to find Jin?
john_locke I have some ideas.
frank_lapidus I'm sorry to say, but I'm leaving with or without you.
sunhwa_kwon If there's any chance of finding my husband, then I have to stay.
frank_lapidus All right. Well, for God sake, watch your back.
sunhwa_kwon All right.
sunhwa_kwon How do we find Jin?
john_locke Ben has something to do first. Isn't that right, Ben?
ben_linus Yes, John. That's right.
john_locke Better get to it then.
ben_linus I'll be outside.
alex_rousseau Again, Daddy! Again!
ben_linus Okay. Okay.
richard_alpert Wow, Alex! Any higher, and you're gonna fly right off the Island.
richard_alpert The sub's about to leave.
alex_rousseau Higher, Daddy! Higher!
ben_linus All right.
richard_alpert You don't have to see him off, Ben.
ben_linus Yes, Richard, I do.
alex_rousseau Higher! Higher, Daddy!
ben_linus Charles!
ben_linus I came to say good-bye.
charles_widmore No, you didn't. You came to gloat.
ben_linus No, don't act as if I wanted this. You brought this on yourself.
charles_widmore Are you quite certain you want to do this, Benjamin?
ben_linus You left the Island regularly. You had a daughter with an outsider. You broke the rules, Charles.
charles_widmore And what makes you think you deserve to take what's mine?
ben_linus Because I won't be selfish. Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this Island.
charles_widmore You wouldn't sacrifice Alex.
ben_linus You're the one who wanted her dead, Charles, not the Island.
charles_widmore I hope you're right, Benjamin, because if you aren't, and it is the Island that wants her dead, she'll be dead. And one day, you'll be standing where I'm standing now. You'll be the one being banished, and then you'll finally realize that you cannot fight the inevitable. I'll be seeing you, boy.
ben_linus Where did John go?
sunhwa_kwon He said he had something to do.
ben_linus Did he say what it was?
sunhwa_kwon No, I didn't ask. Jack must have lied.
ben_linus Excuse me?
sunhwa_kwon About Locke being dead? I don't know why he would, but that's the only explanation.
ben_linus Jack didn't lie. John was dead.
sunhwa_kwon Just because he was in a coffin doesn't mean that he couldn't have faked his dea--
ben_linus Trust me. I'm sure.
sunhwa_kwon So you knew this would happen to Locke if we brought him back here?
ben_linus Sun, I had no idea it would happen. I've seen this Island do miraculous things. I've seen it heal the sick, but never once has it done anything like this. Dead is dead. You don't get to come back from that, not even here. So the fact that John Locke is walking around this Island... scares the living hell out of me.
ben_linus You may want to go inside.
sunhwa_kwon Why?
ben_linus Because what's about to come out of that jungle is something I can't control.
john_locke Any luck?
ben_linus It hasn't shown up yet.
john_locke Last time we didn't have to wait this long.
ben_linus It's not a train, John. It doesn't run on a schedule.
john_locke Well, if it's not gonna come to us, then... I suppose we'll have to go to it.
ben_linus It doesn't work that way. I only know how to summon it. I don't know where it actually is.
john_locke I do.
john_locke It's weird for me, too.
sunhwa_kwon Excuse me?
john_locke I realize how strange this all is--me, here. But I assure you, Sun, I'm the same man I've always been.
john_locke Are you ready?
ben_linus Lead the way.
charles_widmore Hello?
ben_linus Charles? It's Benjamin.
charles_widmore How did you get this number?
ben_linus Doesn't matter. What matters is I'm going back to the Island today.
charles_widmore The Island won't let you come back, trust me. I've spent almost 20 years trying to return.
ben_linus Well, Charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed... just as soon as I do one thing.
charles_widmore And what's that, Benjamin?
ben_linus Kill your daughter. In fact, I'm looking at Our Mutual Friend right now.
charles_widmore I don't know what you're talking about.
ben_linus It's the name of the boat that Penny's on.
charles_widmore Don't you dare.
ben_linus Good-bye, Charles.
ben_linus May I ask you a question, John?
john_locke Shoot.
ben_linus How is it that you know where you're going?
john_locke I just know.
ben_linus I mean, how does that work, exactly?
john_locke How does what work?
ben_linus The knowing. I mean, did it come upon you gradually, or did you wake up one morning suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe?
john_locke You don't like this, do you?
ben_linus What?
john_locke Having to ask questions that you don't know the answers to, blindly following someone in the hopes that they'll lead you to whatever it is you're looking for.
ben_linus No, John, I don't like it at all.
john_locke Well, now you know what it was like to be me.
sunhwa_kwon We should keep moving.
john_locke Yes, we should.
ben_linus I think I know where we're going now, John.
john_locke Do you?
ben_linus It's the same place they brought me as a child. It's where the Island healed me.
john_locke Well... let's hope it's as generous this time around.
sunhwa_kwon What is it?
ben_linus It's the wall around our Temple.
sunhwa_kwon What Temple?
ben_linus About a half mile from here. We built this wall to keep people like the two of you from ever seeing it.
john_locke We're not going into your Temple, Ben.
john_locke We're going under it.
john_locke After you.
ben_linus I need to ask a favor of you, Sun. If you can ever get off this Island, find Desmond Hume for me. Tell him I said I was sorry.
sunhwa_kwon Sorry for what?
ben_linus He'll know.
desmond_hume Hey! What are you doing here?
penelope_widmore Desmond! Desmond! Des?!
ben_linus Don't move. Not another word. Hello, Penelope. My name is Benjamin Linus. I'm sorry that you're caught up in the middle of this thing, but your father--
penelope_widmore My father and I have absolutely no relationship whatsoever, so whatever--
ben_linus Your father is a really terrible human being. He's responsible for the killing of my daughter. That's why I'm here.
young_charlie Mommy!
penelope_widmore Charlie, go back inside, babe. Go back inside. Please. Please, whatever you do, don't hurt my son. Please don't hurt my son.
young_charlie Mommy? Mommy?
penelope_widmore Charlie, go inside!
desmond_hume Aah!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Captain Lapidus! Captain Lapidus! You're back. Thank God. They found guns.
frank_lapidus What are you talking about? Who found guns?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode12 Ilana and three of the others. They said they were in charge now.
frank_lapidus Where are they?
frank_lapidus Ilana!
frank_lapidus What's going on?
ilana_verdansky What lies in the shadow of the statue?
frank_lapidus What?
bram Answer the question!
ilana_verdansky What lies in the shadow of the statue?
frank_lapidus I have no idea what the--
ilana_verdansky Get everyone else. Tell them it's time. And tie him up. He's coming with us.
ben_linus You know, you were right.
john_locke About what?
ben_linus Why I need to be judged. When Charles Widmore's men came, they gave me a choice. Either leave the Island or let my daughter die. All I had to do was walk out of the house and go with them. But I didn't do it. So you were right. John, I did kill Alex. And now I have to answer for that. I appreciate you showing me the way, but I think I can take it from here.
john_locke You got it.
ben_linus I'll meet you outside, if I live--Aah!
john_locke Ben!
john_locke Are you all right?
ben_linus Never better.
john_locke Hang on. I'll find something to get you out of there.
ben_linus John, wait!
ben_linus You didn't tell me she had a child. What was it I was supposed to do?
charles_widmore Kill it.
ben_linus It's not an "it." This is a child.
alex_rousseau Higher! Again, Daddy! Again! Higher! Higher, Daddy!
alex_rousseau I hate you! I hate your guts! I wish you were dead.
alex_rousseau These people--you said they're dangerous. More dangerous than you?
alex_rousseau Dad, they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother. Please, Dad. Help me!
ben_linus She's not my daughter. She means nothing to me. So if you wanna kill her, go ahead and--
alex_rousseau Daddy?
ben_linus Alex.
alex_rousseau Hi, Dad.
ben_linus Ohh, Alex. I'm so, so sorry. It was all my fault.
alex_rousseau I know.
alex_rousseau Listen to me, you bastard! I know that you're already planning to kill John again, and I want you to know that if you so much as touch him, I will hunt you down and destroy you. You will listen to every word John Locke says, and you will follow his every order. Do you understand?
alex_rousseau Say it! Say you'll follow him.
ben_linus Yes, I will. I'll follow him. I swear.
john_locke Ben? Ben! Ben?
john_locke What happened?
ben_linus It let me live.
