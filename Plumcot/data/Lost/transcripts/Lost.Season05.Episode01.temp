WIFE Ah. Mm. Baby's awake.
WIFE It's your turn.
RECORD Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear / Bitin' on a bullet pullin' out all of his hair
RECORD Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
RECORD Well, you can't make a record if you—
RECORD Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you—
DIRECTOR Morning. Here you go, Doc.
CHANG I don't need a script. Let's go. I don't have all day.
SOUND MAN Speed.
DIRECTOR Okay. DHARMA orientation film number two, take one.
DIRECTOR And... action.
CHANG Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for station two, the Arrow. Given your specific area of expertise, you should find it no surprise that this station's primary purpose is to develop defensive strategies and gather intelligence on the island's hostile indigenous population—
MAN Dr. Chang! Dr. Chang?
CHANG Damn it! What the hell?!
DIRECTOR Cut!
MAN Sir, we got a problem down at the Orchid.
FOREMAN Over here. We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs. That's when the drill melted.
CHANG The drill melted?
FOREMAN Yeah, yeah. 3 meters in. We went through six carbon drill bits, and the last one just fried.
FOREMAN Then my operator starts grabbing his head and freaking out. We sonar-imaged the wall. There's an open chamber about 20 meters in, behind the rock.
FOREMAN There's something in there. And the only way to get to it is to lay charges here and here and blast through it and take a look—
CHANG Under no circumstances! This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy. And that energy, once we can harness it correctly, it's going to allow us to manipulate time.
FOREMAN Right. Okay, so, what? We're gonna go back and kill Hitler?
CHANG Don't be absurd. There are rules, rules that can't be broken.
FOREMAN So what do you want me to do?
CHANG You're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen...
CHANG ...God help us all.
WORKER All right, get him up.
FOREMAN Come on. Let's go.
CHANG Watch yourself!
TANK CARRYING WORKER Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
WORKER We need a doctor.
FOREMAN Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
FOREMAN Did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
FOREMAN Let's go, guys.
BEN Why don't you close that up now, Jack? Come on. Let's get him in the van. It's out back.
JACK Where are we taking him?
BEN We'll worry about that once we pick up Hugo.
JACK Hurley... is locked away in a mental institution.
BEN Which should make recruiting him considerably easier than the rest of your friends.
JACK They're not my friends anymore.
BEN Oh, that's the spirit.
JACK How did we get here? How did all this happen?
BEN It happened because you left, Jack. Now let's get started, shall we?
JACK So once we get Hurley... then what?
BEN Then we get Sun, Sayid... and Kate, of course.
JACK I don't see that happening.
JACK When was the last time you saw him? I mean, Locke.
BEN On the Island... in the Orchid station, below the greenhouse. I told him I was sorry for making his life so miserable, and then he left. So obviously John's visit to you made an impression. What did he say to make you such a believer?
JACK Sawyer, Juliet, everyone from the boat... and everyone we left behind—John said that they'd die, too, if I didn't come back.
BEN Did he tell you what happened to them after the Island moved?
JACK No. No, he didn't.
BEN Then I guess we'll never know.
LOCKE What the... Richard? Richard?! Anyone? Anyone?!
FROGURT What happened? What was that light?
FARADAY We must've been inside the radius.
SAWYER What the hell was that?
JULIET I don't know.
SAWYER Where's the freighter?
JULIET Maybe it went down.
SAWYER Unh-unh. No way. A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke. Now there's just nothin'?
JULIET What about the helicopter?
SAWYER It was heading for that boat.
BERNARD Rose! Rose!
JULIET Bernard!
BERNARD Rose! Have you seen Rose?!
JULIET No.
ROSE Oh, my God! Bernard!
BERNARD Rose! Where were you?
ROSE I was over... by the church. Wh-what was that sound? What was that light?
BERNARD I don't know.
SAWYER Just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right? We'll just go back to camp and—
BERNARD "Calm down"? "No need to panic"? We can't go back to the camp.
SAWYER What the hell are you talking about?
BERNARD There is no camp.
BERNARD The—the sky lit up, a—and then this. The—the kitchen? Gone. And—and all the tents, all the food and water... gone. Well, everything but us. All of it. It's gone.
FARADAY It's not gone.
CHARLOTTE Daniel!
FARADAY Hey.
CHARLOTTE I thought you were on the freighter.
FARADAY No, we never made it. We were on our way out there when it happened.
SAWYER What do you mean, the camp's not gone? Who the hell are you anyway?
MILES That's Dan. He's our physicist.
FARADAY Listen, we have no time. I need you to take me to something man-made, something that was built, any kind of a landmark.
JULIET There's a DHARMA station 15 minutes from here.
SAWYER You mean the hatch? The one we blew up?
FARADAY That's perfect. We should get moving before it happens again, okay?
SAWYER Before what happens again? And why is our camp gone?
FARADAY Your camp isn't gone. It hasn't been built yet.
AARON Choo choo! Tunnel!
KATE Oh, I think Choo Choo knows better than that. He goes into that tunnel, he's never coming back out.
KATE Watch your cartoons, Goober. Mommy'll be right back.
NORTON Ms. Austen?
KATE Yes?
NORTON Hi, I'm Dan Norton of the law firm Agostini & Norton. May we have a moment of your time?
KATE And who are you?
NORTON He's my associate. If I could just come in, I'll be glad to explain—
KATE No, you can explain right here.
NORTON Okay, you got it. Ms. Austen, we're here to get a blood sample from you and one from your son Aaron.
KATE Excuse me?
NORTON Now, I have a court order signed by a judge for you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers—
KATE Why?
NORTON To determine your relationship to the child.
KATE I'm sorry. I don't understand. Um, who's the—
NORTON I'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.
KATE Your client?
NORTON Please, may we come in?
KATE Get off my property.
NORTON If you won't comply, then I'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.
KATE Then come back with the sheriff.
AARON Where you going, mommy?
KATE We're going on vacation, baby.
KATE Say bye-bye, baby.
JULIET Why did you jump off that helicopter?
SAWYER I told you. We were runnin' out of gas. I wanted to make sure she—(sighs) I wanted to make sure they got back to the boat. Don't matter now anyway, does it?
FARADAY Excuse me. I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. Okay? Thanks.
SAWYER First things first. Gimme your shirt.
FARADAY My shirt?
SAWYER Yeah.
FARADAY I really think we have far more pressing matters than me giving you a shirt. How about we just keep moving, okay?
SAWYER How about we call a time-out so you can tell us what the hell is going on?
FARADAY How about you trust me?
SAWYER Trust you? I don't know you!
FARADAY We really do not have time for me to try to explain. You have no idea how difficult that would be for me to try to explain this—this phenomenon to a quantum physicist. That would be difficult, so for me to try to explain whatever is happening—
CHARLOTTE Oi! What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?
SAWYER Shut it, Ginger, or you're gettin' one, too.
SAWYER Now talk.
FARADAY The Island... think of the Island like a record spinning on a turntable... only now, that record is skipping. Whatever Ben Linus did down at the Orchid station... I think... it may have... dislodged us.
MILES Dislodged us from what?
FARADAY Time.
JULIET So that's why our camp is gone? Because the Island is moving through time?
FARADAY Yeah, either the Island is, or we are.
SAWYER What?
FARADAY And it's just as likely that we're moving, your people and us. And everyone in your group—you're all accounted for, right?
SAWYER Not everyone. ...Locke.
LOCKE Is anyone there?!
LOCKE Hello?!
LOCKE Hello?!
LOCKE Hey!
LOCKE Uhh!
ETHAN Who are you?
LOCKE Well, listen, listen—
ETHAN How many others onboard?
LOCKE You don't understand. I didn't come on that plane.
ETHAN Wrong answer.
LOCKE No, wait! Stop! Stop! I know you. I know who you are. Your name... your name is Ethan. Your name is Ethan.
ETHAN Who are you?
LOCKE My name is John Locke. I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but Ben Linus appointed me as your leader.
ETHAN That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
ETHAN Good-bye, John Locke.
SAWYER Great.
SAWYER So when are we now, whiz kid?
FARADAY We're either in the past... or we're in the future.
WOMAN Flight 23 to Paris will begin boarding at gate 15. Please have your boarding passes ready.
TICKETING AGENT Evening, ma'am. Where you flying to tonight?
SUN Los Angeles.
TICKETING AGENT Of course. May I see your passport, please?
SUN Mm-hmm.
TICKETING AGENT Excuse me. Could you wait here for just one moment, Ms. Kwon?
SUN Hey! Where are you going?
SUN Open this door. Open this door!
WIDMORE Save your breath.
WIDMORE They only do what I tell them to do.
SUN You. You had me brought in here? Why?
WIDMORE You had the audacity to approach me in broad daylight in front of my business associates... in public. Why did I have you brought here? Because you showed me no respect. I will be respected, Sun.
SUN Fair enough.
WIDMORE Since you seem to be worried about your plane, I'll get right down to business. You mentioned that you and I had... common interests. Why don't you tell me exactly what they might be?
SUN To kill Benjamin Linus.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR The victim was found shot in his car on the grounds of the Santa Rosa hospital, a private mental health care facility outside Los Angeles.
JACK Okay. Let's go get him.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR Police have now identified their suspect in the shooting as a patient at the hospital who escaped earlier this evening—Hugo Reyes.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR Now if that name sounds familiar to you, that's because Reyes was a member of the infamous Oceanic Six. As to why he may have murdered a visitor to the facility where Reyes lived for two years, that remains a complete mystery.
BEN Well... looks like we have a change of plan.
HURLEY Here she comes, right now.
WAITRESS Here's your order, sir.
SAYID Keep the change.
WAITRESS Thank you.
HURLEY Awesome.
HURLEY You want a fry?
SAYID No, thank you.
HURLEY You know, maybe if you ate more comfort food you wouldn't have to go around shooting people.
HURLEY So that dude you popped outside Santa Rosa—who was he?
SAYID I don't care. He was armed and he was watching you. That made him an enemy.
HURLEY Do you think he was gonna kill me?
SAYID I'm not taking any risks. After Bentham died—
HURLEY You mean Locke.
SAYID Yes, I mean Locke.
HURLEY I need a cool code name.
HURLEY So when'd you become so paranoid?
SAYID If you'd spent the last two years doing the things I was doing, you'd be paranoid, too.
HURLEY Oh, yeah? Paranoid like what? What kind of things?
SAYID I was working for Benjamin Linus.
HURLEY Wait. He's on our side now?
SAYID Listen to me, Hurley. If you ever have the misfortune of running into him, whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.
SAYID Wait here.
FIRST MAN Is he all right?
SECOND MAN I don't know.
FIRST MAN Is he breathing or what?
THIRD MAN Who is that? Check him out.
FIRST MAN Look out! That guy's got a gun!
SECOND MAN Run!
FIRST MAN Get out of here! Call the cops! Hurry!
HURLEY Sayid! Whoa. You okay?
SAYID Get me to the car.
HURLEY Dude. Dude. Oh, man. I thought it was supposed to be a safe house. I never should've left the Island.
CHARLOTTE Hey, do you think he's looking for us?
MILES Who?
CHARLOTTE Widmore.
MILES It took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time. I'll start holding my breath now.
JULIET Over here!
FARADAY Is this the hatch?
SAWYER It was. Blown up, just like we left it.
FARADAY Okay. So when we are now... it's now after you and your people crashed on the Island.
SAWYER You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again?
FARADAY It's possible, yeah.
SAWYER Good. I'm going back.
FARADAY Hey. No, no. It's pointless.
SAWYER More pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?
FARADAY We don't know when the next flash is coming. By the time you get back to the beach, the camp could be gone again.
SAWYER Yeah, but what if it ain't? Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?
JULIET We could warn them, stop them from ever flying to that boat.
FARADAY That's not the way it works.
SAWYER Who says?
FARADAY You cannot change anything. You can't. Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.
SAWYER Why not?
FARADAY Time—it's like a street, all right? We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse, but we cannot ever create a new street. If we try to do anything different, we will fail every time. Whatever happened, happened.
SAWYER How do you know so much about this, Danny Boy?
FARADAY I know about this because... I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time. I know all this because this journal contains everything I've ever learned about the DHARMA Initiative. This is why I'm here. I know what's happening.
SAWYER So how can we stop it?
FARADAY We can't stop it.
SAWYER Then who can?
LOCKE Aah!
LOCKE Aah! 
LOCKE Richard?
RICHARD Hey, John.
LOCKE Richard... what is happening?
RICHARD What's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Here.
RICHARD I need to get the bullet out.
LOCKE How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
RICHARD Because you told me there was, John.
LOCKE No, no. No, I didn't.
RICHARD Well... you will.
LOCKE It was Ethan who shot me.
RICHARD Well... what comes around, goes around.
LOCKE Aah! When am I?
RICHARD Well, John, that—that's all relative.
LOCKE Wait, wait. When the sky lit up... where did you go?
RICHARD I didn't go anywhere, John. You went. All right, this—this is gonna hurt. It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? Hold still.
LOCKE Uhh!
RICHARD All done.
LOCKE Jeez.
LOCKE I don't understand. How—how did you know that I was here? How did you know where to find me?
RICHARD I wish I had time to explain it, John. But you're gonna be moving on soon, and we need to go over a couple of things before you do.
LOCKE "Moving on"? Aah!
RICHARD Sorry. The first thing, okay?
RICHARD You're gonna need to clean out the wound every couple of hours and keep as much weight off the leg as you can, all right? The Island'll do the rest, John, all right?
LOCKE But I don't—
RICHARD Second thing—no, no, pay attention. Next time we see each other, I'm not gonna recognize you. All right? You give me this. All right?
LOCKE What is this?
RICHARD It's a compass.
LOCKE What does it do?
RICHARD It points north, John. Look, I wish I had time to be more sensitive about this because it's a lot to swallow, but you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do. So I'm just gonna say it, okay? The only way to save the Island, John, is to get your people back here—the ones who left.
LOCKE Jack, Kate... The chopper was headed for the boat. The boat—
RICHARD No, they're fine, John, and they're already home, so you have to convince them to come back.
LOCKE How—how am I supposed to do that?
RICHARD You're gonna have to die, John.
MILES So... what was this thing before you guys blew it up?
JULIET A DHARMA station.
MILES For what?
JULIET There was a man named Desmond living down in it. He was pushing a button every 108 minutes to save the world.
MILES Really?
JULIET Yeah. Really.
SAWYER Son of a...
SAWYER ...bitch!
JULIET The hatch—it's back. I guess you haven't found it yet.
MILES Hey! Where you goin'?
SAWYER Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.
FARADAY James, wait. Not a good idea.
SAWYER The sky can flash all it wants, but I ain't startin' over, Dilbert. I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and starting a fire, and I ain't huntin' damn boar! There's DHARMA food, beer, and clothing in there. And I'm gettin' Desmond to let me in one way or another.
FARADAY That's not gonna work, my friend.
SAWYER Yeah? Why not?
FARADAY Because Desmond didn't know you when he first came out of there. That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.
SAWYER That would all be fascinating if I was listening to ya.
FARADAY So how do you know Desmond is even in there? Think about it. It could be anybody.
SAWYER I don't care who's in there.
FARADAY Wait. Wait.
SAWYER Open the damn door!
FARADAY It won't work.
SAWYER Sure it will. Yo, open up! It's the Ghost of Christmas Future!
FARADAY No one—no one is gonna answer.
SAWYER Open! Open the damn door! Open the door!
FARADAY You're wasting your time.
SAWYER Open up! I know you can hear me.
FARADAY If it didn't happen, it can't happen.
SAWYER Open the damn door!
FARADAY You can't change the past, James!
SAWYER Everybody I care about just blew up on your damn boat. I know what I can't change.
JULIET We should get back to the beach. It's been a long day.
MILES Why are we going back to the beach if there's nothing to go back to?
JULIET So stay here.
MILES That chick likes me.
CHARLOTTE What? Wh—what? What's the matter?
FARADAY You... 
CHARLOTTE Ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed since I was little. Dan, I'm fine.
FARADAY Yeah. No, no, no, you're—um, of course you're fine. I'm, uh... you know, the sight of blood is...
CHARLOTTE Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're a physicist then, isn't it? Shall we?
FARADAY Yeah, um... my pack. Of course I left my pack back at the hatch crater. I better get it. Why don't you head back with everyone else? And I'll be right behind you.
CHARLOTTE Don't dillydally.
FARADAY I wouldn't think of it.
FARADAY Please let this work. Please let this work. Please, please, please, let this work.
FARADAY Oh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa. Don't shoot.
MAN Then you'd best explain why you've been bangin' on my door for the last 20 minutes, brother.
FARADAY Desmond.
DESMOND Are you him?
FARADAY "Him"? Who?
DESMOND My replacement.
FARADAY No, I'm not.
FARADAY I'm not. I'm not. I'm...
DESMOND Do I know you?
FARADAY Yeah... in a way. But listen, that's not important. What is important, Desmond, is what I'm about to say to you. I need you to listen. You're the only person who can help us because, Desmond... the rules... the rules don't apply to you. You're special. You're uniquely and miraculously special.
DESMOND What are you talking about?
FARADAY Okay, listen to me. Listen! If the helicopter somehow made it off the Island, if you got home—
DESMOND What helicopter? What are you talking about?!
FARADAY Listen, I need you to listen, or people are gonna die. My name is Daniel Faraday, and right now me and everyone else you left behind—we're in serious danger. You're the only person who can help us. I need you to go back to Oxford University. Go back to where we met.
FARADAY I need you to go there and find my mother. Her name is—
PENNY Are you all right?
DESMOND I was on the Island.
DESMOND I was on the Island.
PENNY You've been off the Island for three years now.
PENNY You're safe now. It was just a dream.
DESMOND It wasn't a dream, Pen.
DESMOND It was a memory.
PENNY Desmond, where are you going? Des?
PENNY Desmond? What are you doing?
DESMOND We're leaving.
PENNY Leaving to go where?
DESMOND Oxford.
