LOCKE Hello, Jack. I was hoping you'd come.
LOCKE I think we have some catching up to do.
JACK Hurley. This was your idea. You alright with me talking with him alone?
HURLEY It's all you, dude.
JACK Alright, let's catch up.
JACK Look just like him.
LOCKE Does it bother you?
JACK No, what bothers me is I don't have any idea what the hell you are.
LOCKE Sure you do.
JACK Why John Locke?
LOCKE Because he was stupid enough to believe that he'd been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.
JACK He had to be dead before you could look like him.
LOCKE That's right.
JACK Who else have you looked like?
LOCKE Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
JACK The third day we were here I saw... I chased my father through the jungle... my, my dead father. Was that you?
LOCKE Yes, that was me.
JACK Why?
LOCKE You needed to find water. This may be hard for you to believe, Jack, but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.
JACK To help me? To do what?
LOCKE Leave. But because Jacob chose you, you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead. We don't have to be trapped anymore. We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.
JACK If we can just fly away whenever we want, why are you still here?
LOCKE Because it has to be all of us.
LOCKE What?
JACK John Locke was the only one of us that ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this island.
LOCKE John Locke was not a believer, Jack. He was a sucker.

BEN I saw the man that did this... the, the hit-and-run driver. He, he was at our school--
EMT #1 When we get to the hospital you can talk to the cops. Do you know anyone we can contact for him?
BEN I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him.
LOCKE Helen.
BEN What did you say?
LOCKE Helen Norwood. I was gonna marry her.
BEN Well, you're still gonna marry her 'cause you're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.
LOCKE John. My name is John.

JACK What is it?
LOCKE You can come out!
LOCKE You following us, Claire?
CLAIRE Yeah.
LOCKE Why?
CLAIRE 'Cause he's my brother.
LOCKE Looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do. I'll leave you to it.
JACK Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th--
CLAIRE Did he tell you? That he was the one pretending to be our father?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, he told me.
CLAIRE You know, I pretty much gave up hoping that you'd ever come back. Now that you're here...
CLAIRE It's... it's good to see you, Jack.
JACK Yeah, it's good to see you too.
CLAIRE You know, I-I never really had much in the way of family, so it...really means a lot that you're coming with us.
JACK Actually, I haven't-I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
CLAIRE Yeah, you have.
JACK What do you mean?
CLAIRE You decided the moment you let him talk to you, just like the rest of us. So, yeah, whether you like it or not, you're with him now.
HURLEY Has he got a submarine?
SAWYER Keep your voice down, damn it. Yeah, Widmore's got a sub. We can use it to get off this rock.
HURLEY Are we gonna tell Sun?
SAWYER Kate's telling her now. Thought we might want to avoid huddles.
HURLEY What about Sayid?
SAWYER Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.
HURLEY Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin--
SAWYER Who the hell's Anakin? Look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothing to no one.
CLAIRE Hey.
HURLEY Hey, Claire.
CLAIRE Hey, Hurley.
HURLEY You look great.
LOCKE It's so nice to have everyone back together again.
SAWYER Want an apple?
SAWYER Hey, Schaub, I'm the one who brought her in. Wanna give us a minute?
SAWYER Katherine Anne Austen. You're wanted for arson, assault on a federal officer, murder in the first degree.
SAWYER Funny, you don't strike me as the murdering kind.
KATE That's because I'm not.
SAWYER You be sure and mention that to feds when they get here.
KATE There something you wanted?
SAWYER You remember me? The airport? We were on the same flight from Sydney.
KATE Yeah, I remember.
SAWYER Well, don't you think it's weird--you and me being on the same flight, having that little meet-up in the elevator? And a week later--boom, of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine. Almost like someone's trying to put us together.
KATE Are you hitting on me?
SAWYER It'd never work, sweetheart. I'm a cop, you're a murderer.
KATE I already told you, I'm not a murderer.
SAWYER Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.
KATE So, why didn't you arrest me?
SAWYER I did arrest you.
KATE No, in L.A.X., the elevator, you saw I was wearing handcuffs.
SAWYER I didn't see any handcuffs. All I saw was a pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.
KATE You know what I think? I think you let me go because you went to Australia, and you didn't want anyone to know you were there. Should I tell that to the feds when they get here?
SAWYER Oh, I like you.
KATE Mm.
MILES Jim, got a live one. Come on.
SAWYER Sorry, duty calls.
MILES We caught a multiple homicide at a restaurant. Victims were a lowlife named Keamy and three goons on his payroll. Korean female GSW at the scene, and her boyfriend witnessed it, but he doesn’t speak English.
SAWYER Any suspects?
MILES Yeah, an ATM surveillance camera grabbed this jabroni fleeing the scene.
SAWYER All righty. Put a name to that face. That's our bad guy.
KATE He's different now.
JACK Guess we're all different now.
KATE So what did Locke say to you?
JACK Said that he wants to leave, and we all have to go together.
KATE And do you believe him?
JACK I'm not sure yet.
MAN Hands up. Stop right there.
ZOE Where's the man in charge?
HURLEY Who's she?
SAWYER That's Widmore's number two.
LOCKE What can I do for you?
ZOE You took something from us, and we want it back.
LOCKE I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
LOCKE It's okay.
ZOE Do you have fix on my position?
MAN Roger that.
ZOE Show them what we're capable of.
ZOE You have until nightfall to return what you took; or next time, we won't miss.
ZOE Call me when you're ready for us to pick him up.
LOCKE Well...here we go.
CLAIRE Uh, hi. I have an appointment with the Western Pacific Adoption Agency.
MAN Fifteenth floor, and sign in, please.
CLAIRE Sure. 
DESMOND Hey there. How are you? Uh, we met at the airport. The, uh, the baggage claim.
CLAIRE Oh, yeah, right.
DESMOND Nice. I'm Desmond. Desmond Hume. Um, I never got your name. Uh... "Claire Littleton." So--So how you doin'?
CLAIRE Um, I'm okay. Better now. I actually had a bit of a scare, ended up in the hospital.
DESMOND Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...
CLAIRE Oh, no. All good now, so... Oh, by the way, uh, you were right. It's a boy.
DESMOND I have a nose for these things. Look, um...excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but I couldn't help noticing you're going to an adoption agency...alone.
CLAIRE Uh...yeah. You're right. It is personal.
DESMOND No, I just meant that you should have some--some legal representation.
CLAIRE What, are you a lawyer?
DESMOND No, no. But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my to see one. You know, adoption contracts are complicated; and, you should be careful because you could find yourself in a situation that's irreversible.
CLAIRE Yeah, I-I don't have money for a lawyer.
CLAIRE What floor?
DESMOND Um...I'm--I'm going to 15 as well. Look, this, um, this attorney I'm seeing--she's excellent. Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor. So...why don't you just come and meet her? You know, I think she could really help you.
DESMOND Look, I promise you it won't cost you a cent. Please. It'd be my absolute pleasure.
CLAIRE Uh, sure.
DESMOND Great, this way.
DESMOND Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to see Miss Verdansky, please.
RECEPTIONIST Oh, yes, Mrs. Hume, she's expecting you. Have a seat.
DESMOND Great.
CLAIRE Hey, um...thank you.
DESMOND You're very welcome.
ILANA Desmond!
DESMOND Ah, Ilana. Uh, Claire, this is Ilana. Ilana, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Claire Littleton.
ILANA Claire Littleton, um...
DESMOND I was hoping you'd be able to help her, um...
ILANA I'm sorry...Claire Littleton from Australia?
CLAIRE Um, do I know you?
ILANA No, but this is a quite a coincidence. We've been looking for you. Desmond, do you mind if I speak with Miss Littleton alone for a few minutes?
DESMOND No, absolutely fine. Go right ahead.
LOCKE Listen up, everyone.
CLAIRE Hey. What's going on?
HURLEY People trying to kill us again.
LOCKE All this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected, but these people have forced our hand, claiming we stole something from them, trying to provoke us into a confrontation. Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Gather your things, we're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane. James, I need your help with something.
LOCKE There's a boat moored just a few hours down the shore from here. I want you to get it and meet the rest of us on the other side of these bluffs. We'll all sail over to the other island together.
SAWYER How come we're not all heading for it together?
LOCKE The bigger the group, the slower it moves.
SAWYER All right. I could use another pair of hands.
LOCKE Take whoever you want.
SAWYER How about it, Freckles? Know anything about sailing?
KATE I know enough.
LOCKE Good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?
SAWYER Give me a hand with something? Listen up, 'cause I’m only gonna say this once. We're not going to that rendezvous point to pick up Locke. I got a deal with Widmore.
JACK What kind of deal?
SAWYER Just listen. First chance you get, double back, hoof it to this spot. There's an old dock. Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.
JACK What about Sayid and Claire?
SAWYER Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts. She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill Kate. And I ain't gonna let that happen again. It's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?
JACK But, how am I supposed to get us away from--from Locke?
SAWYER You figure it out.
SAWYER Ready to roll?
KATE What was that all about?
SAWYER Guy talk.
LOCKE I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.
SAYID I thought you weren't going to give him back.
LOCKE I'm not. You're gonna kill him. And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid? You do still want what you asked me for, right?
SAYID Yes, I do.
LOCKE Then, go do what I said.
DESMOND So what did he offer ya? If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...I think I have a right to know what you're getting in exchange for it.
SAYID He told me I could get something back I lost.
DESMOND And what did you lose?
SAYID The woman I loved.
DESMOND And where is she now?
SAYID Dead.
DESMOND And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?
SAYID I died...and he brought me back.
DESMOND So, what will you tell her?
SAYID What do you mean?
DESMOND This woman--when she asks you what you did to be with her again...what will you tell her?
NADIA Sayid. What's going on?
SAYID Everything will be okay for you now. I took care of it.
NADIA What do you mean? Where are you going?
SAYID I have to leave.
NADIA Did you hurt someone?
SAYID Nadia, I'm leaving. And I'm never going to be able to come back again.
NADIA What did you do, Sayid?
SAYID Stall them.
NADIA Who is it?
MILES LAPD.
NADIA May I see some identification?
MILES Can you open the door, please. Mrs. Jarrah, I'm Detective Straume. I need to ask you some questions. You have a few minutes?
SAWYER That's good, stay down. Sayid Jarrah, you're under arrest.
SAWYER Thar she blows. You ready to get wet?
KATE Ah. You sure this is a good idea?
SAWYER You see a bridge?
KATE Going back to get Locke.
SAWYER Course not. It's a terrible idea, which is why we ain't doing it.
KATE What?
SAWYER We're gonna ditch Locke. You, me Jack, Hurley, Sun and that pilot that looks like he's stepped off the set of a Burt Reynolds movie.
KATE When were you planning on telling me this?
SAWYER Now.
KATE Wait, you didn't say Claire.
SAWYER She ain't coming. The Claire you came back for is gone.
KATE I promised I would bring her back.
SAWYER That was before she started drinkin' Locke's kool-aid. She's dangerous, you really want her around Aaron? Let's go. We ain't got much time.
JACK Hey, Claire.
CLAIRE Jack.
JACK How long have you been with Locke?
CLAIRE Ever since you left.
JACK So you trust him?
CLAIRE Yeah.
JACKS Why?
CLAIRE 'Cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.
LOCKE Sun. Have you seen Sayid? He was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back. Oh, the silent treatment?
 "You did this to me!"
LOCKE I'm sorry, Sun, but I didn't do anything to you. James should be on his way by now. Just keep everyone moving to the beach, I'll catch up with you there.
CINDY Where are you going?
LOCKE I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.
JACK Hurley, wait up.
HURLEY Yeah?
JACK Sun.
JACK We have to go now.
LAPIDUS Go where?
JACK There's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.
HURLEY Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan, or he'll be really pissed.
JACK This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go!
LOCKE Sayid. Where have you been?
SAYID Doing what you asked.
LOCKE Then, what took you so long?
SAYID I just shot an unarmed man. I needed a moment.
LOCKE Did you kill him, Sayid?
SAYID Of course, I did. Go and check, if you like.
LOCKE Come on, we have a boat to catch.
LAPIDUS Hope you know where you're going. Because that smoke thing runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.
JACK Sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.
HURLEY There they are!
KATE Hey.
SAWYER Alright, let's go. Everybody on board, let's go!
LAPIDUS Sailin' home on this, huh?
SAWYER Won't work, not without a bearing. For three years the only DHARMA folk ever got on or off this Island was by sub, so that's what we're doin'. Nice job, doc.
HURLEY Uh oh.
CLAIRE Where are you going?
KATE Claire...it's okay.
JACK Kate.
KATE We're leaving the Island.
CLAIRE Then, uh, why aren't you waiting for John?
KATE Because that's not John, and whoever he is, he's not one of us. Claire, come with us. I can get you back to Aaron.
SAWYER Wait a damn minute-
KATE Sawyer shut up. She is coming or I'm not. Come with us Claire.
CLAIRE John promised me-
KATE No I'm promising you. I was there when he was born, and I never should have raised him, it should have been you. I came back to get you so you can be with him again. It's the only reason I came back to the Island, Claire. So please come with us. Let's go home.
SAWYER Alright, get on the boat before Locke gets here.
CLAIRE He finds out we're gone, he's gonna be mad.
JACK It's your mom. Hey. Yeah, we just got here. Thank you. Uhh, I don't know, I'll have him home as soon as I can, maybe like 5 o'clock?
JACK Actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards, so...maybe more like 7? Alright. Yeah, yeah I'll drop him off.
JACK Hey. You know, hearing your grandfather's will being read, I know it's not the most fun, but it'll be over soon, I promise, and it's okay to be sad.
DAVID I'm sad for you, Dad.
ILANA Mr. Shephard.
JACK Hello.
ILANA And you must be David.
DAVID Hi.
ILANA We're set up in the conference room. I've got a surprise for you. Do you believe in fate?
ILANA This is Claire Littleton. Claire, this is Mr. Shephard and his son David.
JACK Hello. I'm Jack Shephard.
CLAIRE Hi, it's uh, it's really nice to meet you.
JACK You found her.
ILANA Actually, she found us.
JACK Uh. You were in my father's will. Do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?
CLAIRE I...he was my father too.
JACK I'm sorry, excuse me. This is the, um, this is the service. Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard. No-no it's not a very good time. Yes, they can go ahead and prep him. I'm 20 minutes away. I'm, so sorry, there's been an emergency at the hospital. And, um, we're going to have to reschedule.
LAPIDUS I know I'm a little late to the party, Captain, but, you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?
SAWYER My plan, Chesty, is to land on Hydra Island, get ourselves nice and cuddly with Widmore until we get a chance to jump on that sub. Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face and make 'em take us home.
LAPIDUS I like that idea...I saw some canned food down in the galley. Anybody else starving?
SAWYER Freckles, take the wheel a minute?
KATE Sure...Be nice.
SAWYER Yeah, yeah.
SAWYER Didn't think you'd show up, doc.
JACK Sorry?
SAWYER Taking orders ain't your strong suit. Nice to see you finally came around.
JACK This doesn't feel right.
SAWYER What doesn't feel right?
JACK Leaving the island.
SAWYER Wanna tell me why not?
JACK Because I remember how I felt last time I left...like a part of me was missing.
SAWYER They got pills for that, doc.
JACK We were brought here because we're supposed to do something, James. And if Locke--that...that thing--wants us to leave; maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.
SAWYER Get off my damn boat.
JACK What?
SAWYER You got a decision to make and you make it now. Either you’re with us, you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself, or you're going in the water.
JACK James, this is a mistake. And I know there's a part of you that feels that. The island's not done with us yet.
SAWYER Yeah, well, I'm done with this island. So, if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it...Get off my damn boat.
JACK I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.
KATE Jack? Jack?! What did you say to him?
SAWYER He changed his mind.
KATE What do you mean he changed his mind? What did you say to him?
SAWYER He ain't coming with us.
KATE We have to go back and get him.
SAWYER We're done going back, Kate.
SUN 
JIN 
SUN 
JIN 
SUN 
JIN It's over...and we're all going to be okay.]
DAVID So, all these years, you had no idea your dad had another kid?
JACK Nope. None.
DAVID Wow. I can't believe he never even mentioned her.
JACK Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.
DAVID Is that where you get it from?
JACK Yeah, probably... All right, uh, you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
DAVID Yeah, sure...Good luck, Dad.
JACK Thanks.
FEMALE SURGEON Car v. ped.
JACK How bad?
FEMALE SURGEON Bad. But, here's the kicker--the victim was already in a wheelchair, pre-existing spinal condition.
JACK Dural sac's obliterated.
FEMALE SURGEON That's why we called you. We're in a bit over our heads here.
JACK Yeah, I got this. We're ready to cut?
FEMALE SURGEON Say the word.
JACK Scalpel.
FEMALE SURGEON What is it?
JACK I think I know this guy.
LOCKE Nice day for a swim... Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER Everybody stay close. Camp's over here. Not gonna have much time before Locke figures out we made off with his ride.
MAN Hands up!
SAWYER Hey! Whoa!
MAN Drop your weapons!
SAWYER Whoa! Take it easy!
ZOE Drop them now! ... It's all right. We know him. Who else is with you?
SAWYER Nobody. You wonder where Locke is, he's still back on the main island.
ZOE Turn the fences off. Ford just showed up on a boat with five of his friends. 
JIN Sun?
SUN Jin? Jin?
JIN Sun! 
SUN I love you!
JIN I love you, too.
SUN I never stopped looking for you.
LAPIDUS Looks like someone got their voice back.
JIN We'll never be apart again. I promise you.
ZOE Are you sure? I-I understand, Charles.
SAWYER That Widmore? What the hell are you doin'?
ZOE What's it look like I'm doing? Hands up, now! On your knees. All of you!
MAN Down!
SAWYER We had a deal!
ZOE Deal's off... We got 'em. If you've got a sightline on Locke, fire when ready.
MAN Roger.
JACK Get down!
LOCKE Jack. You all right? Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. You're with me now.
