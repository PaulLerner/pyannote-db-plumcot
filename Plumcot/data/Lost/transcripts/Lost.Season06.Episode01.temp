CINDY So how's the drink?
JACK Uh... it's good.
CINDY That's not a very strong reaction.
JACK Well, it's--it's not a very strong drink.
CINDY Don't tell anyone.
JACK It'll be our secret.
CINDY Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.
CINDY Please return to your seats and keep your seat belts fastened.
ROSE It's normal. My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.
JACK Sounds like a smart man.
ROSE You be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
JACK Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry--
ROSE You can let go now.
ROSE It's okay. You--you can let go.
JACK Looks like we made it.
ROSE Yeah. We sure did.
NORRIS Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks. We just hit a pocket of rough air. It should be a smooth ride from here on out.
BERNARD Remind me to hold it next time, will ya?  I almost died in that bathroom.
BERNARD Now I know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.
ROSE I missed you.
BERNARD I missed you, too, beautiful.
JACK Excuse me.
DESMOND Oh, I'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat? The stewardess said it was empty.
JACK No. No, I'm at the window.
DESMOND Oh, right.  Listen, mate, do you mind if I sit here? It's just the fella next to me has been snoring ever since we took off from Sydney.
JACK Yeah, no problem.
DESMOND Thanks, brother. Something wrong?
JACK No. No, you just...  Do I know you from somewhere?
DESMOND  Well, I'm not sure. Desmond.
JACK Jack.
DESMOND Nice to meet you, Jack... or to see you again.
JULIET Aah! No! No!
SAWYER Juliet!
JULIET Aah!
SAWYER I got you. No, don't let go!
JULIET Aah!
SAWYER Juliet! No!
JULIET Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
KATE Aah!
KATE Hello?
KATE Hello?!
MILES Hey!
MILES Hey! Hey! Kate!
MILES It's okay. It's me, miles. It's okay.
KATE What happened?
MILES What?
KATE Where are we?
MILES I can't--I can't hear you. Are your ears ringing?
MILES What is it?
KATE We're back.
MILES Back where?
KATE No.
MILES Is that the construction site?
KATE No. That's the Swan hatch... after Desmond blew it up.
MILES Guess we're not in 1977, huh?
KATE Jack? Jack. Can you hear me? Jack!
JACK What happened? Where are we?
KATE At the hatch.
JACK What? They built it?
KATE Yeah. They built it.
KATE Sawyer!
JACK Uhh!
SAWYER You were wrong! That's the damn Swan hatch--blown up just like we left it before we started jumping through time! You said we could stop it from ever gettin' built! That our plane would never crash on this Island!
KATE Stop it!
SAWYER This ain't LAX!
KATE Stop it!
SAWYER You blew us right back where we started! Except Juliet's dead. She's dead, you son of a bitch, 'cause you were wrong.
JACK Sawyer... I'm sorry. I thought we were supposed to... I thought it would work.
SAWYER Well, it didn't!
JACK You in line?
MARS No, I'm just waiting for my friend.
KATE Oh!
JACK Whoa.
KATE I'm sorry. I didn't...
JACK  It's okay.
KATE I didn't see you there.
JACK It's okay.
MARS Let's get back to our seats, sweetheart.
MARS Mmm. Lasagna.
MARS No. No knife and fork for you, honey.
KATE What do you think I'm gonna do, stab you and run?
MARS Hey, watch we're you're going, buddy.
SAWYER Sorry. My bad.
ARZT Say it. Come on, please? Just once.
HURLEY I really don't want to, dude.
ARZT I love those commercials. Come on. Just do the Australian accent, and I'll leave you alone.
HURLEY All right. Fine. All right.  Oi! Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!
ARZT You know who this is? This is--this is the owner of Mr. Cluck's Chicken. And he's--and he's back here riding coach with the rest of us yutzes! Huh?
SAWYER How about that?
ARZT Hey, um, do you mind me asking, how exactly did a guy like you get to own a major corporation?
HURLEY I won the lottery and I like chicken, so I bought it.
ARZT Oh. Good. Good for you.
SAWYER You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.
HURLEY Yeah? Why not?
SAWYER Cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not.
HURLEY Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.
SAWYER It's not, huh?
HURLEY Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me. I'm the luckiest guy alive.
HURLEY What just happened?
JIN I found a flashlight.
HURLEY Dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night. What happened?!
JIN I think we moved through time.
HURLEY How do you know that?
JIN White flash. Headache. Can't hear. Happened to me before.
HURLEY What about Jack and everyone else? Did they move through time, too?
JIN I don't know. They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.
JIN And then I heard gunfire--
HURLEY Shh!
SAWYER You said that our plane would never crash on this Island!
HURLEY You hear that, dude? It's Sawyer.
JIN Stay here with Sayid.
JACK The bomb must've gone off.
SAWYER You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!
JACK I don't know.
SAWYER That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!
JIN Jack! Sayid needs help.
JACK Where is he?
JIN With Hurley at the van. Two minutes away.
JULIET Help.
JIN He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.
JULIET Help me.
SAWYER So what do you say, doc? Got another great idea to save Sayid? Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
KATE Hey, shut up!
JULIET Help.
SAWYER Juliet!
JULIET James?
KATE Oh, my God.
SAWYER Juliet!
HURLEY Oh, God. Oh, God, this is gross.
HURLEY Don't worry, dude. Everything's gonna be fine.
SAYID When I die... what do you think will happen to me?
HURLEY Just--just try not to talk, dude.
SAYID I've tortured more people than I can remember. I murdered. Wherever I'm going...  it can't be very pleasant.
HURLEY Sayid, come on.
SAYID I deserve it.
HURLEY Hello? Jin?
HURLEY Jin!
HURLEY I've got a gun!
HURLEY And I know how to shoot it!
JACOB Hello, Hugo. You got a minute?
JIN 저 사람들을 뭘 쳐다봐?
SUN 아니... 그냥 너무 행복해보여서요.
JIN 단추 채워라.
BOONE You're wasting your time, man. This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.
LOCKE Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, we could survive a water landing. And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough to keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts...
LOCKE What?
BOONE No, it's just impressive you know that. So what were you doing in Australia? Business or pleasure?
LOCKE Pleasure. You?
BOONE I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship that it turns out she didn't want to get out of. So... here I am. So what, you were just Down Under for vacation?
LOCKE Actually, I went on a walkabout.
BOONE Really? Like--like Crocodile Dundee?
LOCKE No, not exactly. But--but, uh, it was pretty intense. We--we spent ten days in the Outback and, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives. We slept under the stars and made our own fires, hunted our own food.
BOONE Wow. I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.
BOONE You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
LOCKE Why would I pull your leg?
BOONE This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.
LOCKE You can stop staring at the fire. Jacob's gone. He's gone.
BEN Why didn't he fight back? Why did he let me just kill him?
LOCKE I guess he knew that he was beaten. Ben... I want you to go outside and tell Richard that I need to talk to him.
BEN Talk to him about... what?
LOCKE That's between me and Richard.
RICHARD There's no other reason.
BRAM No, that's not how it's gonna be.
RICHARD You have to--you're not going in there.
RICHARD No
RICHARD Just back up a little. Okay?
SUN Who are they?
LAPIDUS Other than the fact that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us, all I know is they knocked me out and dragged my ass to some cabin, which they promptly burned, then... brought me here along with the dead guy in the box. They say they're the good guys.
LAPIDUS I'm not buying it either.
RICHARD Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully. No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.
ILANA Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.
RICHARD Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue doesn't mean you're in charge.
ILANA Then who is?
BEN Richard.
RICHARD Ben. What happened in there?
BEN Everything's fine. John wants to speak to you.
ILANA Is Jacob all right?
BEN I'm sorry. Who are you?
RICHARD Answer her question, Ben.
BEN Well, of course Jacob's all right. They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.
RICHARD John wants to talk to me?
BEN That's right.
BEN Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.
RICHARD Well, I'm happy to talk to John. But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.
SAWYER Hang on, Juliet! We're comin'!
JACK Jin! Flashlight!
SAWYER If we can move this beam, I think I can get down there.
SAWYER It's too heavy... we need something to pull it. Jin! The van. There's chains in it. Go get 'em!
HURLEY Where you goin', dude? And what are you doin' here? I mean... I meet you in a taxi and you know everything about me and you give me a plane ticket which just so happens to get me back on this Island. How'd you know that was gonna happen?
HURLEY Hello? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?
HURLEY Look, my friend Jin is gonna be here any second so you better stop ignoring--
JACOB Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.
HURLEY Why not?
JACOB Because I died an hour ago.
HURLEY Sorry, dude, that sucks.
JACOB Thanks.
HURLEY How'd you die?
JACOB I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.
HURLEY You want me to do something crazy again, don't you?
JACOB No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.
HURLEY Well that's why Jin went to go get Jack...
JACOB Jin can't help him. You need to take Sayid to the Temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there.
HURLEY The Temple? I'm supposed to know what that is?
JACOB Jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the French team. Through that opening you can get into the Temple. You still have that guitar case I gave you?
HURLEY Yeah...
JACOB Bring it.
HURLEY Who are you, dude?
JACOB I'm Jacob.
JIN Hurley! Help me with Sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help.
JIN Come on, we have to go!
HURLEY Jin, if I asked you to take me to where there's, like, a hole in the wall... where you went with the French team... would you know what I was talkin' about?
JIN Yes.
HURLEY Good.
JACK I'll get the chain.
SAWYER Juliet!
KATE Stop it! Stop, Sawyer! The van is here, the chains are coming.
SAWYER She ain't makin' any more noises...
KATE No, she knows we're here. She's probably just resting.
SAWYER Juliet!
SAWYER If she dies, I'll kill him.
CINDY Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about, but if there is a doctor onboard could you please press your call button?
CINDY Sir? You're a doctor?
JACK Yes.
CINDY Could you come with me please?
CINDY We appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom about half an hour ago and he's not responding when we knock.
CINDY This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there--"
EMPLOYEE Well, I think he tampered with the lock, it's... it's jammed or something, I don't know.
SAYID Can I be of assistance?
SAYID Excuse me.
JACK He's not breathing.
SAWYER What's goin' on back there, Earheart?
CINDY Everything's fine sir, please just stay in your seats.
SAWYER ...yeah, looks peachy.
JACK ...Sir, I'm gonna need your help.
SAYID What can I do?
JACK I need ya to hold this over his mouth... hold it there and do not let any air escape.
SAYID OK, now?
JACK Yes, now.
JACK Somethings blocking his air passage. I'm gonna have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp - a razor...
JACK I gotta pen.
SAYID A pen!?
CINDY It's regulation, there's nothing sharp.
JACK A pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damnit.
JACK I got it, I got it. Relax, just relax, breathe.
CHARLIE Am I alive?
JACK Yeah, you're alive.
CHARLIE ...Terrific.
JACK You got it?
SAWYER Okay Jin! We're good down here! ...hit it!
SAWYER Gimme the flashlight.
SAWYER Juliet! Okay...I'm comin... Juliet? Hey, I'm here, come on baby, come on wake up.
JULIET Hi.
SAWYER Hey.
JULIET Wh-Wh-Where are we?
SAWYER Don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you outta here, okay?
JULIET It didn't work, we're still on the Island.
SAWYER It's okay, It's okay, I just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay?
JULIET No, I hit the bomb and you're still here.
SAWYER You what? ...You hit the bomb? Why?
JULIET I wanted you to be able to go home. I wanted to make it so you never came to this damn Island ...it didn't work.
SAWYER Don't you worry about that. You're gonna be OK. I'm gonna get you outta here and we're all gonna go home together, you hear me?
KATE Sawyer!?
JACK Even if I could get the bullet out, bleeding won't stop, there's nothing I can do for him.
HURLEY There's somethin' I can do. There's a temple, if we can get Sayid there we can save him.
MILES And you know this how?
HURLEY This guy Jacob told me just before we got here.
JACK Who's Jacob?
HURLEY Does it matter? Can you fix Sayid, Jack?
JACK No.
HURLEY Then you're gonna have to let me do it.
RICHARD Ben, you need to talk to me. I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there. What happened to Jacob.
RICHARD You and I have known each other for 30 years Ben, I'm asking you this as a friend.
BEN You wanna know what happened Richard? Why don't 'cha go inside and find out.
RICHARD What are ya doin?
BRAM We're goin in, and he's comin' with us.
LOCKE Where's Richard?
BEN He's not coming.
LOCKE Then who is that behind you?
BRAM Where's Jacob?
LOCKE Jacob is dead.
BRAM Who are you?
LOCKE Don't worry about me. Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are, what? Jacobs bodyguards? And that you came all the way to this Island to protect him? Well I have good news, Jacob burned up, right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free.
BRAM Kill him! Spread out! Get him! ...where is he?
LOCKE I'm sorry you had to see me like that.
KATE Sawyer!? Is she ok?
SAWYER Working on it!
SAWYER Okay, okay, I got'cha, I got'cha. Don't worry.
JULIET We can get coffee some time.
SAWYER I gotta get you outta here.
JULIET We can go dutch.
SAWYER Juliet...it's me.
JULIET ...James.
SAWYER Yeah.
JULIET Kiss me.
SAWYER You got it Blondie.
JULIET I have to tell you something, it's really really important.
SAWYER You tell me... you tell me...
SAWYER Juliet? You tell me ...oh...oh my god
SAWYER You did this.
CHARLIE Should'a let that happen man, I was supposed to die.
CINDY Don't take it personally, some people just don't know how to say thanks.
JACK Excuse me, do you know what happened to the guy that was sitting next to me?
ROSE Um, we were asleep.
NORRIS Ladies and Gentlemen, captain Norris here, we're now beginning our final descent into Los Angeles international airport, I'm happy to tell you it's a beautiful day in Los Angeles, 72 degrees, 6 miles visibility and winds outta the south-west at 5 miles an hour.
ROSE Buckle up. We're almost home.
NORRIS I'll be putting on the fasten seat belt sign now, we'll be on the ground in just a few minutes, thank you so much for flying Oceanic Air.
