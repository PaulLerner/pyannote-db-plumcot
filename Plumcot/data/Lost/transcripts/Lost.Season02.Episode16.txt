jinsoo_kwon 자기야, 뭐 해? 안 자?
sunhwa_kwon 곧 가요.
jinsoo_kwon 와, 근사한데.
sunhwa_kwon 왜 그래...
jinsoo_kwon 돌아 봐 봐.
sunhwa_kwon 자기야...
jinsoo_kwon 한 번만. 부탁합니다, 돌아봐 주세요.
jinsoo_kwon 체온은 쟀지?
sunhwa_kwon 분위기 다 망치네.
jinsoo_kwon 미안해. 난 그저... 지난 1년 동안 노력해도 아무 소식이 없어서... 우리 병원에 가자.
sunhwa_kwon 병원?
jinsoo_kwon 불임 전문의한테.
sunhwa_kwon 애랑 놀아줄 시간도 없으면서 애 욕심은...
jinsoo_kwon 내 핑계 대지 마. 다 일 때문에...
sunhwa_kwon 일 때문에? 피 묻힌 손으로 집에 들어오는 것은 일이 아니에요!
jinsoo_kwon 당신은 내 손에 왜 피가 묻었다고 생각해? 어? 피를 묻히게 한 사람은 당신 아버지야! 다 아버님이 시킨거야!
jinsoo_kwon 다른 뜻은 없었어... 정말 미안해. 우리한테 애가 생기면, 아버님도 생각이 바뀌실 걸? 손주가 생기면 혹시 알아? 좀 더 안전한 일자리를 주실지... 아이가 생기면 모든게 변할 거야. 아이만 생기면 다... 좋아질거야.
sunhwa_kwon 여보! 깜짝이야.
jinsoo_kwon 얼마나 찾았는데! 여기서 뭐 하고 있는거야!
sunhwa_kwon 뭐 하기는? 밭에서 일하고 있잖아요.
jinsoo_kwon 어서 돌아가자!
sunhwa_kwon 뭐? 싫어!
jinsoo_kwon 당장 가자니까! 또 납치당하고 싶어?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐라구요?
jinsoo_kwon 바로 여기서 놈들한테 당했잖아! 우리 얘기한거 다 잊어먹었어? 가자 어서!
sunhwa_kwon 이런 식으로 날 보호할 필요는 없어요! 그냥 내 밭에서 일하게 내버려 둬.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐? 내 밭?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐 하는 거야!
jinsoo_kwon 이제 여기 올 필요 없지? 이제 갈까?
john_locke You were running like the devil's chasing you.
ana_lucia_cortez Maybe he is.
john_locke Good for you, keeping in shape.
ana_lucia_cortez What do you want, Locke?
john_locke What do I want?
ana_lucia_cortez I've been here over a week -- you've never said 2 words to me. And now you're sitting outside my tent?
john_locke We've got a man locked up down in the Hatch. There's a possibility he's one of them -- the Others.
ana_lucia_cortez Who's we?
john_locke Me and Jack. He's keeping watch right now.
ana_lucia_cortez How long's he been down there?
john_locke 3 days. I'd like you to talk with him. You have experience with the Others. You were a cop. Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out if this man's telling the truth.
ana_lucia_cortez Does Jack know you're coming to me with this?
john_locke We've got a serious problem, Ana Lucia -- all of us. I'm taking the necessary steps to solve it. I don't need Jack's permission to talk with you because right now there's a man sitting in a room in my hatch and I want him out.
rose_nadler I don't have to give you anything. It's the thought that counts. You just didn't think.
bernard_nadler I think all the time. You know, maybe you should think about giving me a little bit of a break here.
rose_nadler Oh, just hush, Bernard. Just hush.
rose_nadler Honey? Are you alright?
sunhwa_kwon I'm -- I think I'm just a little lightheaded.
bernard_nadler You look as pale as a sheet.
rose_nadler Well, give her some water.
bernard_nadler Yes, ma'am.
rose_nadler Don't pay him any mind, honey. He's just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday.
bernard_nadler I didn't forget. I don't even know what day of the week it is, Rose.
rose_nadler It's Saturday, Bernard. Honey, can you walk?
sunhwa_kwon Really, I'm alright.
bernard_nadler Maybe we should go get Jin?
sunhwa_kwon No -- I think I was just out in the sun too long.
rose_nadler Well, you spent a lot of time around the baby maybe you caught something. At least talk to Jack.
sunhwa_kwon Really, I'm okay. Thank you -- both of you.
jaehyeok_lee 교통이 많이 막히진 않았죠?
sunhwa_kwon 맨날 똑같죠, 뭐.
jaehyeok_lee 진수 씨가 여기 오는거 아시죠?
sunhwa_kwon 아니오.
jaehyeok_lee 난 얘기할 줄 알았는데...
sunhwa_kwon 그럴 수가 없었어요.
sunhwa_kwon 많이 바쁘실 텐데, 이렇게 시간 내주셔서 고마워요.
jaehyeok_lee 호텔 매니저나 회장님 외아들만이 할 수 있잖아요... 근무 시간이 자유로운 편인거. 방도 이 정도면 괜찮은 것 같은데요. 마실 것 좀 드릴까요?
sunhwa_kwon 그냥 아이스티 주세요.
jaehyeok_lee In English.
sunhwa_kwon I would like iced-tea, please.
jaehyeok_lee Very good.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
jaehyeok_lee 괜찮아요?
sunhwa_kwon 네.
jaehyeok_lee 무슨 고민 있으세요?
sunhwa_kwon 아니에요...
jaehyeok_lee 나중에라도 마음이 바뀌시면... 뭐 그렇다고 제가 충고할 입장도 아니지만... 그래도 선 씨가 영어를 잘 하시면 진수씨가 좋아하실걸요?
sunhwa_kwon 어떻게 배웠냐고... 누구한테 배웠냐고 하면 뭐라고 해요?
jaehyeok_lee 우리가 이렇게 만나는 것이 불편하시면 그만 하죠.
sunhwa_kwon 그러길 원하세요?
jaehyeok_lee 아니오. 사실은 저한테도 공부가 많이 돼요.
john_locke Morning, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard You couldn't wait 'til I was done in here?
john_locke The steam opens up my pores. A man's got no shaving cream, he's got to improvise. I also thought this might be a good time to talk about our problem.
dr_jack_shephard Our problem?
john_locke Our Henry problem. We've had him locked up for 3 days now, and I can't help but get the sense that he's just not motivated to cooperate with us.
dr_jack_shephard And how are we going to motivate him?
john_locke I don't think there's anything we can do. I think we need to bring in some new blood.
dr_jack_shephard Obviously, you have someone in mind.
john_locke What do you think about Ana Lucia?
dr_jack_shephard Why her?
john_locke She's the one you went to to start an army to fight these people -- why not her? Unless you're worried about what she'll do to him.
dr_jack_shephard I'll talk to her.
john_locke I already did. In there with him now.
ben_linus Were you on the plane, too?
ana_lucia_cortez I was in the tail section. We crashed on the other side of the Island.
ben_linus You walked across all the way here? That must have been fun.
ana_lucia_cortez It had its moments. So, are you going to tell me your story, Henry?
ben_linus Why bother, I've already told it to everyone -- Jack, Locke, the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me. Oh, yeah, and my buddy, Sayid. You can see how much he liked my story.
ana_lucia_cortez So how about you try me.
ben_linus I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why are you going to help me get out of here?
ana_lucia_cortez On the other side of the Island there was this guy with us. I was 100 percent convinced that he wasn't on the plane. So I dug a hole and I threw him in it.
ben_linus And what happened?
ana_lucia_cortez I was wrong. And now he's dead. But good news for you Henry -- I don't make the same mistake twice. So how about you tell me your story?
sunhwa_kwon Sawyer?
james_ford Well, hey there, Sunshine, what can I do for you?
sunhwa_kwon How's your book?
james_ford Predictable -- not nearly enough sex.
sunhwa_kwon I heard that you have all the medical supplies.
james_ford You heard correct.
sunhwa_kwon May I look through them?
james_ford No you may not. But if you'll tell me what you're looking for...
sunhwa_kwon Forget it.
james_ford Okay, hold on. Now I'm intrigued. Tell you what, tell me what you're looking for and it's yours, gratis.
sunhwa_kwon Can't I just look myself?
james_ford It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.
sunhwa_kwon I need a pregnancy test.
dr_jack_shephard Can't hear anything.
john_locke She's only been in there about 30 minutes.
dr_jack_shephard How do you know he hasn't snapped her neck, John?
john_locke How do you know she hasn't snapped his?
ana_lucia_cortez So let me get this straight -- you and your wife travel around the world and crash here in a smiley-face balloon? Then she dies. You get captured by a French chick who brings you here, and then they lock you up.
ben_linus It sounds kind of silly when you say it like that.
ana_lucia_cortez Why don't you have a beard?
ben_linus Because I shaved -- because I needed something normal.
ana_lucia_cortez Okay, so why don't you draw me a map to your balloon? We'll go out there, we'll find it, and everybody will believe you.
ben_linus That's what they all keep asking me to do -- draw a map. And if I mess up they'll crucify me.
ana_lucia_cortez You flew around the world in a balloon and you don't think you can draw up a good map?
ben_linus Air travel -- it's a different animal. It's about wind currents and...
ana_lucia_cortez Do you or do you not know where it is?
ben_linus Yeah, I know where it is. I went back there to bury my wife.
ana_lucia_cortez Why'd you do that?
ben_linus Because our balloon was the closest thing we had to home. You people have been looking for someone to punish for everything that's happened to you -- someone to blame -- and now you've got him. It doesn't matter what I do, I'm dead already.
ana_lucia_cortez You draw up that map, Henry. I'll find your balloon. But if you don't, things are going to play out just like you said.
hugo_reyes Hey, Sun. Look what I found in the middle of the jungle. It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh? You want to split it?
sunhwa_kwon No. No, thank you. I was just heading to the beach.
hugo_reyes Okay, well, later, dude.
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 안녕하세요, 미스터 권. 아, 선화 씨. 죄송합니다, 오래 기다리게 해서. 아버님은 건강하시죠?
sunhwa_kwon 네, 덕분에요.
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 아버님께 안부 좀 전해주시죠.
sunhwa_kwon 그럼요. 다른 환자분들도 많으실 텐데 이렇게 시간 내 주셔서 감사합니다.
jinsoo_kwon 선생님, 결과는요?
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 말씀드리기가... 별로 좋지 않습니다. 초음파 검사 결과, 부인의 나팔관은 조직 상처로 인해 다 막혀있습니다. 그래서... 수술을 하더라도... 임신 가능성은... 불가능합니다
jinsoo_kwon 고칠 수 없을까요? 어떻게 해서라도...
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 글쎄, 저는... 죄송합니다.
jinsoo_kwon 결혼하기 전부터 알고 있었어?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐요?
jinsoo_kwon 전혀 몰랐단 말야?
sunhwa_kwon 이런 사실을 내가 왜 숨기겠어요? 아, 그렇지. 내가 어떻게 당신같은 잘난 남자를 꼬셨겠어요?
ana_lucia_cortez Coming out.
ana_lucia_cortez He told me the same story he told you.
john_locke You believe him?
ana_lucia_cortez I don't know yet. I need more time with him.
john_locke He's all yours.
ana_lucia_cortez Tomorrow. I want to give him some time to think. If that's okay with you.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't tell anyone, Ana.
ana_lucia_cortez No worries, man.
charlie_pace A bit large for a dining room table, isn't it?
sayid_jarrah If we cut them in two, it will suit the purpose.
ana_lucia_cortez Sayid, can I talk to you?
sayid_jarrah Of course.
ana_lucia_cortez Alone?
sayid_jarrah Whatever you need to say you can say it here.
ana_lucia_cortez It's about the Hatch.
charlie_pace You mean the guy locked in the closet there? What about him?
ana_lucia_cortez It's to his balloon.
sayid_jarrah How did you get him to do this?
ana_lucia_cortez I asked nicely.
sayid_jarrah Do Jack and Locke know about this?
ana_lucia_cortez Jack and Locke are a little too busy worrying about Locke and Jack. All I want to know is if this guy's telling the truth.
sayid_jarrah Why come to me?
ana_lucia_cortez Judging from what you did to his face that's what you want, too.
sayid_jarrah This is at least a day's walk.
ana_lucia_cortez Then we should get going.
ana_lucia_cortez You okay?
charlie_pace I'm alright. Thanks.
sayid_jarrah That cliff there appears to be this .
ana_lucia_cortez Score one for Henry.
sayid_jarrah Pointing out a geographical touchstone does not mean he's leading us to a balloon.
ana_lucia_cortez Maybe not, but at least we're on the right island.
charlie_pace Humor's not his strong suit. And I'm saying this to you.
charlie_pace You looking at my bum?
ana_lucia_cortez No, I'm looking at your gun.
charlie_pace My what?
ana_lucia_cortez Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it.
charlie_pace Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun you murdered someone.
sayid_jarrah That's enough.
sayid_jarrah We'll go as far as the base of the cliff and we'll camp there.
sunhwa_kwon How long is it supposed to take?
kate_austen Uh, up to two minutes.
sunhwa_kwon I'm sorry -- I'm just...
kate_austen I know. Where did Sawyer find one of these anyway? I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right?
sunhwa_kwon Have you ever taken one?
kate_austen Yeah.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you for waiting with me and not asking why you're here and not Jin.
kate_austen You're welcome. It's time.
kate_austen You're pregnant.
sunhwa_kwon Is it 100 percent sure?
kate_austen There's only one way to find out.
dr_jack_shephard These tests are pretty accurate. You know, a false negative in the first week maybe, but positive is a positive.
sunhwa_kwon But it's impossible.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, it's possible. You feeling queasy, lightheaded?
sunhwa_kwon Please, Jack. This is private, nobody can know.
kate_austen You're not going to tell Jin?
sunhwa_kwon In time I will, it's just -- it's complicated.
dr_jack_shephard As complicated as Jin being the last one on the Island to find out you spoke English? Sun, my advice -- and it's just that because I'm the last person to ask about this, but -- you should tell him. And when you do, you should tell him everything -- the whole truth. I'm going to get back to the Hatch. Congratulations, Sun.
kate_austen You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay?
dr_jack_shephard Sure, yeah, everything's fine.
kate_austen Are you okay? Sun?
jaehyeok_lee Sun? Sun. Sun are you alright?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, I'm fine.
jaehyeok_lee You were distracted for our entire lesson. You're not fine.
sunhwa_kwon We -- Jin and I went to see a doctor. He said I cannot have children.
jaehyeok_lee I'm very sorry, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon I was glad.
jaehyeok_lee 우리가 여기서 뭐하는 거죠?
sunhwa_kwon 저한테 영어를 가르쳐 주시고 있잖아요.
jaehyeok_lee 선 씨는 이미 한달 전부터 영어를 유창하게 하는데요, 왜 영어를 배우려는 거죠?
sunhwa_kwon 저... 미국에 가려고요.
jaehyeok_lee 진수 씨하고... 헤어질 생각이세요? 난 한 여자 때문에 미국으로 도망갔었어요. 그것이 사랑인줄 알고... 하지만 자기 인생에서 도망갈 순 없죠.
sunhwa_kwon 그럼... 그 사람이 제 인생의 전부인가요? 저는요?
jaehyeok_lee I'm not saying you should stay for Jin.
ana_lucia_cortez Do you mind?
sayid_jarrah You should sleep while you can.
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, I can't sleep. People don't like me. I tried to get them to most of my life. I guess I just gave up a while back. I mean, I am what I am. But you -- you've got a good reason to hate me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did.
sayid_jarrah You were trying to protect your people. It wasn't you that killed Shannon; it was them. And once we find out he is one of them then something will have to be done.
ana_lucia_cortez What?
sayid_jarrah Nothing.
ana_lucia_cortez It's going to rain.
sayid_jarrah We should get moving.
charlie_pace Morning! Who wants breakfast? I have papayas and papayas.
sayid_jarrah Let's go.
charlie_pace Right, why eat?
sayid_jarrah This is it.
charlie_pace This balloon would be rather large, right?
sayid_jarrah Why am I not surprised?
ana_lucia_cortez We need to look some more.
sayid_jarrah This is where he said it would be.
ana_lucia_cortez If I'm going to back your play on this, Sayid, we need to be sure.
sayid_jarrah I'll divide the area into 3 grids, so search as thoroughly as you please.
bernard_nadler Oh, for the love of god.
jinsoo_kwon 펼쳐 놔야지. 한데 모아놓지 말고, 펼쳐 놔야 돼.
bernard_nadler Oh, no, no, no, it's not for fish.
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 아뇨...
bernard_nadler No, no, no, oysters. Pearl, for Rose.
jinsoo_kwon Ahhh.
bernard_nadler Pearl.
jinsoo_kwon 시간 낭비하지 마세요. No oyster. No oyster here.
bernard_nadler Ah, of course not. Why would there be?
james_ford Yo, Daddy-o.
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer.
james_ford Way to go, Papa-san. You didn't waste much time. I'd give you a cigar, Bernie, but I'm fresh out.
bernard_nadler Sun's pregnant?
james_ford Keep it down there, Suzie; I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet.
sunhwa_kwon 여기서 뭐하는 거에요?
jinsoo_kwon 내가 잘못했으니까 바로 해 놔야지.
sunhwa_kwon 그럴 필요는 없는데...
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 내가 그렇게 했잖아. 자기야... 난 니가 필요해.
sunhwa_kwon 네?
jinsoo_kwon 난 이런건 너무 싫어. 자꾸 싸우는 거. 근데 내가 어떻게 해야... 다른 사람들하고 얘기도 할 수 없어. 의사소통이 전혀 안 돼. 난 당신이 필요해.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨, 난...
jinsoo_kwon 아냐, 괜찮아... 미안하다. 다 내가 못나서...
sunhwa_kwon 나 임신했어요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐? 임신?
sunhwa_kwon 임신이요, 여보.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨, 내 말 좀 들어.
jinsoo_kwon 왜?
sunhwa_kwon 당신한테... 당신한테 할 얘기가 있어요.
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 백선화 씨! 선 씨!
sunhwa_kwon 김 선생님?
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 잠깐 차에 타시죠.
sunhwa_kwon 왜요? 무슨 일이시죠?
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 잠시 드릴 말씀이 있습니다.
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 잠시만요! 잠깐이면 돼요. 선 씨, 지난번엔 제가 큰 잘못을 했습니다. 사실은요, 선 씨에게 문제가 있는게 아니고요...
sunhwa_kwon 네?
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 부군에게 문제가 있습니다.
sunhwa_kwon 아니, 뭐 때문에 그런...
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 그땐 제가 어떻게 할 수가 없었어요. 죄송합니다, 정말 죄송합니다. 부군께서 아버님 밑에서 일하지 않습니까. 그런 사람에게 제가 사실대로 마냥 다 얘기했다면 그 분은 제 병원을 불살라 버렸을 겁니다!
sunhwa_kwon 왜 이 얘기를 이제 하시는 거죠?
dr_jegyu_kim KIM 선 씨가 이 사실을 다 아셔야 하니까요.
jinsoo_kwon 왜 나한테 얘기 안 했어?
sunhwa_kwon 어떻게 얘기를 해요...
jinsoo_kwon 아니 만약 내가... 나한테 문제가 있다면... 어떻게 아이가 생길 수 있지?
sunhwa_kwon 당신한테 맹세하는데... 나한테는 당신 뿐이야. 그게 사실이고.
jinsoo_kwon 그랬다면... 이건 기적이야.
jinsoo_kwon 만약 아들이면, 우리 아버지 이름에서 한 자를 따면 어떨까?
sunhwa_kwon 하나는 우리 엄마 이름으로 해요.
jinsoo_kwon 사람들에게 알려도 돼?
sunhwa_kwon 잭하고 케이트는 벌써 알고 있고... 아마 소이어도 알고 있을 거에요.
jinsoo_kwon Daddy-o. 그럼 버나드도 알고 있겠네?
sunhwa_kwon 섬에서 아마 모르는 사람 없을걸요?
jinsoo_kwon 배 안 고파? 우리 점심 먹으러 가자.
sunhwa_kwon 나, 한 20분만이라도 혼자 있고 싶은데... 그냥 혼자서... 당신이 괜찮다면.
jinsoo_kwon 그럼 그렇게 해. 바닷가에서 보자.
sunhwa_kwon 사랑해.
jinsoo_kwon I love you.
dr_jack_shephard How is it?
ben_linus Men reject their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain. So what's the difference between a martyr and a prophet?
dr_jack_shephard Either way, it sounds like you end up dead.
ben_linus That's the spirit.
dr_jack_shephard In the mood for some breakfast?
ben_linus What's the computer for?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing.
ben_linus Cereal? Wow, where'd you guys get cereal?
john_locke It was down here all along. The pantry's full of food.
ben_linus How old is it? You guys don't know much, huh? I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here. You guys don't even seem that curious.
dr_jack_shephard Do you want the cereal or don't you?
ben_linus This must be my reward for good behavior, huh? I guess I earned myself some good will for finally drawing that map for Ana.
john_locke What map?
ben_linus To my balloon.
dr_jack_shephard Did you...
john_locke No.
ben_linus Wow, you guys have some real trust issues, don't you? Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you. I mean, with the two of you fighting all the time. Of course, if I was one of them -- these people that you seem to think are your enemies -- what would I do? Well, there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map to a real secluded place like a cave or some underbrush -- good place for a trap -- an ambush. And when your friends got there a bunch of my people would be waiting for them. Then they'd use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh? You guys got any milk?
