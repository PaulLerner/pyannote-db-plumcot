james_ford Ow. Son of a bitch. What the hell are you doing?
kate_austen What the hell are you doing?
james_ford It's my knee. You practically busted my damn knee.
kate_austen You stalking me, now?
james_ford Stalking you? I was protecting you.
kate_austen From what? Southern perverts?
james_ford Yeah, whatever. I can't believe you.
kate_austen It's not that bad.
james_ford It's my knee. I'll tell you how bad it is. What the hell you doing out here anyway?
kate_austen Everyone's been eating a lot. This is the only place the trees aren't picked clean.
james_ford Yeah, well, you shouldn't be out here alone. Not after what happened...
kate_austen No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.
james_ford Oh, of course. I don't need protection. I can take care of myself. Me Kate. Me throw rock.
kate_austen Shhhh.
james_ford What? You smell blood on the wind?
kate_austen You don't hear that?
kate_austen What are you doing?
james_ford I need to soak my sore knee. Come on, Freckles, after all we've been through on this damn Island, don't we deserve something good? What? You going to say no? You some sort of navel-gazing, no-fun, mopey type?
james_ford Well, ... it's chilly. Come on, girl, woohoo. It's nice, huh? C'mon, what you got? C'mon, let's go up the rocks. C'mon.
james_ford Hey, are you okay?
kate_austen Yeah. Yeah, you?
james_ford Yeah, I'm going to go check them out.
kate_austen Check them out for what?
james_ford See what they got on them.
kate_austen Sawyer!
james_ford Hey, I got myself a wallet.
kate_austen You're disgusting.
james_ford He ain't gonna miss it.
kate_austen Help me get that case.
james_ford Oh, I'm disgusting, but you're not?
kate_austen It's mine.
james_ford Wouldn't happen to have your key on you, would you? That case ain't yours, is it?
kate_austen No.
james_ford Well, you wouldn't mind if I just -- take it.
kate_austen I don't care.
james_ford Not what it looks like. Something you want to tell me about this little suitcase, Freckles?
kate_austen Take it.
sayid_jarrah Everything is getting washed out to sea. This can't be normal. The tide shifting so suddenly, rising in so short a time.
dr_jack_shephard There's a lot not normal around here. At the rate this beach is eroding this fuselage is going to be underwater in a matter of days. We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall.
sayid_jarrah I just hope that moving up the coast will make a difference.
dr_jack_shephard It would make a difference if everyone moved inland.
sayid_jarrah I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle after what happened to the pregnant girl. Not to mention whatever that thing is.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, I need you to take me back to the French woman, Rousseau. Claire's still out there. Now, Rousseau mentioned that there are others on this Island.
sayid_jarrah Her mind is gone.
dr_jack_shephard You heard them yourself.
sayid_jarrah I don't know what I heard.
dr_jack_shephard You said that when you...
sayid_jarrah The wind, Jack. It was the wind playing tricks.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, then, what about the papers that you took from her -- the documents, the maps. I mean, isn't there anything here that. . .
sayid_jarrah I'm skilled at mathematics and decryption, but these equations are beyond anything I've ever seen. There are these notes in French accompanying some of the maps and diagrams. If I could translate them I might be able to make sense of it, but. . .
dr_jack_shephard What?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps some things are best left untranslated.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? Maybe you should tell him that.
boone_carlyle Glad to see you're doing something productive with your time.
shannon_rutherford Where have you been?
boone_carlyle What do you mean where have I been?
shannon_rutherford You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for the last 4 days. What are you doing out there? Is he your new boyfriend?
boone_carlyle We're looking for Claire.
shannon_rutherford I thought there was no trail anymore -- that no one even knew where to look.
boone_carlyle Yeah, well, at least I'm doing something. Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just -- you're useless.
Mark#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Hutton Okay, Ms. Ryan, if you'll just give me some ID, we'll get started on your loan app.
kate_austen Okay, here you go.
hutton So what brings you to New Mexico?
kate_austen My work.
hutton And what line of work is that?
kate_austen I'm a photographer.
hutton What do you photograph?
kate_austen I've been commissioned for a coffee-table book. Uh, pictures of old theaters in small towns.
hutton Oh, there's a fantastic one down in Ruidoso. You can't miss it. It's right off the main road.
kate_austen Well, if I end up using it, I'll have to make sure I give you acknowledgment, Mr. -- Hutton.
hutton Mark.
ROBBERS#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Everyone down on the ground. Down on the ground, now.
ROBBERS#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Don't. Don't even think about it. Let's go. Shut up and move over there. Let's go. Move. Who's back there, I see you. All right, big boy, get your ass down there! Get out. Alright, girlie, get up and get over there! Let's go, move. Stay there, right there! Get down on the floor, bitch! Are you the manager?! I said, are you the manager?!
hutton Yes.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Good. Then let's open the money cage now, before people start getting killed.
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 #2 Don't look at me, look at the floor.
james_ford Gotcha.
kate_austen Get off of me.
james_ford Golly, I hate to bicker about positions, sweetheart. But I think you're the one on top. Maybe you're not here for the case at all.
james_ford Ow, woman. If you wanted to play rough, all you had to do was say so. You want to try for it again?
kate_austen Give it to me.
james_ford No.
sayid_jarrah We're quite close to the equator. The sun might be stronger than what you're used to.
shannon_rutherford I have a pretty good base.
sayid_jarrah There was a matter I was going to ask you about.
shannon_rutherford What?
sayid_jarrah I need a favor. I need your help translating some papers I took from Rousseau.
shannon_rutherford Who's Rousseau?
sayid_jarrah The French woman -- the distress call we intercepted.
shannon_rutherford Did my brother put you up to this?
sayid_jarrah Your brother? No. The papers contain equations accompanied by notations in French. If I could understand the notations, then-
shannon_rutherford Sorry, can't do it.
sayid_jarrah You're the only person on this Island who speaks French.
shannon_rutherford I barely speak French.
sayid_jarrah Please, Shannon, can you at least try?
james_ford Son of a bitch!
michael_dawson You're wasting your time, man. If you pick the lock on a Halliburton, I'll put you on my back and fly us to LA.
james_ford You better find yourself a runway, daddy, cuz there ain't a lock I can't pick.
hugo_reyes What's he trying to do?
michael_dawson Pick the lock on a Halliburton.
hugo_reyes Good luck.
michael_dawson The only way you're going to open that case is with pure force, man. Impact velocity.
james_ford What the hell is that supposed to mean?
michael_dawson You've got to hit it with something hard, like a sledgehammer. Or the axe.
john_locke You got it?
boone_carlyle Yeah. Right there. Isn't there any easier way to get there?
john_locke The easiest way isn't always the best. Did anybody see you take it?
boone_carlyle No, I don't think so.
john_locke Well, which is it?
boone_carlyle Sorry?
john_locke No? Or, I don't think so?
boone_carlyle No.
john_locke Good. Let's get to work.
rose_nadler Hello, Charlie. Oh, that's right, you're not talking much these days. It doesn't mean you get to be rude.
charlie_pace Excuse me?
rose_nadler Everybody else is helping us move the camp up the beach except for you.
charlie_pace Are you serious?
rose_nadler Do you think you're the only one on this Island that's got something to be sad about? Baby, I've got sob stories for you, so why don't you grab the other end of this thing and help me. Well?
james_ford Come on. Come on, god.
james_ford Impact velocity -- physics my ass. Alright. Son of a... Unbelievable. Hey, hey, don't even think about it! Hey! Damn it.
james_ford Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it. I just didn't know how bad. Whoa-hoa, you're going to have to come up with a new move. Ow, god, okay, okay. Okay, this is just silly. Hold on. I've got a proposition for you. You tell me what's inside and I'll give it to you.
kate_austen Are you serious?
james_ford Hell, no way to open the damn thing. At this point all I care about is satisfying my own curiosity. Whoa, easy, sweetheart, I don't really care what it is. What's burning me up is why it means so much to you. -- Last chance. Alright.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Give me the key, now. I'm tired of asking nice. Give me the money cage key, now.
hutton You're just going to kill me, anyway, why would I give you-
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 You think we're in a conversation, here, huh?
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 #2 Everybody be cool! You want to go home?! Don't look at me, look at the floor! Be calm, stay down!
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Listen to me, I am not going to ask you again. I want that key!
baseball_hat HAT I can take him.
kate_austen What?
baseball_hat HAT The tall guy, he's not watching us... It's now or never. Keep your head down.
baseball_hat HAT Pick it up, pick it up! Shoot him! Shoot him! What's wrong with you, shoot the gun! Turn off the safety!
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Give me that gun.
baseball_hat HAT Other side, turn it off!
kate_austen I don't know how to use a gun!
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 #2 You want to get shot, fat boy, huh?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay, little hero...
kate_austen No, please don't.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Shut up. Let's you and me go talk, huh?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I don't know how to use a gun? That's classic.
kate_austen Yeah.
shannon_rutherford You never said anything about math.
sayid_jarrah You worry about the French, I'll take care of the math.
shannon_rutherford I can't do this.
sayid_jarrah If you really put your mind to it, I know you can, Shannon. Where did you learn to speak French?
shannon_rutherford I knew this guy.
sayid_jarrah This guy?
shannon_rutherford In France, in Saint Tropez. I kind of lived there for a while.
sayid_jarrah Well, they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language.
shannon_rutherford Alright. Let me see.
dr_jack_shephard So, what is this? What is this for?
sunhwa_kwon 두통에 쓰이는 약초인데, 그러니까...
dr_jack_shephard A headache? Oh, cool, alright.
kate_austen Jack? We got a problem.
dr_jack_shephard We have a problem? Or, you have a problem?
kate_austen Jack, you're the only one who knows about me. Before I left the city, the Marshal who was escorting me, he had this silver case. The airline wouldn't let him bring the case on the plane. It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun on his ankle. But the case, they made him check it.
dr_jack_shephard What was in the case?
kate_austen Some traveling money, some of his personal stuff. And 4 nine millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.
dr_jack_shephard Guns?
kate_austen Guns.
dr_jack_shephard So, where is the case now?
kate_austen Sawyer has it.
dr_jack_shephard Aha.
kate_austen He hasn't been able to open it.
dr_jack_shephard Lucky for us.
kate_austen He will. Sooner or later.
dr_jack_shephard So, what do you need me to do?
kate_austen I know where the key is. The Marshal, he kept it in his wallet. In his back pocket.
dr_jack_shephard I buried him, Kate.
kate_austen I know. Where?
dr_jack_shephard So, what else is in the case?
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard What else is in the case, Kate?
kate_austen Nothing.
dr_jack_shephard That's the truth?
kate_austen Just the guns.
dr_jack_shephard If you want my help, we're going to open the case together.
kate_austen Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
charlie_pace Why are you smiling?
rose_nadler Am I?
charlie_pace You look -- happy.
rose_nadler Well, I guess I must be then.
charlie_pace There's no reason to be happy, things are awful.
rose_nadler They're not that awful.
charlie_pace We're stranded on an Island. No one's coming for us.
rose_nadler You don't know that.
charlie_pace Well, what I do know, is there's something in that jungle that eats people. Just because we haven't heard from it in a couple of weeks doesn't mean it won't get hungry again. And I know there's a person, or people, that are trying to hurt us...
rose_nadler Charlie. Nobody blames you.
charlie_pace What?
rose_nadler For what happened to Claire. It's not your fault. You did everything that you could do. And you came very close to dying yourself.
charlie_pace Maybe I should have died.
rose_nadler You know what I think, Charlie? You need to ask for help.
charlie_pace Who's going to help me?
kate_austen So, why didn't you put him with the others, when you burned the fuselage?
dr_jack_shephard Because I needed to bury him.
kate_austen So you ready to do this?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Hell, yeah, by now their imaginations are running wild.
kate_austen Don't hold back. He won't talk if the details are off.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 You and your details, Maggie.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay, hero.
kate_austen No, please don't. I've got...
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Shut up.
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 #3 Everybody just relax. I said quiet.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay, Mr. Manager, you want to be a hard-ass? Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you? Okay? There's going to be consequences.
kate_austen He's going to kill me anyway.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I said... if you don't shut up! You've got 3 seconds to give me that damn key. 1, 2, , 3.
hutton Alright, I'll give it to you.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Good. Let's go, right around here. Let's go.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, alright?
kate_austen Compared to what?
dr_jack_shephard You want me to...
kate_austen No, I'll do it.
dr_jack_shephard Did you get it?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Key isn't in here.
kate_austen It isn't?
dr_jack_shephard No, but that was real good sleight-of-hand distracting me with the wallet. Open it.
kate_austen Jack, I...
dr_jack_shephard Don't. Don't.
shannon_rutherford A des reflets d'argent. La mer des reflets changeants -- the sea of sparkles? No, wait, um, the sea of silver sparkles that change. It's the same as the last one.
sayid_jarrah Are you sure? But the equation is completely different. It doesn't relate. What you're saying doesn't make any sense.
shannon_rutherford Okay?
sayid_jarrah What about this one? It should say something about latitude or longitude, something about the stars...
shannon_rutherford Okay, just give me some room, okay? Um, next to the pond, blue, um, blue eternity, blue eternity? No, wait, no, blue infinity.
sayid_jarrah Blue infinity?
shannon_rutherford Blue infinity. There's something about this that is so familiar.
sayid_jarrah You've been telling me what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour and now it seems to me...
shannon_rutherford Okay, a) I told you that my French sucks, and b) this isn't my nonsense, okay? Did you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island your friend might not be quite adjusted?
sayid_jarrah This was a mistake.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, haven't you heard? I'm completely useless.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer.
james_ford Doctor? What can I do you for? Figured she'd get you to do her dirty work for her. So what? Are we going to wrestle for it?
dr_jack_shephard No, you're going to give it to me.
james_ford Am I?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford I'm just going to give it to you?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford Why would I want to do that?
dr_jack_shephard Cephalexin.
james_ford Yeah, go on?
dr_jack_shephard That's the antibiotic I've been giving you for the knife wound in your arm. You're right in the middle of the treatment cycle now, if I keep giving you the pills you're going to be as right as rain. But I'm going to stop giving you the pills. And for 2 days you're going to think you're all good, then it's going to start to itch. The day after that the fever's going to come and you're going to start seeing red lines running up and down your arm. A day or two after that you'll beg me to take the case, just to cut off your arm.
james_ford That's a nice story, Jack. And, even if it were true, I don't think you could do it.
dr_jack_shephard You're wrong.
james_ford Did she tell you what's inside? Yeah, me neither. Hope you got yourself some jaws-of-life back in cave-town, that's what it's going to take to pop this bitch.
dr_jack_shephard I'll figure something out.
james_ford I know you think you're doing her a favor. But however she talked you into doing this, she lied, brother.
kate_austen Jack?
dr_jack_shephard We're going to do this together.
kate_austen Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because that's what I said we'd do.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 What the hell you waiting for? Open the damn thing. Well, now we're talking. Don't move.
kate_austen Please, don't. I can't...
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Shut up.
hutton I let you in, now please, let the girl go.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Let the girl go? Man, you have no idea, do you? The girl is the one who set you up. The girl picked this bank, picked this vault. This whole thing is the girl's idea.
kate_austen What are you doing?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Easy, Maggie -- just cleaning up after myself.
kate_austen You shoot, I shoot.
hutton Please, what's...
kate_austen I said, no one gets hurt.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I know you're cold, baby. But you're not that cold.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 You shot me, stupid bit...
kate_austen Shut up, Jason.
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 #2 I told you not to trust her.
kate_austen I need the key to safety deposit box 815, now.
hutton Who are you?
kate_austen The key to the box, now.
hutton You need 2 keys. The bank's, and... If you had the customer key, why would you need...
kate_austen I'm not on the signatory card.
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 You put me up to this to get into a safe deposit box? I swear to god, you better kill me, Maggie. Because if you don't...
kate_austen My name's not Maggie. Now, go.
dr_jack_shephard Anything you want to tell me? Alright then.
dr_jack_shephard Is this it? Is this what you wanted?
dr_jack_shephard What is it?
kate_austen It's nothing.
dr_jack_shephard What is it, Kate?
kate_austen You wouldn't understand.
dr_jack_shephard I want the truth, just this once. What is it?
kate_austen It belonged to the man I loved.
dr_jack_shephard The truth.
kate_austen It belonged to the man I loved.
dr_jack_shephard Stop lying and tell me the truth!
kate_austen I'm not! It belonged to the man I killed!
charlie_pace Your husband was in the tail section of the plane.
rose_nadler Yes, he was. But he'll be back.
charlie_pace You think he's still alive?
rose_nadler I know he is.
charlie_pace How?
rose_nadler I just do. It's a fine line between denial and faith. It's much better on my side.
charlie_pace Help me.
rose_nadler Baby, I'm not the one that can help you... Heavenly Father, we thank you. We thank you for bringing us together tonight, and we ask that you show Charlie the path...
shannon_rutherford The guy from Saint Tropez, he had this kid, a real snot, who hated me. His name was Laurent. He watched this movie over and over and over again, everyday, all day, the way kids do, 900 times. It was the cartoon about fish, you know, one of the computer ones?
sayid_jarrah Why are you telling me this?
shannon_rutherford Because the movie was dubbed in French. And at the end there was this song. Those notations, they're song lyrics. And your French woman, she's just like Laurent, because she wrote them over and over and over again.
sayid_jarrah What's the song?
shannon_rutherford La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs. A des reflets d'argent. La mer. Des reflets changeants. Sous la pluie. La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs...
