jacob Извини, что не смог прийти раньше
ilana_verdansky Я очень рада тебя видеть
jacob I'm here because I need your help. Will you help me, Ilana?
ilana_verdansky Yes.
jacob There are six people I need you to protect. I'm gonna give you a list of their names. This is what you've been preparing for.
ilana_verdansky Are these people... who are they?
jacob They're the remaining candidates.
dr_jack_shephard Candidates? Candidates for what?
sunhwa_kwon To replace Jacob. She said I was one of them and so are you and so is Hurley.
frank_lapidus Well, that's great. So what do we do now?
ilana_verdansky I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard Then, who does?
ilana_verdansky After I've brought them to the temple, what do I do?
jacob Ask Ricardus, he'll know what to do next.
hugo_reyes Who's Ricardus?
ilana_verdansky He is. So, Richard, what do we do next?
richard_alpert Uhh.. I have no idea what we do next. You didn't tell your friends that I was trying to kill myself when you found me? That sounds like someone who has a plan?
ilana_verdansky Why would Jacob say you knew what to do if--
richard_alpert Because everything he ever said is a lie.
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about?
richard_alpert You wanna know a secret, Jack? Something I've known a long, long time. You're dead.
hugo_reyes You mean that figuratively right?
richard_alpert No, I mean literally. We are all dead, every single one of us. And this, this, all this, it's not what you think it is. We're not on an island, we never were. We're in Hell. So, I'm not interested in what Jacob said. In fact, maybe it's time to stop listening to him, and we started listening to someone else, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?
ilana_verdansky I'm going after Richard.
dr_jack_shephard Why? You heard him he doesn't... doesn't know what we need to do next.
ilana_verdansky He knows! Jacob told me. He has to know.
dr_jack_shephard Alpert has lost his mind. He thinks that we're, we're in hell. If he cared about what Jacob said, he wouldn't be talking about, about listening to someone else.
dr_jack_shephard Wait, you know who he meant?
ben_linus Oh, this should be interesting.
dr_jack_shephard What?
sunhwa_kwon He meant Locke.
dr_jack_shephard Locke is dead.
ben_linus If it's any consolation, it's not exactly Locke.
hugo_reyes ¿Por qué? Que no sé. Sí, yo te puedo ayudar, pero yo no sé como encontrarlo si no sé cómo.... Why? I don't know. Yes, I can help you, but... I don't know how to find him.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! What's he saying?
hugo_reyes Uh, what's who saying?
dr_jack_shephard Jacob, I saw you talking to him.
hugo_reyes I'm not talking to Jacob.
dr_jack_shephard Don't lie to me. Please, if you know something, anything that can help us figure out--
hugo_reyes It's not Jacob, man!
dr_jack_shephard Then, who is it?
hugo_reyes Sorry Jack, but this has nothing to do with you.
ben_linus Shephard is right, you know.
ilana_verdansky Right about what?
ben_linus Richard. Going after him is a waste of time. He doesn't know anything.
ilana_verdansky And what makes you so sure?
ben_linus I've known him since I was twelve years old, that should count for something.
frank_lapidus So you guys met when you were kids, huh?
ben_linus No Frank, I was a kid. Richard looked just like he does today.
frank_lapidus You're saying this guy doesn't age.
ben_linus That's exactly what I'm saying.
frank_lapidus And how the hell do you think that happened?
isabella ¿Eres tú, Ricardo?
richard_alpert Sí, soy yo.

father_suarez SUAREZ ¿Estás listo para confesarte?
richard_alpert In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amén. Perdóneme, padre, porque he pecado. Padre, yo... yo maté a un hombre. De verdad me arrepiento. Y le ruego, le ruego, padre, por el perdón de Dios.
father_suarez SUAREZ No.
richard_alpert ¿Cómo?
father_suarez SUAREZ No te puedo otorgar la absolución por un asesinato.
richard_alpert Padre, fue un accidente, yo no quería matar a ese señor.
father_suarez SUAREZ Pero lo hiciste.
richard_alpert Por favor, Padre, debe de haber alguna manera para recibir el perdón de Dios
father_suarez SUAREZ La única manera de regresar a Su gracia es a través de la penitencia.
richard_alpert Sí, claro, haré lo que sea.
father_suarez SUAREZ ¡Pero tú no tienes tiempo para nada! Porque mañana... mañana te van a colgar.
father_suarez SUAREZ No, hijo mío. Me temo que el diablo te espera en el infierno. Que Dios tenga misericordia de tu alma. awaits you in hell. May God have mercy on your soul.]
father_suarez SUAREZ Véndenle los ojos.
richard_alpert Señor, por favor, perdona mis pecados, estoy penitente y arrepentido (x4, not clear)

jonas_whitfield Wait! You have strong hands, what sort of work did you do?
richard_alpert I worked...I worked in the fields.

richard_alpert No! What are you doing?
ignacio Se lo ruego. No lo haga. No lo haga, por favor.
jonas_whitfield We are shipwrecked in the middle of the jungle. We have no fresh water, and limited supplies, and there are only five officers left.
richard_alpert Why, why are you doing this?
jonas_whitfield Because if I freed you, it'd only be a matter of time before you tried to kill me.
richard_alpert No!
jonas_whitfield What happened up there?
jonas_whitfield I said report!
richard_alpert Santo Padre que estás en el cielo, santificado sea Tu nombre, vénganos Tu reino.
richard_alpert ¡Vete de aquí! ¡Te voy a matar! ¡Te voy a matar!

richard_alpert ¿Cómo? ¿Antes de que regrese quién?
isabella El diablo. .]
richard_alpert ¿El diablo? ?]
isabella Yo miré en sus ojos, y todo lo que vi fue maldad. ¿Tú lo has visto, Ricardo?
richard_alpert Sí, yo creo que sí.

man_in_black IN BLACK Shhh. Here, water.
richard_alpert Who are you?
man_in_black IN BLACK A friend.
richard_alpert I am... in Hell?
man_in_black IN BLACK Yes, I'm afraid you are.
richard_alpert You... you were not on the ship.
man_in_black IN BLACK I was here long before your ship.
richard_alpert Did... did you see my, my wife?
man_in_black IN BLACK I'm sorry?
richard_alpert Isabella, my wife. She was here. She was. But then the black smoke came and she ran.
man_in_black IN BLACK And she hasn't come back?
man_in_black IN BLACK That probably means he has her.
richard_alpert Who?
man_in_black IN BLACK I think you know who.
richard_alpert If she's alive I must save her, please, please help.
man_in_black IN BLACK Of course. Of Course I'll help. I want to be free too.
man_in_black IN BLACK As luck would have it, I found these on one of the officers outside. I think they'll work. But before I try, I need to know that you will help me.
richard_alpert Yes, yes, yes, I do of course.
man_in_black IN BLACK You'd do anything I ask?
richard_alpert Yes yes, anything, yes, I promise.
man_in_black IN BLACK Then we're agreed.
richard_alpert Thank you.
man_in_black IN BLACK Of course my friend. It's good to see you out of those chains.
richard_alpert Thank you.
man_in_black IN BLACK Got to get you on your feet. Gonna need your strength if we're going to escape.
richard_alpert Escape?
man_in_black IN BLACK That's right. I'm afraid there's only one way to escape from Hell. You're going to have to kill the Devil.
man_in_black IN BLACK When you're finished eating, you walk due west. Once you get to the ocean, you'll be able to see the Statue.
richard_alpert What statue?
man_in_black IN BLACK Your ship smashed through it, on its way inland. Broke it into pieces. That's where you'll find the Devil.
man_in_black IN BLACK You only have one chance. Put this through his chest. Do not hesitate, do not let him say a word. If he speaks, it will already be too late. He can be very persuasive.
richard_alpert How, how can I kill him with this, he's...black smoke.
man_in_black IN BLACK No. I am.
richard_alpert My wife Isabella, she was running from you?
man_in_black IN BLACK She was running from him. I'm sorry. I saw him take her but I couldn't do anything to stop it.
richard_alpert But if you are the black smoke...
man_in_black IN BLACK You aren't the only one who's lost something, my friend. The Devil betrayed me. He took my body. My humanity.
richard_alpert You killed the officers on the ship.
man_in_black IN BLACK I'm not the one you need to worry about. The Devil has your wife, and you are going to have to kill him if you ever want to get her back.
richard_alpert Murder is wrong. That is what brought me here.
man_in_black IN BLACK My friend, you and I can talk all day long about what's right or wrong, but the question before you remains the same - "Do you ever want to see your wife again?"
richard_alpert Yes I do.
jacob What are you doing here? Who gave you this?
richard_alpert Where is my wife?
jacob What?
richard_alpert Where is my wife?
jacob I don't know your wife. Did she come here on the ship?
richard_alpert No, she's dead.
jacob Then why are you asking me where she is? Did you meet a man in the jungle dressed in black?
richard_alpert Yes.
jacob What did he tell you?
richard_alpert He said you are the devil.
jacob And?
richard_alpert He said the only way I would see my wife again is if I kill you. I - I saw her, here, in this place. Where is she?
jacob That wasn't your wife.
richard_alpert Yes, it was! She's dead, just like me.
jacob You're not dead.
richard_alpert I am in Hell. I know that I am in Hell.
jacob You really think you're dead?
richard_alpert Where else would I be?
jacob Alright then.
richard_alpert What are you doing? What are you doing?
jacob Still think you're dead?!
richard_alpert Stop!
jacob Still think you're dead?! Why should I stop?
richard_alpert Because I want to live!
jacob That's the first sensible thing you've said. What's your name?
richard_alpert Ricardo.
jacob Ricardo... Get up, we need to talk.
richard_alpert What is inside?
jacob No one comes in unless I invite them in.
richard_alpert Are you the Devil?
jacob No.
richard_alpert Then who are you?
jacob My name is Jacob. I'm the one who brought your ship to this island.
richard_alpert You brought it here? Why?
jacob Think of this wine as what you keep calling hell. There's many other names for it too malevolence, evil, darkness. And here it is, swirling around in the bottle, unable to get out because if it did, it would spread. The cork is this island and it's the only thing keeping the darkness where it belongs. That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it's in their very nature to sin. I bring people here to prove him wrong. And when they get here, their past doesn't matter.
richard_alpert Before you brought my ship, there were others?
jacob Yes, many.
richard_alpert What happened to them?
jacob They're all dead.
richard_alpert But if you brought them here, why didn't you help them?
jacob Because I wanted them to help themselves. To know the difference between right and wrong without me having to tell them. It's all meaningless if I have to force them to do anything. Why should I have to step in?
richard_alpert If you don't, he will.
jacob Do you want a job?
richard_alpert A job?
richard_alpert Doing what?
jacob Well, I don't want to step in. Maybe you can do it for me. You can be my...my representative and intermediary between me and the people I bring to the island.
richard_alpert What will I get in return?
jacob You tell me.
richard_alpert I want my wife back.
jacob Can't do that.
richard_alpert Can you absolve me of my sins so I don't go to Hell?
jacob I can't do that either.
richard_alpert I never want to die. I want to live forever.
jacob Now that...
jacob ...I can do.
man_in_black IN BLACK You let him talk to you, didn't you?
richard_alpert He told me to give you this.
man_in_black IN BLACK I'm sure you realize that if you go with him, you'll never see your wife again? I understand. He can be very... convincing. But I want you to know if you ever change your mind, and I mean ever, my offer still stands.
man_in_black IN BLACK I have something for you.
man_in_black IN BLACK You must've dropped it. I found it on the ship.
richard_alpert Adiós, mi amor.
richard_alpert I've changed my mind. Are you listening to me? I've changed my mind. I was wrong. You said I could change my mind. You said the offer would stand. Does the offer still stand? Does the offer still stand?! Does the offer still stand?!
hugo_reyes What offer, dude?
richard_alpert What the Hell are you doing here? Did you follow me?
hugo_reyes Well, kind of.
richard_alpert Get out! Get out!
hugo_reyes Hey!
richard_alpert Didn't you hear what I said?!
hugo_reyes I was just trying--
richard_alpert I told you people, I don't know anything!
hugo_reyes Just calm down!
richard_alpert Why did you follow me?!
hugo_reyes Your wife sent me.
richard_alpert What did you say?
hugo_reyes I said your wife sent me. Isabella. She wants to know why you buried her cross.
richard_alpert H--how do you know about that?
hugo_reyes Because she just told me.
richard_alpert What do you mean, just told you?
hugo_reyes Isabella saw you dig it up, man. She's standing right next to you.
isabella Él no te cree.
hugo_reyes A veces a las personas les toma un poco. .]
richard_alpert I--I don't see her.
isabella Dile que su inglés es magnífico.
hugo_reyes She's right there. She says your English is awesome.
richard_alpert ¿Estás tú realmente aquí?
isabella Cierra tus ojos.
hugo_reyes She wants you to close your eyes. It's okay, I'll tell you what she says.
isabella No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo.
hugo_reyes No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo.
isabella Por más que quisiste salvarme, era mi hora.
isabella Ya has sufrido suficiente, Ricardo.
richard_alpert Te extraño, yo... Yo haría cualquier cosa para estar juntos de nuevo.
isabella Mi amor, ya estamos juntos.
richard_alpert Is she gone?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
richard_alpert Thank you.
hugo_reyes Yeah, you got it.
richard_alpert Something wrong?
hugo_reyes She kinda said one more thing. Something you have to do.
richard_alpert What?
hugo_reyes She said you have to stop the Man in Black. You have to stop him from leaving the island. 'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno. .]
jacob Good morning
man_in_black IN BLACK Morning.
jacob I see you got my present.
man_in_black IN BLACK Don't gloat, Jacob. It doesn't become you.
jacob So you tried to kill me?
man_in_black IN BLACK You expect an apology?
jacob No. I guess I'm just wondering why you did it.
man_in_black IN BLACK Because I want to leave. Just let me leave, Jacob.
jacob As long as I'm alive, you're not going anywhere.
man_in_black IN BLACK Well then, now you know why I want to kill you. And I will kill you, Jacob.
jacob Even if you do so, somebody else will take my place.
man_in_black IN BLACK Then I'll kill them too.
jacob Here. Something for you to pass the time.
jacob I'll see you around.
man_in_black IN BLACK Sooner than you think.
