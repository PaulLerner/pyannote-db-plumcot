JACK Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
JACK Welcome back.
JOHN I know you...
JACK We were on the same flight back from Sydney. I met you in the baggage claim office, you had lost your knives. I'm Jack Shephard.
JOHN What happened?
JACK You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery.
JOHN Am I... am I alright?
JACK Your dural sac ruptured, but I think I got everything back where it belongs.
JACK Mr. Locke, while I was operating I got a look at the initial injury to your spine, the one that put you in a wheelchair. And... I was hoping you could tell me how that happened.
JOHN Why?
JACK Because I think you're a candidate.
JOHN A candidate for what?
JACK A new procedure. A surgery we're developing. And if it works it could restore feeling to your legs. In fact, you may even walk again. If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke, I think that... that I could fix you.
JOHN No. Thank you.
JACK Now, there's minimal risk, and the benefit--
JOHN I said no, doctor.
HELEN John?
HELEN Oh John, this is the first time they let me see you. Are you okay?
JOHN I'm fine.
HELEN Are you his doctor?
JACK Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.
HELEN Thank you.
HELEN Thank you. Thank you for saving him. Thank you.
SAYID Welcome to Hydra Island. At least you didn't have to paddle.
SEAMUS Get in.
SAWYER Uh-uh. No way I'm getting back in those cages.
SEAMUS Well I've got the gun, so you--
SAWYER Not anymore, doughboy.
WIDMORE Drop the gun! Put the gun down or I'll kill her!
SAWYER You ain't gonna kill anybody. Otherwise you wouldn't be throwin' us in a cage.
WIDMORE I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it. As are Reyes and the Kwons. Kate Austen? She's not. It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies.
KATE Don't listen to him.
WIDMORE You may not believe it, but I'm doing this for your own good.
SAWYER You're right. I don't believe it.
WIDMORE Is the fence live yet?
PAUL They're saying about an hour...
WIDMORE We haven't got an hour! Tell them to work faster! He's coming...
JACK Hello?
JACK Excuse me? Hello?
BERNARD Oh!
JACK I'm sorry. There was no one out front and I heard the drill... do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?
BERNARD Well, you can find him right here. And, if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard.
JACK Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
JACK Um, I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian, and I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files.
BERNARD And which patient would that be?
JACK His name's John Locke, and our records said that you had done some emergency oral surgery on him about three years back.
BERNARD And what are you looking for exactly?
JACK I want to know how he was hurt.
BERNARD Do you mind if I ask you why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?
JACK Um... he and I met about a week ago. We were on the same flight back from Australia--
BERNARD Oceanic 815.
BERNARD I sat across the aisle from you. If memory serves, you were flirting with my wife, Rose, while I was in the bathroom. It's pretty weird, huh?
JACK Yeah.
BERNARD Well, then maybe you're on to something here, hmm? Now, I can't break patient confidentiality and tell you something I shouldn't... but I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke, there was another man in the same accident with him.
JACK That was three years ago... you just remember that?
BERNARD Of course I do, Jack.
JACK Anthony Cooper...
BERNARD Good luck, doc. I hope you find what you're looking for.
JACK What happened?
SAYID There was a mortar attack. Widmore's people fired on us. Locke saved you.
JACK What about the rest of your group? What happened to them?
SAYID The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle. It's just the three of us now.
JACK Why did he bring me here?
LOCKE Because your friends got themselves captured. And now we're going to have to rescue them.
JACK Rescue them from what?
LOCKE Widmore has them in a cage about half a mile inland.
JACK Why would he--
LOCKE You know, I would ask him, except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer. But I can't imagine that his intentions are good. If we move right now, we can break your people out, run for the plane, and be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him.
JACK They're not my people. And I'm not leaving the Island.
LOCKE Well Jack, I'm hoping you still change your mind about that. But your friends do want to leave. And since they just ran away from me, on my own boat, I'm gonna need your help convincing them that they can trust me.
JACK Why should I trust you?
LOCKE Because I could kill you, Jack. Right here. Right now. And I could kill every single one of your friends. And there's not a thing that you could do to stop me. But instead of killing you, I saved your life. And now I want to save them too. So will you help me?
SAWYER Feel like we're running in circles? Back in these cages... except last time the gun was to my head.
KATE He wouldn't have killed me, James.
SAWYER That cave I told you about... where all the names were written... your name was there too. But it was crossed out. He doesn't need you, Kate.
JIN So she's with your mother?
SUN Yes. You saw her pictures? How?
JIN Widmore's people found your camera on the plane. He showed me the pictures. Our daughter... she's so beautiful.
SUN I have your ring.
LAPIDUS Uh-oh...
MAN What happened?
MAN Somebody shut it down? What's going on?
PAUL Somebody killed the power.
SEAMUS Get a team to that generator now!
HURLEY And we're dead...
MAN Go, go, go.
SEAMUS Ahh!
KATE I think I can reach the keys! 
HURLEY Hurry! When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us!
LAPIDUS Well, I ain't waitin'!
KATE Uh, damn it!
KATE What are you doing here?
JACK I'm with him. Come on.
JACK How much further to the plane?
LAPIDUS Say about a quarter mile. Just over that ridge.
KATE So you're coming with us now?
JACK I'm going to take you to the plane but I'm not getting on it. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm... I'm not meant to go.
SAWYER Thanks for comin' back for us, doc. Appreciate it.
JACK No, it's okay! Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators.
SAWYER Great. The more the merrier.
SAYID We need to go. Locke's waiting.
NURSE Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?
JACK Uh, no. No I'm not. But--
NURSE May I ask the nature of the visit?
JACK Um...
HELEN Dr. Shephard?
JACK Hey.
HELEN What are you doing here?
JACK Um... I'm here to see Anthony Cooper. Do you know him? Is that why you're here too?
HELEN What do you want with Anthony?
JACK I want to talk to him about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke.
HELEN Uh... Dr. Shephard... just go.
JACK Look, all I want to do is help him.
HELEN I know. John told me about the operation. He doesn't want it.
JACK Why doesn't he want it?
HELEN Please Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone. You saved John's life. Why can't that be enough?
JACK Because it's not.
HELEN Hi.
HELEN This is Anthony Cooper. He's John's father.
WHEELER Hey! Stop! Stop right there!
LAPIDUS Alrighty... let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly.
SAWYER Son of a bitch!
SAYID His neck's been broken.
LOCKE That's because I broke it. If it's any consolation, Widmore knew that I would kill these men.
SAWYER What are you talkin' about?
LOCKE They were only guarding the plane for show. If Charles had really wanted to keep me from actually getting on board he wouldn't have moved his little fences.
HURLEY Well... wait, now he wants us to leave the Island?
LOCKE No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place at the same time... a nice confined space we have no hope of getting out of... and then he wants to kill us.
SAWYER Kill us with what?
LOCKE With this.
LOCKE Four bricks of C-4. I found them in one of the overheard compartments, wired to the electrical system of the plane. If we would've turned it on... boom.
JIN So what now?
LOCKE We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane. It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island, I think we have to take the submarine.
SAWYER Well that's what I've been saying all along.
HURLEY Dude, wait... he's not supposed to leave the island. I mean, Alpert said that--
SAWYER Screw Alpert. He ain't here.
SAWYER That's twice you've saved our asses. Guess I was wrong about you.
LOCKE Thank you, James.
LOCKE That submarine is gonna be heavily defended. We're gonna need everyone.
JACK I'll help you but, like I said, I'm not going with you.
LOCKE Fair enough. Let's go.
CLAIRE Hey... I'm sorry I--
LOCKE It's alright, Claire. I understand why you went with them.
SAWYER Hey doc, listen up... you don't wanna leave this island, that's your own damn business. But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. I don't trust that thing one bit, so here's what I need you to do... once we get to the dock, you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.
JACK How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there.
SAWYER Just get it in the water, I'll take care of the rest.
JOHN 
WOMAN CT test to Trauma 3. CT test to Trauma 3.
JACK Mr. Locke, are you awake?
JOHN Push the button.
JACK Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
JOHN I wish you had believed me.
WOMAN Excuse me?
JACK Miss Littleton.
CLAIRE Dr. Shepard. I--I was just looking for you. The, um, the lawyer told me you were here.
CLAIRE Um, c-can we talk?
JACK Yes. Yes.
CLAIRE Oh, no. I'm okay. 
JACK Sorry, I had to run out of the will-reading the other day, but I did have an emergency, and...
CLAIRE Oh, no worries. Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me. Never even met this man.
CLAIRE Anyway, the, uh, lawyer gave me this. She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come, but that my father especially wanted me to have this.
CLAIRE Do you know why or what it's suppose to mean?
JACK I have no idea; but, then... I--I didn't know about you either.
CLAIRE Our father, uh... you mind, you mind if I ask how he died?
JACK He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney. He drank himself to death. I flew down to bring his body back... but then, uh... the airline lost it.
CLAIRE I just flew in from Sydney a few days ago.
JACK When?
CLAIRE Uh, last Wednesday?
JACK Oceanic Flight 815?
CLAIRE Uh, yeah.
JACK Do you mind if I have a look at that? 
CLAIRE Uh, sure, go ahead.
JACK I'm sorry. I--I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this. 
CLAIRE Yeah, me, too. Well, um. It was nice seeing you again. Thanks for trying to help.
JACK Where are you staying?
CLAIRE Uh, just down the road...motel.
Jack Why don't you come stay with me?
CLAIRE Stay with you? I mean, we're...we're strangers.
JACK  No, we're not strangers. We're...we're family.
SAWYER Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock, doesn't mean they ain't on the sub. We’re goin' in hard. Got it? Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun--you're with me. The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us. You think you two can get our backs?
JACK Absolutely.
SAWYER All right. Let's go home. 
MAN After engine room, power the bilges. After engine room, power the bilges, please.
SAWYER Where's the damn captain?
SAWYER Put your damn hands up.
LAPIDUS Nothin' personal.
SAWYER Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up?
LAPIDUS I got it.
KATE Let's go.
LOCKE You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?
JACK Yeah, I'm sure.
LOCKE Whoever told you, you needed to stay had no idea what he was talking about.
JACK John Locke told me I needed to stay. 
KATE What happened?
JACK Kate?!
KATE Ahh.
SAYID Claire, let's go now! 
SAWYER What's going on up there? What happened?
JACK Widmore's people shot her. Hurley, I need a first aid kit.
SAWYER Who else is up there?
SAYID Claire.
SAWYER Claire!
LOCKE James!
SAWYER Lapidus, if you can hear me...DIVE! DIVE!
LAPIDUS Let's go!
CLAIRE Hey! Wait! Wait!
LOCKE Claire! Claire! Wait! 
JACK What the hell are you doing?
SAWYER What we came here to do...leaving.
LOCKE It's alright. It's alright.
CLAIRE No! They're leaving us.
LOCKE No trust me. You don't want to be on that sub.
JACK Kate.
KATE Claire? Where's Claire?
JACK She's still up there.
KATE No, we can't leave without her...we can't... 
Jack "Kate..." or "Okay".
SAWYER Is she gonna be okay?
HURLEY Jack, can't find first-aid kit, dude.
JACK Jin--my pack. There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure. It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be alright.
JIN Here. Can you help her? 
JACK I think the bullet went straight through...
SAWYER What?
HURLEY Dude, where did that come from?
JACK Locke. We did exactly what he wanted.
JACK We have to get to the surface.
SAWYER What the hell?
JACK We have to get to the surface now!
JIN Lapidus, take us up.
LAPIDUS We're divin'!
JIN Just do it!
LAPIDUS You heard him. Up!
HURLEY Dude how'd that get on the sub?
JACK Locke put it in my pack.
JIN Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us?
SAWYER Damn right he did, that's why I shut his ass out.
JACK He wanted you to shut him out. Any idea how that thing works? Can we turn it off?
SAYID This watch is jury-rigged to the battery. The battery detonates the explosives.
SAWYER How much time till we're up, Frank?
LAPIDUS At least 5 minutes.
SAWYER We ain't got 5 minutes. What's it gonna be Sayid?
SAYID These wires--they're leads from the watch. If we disconnect them from the battery, technically speaking, the bomb should be inert.
SAWYER Technically?
SAYID Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously; and, I'm not sure...
SAWYER Step aside.
JACK Wait! Wait!
SAWYER What the hell are you doin', doc?
JACK Nothing's gonna happen.
SAWYER What?
JACK Don't pull those wires out. We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen.
SAWYER If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.
JACK No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.
HURLEY Uh...what?
JACK This is what he wanted. This is what he's been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all in the same place, at the same time--a nice, enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out of.
JIN I don't understand.
JACK Locke said that he can't leave the island without us. I think that he can't leave the island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill anyone of us whenever he wanted. So, what if he hasn't because he's...he's not allowed to. What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
SAWYER Stay out of my way, doc.
JACK Now if he wanted that thing to blow up, why would he put a timer in it? Why not just throw it inside?
SAWYER I don't care.
JACK Nothing is gonna happen.
SAWYER It's not your decision to make.
JACK He can't kill us!
SAWYER I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!
JACK James. We are going to be okay. Just have to trust me.
SAWYER Sorry, doc, I don't.
SAYID Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island, half mile south from the camp we just left. Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead, which means you're going to need him. Do you understand me?
JACK Why are you telling me this?
SAYID Because it's going to be you, Jack.
HURLEY Sayid!
LAPIDUS Ah, hell!
JACK Are you okay?
HURLEY What happened? Did Sayid just...?
SUN Help!
JIN Wait! Hold on. I'll get you out...Sawyer! I need help!
SAWYER Jin!
JACK Hurley! Hurley! You gotta take Kate out of here.
HURLEY What about everybody else?
JACK I'll take care of them! 
HURLEY I have to go after Sayid!
JACK There is no Sayid! Listen to me. Take this tank and buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole is, okay? Hurley, you can do this, okay?
HURLEY Okay.
Jack Go!
SUN 너무 아파!
SAWYER Doc! Push.
JIN On three.
ALL One... two... three...
JIN Sawyer! Jack!
JACK Sawyer! Sawyer!
SUN Jin... Go!
JIN No.
SUN Save yourself.
JIN I'm going to get you out of here. Go. Go. I'll get her free.
JACK No, we can do this!
JIN Just go! Save Sawyer.
JACK Jin take this. I can get him out without it.
JIN No, you can't Jack. Just go! Go.
JIN Ahh...Uhhh
SUN Jin. You have to go.
JIN No. I can do this.
SUN No. No, you can't. Please go.
JIN I won't leave you.
JIN I'm gonna get you out of here.
SUN Go... Please! Go.
JIN 당신하고 같이 있을게. 다시는 떠나지 않을거야.  I love you, Sun. 
SUN I love you.
ORDERLY Is somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke
JOHN Yes, my fiancée, Helen. She's, um... ...probably stuck in traffic... Hey, I'll take it from here. I'm pretty good at this.
ORDERLY Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
JOHN Thank you. See ya. 
JACK Mr. Locke. I'm glad I caught ya. I hadn't have a chance to say goodbye yet.
JOHN Well, goodbye..and thanks again, Dr. Shepherd. 
JACK I went to see your father.
JOHN W-what?
JACK When you didn't want the surgery, I felt like I had to understand why...and, uh, I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair, that maybe...
JOHN I was in a plane crash. I had my-my private pilot's license for a week, and, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger. He was terrified of flying. But, I looked him right in the eye--I told him that he could trust me. And we barely got off the ground. I still don't re--I don't remember what I did wrong, but it was my fault. It was my fault. This man, who I loved more than anything, will never walk, or talk or...
JACK You know, the first time you and I met, uh, back at the--at the airport...you told me that my father was gone, and, uh, it hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right. Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.
JOHN Uh, no, no, he's not.
JACK Yes, he--he is, and you can punish yourself as much as you want and that's never gonna bring him back. What happened, happened...and...you can let it go.
JOHN What makes you think letting go is so easy?
JACK It's not. In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself. And, that's why I was hoping that…maybe you could go first.
JOHN Goodbye, Dr. Shephard. 
JACK I can help you, John...I wish you believed me.
KATE Jack...I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. 
HURLEY Is he okay?
JACK He got hit in the head pretty hard, but he's breathing.
KATE What about Jin and Sun?
LOCKE It sunk.
CLAIRE What, the submarine? But, they-they were all on it, everyone... What? Th-they're all dead?
LOCKE Not all of them.
CLAIRE Wait. W-where are you going?
LOCKE To finish what I started.
