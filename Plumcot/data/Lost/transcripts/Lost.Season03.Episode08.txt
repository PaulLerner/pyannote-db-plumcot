hugo_reyes Dude, I don't know about this.
charlie_pace See, you're looking at this all wrong. He would want us to do this.
hugo_reyes He would want us to ransack his tent and take his stash? Yeah, that sounds exactly like Sawyer.
charlie_pace Well, he stole all this in the first place. I mean, people need food. They need medical supplies. They need -- shocking amounts of pornography.
desmond_hume Charlie.
hugo_reyes Oh, Desmundo.
desmond_hume I need you to come with me.
hugo_reyes You guys find Eko?
desmond_hume Both of you.
charlie_pace What happened?
john_locke Eko is dead.
sayid_jarrah We found his body in the jungle -- buried him yesterday.
charlie_pace How did he die?
john_locke The island killed him.
charlie_pace What do you mean "the island killed him?" What do you mean "the island killed him?"
john_locke You know what it means. With the doctor gone, the camp's on edge enough without people having to worry about what's out here in the jungle. They're going to look to you two to see how to react.
john_locke So when I tell everyone what happened I need you to help keep things calm.
hugo_reyes Dude, you okay? Hey guys, what's wrong with Desmond?
sayid_jarrah What is he doing?
john_locke There's someone else out there.
charlie_pace Where's Claire?
sunhwa_kwon She just went for a walk. I offered to watch the baby.
charlie_pace Claire!
desmond_hume I've got her.
charlie_pace Is she okay? Claire! What happened?!
desmond_hume Just stand back; give me some room!
charlie_pace Claire.
desmond_hume Get back, Charlie; I know what I'm doing.
charlie_pace Is she breathing? She's not breathing.
charlie_pace You want me to help you?
desmond_hume Come on; come on.
charlie_pace Claire? Claire.
charlie_pace Claire!
desmond_hume Are you alright? Come on; you're okay. Let's get you back to the tent.
charlie_pace Charlie's here!
desmond_hume It's alright, Charlie. Alright, let's get her back to her tent.
charlie_pace Is she okay? Let me help.
desmond_hume I got it, Charlie.
charlie_pace Hey, I'll take her.
charlie_pace Where are you going? Hey, how did you know? How did you know she was drowning?!
hugo_reyes I'll tell you how he knew -- that guy sees the future, dude.
claire_littleton She's beautiful.
desmond_hume Aye, thanks.
claire_littleton What's her name?
desmond_hume Penny, well, Penelope. How are you feeling?
claire_littleton Still a little shaken up. I mean, I go swimming almost everyday -- the undertow just grabbed me. I mean, if -- if you hadn't...
charlie_pace Claire? I thought you were only going to be 5 minutes. Aaron's starving.
claire_littleton Yeah, um, sorry, I... Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you so much for being there.
desmond_hume It's my pleasure.
hugo_reyes Locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing.
charlie_pace There's nothing to know. I don't buy this precognitive insanity rubbish. Look, if the bearded wonder could predict the future he wouldn't have ended up here, would he?
charlie_pace Well, whatever happened to him -- we're going to have to find out what it is.
hugo_reyes You do realize he's going to know your plan before you even come up with it, dude.
charlie_pace In that case, we're going to have to get him really bloody drunk.
charlie_pace Beautiful evening.
desmond_hume Aye.
hugo_reyes Say it, dude.
charlie_pace This morning -- I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful. Thank you for helping Claire not drown.
desmond_hume No harm done.
charlie_pace Excellent. Brought a peace offering -- you know, make the truce official.
desmond_hume Thanks, but no. I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late.
charlie_pace This'll be good for us, brother. Alright, that's fine. We'll take our drink and go somewhere else.
desmond_hume What kind of whiskey is that?
charlie_pace It's, uh -- it just says MacCutcheon.
desmond_hume Alright then, let's have it. No, the bottle, brother. I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink.
charlie_pace Alright, let's drink.
desmond_hume Cheers.
charlie_pace Cheers.
desmond_hume AND CHARLIE ...she was only the farmer's daughter.
charlie_pace Desi.
desmond_hume Cheers.
hugo_reyes Hey, do you know any songs about drinking and fighting and girls with one leg?
charlie_pace Well, girls with one leg and a heart of gold. So, Desi, let me ask you something.
desmond_hume Anything, pal.
charlie_pace How'd you know Claire was drowning?
desmond_hume I could hear her calling for help.
hugo_reyes Oh no you didn't. You were like a mile away.
desmond_hume Well, I suppose I've -- I've got good hearing.
charlie_pace You hear the lightning, as well?
desmond_hume Excuse me?
charlie_pace The lightning. Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
desmond_hume Thanks for the drink, pal.
charlie_pace Hey, I don't know what you're doing -- you best tell us. Oi! You think because you turned some key that makes you a hero? You're no hero, brother. I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one. Yeah...
desmond_hume You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!
charlie_pace Hurley.
hugo_reyes Dude.
desmond_hume You don't want to know! And I don't want to know!
charlie_pace Get him off!
desmond_hume You don't want to know!!
john_locke Desmond!
desmond_hume I'll see you in another life, brother.
desmond_hume I love you, Penny.
penelope_widmore Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Des, are you alright? Stay there, hang on.
penelope_widmore I'm just getting ice. You alright? Sweetie, you okay?
desmond_hume What's happening?
penelope_widmore Well, what's happening is the result of combining ladders, painting a ceiling, and alcohol. Are you okay? You nauseous?
desmond_hume This is my flat?
penelope_widmore Mmm-hmm, although, if you want me to feel at home you might start calling it our flat. How many fingers, Des? Love, look at me. What's wrong?
desmond_hume Absolutely nothing.
penelope_widmore Here, let me.
desmond_hume Thanks.
penelope_widmore Oh, hang on. You've got paint on your neck.
desmond_hume Have I?
penelope_widmore How's that concussion?
desmond_hume Well, my severe head injury is a small price to pay for the pleasure of having you move into my humble -- is rat trap accurate?
penelope_widmore Uh-uh. Voila! You know you don't really need a job from my father, Des.
desmond_hume It's not about the job. I want him to respect me.
penelope_widmore And respect you he shall. But if for some reason he's too daft to see how brilliant you are it's not the end of the world.
desmond_hume What did you say?
penelope_widmore Here you go, love. You alright?
desmond_hume Yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- just had a bit of a deja vu, that's all.
desmond_hume Good afternoon, uh, I'm here to see Mr. Widmore.
RECEPTIONIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode08 And you are?
desmond_hume Hume, uh, Mr. Desmond Hume.
delivery_man MAN Hello, love. Got a parcel here for 815.
desmond_hume Excuse me, what did you say?
delivery_man MAN I said "delivery for 815."
RECEPTIONIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode08 Mr. Hume, Mr. Widmore is ready for you.
desmond_hume Thank you.
charles_widmore Penny didn't tell me you were an actor, Desmond.
desmond_hume No, it was actually set design for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
charles_widmore Impressive. You didn't graduate from university.
desmond_hume No, sir. I had to look after my 3 brothers after my father--
charles_widmore Any military experience?
desmond_hume No, sir. She's beautiful -- your boat.
charles_widmore My foundation is sponsoring a solo race around the world.
charles_widmore Something wrong?
desmond_hume No. No, sir.
charles_widmore Well, Desmond, I'm going to see to it that you have a position in our administrative department. Not the most glamorous duty but it's a start. I'll speak to human resources.
desmond_hume With all due respect, sir, I haven't come here to interview for a position in your company.
charles_widmore You haven't?
desmond_hume No, sir. I came here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. We've been together 2 years now and Pen's moving in and I love her. Your permission would mean everything to me.
charles_widmore I'm impressed, Hume -- a very noble gesture.
charles_widmore You know anything about whiskey?
desmond_hume No, I'm afraid not, sir.
charles_widmore This is a 60 year MacCutcheon, named after Anderson MacCutcheon, esteemed Admiral from the Royal Navy. He retired with more medals than any man before or since -- moved to the highlands to see out his remaining years. Admiral MacCutcheon was a great man, Hume. This was his crowning achievement.
charles_widmore This swallow is worth more than you could make in a month. To share it with you would be a waste, and a disgrace to the great man who made it -- because you, Hume, will never be a great man.
desmond_hume Mr. Widmore, I know I'm not...
charles_widmore What you're not, is worthy of drinking my whiskey. How could you ever be worthy of my daughter?
charlie_pace I said maybe / You're gonna be the one who saves me? / Maybe / And after all / You're my wonderwall
charlie_pace Thank you very much. Fiver! Thank you very much.
desmond_hume I know you? How do I know you?
charlie_pace Thank you, you can leave your number if you want.
desmond_hume How do I know you?
charlie_pace I don't, uh...
desmond_hume Where do I know you from?
charlie_pace Look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.
charlie_pace Hey, can I get some help?
desmond_hume You're Charlie.
charlie_pace Yeah, name's on the sign.
desmond_hume Who -- they -- they. It -- it was in the hatch. I remember seeing you. There was a -- there was a computer. There was a button. We -- we were on an island.
charlie_pace We are on an island, mate. This is England.
desmond_hume No, it was real, man. I remember!
charlie_pace Hey, alright. This is why we don't do drugs.
desmond_hume No this -- I remember this. This all happened before! Today -- th -- th -- this happened today. This -- I remember that he said I wasn't worthy -- and then I -- and then I -- and then I came down and I -- and I took off my tie and I -- and then I lost my tie and Penny said where was it and then it started to rain and...
donovan Your thesis is a bit neat. The wild card part which is unpredictability -- run the same test 10 times -- you get 10 different outcomes. It's what makes life so wonderfully...
desmond_hume Donovan!
donovan Case in point, who could have known that a drenched Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?
donovan You've looked better, Des; not much, but I...
desmond_hume I need to ask you something.
donovan By all means, do.
desmond_hume What do you know about time travel?
donovan Are you bloody insane?
desmond_hume Just tell me if it's possible?
donovan Which part? The island full of mysterious hatches? Or the computer which keeps the world from ending?
desmond_hume You know what? Forget you're my best mate, right? As a physicist -- is it possible that I've somehow managed to go back in time and I'm now living my life over again? It's not funny, Donovan.
donovan Penny's father berates you for not being a great man, and voila, you've dreamed a future where you push a button to save the world.
desmond_hume These things are not in my head, brother. I remember things.
donovan Alright, then -- what happens next?
desmond_hume It doesn't work like that. I don't remember everything, just -- just bits and pieces.
donovan How wonderfully convenient.
desmond_hume Wait, I remember this. I know this song. The jukebox...
donovan Des, you're worrying me now.
desmond_hume I remember this night. Graybridge come back from 2 goals down in the final 2 minutes and win this game. It's a bloody miracle. And after they win, Jimmy Lennon's going to come through that door and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat because he owes him money.
donovan Seriously...
desmond_hume Watch, please! Just watch. They'll score the first goal right now. No, no, they came back. They won. Jimmy Lennon ... cricket bat.
donovan There's no such thing as time travel, Des. From what I understand true love can be just as unlikely. So, if you love Penny, stop messing about and marry her.
penelope_widmore You smell like the pub.
desmond_hume That's because I was at the pub.
penelope_widmore You didn't get the job.
desmond_hume Nope.
penelope_widmore What did my father say?
desmond_hume Your father was lovely. We just both agree that I wasn't exactly qualified.
penelope_widmore Well, I say we celebrate. I say we celebrate that fate has spared you a miserable existence under the employ of Widmore Industries. Let me take you out tomorrow. Let's go for lobsters on the pier. My treat.
desmond_hume I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate.
penelope_widmore Well, the occasion is I love you.
desmond_hume Why? Why do you love me?
penelope_widmore Because you're a good man. In my experience they're pretty hard to come by.
penelope_widmore Hey, Des, where are you?
desmond_hume I'm right here.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Never done this before have you?
desmond_hume Is it that obvious?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING I can always tell the first timers. Well, then, may I ask your price range?
desmond_hume I'm not a man of means...
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Oh...
desmond_hume I hope to -- one day...
nikki_fernandez HAWKING I have just the thing. This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still has the sparkle of life.
desmond_hume I'll take it.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING I'm sorry?
desmond_hume It's perfect. I'll take it.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING No you won't. Give me the ring. Give it here.
desmond_hume I don't understand.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING This is wrong. You don't buy the ring. You have second thoughts; you walk right out that door. So, come on, let's have it.
desmond_hume I don't know what you're on about.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING You don't buy the ring, Desmond.
desmond_hume How do you know my name?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Well, I know your name as well as I know that you that don't ask Penny to marry you. In fact, you break her heart. Well, breaking her heart is, of course, what drives you in a few short years from now to enter that sailing race -- to prove her father wrong -- which brings you to the island where you spend the next 3 years of your life entering numbers into the computer until you are forced to turn that failsafe key. And if you don't do those things, Desmond David Hume, every single one of us is dead. So give me that sodding ring.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Oh, you're going to be difficult about this, I can see.
desmond_hume Who are you?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Do you like chestnuts?
desmond_hume What?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Thank you.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING That man over there is wearing red shoes.
desmond_hume So, what then?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Just thought it was a bold fashion choice worth noting.
desmond_hume This isn't really happening, is it?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Sorry?
desmond_hume I've had a concussion. You're my subconscious.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Am I?
desmond_hume You're here to talk me out of marrying Penny. Well, it won't bloody work.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Oh, yes it will.
desmond_hume No, there is no island. There is no button. It's madness. I love her. She loves me. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING No, Desmond, you're not.
desmond_hume Oh, my God. You knew that was going to happen, didn't you? Then why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you do anything?
nikki_fernandez HAWKING Because it wouldn't matter. Had I warned him about the scaffolding tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi. If I warned him about the taxi, he'd fall in the shower and break his neck. The universe, unfortunately, has a way of course correcting. That man was supposed to die. That was his path just as it's your path to go to the island. You don't do it because you choose to, Desmond. You do it because you're supposed to.
desmond_hume I'm going to meet Penny in an hour. I've got the ring; she'll say yes; I can choose whatever I want.
nikki_fernandez HAWKING You may not like your path, Desmond, but pushing that button is the only truly great thing that you will ever do.
desmond_hume How much for the ring?
desmond_hume Hi.
penelope_widmore Hey, am I late?
desmond_hume Right on time.
photographer Eh, take your photo, lovebirds?
desmond_hume No thanks, mate.
photographer Come on, something to show the grandkids.
penelope_widmore Oh, come on, Des, let's do it -- for all those grandkids.
photographer Yeah, you're gonna do it? Alrighty. Let's see what we've got for you here, eh? Ah, beautiful desert scene?
penelope_widmore Nah.
photographer No, not the desert, alright. Ah, I know, the Alps.
desmond_hume Ah, I love the Alps.
penelope_widmore Oh, I hate the Alps.
photographer Yeah, not the Alps. Ah, here we go -- beautiful marina scene.
penelope_widmore Yeah, let's do that.
photographer That's the one, innit? Alright, you guys get in position.
penelope_widmore Take your coat off; it's boiling. There are palm trees.
photographer 1-2-3. Instant classic. Only 5 quid.
penelope_widmore Here you go, love.
photographer Here you go, mate. Out of 20. You're a lovely couple -- small price to pay for the memories, right?
desmond_hume I couldn't go through with it.
penelope_widmore What was that?
desmond_hume I can't do this.
penelope_widmore You can't do what?
desmond_hume Us. This. This relationship.
penelope_widmore What are you talking about?
desmond_hume How can I? I - I can't look after you. I haven't got a job. I don't have any -- I can't even afford 5 quid for a bloody photograph. You deserve someone better.
penelope_widmore I know what I deserve. I chose to be with you. I love you.
desmond_hume Love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough.
penelope_widmore What's this about, Des? Where's this coming from?
desmond_hume It's all happening too soon -- you moving in. You're painting rooms; you're changing things. I don't even like red. Why would you leave your flat, your expensive flat--
penelope_widmore Don't do that! Don't you pretend you don't care. And don't you dare rewrite history. I left my expensive flat because you were too proud to live there, remember? If you want me to go -- if you want me to leave then don't make this about what I do or don't deserve. And have the decency to admit that you're doing this because you're a coward.
desmond_hume I'm sorry, Pen, but this -- we're not supposed to be together.
bartender What'll it be?
desmond_hume Just give me a pint of your cheapest. I'm celebrating.
bartender Oh, what's the occasion?
desmond_hume I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life. And the worst part is I'm pretty sure I've made it before.
bartender That's what they call deja vu, mate.
desmond_hume Do they now?
desmond_hume I had the wrong night. I was right. I was off by a night. I heard the song and then -- I remember this. I'm not crazy. I can still change things. I can still change it.
desmond_hume Jimmy Lennon.
jimmy_lennon Where the hell's my money?
desmond_hume Hey, duck brother!
desmond_hume Oh, no. Oh.
desmond_hume Please, let me go back. Let me go back one more time. I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time. I'm sorry, Penny. I'll change it. I'll change it.
charlie_pace How'd you know Claire was drowning?
charlie_pace How'd you know Claire was drowning?
desmond_hume I could hear her calling for help.
charlie_pace You hear the lightning, as well?
charlie_pace Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
charlie_pace I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one. Yeah, a cow...
desmond_hume You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key! You don't want to know!
charlie_pace Get off!
desmond_hume You don't want to know what happened to me! You don't want to know!
desmond_hume You don't want to know. No matter what you do...
charlie_pace What the hell are you doing?
desmond_hume You can't change it. You can't change it no matter what you try to do. You just can't change it.
charlie_pace He's wankered. Let's get him to his tent. Alright, Des, come on. Give me your arm. Come on stand up. Stand up. Okay, okay.
desmond_hume You're a good man, Charlie. Listen, I'm sorry I tried to strangle you, alright?
charlie_pace Oh, fair play, mate. Sorry I called you a coward.
desmond_hume No, you're right, pal.
charlie_pace Desmond, you are going to tell me what happened to you.
desmond_hume When I turned that key my life flashed before my eyes. And then I was back in the jungle and still on this bloody island. But those flashes, Charlie -- those flashes -- they didn't stop.
charlie_pace So, you're telling me you saw a flash of Claire drowning this morning -- that's how you knew how to save her?
desmond_hume I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie, I was saving you. This morning you dove in after Claire. You tried to save her but you drowned.
charlie_pace What are you talking about? I didn't drown.
desmond_hume When I saw the lightning hit the roof you were electrocuted. And when you heard Claire was in the water you -- you drowned trying to save her. I dove in myself so you never went in. I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but the universe has a way of course correcting and -- and I can't stop it forever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because no matter what I try to do you're going to die, Charlie.
