james_ford Son of a bitch!
james_ford Jin... come on, wake up buddy. Wake up!
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer. How long have I been out?
james_ford A while. Figured you could use a rest...
jinsoo_kwon Claire and Locke... where are they?
james_ford I don't know. They said they'd be back by sun up.
jinsoo_kwon We have to get out of here before they come back!
james_ford Whoa, whoa! I'm with Locke.
jinsoo_kwon That is not Locke!
james_ford Yeah... I know. Whoever he is, he says he can get us off this damn island.
jinsoo_kwon I can't leave. Sun could be here somewhere.
james_ford Fine. If she's here, you've got my word... we ain't leavin' without her.
jinsoo_kwon What's that?
james_ford They're back.
kate_austen Hi.
james_ford Hi yourself.
ava Wow. Jimmy, you are... unbelievable.
james_ford You're not too shabby yourself sweetheart.
ava Baby...
james_ford Yeah ?
ava Weren't you supposed to meet that guy at nine?
james_ford Yeah. So?
ava It's 842.
james_ford Damn it!
james_ford You weren't exactly supposed to see that...
ava Jimmy, what are you doing with all that money?
james_ford This meeting... it's a potential investment, we're going fifty-fifty. The guy wants to see the money up front. Don't worry it won't take long. I'll be right back. Me and you'll go for a round.
james_ford Whoa...
ava Step away from the case.
james_ford Take it easy, honey...
ava Here's the thing, dimples. I can spot a con man. I'm married to one. So I know all about the pigeon drop. Oh, what? That case just accidentally flew open? How stupid do you think I am?
james_ford Pretty damn stupid actually.
ava Excuse me?
james_ford This is a setup, lady. There's a van sitting right outside. The room is bugged... place is surrounded by cops. So now you wanna put that gun down and we'll work something out. They don't care about you, they want your husband. There's a tracer in the case, all you had to do is take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out.
ava You really expect me to believe that you're here with the police? This place is surrounded? How come no-one came to save you?
james_ford I don't need saving. 'Cause you're gonna do the right thing and put that gun down. But if you don't... well, then all I gotta do is say the magic word and that door busts open.
ava You're a lousy con man.
james_ford LaFleur.
ava La what?
police_officer OFFICER Police! Drop the gun!
miles_straume Cutting it a little close, huh?
james_ford Only way to cut it.
miles_straume Put your damn clothes on, Jim.
james_ford You got it, partner.
ava You're a cop?
james_ford Surprise.
kate_austen Is this where you lived?
claire_littleton Yeah.
kate_austen What is that?
claire_littleton It's all I had.
john_locke Alright everybody, listen up. Come on in, gather round. I know that everyone is tired. It was a... a long and traumatic night for all of us. And you all have got a lot of questions, I know. And I will make myself available to answer them. But right now we need to keep moving. We have to take advantage of the daylight.
cindy_chandler We want to know what happened to the people who stayed behind at the Temple.
john_locke The black smoke killed them.
john_locke Hey... I know that what happened back there was really scary. But it's over. You're with me now, and I promise that I'm gonna take care of you. Okay?
john_locke Alright, let's move out!
james_ford Looks like you had a hell of a night.
kate_austen Yeah.
james_ford Jack, Hurley, the rest of them... they make it out of the temple all right?
kate_austen I saw them leaving on the way back.
james_ford What about Miles?
kate_austen I don't know what happened to him. So you're with Locke now?
james_ford I ain't with anybody, Kate.
james_ford Hello, is this Anthony Cooper? Hi Mr Cooper, this is Detective James Ford, L.A.P.D. Yeah, we've discovered some unclaimed property that might belong to you. Can you verify you were in Alabama in 1976? Uh huh... okay, thanks. Sorry to have taken up your time.
james_ford May I speak with Anthony Cooper?
james_ford Sorry, I'm going to have to call you back...
miles_straume Who's Anthony Cooper?
james_ford Old buddy I ran into. Said he could hook me up with some Laker tickets.
miles_straume That's cool. What'd you... you see him in Palm Springs?
james_ford What?
miles_straume Palm Springs. Your trip last weekend?
james_ford Yeah. It's a blur. Too much sunshine, too many Mai Tais...
miles_straume Well get it together, because you got a date tonight, pal.
james_ford Date with who?
miles_straume Friend of mine. Works with my dad at the museum. She's great.
james_ford Well if she's so great, why don't you go out with her?
miles_straume Hey, I got a girlfriend. What is your deal Jim? You wanna die alone?
james_ford Alright, look...I go out with her, are you gonna leave me alone?
miles_straume Throw in one of those Laker tickets, hell yes I will.
james_ford Look I'm...already pulling strings with this guy. It's just, uh... I don't know if I can get another seat...
miles_straume You know you can tell me the truth. About anything. Are you lying to me, man?
james_ford Why the hell would I lie?
john_locke About a quarter mile ahead there's a clearing. We'll make camp there. Everybody fill up on water. We might be there a couple of days.
james_ford A couple of days? I thought you said we were getting off this rock?
john_locke We are.
james_ford When?
john_locke Maybe we should talk about this in private.
james_ford Great. Let's go.
john_locke I wish you hadn't interrupted me.
james_ford I'm sorry... I forgot my manners.
john_locke I forgive you.
james_ford What happened back at the temple? How'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing?
john_locke I didn't rescue them. I'm the smoke thing.
james_ford You telling me you killed all of those people?
john_locke I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully and they didn't take it.
james_ford Why not?
john_locke Because they're convinced that they're protecting the Island from me, when in fact all I want to do is leave. So it's either kill or be killed. And I don't wanna be killed.
james_ford You goin' on a boat ride?
john_locke You are.
james_ford Where?
john_locke Hydra Island.
james_ford What's on Hydra Island?
john_locke The plane. The Ajira flight. The same plane that brought your friends back. Unfortunately they didn't come alone. And I have reason to believe that some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm. So I want you to go over there and do some recon.
james_ford Well that sounds safe...
john_locke You'll be fine.
james_ford Yeah? And what am I supposed to do if I run into somebody who wants to do me harm?
john_locke I'm not worried about that.
james_ford Oh, you're not, huh?
john_locke No. Because you are the best liar I ever met. You tell them whatever you need to tell them to gain their trust... find out everything you can about them... and then get back here.
james_ford Why exactly am I doing this again?
john_locke Why do you think, James? We get on that plane, we fly off this Island, and we never look back. Come on.
miles_straume Yeah?
james_ford Miles, what does this girl look like again?
miles_straume She's a redhead. How many redheads do you see?
james_ford Roger that.
miles_straume Be nice to her.
james_ford Yeah, yeah...
james_ford Excuse me. Would you be Charlotte?
dr_charlotte_lewis I most certainly am.
james_ford Well... it's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
dr_charlotte_lewis Thank you.
james_ford Archaeology, huh?
dr_charlotte_lewis What's wrong with archaeology?
james_ford Nothin'. I just figured you'd be stuck in a room somewhere dustin' off antiques.
dr_charlotte_lewis No, I actually get to travel quite a bit. To far off and romantic places.
james_ford Really? What are you, like a... Indiana Jones or somethin'?
dr_charlotte_lewis Yes. I'm exactly like Indiana Jones.
james_ford You got a whip?
dr_charlotte_lewis Maybe...
dr_charlotte_lewis So, um... what about you?
james_ford What about me?
dr_charlotte_lewis Why did you become a cop?
james_ford You ever seen Bullitt? Steve McQueen flick?
dr_charlotte_lewis No.
james_ford Well then I won't even bore you with an explanation.
dr_charlotte_lewis Okay, do me a favor, James, and don't treat me like all the other girls that ask you. Tell me the truth.
james_ford Well... I guess I... got to a point in my life where I was either going to become a criminal or a cop. So I chose cop.
james_ford What?
dr_charlotte_lewis You know what.
dr_charlotte_lewis Wow... not bad, considering we didn't have that whip.
james_ford Bring it next time.
james_ford You want some water?
dr_charlotte_lewis Mmm hmm. Yes please.
dr_charlotte_lewis You mind if I borrow a t-shirt?
james_ford Help yourself. Top drawer on the right.
dr_charlotte_lewis Thanks.
james_ford What the hell are you doin'?
dr_charlotte_lewis Um... I was just looking for a t-shirt...
james_ford What did you see?
dr_charlotte_lewis Nothing. Just this, you know, that picture fell out and I was trying to put it back.
james_ford What did you see?!?
dr_charlotte_lewis Nothing, I didn't see anything!
james_ford Get the hell out.
dr_charlotte_lewis James, just let me explain!
james_ford Get out!
kate_austen Hey.
sayid_jarrah Kate.
kate_austen Do you believe Locke?
sayid_jarrah What do you mean?
kate_austen That he can get us off the island...
sayid_jarrah Yes, I believe him.
kate_austen Sayid, are you alright?
sayid_jarrah No.
kate_austen Claire!
kate_austen Sayid! Sayid, please!
john_locke What are you doing?
claire_littleton She took him! She took Aaron!
john_locke Claire, you had disappeared! Kate couldn't find you! She did what she had to do!
claire_littleton She took Aaron! She can't just do this!
john_locke This is completely inappropriate. Alright? Now... you go over there. I'll deal with you in a minute. Go.
john_locke You alright?
kate_austen No, I'm not alright!
james_ford Hey, stop!
james_ford Don't move!
zoe Please don't hurt me!
james_ford Who the hell are you?
zoe I'm the only one left.
liam_pace Excuse me. Sir? I asked you about my brother...
police_officer I told you, I'll be with you in a minute.
liam_pace Hey! Uh... I'm looking for my brother. He was arrested at the airport on a drug charge.
james_ford Sorry, not my department.
james_ford Mornin', sunshine.
miles_straume Come with me.
james_ford Whoa--
miles_straume Shut up! Is there something you wanna tell me?
james_ford What?!?
miles_straume Is there something you wanna tell me?!?
james_ford Look, she opened the wrong drawer.
miles_straume What the hell are you talking about? I wanna know what you were doing in Australia when you told me you were in Palm Springs. I ran your credit card. I know you went to Sydney. Oceanic, round trip. You took flight 815 back two days ago.
james_ford What the hell are you doin' runnin' my credit card?
miles_straume You lied to me! We're supposed to trust each other. So, Jim... what were you doing in Australia?
james_ford That's none of your damn business.
miles_straume You know what? You're right. Because I'm not your partner anymore.
james_ford You thirsty?
zoe Very.
james_ford I'm Sawyer.
zoe I'm Zoe. I can't believe there's anybody left alive. I thought I knew everybody on the plane.
james_ford I didn't come on this plane.
zoe What plane did you come on?
james_ford Long story. What the hell happened here? What killed all those people?
zoe I... we... we crashed here. And we were all just waiting for someone to rescue us. I was out collecting wood when I heard... screaming.
james_ford Screaming?
zoe When I came back... they were... they were all dead. I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here. I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun. Are you alone?
james_ford No. There's a group of people back on the main island. I can take you back there.
zoe Thank God...
james_ford Trust me... God's got nothing to do with it.
john_locke I'm sorry, Kate.
kate_austen Excuse me?
john_locke I have to take responsibility for Claire's behaviour. I was the one who told her the Others had her baby.
kate_austen Why would you tell her that?
john_locke Have you ever had an enemy? Someone that you needed to hate? Very powerful, isn't it? Claire was devastated without Aaron. She needed something to... something to keep her going. So, I gave her something to hate. And then... when you told her the truth... all those feelings, all that anger that she'd been holding on to for so long... it had to go somewhere.
kate_austen Very insighful... coming from a dead man.
john_locke Well, nobody's perfect. I'm sorry that this happened. And I'm sure if you give her time, everything will be alright. I promised before that I would keep everyone safe. And that means you too, Kate.
kate_austen Where did Sawyer go?
john_locke I'll show you.
james_ford Think that thing'll still fly?
zoe I don't know. It'll take a bit of work and someone who knows how... how to do it. I... I take it you haven't come across the pilot?
james_ford No ma'am.
zoe How many people did you say were with you?
james_ford Couple dozen...
zoe Did they all come on the same plane as you?
james_ford Some. Not all.
zoe When did you crash?
james_ford A long time ago.
zoe Do you all have guns?
zoe I mean... whoever killed all those people back there, they... they might come back.
james_ford Yeah, we got plenty of guns.
james_ford Wanna grab that end?
james_ford Where did you say you were headed?
zoe What's that?
james_ford Your flight. Where were you goin'?
zoe Oh. Uh... Guam.
james_ford What's in Guam?
zoe My boyfriend.
james_ford You're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good.
zoe What are you talking about?
james_ford Who are you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode08 Put your weapon down! Drop it, now!
james_ford Is your name even Zoe?
zoe Is yours Sawyer?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode08 Down on your knees!
james_ford Alright, alright... you got me. Take me to your leader.
john_locke That island over there... that's where I sent Sawyer.
kate_austen You could have just told me that you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages, you didn't have to bring me down here.
john_locke Sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you. You referred to me as a dead man. I am not a dead man. I know what you're feeling, Kate. I know what you're going through.
kate_austen And how do you know that?
john_locke Because... my mother was crazy. Long time ago, before I... looked like this... I had a mother, just like everyone. She was a very disturbed woman. And, as a result of that, I had some growing pains. Problems that I'm still trying to work my way through. Problems that could have been avoided had things been different.
kate_austen Why are you telling me this?
john_locke Because now Aaron has a crazy mother too.
zoe Get in. He's waiting for you.
LAURA#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode08 It's not me I'm worried about. I just don't know what I would do if anything ever happened to you or Ma.
charles_widmore Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us. Not today, anyway. That's the way you live this life. Each day, one at a time. Now, if you spend your whole life worryin' about something that's gonna happen, before you know it, your life's over and you spent an awful lot of it just worryin'.
charles_widmore Hey, you heard that? Now that's what life's all about. Laughin' and lovin' each other. And knowin' that people aren't really gone when they die. We have all the good memories to sustain us until we see 'em again.
LAURA#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode08 It's hard not being afraid, Pa...
charles_widmore I know, sweetheart. I know.
dr_charlotte_lewis You've got to be joking.
james_ford May I come in?
dr_charlotte_lewis Absolutely not.
james_ford Why not?
dr_charlotte_lewis You don't get to kick me out at three o'clock in the morning and then come around the next day with puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower. Look, I don't know if you're just lonely, or guilty, or completely mad... but, you know what? I don't care. You blew it.
james_ford What do you got in here?
zoe None of your business. Keep moving.
charles_widmore Come.
zoe He's here, sir.
charles_widmore Thanks, Zoe.
charles_widmore Would you leave us please?
zoe Of course.
charles_widmore Hello, Mr. Ford. My name is Charles Widmore.
charles_widmore Do you know who I am?
james_ford Of course I do. You're the fella that sent a freighter to the island loaded with guys to kill us all.
charles_widmore It's sad, really... how little you actually know.
james_ford Well, I know you murdered all them people out there and dropped 'em in a ditch.
charles_widmore We didn't murder those people. But I don't expect you to believe that.
james_ford Good, I don't.
charles_widmore So, why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island.
james_ford John Locke sent me.
charles_widmore John Locke's dead.
james_ford I think we both know the guy I'm talking about's not really Locke. Here's the deal, Chief... I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear, that I didn't find anybody. Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep... then you can kill him.
charles_widmore And what do you want in exchange, James?
james_ford One The people I come back with, people on my boat don't get touched. Not even a hair on their head. And two You give us safe passage off the Island.
charles_widmore How do I know I can trust you?
james_ford Same way I know I can trust you. So, do we have an agreement?
charles_widmore I suppose we do.
claire_littleton Kate. I just wanna say I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me and about Aaron. Thank you. And thank you for taking care of him.
claire_littleton I'm sorry, I'm so, so, sorry.
kate_austen It's okay. It's okay.
john_locke How'd it go?
james_ford You didn't really send me over there to find passengers from that plane, did you?
john_locke No.
james_ford Well in case you're interested, they're all dead.
john_locke Well that's terrible. What happened?
james_ford I don't know.
john_locke Well what do you know, James?
james_ford I know there's a man over there on that island that ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight. Came over on a sub. Name's Widmore.
john_locke Charles Widmore?
james_ford Well, I guess y'all know each other. He ain't alone. Counted at least six armed compadres with him, not to mention whatever crew's on that sub. There's a locked room on there, something they're hiding. And they're setting up pylons, like the ones in New Otherton. You know, ones that keep out that smoke thing.
john_locke Now what did you tell them about me?
james_ford I told 'em I'd tell you the coast was clear, and bring you back with me...walk you right into their trap. That way they could kill you. Which means they'll be caught with their pants down when we change our plan of attack.
john_locke I appreciate your loyalty, James.
james_ford You said you were gonna get me off this Island. Deal's a deal.
miles_straume What are you doing here?
james_ford Get in the car.
miles_straume Who's Sawyer?
james_ford When I was nine years old...my father shot my mother, then he killed himself. Sawyer was the reason why. He was a grifter...con man. I've been hunting him down since the day I left the academy. I chased down a lead in Australia, got a name - Anthony Cooper - I ran the name, I got a list of Anthony Coopers and I've been calling them. And when I find the right one...I'm gonna kill him.
miles_straume Why didn't you tell me any of this?
james_ford I knew you'd try to talk me out of it.
miles_straume Damn right.
james_ford Fair enough.
james_ford Whoa! My car!
james_ford Hey!
james_ford Son of a bitch.
james_ford What's for dinner?
kate_austen Rabbit. I think.
james_ford Good, I'm starving.
kate_austen What are you doing running errands for Locke?
james_ford I ain't running errands for nobody.
kate_austen He said he sent you over to the other island. Did you find the plane?
james_ford Yeah, and that ain't the only thing over there. Guy named Widmore set up camp over on the beach. Got a whole team with him - guys with guns - they're here for Locke.
kate_austen So what are you gonna do?
james_ford I'm gonna let them fight it out. And while they got their hands full with each other...you and me are getting the hell off this Island.
kate_austen Even if we could get on that plane, who's gonna fly it?
james_ford We ain't taking the plane, Freckles. Taking the sub.
