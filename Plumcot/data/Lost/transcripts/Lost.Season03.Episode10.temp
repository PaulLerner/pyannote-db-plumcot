DAVID You got that thing running yet, buddy?
YOUNG HURLEY Naw, but I got your tools all set.
DAVID Let's see if we can get this thing started, okay?
YOUNG HURLEY I thought we needed a new carburetor?
DAVID Well, maybe we don't. Come on, slide behind the wheel. Let's fire this up.
DAVID What's the matter? Go ahead.
YOUNG HURLEY It's stupid. Without a new carburetor it's not going to work.
DAVID Having hope is never stupid. You've got to believe good things will happen and then they will. You understand what I'm saying? In this world, son, you've got to make your own luck. Alright, come on.
YOUNG HURLEY Well, what do you want to fix today?
DAVID We're going to have to put that on hold for a little while because, um, I've got to go to Vegas. You know, I've got some work out there.
YOUNG HURLEY What about the road trip?
DAVID The Grand Canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. Hey, I've got something for you. 
YOUNG HURLEY Um, I'm not supposed to, mom says.
DAVID Live a little, Hugo. It's just a candy bar. Alright, I'll be back before you know it. Hold down the fort? You're my man? Alright.
HURLEY So then, the Others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which I did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to Eko -- they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then, I've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby.
CHARLIE Bloody hell.
HURLEY Dude, you okay?
CHARLIE Peachy.
HURLEY Really? Because you've kind of been moping...
CHARLIE Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley. Okay?
HURLEY You can tell me anything.
CHARLIE Desmond told me I was going to die. He told me has these flashes -- visions, whatever -- and in them I always die. So this is the part where you tell me it is ridiculous, don't be daft, he's a nutter.
HURLEY I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault.
CHARLIE Your fault?
HURLEY I'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude.
CHARLIE Vincent? Is that an arm?
HURLEY Here, Vincent. Come here. I think we need to get that.
CHARLIE Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest.
HURLEY Okay, if I'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody.
HURLEY Vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent.
HURLEY Awesome.
TRICIA It's everyone's fantasy -- winning the lottery -- untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes, winner of a record 140 million dollars, outside Mr. Clucks Chicken in Diamond Bar which will be having its grand re-opening tomorrow. So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is why did you buy Mr. Clucks?
HURLEY Uh, I like chicken.
TRICIA Um, also with us is Hugo's former boss, and now employee, Randy Nation. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes? Um, okay, so, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak?
HURLEY Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend, Starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
TRICIA Cut! What the hell was that?! It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes, do you know what that is?
HURLEY Yeah. Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.
TRICIA Um, do you mind if we go inside and shoot some B-roll?
HURLEY Oh, I don't know.
RANDY Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
TRICIA Okay, let's go. Ugh, god I hate this. I always get the stupid stories...
HURLEY Hey, you sure it's okay?
RANDY Yeah, relax.
HURLEY The safety guards are on the fryers?
RANDY Those fryers are stone cold, alright? We don't even start cooking until tomorrow.
HURLEY Do you hear something?
TRICIA And then pan through the...
PAULO Well, we are out of DHARMA Oat Bars.
NIKKI Already?
PAULO Yep.
NIKKI Did you check behind the powdered milk?
PAULO Yes, it's not there.
SUN Will you pass me the box of cereal? Will you pass me the box of cereal?
JIN 무슨 말을 하는지 모르겠어.
SUN From now on I will only speak to you in English. It's how you will learn.
JIN 아, 왜 이래.
SUN It will be hard at first.
JIN 싫다니까?
HURLEY Hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey!!
CLAIRE Hurley, what is it?
PAULO Is it the Others?
CLAIRE Hurley, are you okay?
PAULO What's going on man?
HURLEY Car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
NIKKI You found a car?
HURLEY And we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on.
PAULO Why do we need to start a car?
HURLEY Because it'll be fun. We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it. Especially you, dude. So who's with me?!!
PAULO Well, I've got to cut some bananas. Sorry.
CHARLIE I don't think so, Hurley.
HURLEY Come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming?!
HURLEY Thanks, dude. You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? Come on.
SAWYER Are we there yet?
KATE If we are where I think we are then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about 5 minutes.
SAWYER Try to contain your excitement, Freckles.
KATE Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.
SAWYER Maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke-- Ow, ow, ow.
KATE What happened?
SAWYER I stepped on something. Son-of-a-bitch!
KATE Looks like a dart.
SAWYER How the hell did it get out here?
KATE Alright, just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm going to pull it out. On the count of 3. Ready? 1 -- .
SAWYER Ow!!! I thought you said "3"?
KATE Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought I would spare you. You know, all you have to do is say sorry. You could start again -- give each other a clean slate.
SAWYER Slate. Like on Little House?
KATE What?
SAWYER Little House on the Prairie? Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school.
KATE You call it Little House?
SAWYER I had mono when I was a kid -- missed 2 months of school -- we only got one channel in my trailer.
KATE What are we even talking about?
SAWYER We ain't talking about nothing. 
KATE James?
SAWYER And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
KATE So that's how it's going to be? Welcome home, Sawyer. 
SAWYER Welcome home, Kate.
CARMEN Hugo! Hugo, is that you? Oh my god, what happened?
HURLEY Tricia Tanaka is dead.
CARMEN What?
HURLEY Mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone.
CARMEN That's crazy.
HURLEY It's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. Ow!!
CARMEN It was an accident.
HURLEY It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to Australia.
CARMEN Again with Australia.
HURLEY That's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me.
CARMEN Hugo, Hugo wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed.
HURLEY You can?
CARMEN Yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something.
DAVID Hey, Hugo!
CARMEN After 17 years your father has returned.
DAVID Hey, your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. Just kidding.
HURLEY Poor, Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude.
JIN Hurley! 이것 봐. In, In.
HURLEY Totally. Let's check it out. 
HURLEY Dude, Roger was on a beer run.
JIN 시체 꺼내자.
HURLEY I suck at charades. You want to what?
JIN 아냐, 아냐.
HURLEY Oh, you want to take Roger out? And turn it over. I understand!
HURLEY Okay, on 3. 1-2-3.
HURLEY We'll get that later.
CHARLIE So, when's it going to happen?
DESMOND When's what going to happen?
CHARLIE Don't play stupid with me, brother.
DESMOND I was drunk. Now if I said anything...
CHARLIE I have a right to know when I'm going to die.
DESMOND It doesn't work like that.
CHARLIE What doesn't work like that?
SAWYER Hey, Oliver Twist, where the hell's my stuff?
CHARLIE What stuff?
SAWYER Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
DESMOND Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
SAWYER You drank it?!
DESMOND Well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us.
CHARLIE Yeah, there was.
SAWYER You, the Munchkin, and who else?
JIN 이렇게, 응? 이렇게.
HURLEY Oh, I got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty.
JIN Crafty?
HURLEY Yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... crafts. Nevermind.
SAWYER Hey, where the hell's my stuff? What are you all doing?
HURLEY Dude! You're alive!! You're alive.
SAWYER Yeah, yeah, Snuffy. Good to see you, too. I'll be damned, you all found yourselves a hippy car.
HURLEY Pretty cool, huh?
JIN Sawyer.
SAWYER Jin-bo. How are you going?
JIN Good see you.
SAWYER Well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics.
HURLEY What about Jack and Kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
SAWYER Kate's with me, but the Doc -- they've still got him.
HURLEY Okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
SAWYER Well, what a relief.
HURLEY Naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign.
SAWYER Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.
HURLEY Uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
SAWYER Now why would I do that?
HURLEY Because there's beer.
SAYID Why did he say "don't come back?"
KATE He sacrificed himself so we could escape. He probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
SAYID Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt.
KATE Yep. They gave Michael a boat. He took off and never looked back.
SAYID Did you see any other boats?
KATE No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
LOCKE So they can leave the island?
KATE I don't know, John.
SAYID This zoo where they held you, is that where they live?
KATE We escaped with one of them -- a kid named Karl -- he says that they live on this island. He could have taken us there but Sawyer let him go.
SAYID Why?
KATE You're going to have to ask Sawyer. 
SAYID Kate, where are you going?
KATE I don't care what Jack said. They've got him and we've got to get him back. I owe him that. I'm going to get help.
LOCKE Help from who?
DAVID Now, that's a hell of a Jesus.
CARMEN Yes, Hugo's such a good son. He knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
DAVID Ah, that smells like great lasagna.
CARMEN The Tranhs made it themselves. Hugo found them in Bennigans. Now they are our butlers.
DAVID Something wrong, Hugo?
CARMEN Your father asked you a question, Hugo.
HURLEY My father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
DAVID I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
HURLEY What?!
CARMEN All those numbers and curses. Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought you needed a manly influence, a father, to get you stop this nonsense.
HURLEY I'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
DAVID Well, now that hurts.
HURLEY Well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh? Your services will no longer be needed. Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse.
CARMEN Hugo, what are you doing?
HURLEY Getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and I'm starting with him.
CARMEN No, Hugo. Your father is staying with us.
HURLEY He's staying with us? Where?
CARMEN It's been 17 years, Hugo.
HURLEY What's been 17 years?
CARMEN I have needs.
HURLEY No! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
CARMEN No you don't.
HURLEY Yeah, I do.
CARMEN Why don't you go show your father what you have in the garage? Hugo?
DAVID I can't believe it. You saved it. You saved it.
SAWYER Me first, now, come on.
SAWYER What the hell is up with all this recycling?
HURLEY You got me, dude.
SAWYER Looks like those DHARMA freaks were building some sort of dirt road. Woo, now we're talking.
JIN 이거 고치려면 시간 많이 걸리겠는데?
HURLEY Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?
SAWYER Son-of-a -- what's a head doing back here?
HURLEY Oh, that's just Roger. I'm going to start the car now.
JIN 아니, 아직 하지 마. 엔진부터 먼저 확인해야지.
HURLEY Dude, even if you were speaking English, I wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work.
HURLEY I have hope. This will work.
HURLEY Damn it.
SAWYER Hoh, it's flat and it stinks.
HURLEY Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
SAWYER Chill out; let the man do his thing.
HURLEY Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before Rocky III, maybe even II. It's probably poison by now.
SAWYER Skeletor seems to like it. Bottoms up.
HURLEY That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's Roger Workman.
SAWYER It's Work Man, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a DHARMA janitor.
HURLEY Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
JIN 배터리가 완전히 죽었어. 아무래도...
HURLEY Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?
JIN No. No fix.
HURLEY But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running.
SAWYER Leave the man alone. He's right, "no fix." Take a look at that mess -- no way it's going to get running. How thick are you?
HURLEY What's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work?
SAWYER I don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you?
HURLEY Because we could all use a little hope.
SAWYER If it's hope you're looking for ese, you're on the wrong damn island. There sure as hell ain't no hope here.
DAVID Rise and shine; hit the deck. We're burning daylight; let's go. What's with the earphones?
HURLEY It's for the noise.
DAVID Well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
HURLEY That is disgusting.
DAVID Come on, we're going on an adventure. Let's go.
HURLEY I'm not going anywhere with you.
DAVID Come on, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. I won't stop you, okay?
HURLEY What "one thing?"
DAVID We're going to break the curse.
HURLEY This is stupid.
DAVID Just give it a chance, man.
LYNN Cut the deck please. You've recently come into a great deal of money.
HURLEY You could have seen that on the news.
LYNN But it hasn't brought you happiness. No, it's brought you great misfortune.
DAVID She didn't see that on the news.
LYNN I'm seeing numbers.
HURLEY What numbers?
LYNN 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers. Great tragedy. I'm sorry.
HURLEY Why? What is it?
LYNN Death surrounds you; and more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed. Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes.
HURLEY My clothes?
LYNN A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you. And it must be exorcised.
HURLEY Did my dad put you up to this?
LYNN What?
DAVID Hugo, please.
HURLEY I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
LYNN The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. How dare you!
HURLEY 10,000.
LYNN Your dad put me up to it.
DAVID I was just trying to help.
HURLEY Help who?
SAWYER Beer.
JIN Beer.
SAWYER Bingo. Beautiful. Car.
JIN Car.
SAWYER International House of Pancakes. What are you doing over there?
HURLEY I'm praying.
SAWYER Praying for what?
HURLEY Help.
SAWYER Well, hell, I've got you a little help right here.
HURLEY Dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on.
CHARLIE Not moping -- thinking.
HURLEY Uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found? We're getting it running.
CHARLIE What's the point? Ow! What did you do that for?
HURLEY Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both. Now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die.
CHARLIE That's supposed to convince me to come with you?
HURLEY It is. Because if you don't die, then we win.
CHARLIE Win?
HURLEY Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and I could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man." Let's make our own luck. What do you say?
SAWYER I'm sorry.
JIN I'm sorry.
SAWYER Okay, nice. Keep it coming.
JIN You were right.
SAWYER Okay. That's two. Hit me.
JIN Those pants don't make you look fat.
SAWYER Now you got it -- only three things a woman needs to hear.
HURLEY Come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
SAWYER What's your problem, Jumbotron.
HURLEY Shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
SAWYER Touché. What is Jiminy Cricket doing here?
HURLEY We need another man.
SAWYER Another man for what?
HURLEY To push this car, dude.
SAWYER Push it? Push it where?
SAWYER Oh, this is going to be real good.
DAVID So, you're going to Australia, huh? Long way to go because of some stupid numbers.
HURLEY I'd really like you to leave.
DAVID When your mom called me about the lottery I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, I saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money.
HURLEY Well, you're not getting any of it.
DAVID That's not why I'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not going to break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just -- you need a little hope. We make our own luck, Hugo. You know what I think you should do?
HURLEY What?
DAVID I think you should give away the money. All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a new carburetor -- work on the Camaro -- you know, just you and me -- take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. Never too late for a fresh start.
HURLEY I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. 
DAVID Hey, I'll -- I'll be here when you get back.
SAWYER Are you nuts? You're not going to drive down that.
HURLEY We're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down I'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
SAWYER You see those rocks? All you're going to do is crash into those real fast. If you don't roll over first.
JIN Hurley, no.
HURLEY Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; I know it.
SAWYER What are you out here for -- watch him crash and burn?
CHARLIE Came to ride shotgun.
SAWYER Well, it's your funeral. Come on, let's give 'em their ride.
HURLEY Are you sure you want to do this?
CHARLIE Victory or death.
HURLEY Push!
HURLEY Oh, jeez.
CHARLIE Careful now. Now would be a good time, Hurley. Like right now!
HURLEY There is no curse. You make your own luck.
CHARLIE Hurley!
HURLEY You make your own luck. There is no curse!
SAWYER Son-of-a-bitch.
JIN Hurley!
SAYID Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack why didn't you ask us?
KATE Two reasons -- you don't know where to look and you're not motivated. And I don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back?
LOCKE You're wrong.
KATE Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after--
LOCKE Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it it'll lead us right to him.
KATE How?
SAYID Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him.
LOCKE So now you know our secret, how about you tell us yours?
KATE No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. It's alright! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out!
DANIELLE What are you doing here?
KATE I came to ask for your help.
DANIELLE To do what?
KATE I'm heading to the Other's camp, and if I'm going to find it, I need someone who knows the island.
DANIELLE What makes you think I have an interest in helping you?
KATE Because they had me, and they would have never let me go -- probably would have killed me if I hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape -- she was about 16 years old and her name was Alex. I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
