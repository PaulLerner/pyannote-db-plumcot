JACK C'mon, out of the way! I need room. Steady.
KATE Boone, can you hear me? It's okay, we've got you.
HURLEY What happened?
KATE He fell down a cliff.
HURLEY But he was with Locke.
JACK Hold steady.
SUN Jack, his leg.
JACK I know. He's bleeding. Keep him steady, damn it. You've got to press harder than that, Kate.
KATE I know. I'm trying.
JACK Alright, slow now. Slow and gentle. Easy. Sun, pair of scissors - second drawer in the cart. Second drawer! Diapers in the first drawer. Sun's going to switch places with you. Sun, I need...
SUN Yes, I understand.
JACK Hurley, grab me that first class seat from up there. Also, I need that mesh. We need to create some kind of sterile -- . Hurley, I swear to god, if you faint!
HURLEY No -- first class -- mesh - I'm cool. Lord in heaven.
JACK Get to the beach. Ransack Sawyer's stuff. I want his alcohol - rubbing, scotch.
KATE Jack, what's going on?
JACK His lung just collapsed. Okay. Okay, okay, good Boone. Good, Boone, that's good. Good job. Alright, a little bit of tube in that and you're going to be just fine. What are you still doing here? The alcohol, Kate! You want him to live -- get to the beach, now!
MARC Alright, damn it, just get the stupid clip-on, huh?
JACK You know why they call it a tie? Because you've got to tie it.
MARC You know why they call it a clip-on? Because you clip it -- on.
JACK You nervous, Silverman?
MARC What the hell do I have to be nervous about?
JACK It's a big responsibility.
MARC I can handle responsibility.
JACK Maybe. But I know that you don't like to get up in front of crowds.
MARC I'll be fine. After about 8 beers, I'll be fine.
JACK She'll bust you, man.
MARC I'll brush my teeth.
JACK She'll bust you. You can still back out, Marc.
MARC Nah, it's just a stupid speech. I'll make you proud.
TUX SHOP OWNER Okay, groom's turn.
MARC You can still back out, Jack.
BOONE Oh, it hurts.
JACK It's a closed fracture but I think I can set it.
SUN His chest, the wound. Can you -- sew him?
JACK He's lost a lot of blood. I wonder how far Locke had to carry him.
BOONE I'm going to die.
JACK Boone, listen to me. Listen! You are not going to die. I'm going to fix this, okay? I am going to save you.
MICHAEL You've got to flip it or it'll burn, Walt.
SAWYER Hey, mamacita. You want some fish?
CLAIRE No, thanks. I'm not really hungry. How long do you think 'til it's ready?
MICHAEL Maybe a week, maybe less. You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah, I'm fine. Alright, I'll see you guys later.
SAWYER She likes me.
MICHAEL Hey, Jin! Jin! Want some fish? Hey, take a break. Eat some fish.
SAWYER The man's got what I call an overzealous work ethic.
MICHAEL Try obsession. He wants off this Island bad, man.
SAWYER Can't say I blame poor Kato. His lady speaks English all this time and he didn't have a clue? I'm surprised he didn't try to swim out of here. Hell, I would've.
KATE Sawyer, I need all your alcohol. Now!
SAWYER How'd it happen?
KATE Locke said that he fell off a cliff while they were out hunting boar.
SAWYER Boar they never seem to get.
KATE Is that it? 
SAWYER Afraid so. You need anything else? I could come with you.
KATE Too many cooks already, but thanks.
BOONE I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
JACK He needs blood.
SUN What?
JACK Blood. A transfusion.
SUN How will you do that?
JACK I don't know. I'll figure it out. After I set the leg.
SUN Let me.
JACK That's okay.
SUN Let me. Get some air.
CHARLIE How is he?
JACK Don't know yet.
CHARLIE What happened out there? Where's Locke? Do you think that...
JACK I don't know!
CHARLIE What, he just took off?
JACK Yeah, Charlie. He just took off.
CHARLIE Where's Shannon?
JACK I don't know.
CHARLIE Well, she's his sister. You don't think...
JACK I don't know where she is!
MARC And here she is, the future Mrs. Jack Shepard.
SARAH Thank you. Wow, can I get another microphone? I think this one's been drinking. A little over two years ago, I blew a tire out -- flipped over the center divider into oncoming traffic, and was hit head-on by an SUV. My back was broken. They all said it was irreparable. And then there was Jack. And he promised he would fix me, because that's the kind of guy he is. Because you are the most committed man I have ever known -- because you fixed me, I will dance at our wedding. To Jack, my hero, Jack.
SUN Give him this -- for the pain.
JACK I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here.
SUN It is not a remedy.
JACK Will you hold his shoulders? Here we go.
KATE Claire? What are you doing out here?
CLAIRE Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.
KATE Oh god, you're having a baby.
KATE Claire, we need to get you back to camp.
CLAIRE I'm fine. I just need to -- I just need to catch my breath.
KATE It's not okay. You're having your baby.
CLAIRE No, I'm not, okay. It's just gas pains, it's fine.
KATE You're having contractions, Claire!
CLAIRE No! I'm bloody not. Can you just leave me alone?
KATE C'mon, I've got to get you to Jack. Please try to stand. Please.
CLAIRE Look, I can't.
KATE Help! Somebody help!
JIN 오. 이런.
KATE Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay, you understand? We need Jack.
JIN Jack. Doctor.
KATE Yes. Get the doctor, please come here.
CLAIRE Don't leave me.
KATE Oh, no, no, honey. I won't. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise. Jack, hurry.
JACK Ask him again.
SUN He's in shock.
JACK That's why you need to ask him again.
SUN Boone, can you hear me? What is your blood type? Boone, please listen. What is your blood type?
JACK Damn it.
SUN Maybe a smaller piece?
JACK Veins are like a wet noodle -- first you have to find one, then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it. I've got bamboo. None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type, not to mention that his injuries-
BOONE A-negative.
JACK Boone, what'd you say?
BOONE Shannon, the plane.
JACK Did you hear A-negative? Get Charlie -- ask everyone you can find, everyone, what their blood type is. A negative, okay? And find his sister. Find Shannon.
SHANNON Where are we going?
SAYID This way.
SHANNON Oh, okay. Are you lost?
SAYID No, absolutely not. Those trees look really familiar. It's this way -- I think.
SHANNON Did you just say I think?
SAYID Surprise.
JACK Damn it.
CHARLIE I found an A.
JACK Positive or negative?
CHARLIE She doesn't know. I also found two B positives and one AB negative. At least, he thinks so.
JACK Did you find any O negative?
CHARLIE Sun said A negative.
JACK Where is she?
CHARLIE We split up. I thought she'd be back here.
JACK You only asked 4 people?
CHARLIE I asked the whole sodding camp -- no one knows their blood type. I don't know my bloody blood type.
JACK Did you find Shannon?
SUN No. I was getting you this. A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle.
JACK It's perfect.
CHARLIE Not to rain on your proverbial parade but I thought you said we needed someone who was A negative.
JACK Or O negative.
CHARLIE Right, which judging by your tantrum, no one is.
JACK Someone is.
CHARLIE You? Why'd you make-
JACK O negative is universal donor. It's in the ballpark, it's not a match. My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock -- stop his heart.
CHARLIE You mean he'll die.
JACK He's not going to die.
SARAH Those girls are checking you out.
JACK You're in your PJs.
SARAH Indeed I am.
JACK Are they cute?
SARAH Who?
JACK The girls that are checking me out.
SARAH Mmm, one of them is kind of cute. The other one's just trashy. Heart and Soul?
JACK You got it.
SARAH I'm taking the easy part.
JACK Of course.
SARAH You know you really don't have to do this if you don't want to.
JACK How do you know I haven't?
SARAH Because you haven't. Oh, sorry. It was a silly idea. I just -- I read too many bridal magazines. I think it rotted my brain.
JACK Sarah, I want to. I'm going to. I just have to figure out the right way to say it.
SARAH Just vows.
JACK Just vows?
SARAH Hey, he's going to come.
JACK Yeah, I know.
SARAH So, you stay down here as long as you need to. And when you're ready I'll be upstairs. I cannot wait to marry you Jack Shepard.
JIN Jack, Jack, doctor, Jack!
HURLEY Jack.
JIN 그... 그... 해변가 근처 정글에 있는 그 임신한 여자... 지금 애 낳으려고 해요. Claire.
CHARLIE Claire? What about Claire?
JIN 지금 케이트하고 같이 있는데, 빨리 오래요.
SUN He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor. Just off the beach.
CHARLIE Claire's having the baby? Where, where?
JIN 잭이 필요하대요.
SUN 클레어는 괜찮아요?
JIN 그런 것 같은데, 많이 아픈가봐.
SUN He says he thinks she's okay, but she's in pain.
JACK Does he know how fast the contractions are coming?
SUN 진통은 얼마마다 와요?
JIN 어... 아마... 2분만에... 한번씩?
SUN Every 2 minutes.
JACK Is she nauseous? Can she stand? Is there any bleeding? Did her water break?
SUN 구토 증상은요? 움직일 수 있나요? 하혈은요? 양수가 터졌나요?
JIN 양수가 터진지는 모르겠는데, 움직이지는 못할거야.
SUN No, none of that, but she can't move.
CHARLIE We should go. What do we need -- towels, bandages, hot water? How do we take hot water?
JACK I'm sure you'll figure all that out, alright. You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire.
SUN 당신은 찰리랑 함께 클레어한테 다시 가세요.
CHARLIE Uh, I know. That, that dilating thing -- how do I look out for that?
JACK Charlie, listen to me. Okay, Charlie, look at me. Tell Kate to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart, you got that? Now, she's going to need to make sure that Claire pushes, but not too hard, not too fast -- just until the head is clear. And then, as hard as she can. When the baby is out make sure she clears it's nose and it's mouth.
CHARLIE Yeah, but, you'll be there by then, right?
JACK No, I'm not going anywhere. I need to stay here. Now, you tell Kate she's going to have to deliver this baby.
CLAIRE They've stopped.
KATE That happens, I think.
CLAIRE No, no, no, they're not coming anymore. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.
KATE No. Claire.
CLAIRE No, no, no. I'm okay, really.
KATE Claire, I don't think that you should be doing...
CLAIRE What is that?
KATE I think your water just broke.
CLAIRE No, no, no.
KATE Yeah, no, no, I think you, okay...
CLAIRE No, I can't have the baby now.
KATE Just hold on...
CLAIRE I can't have the baby now!
KATE Just hold on. Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming.
BOONE I screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?
JACK Hey.
BOONE My leg, it hurts.
JACK Don't try moving. Can you breathe okay?
BOONE It fell on me.
JACK What fell?
BOONE A plane. It was a plane.
JACK Boone. Boone, Locke said you fell from a cliff.
BOONE No -- it was. It fell -- the plane. It's because of the hatch. We found a hatch.
JACK Boone, Boone, stay with me, man. Hey, stay with me.
BOONE Locke said, John said, John said not to tell. About the hatch.
JACK What did Locke do? What hatch? What...
BOONE Oh, my leg hurts.
JACK Boone? Boone, hey.
BOONE Shannon, Shannon, Shannon...
SHANNON I need to tell you something.
SAYID Alright.
SHANNON My brother, Boone. He's not really my brother. He's my step-brother. Our parents got married when we were, like, 8 and 10. He's kind of in love with me.
SAYID In love with you? And how do you feel towards him?
SHANNON I'll always feel something for him. But am I in love with him in that way? No. Not at all. We're here for god knows how long, and so is Boone.
SAYID Maybe we should go back?
SHANNON I don't want to go back.
SAYID Are you sure?
SHANNON Yes. I just need to take it a little slow. Are you okay with that?
SAYID I had no expectations.
SHANNON Right.
SAYID Hopes, not expectations.
CLAIRE Oh, god, that hurts.
CHARLIE Hello? Hey, Kate. Claire, is she okay?
KATE Where's Jack?
CHARLIE Couldn't come.
KATE What do you mean he couldn't come?
CHARLIE He's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now.
KATE Okay, okay. We'll just pick her up and bring her to him.
CHARLIE No, Kate.
KATE No, we have to take her to him before it's too late.
CHARLIE Look, Jack said you have to deliver the baby.
KATE What?
CHARLIE Now, he talked me through it...
KATE No.
CHARLIE It's relatively simple.
KATE I can't do this.
CHARLIE Yes, you can. I have water. I have towels.
KATE You're not listening to me. I can't deliver this baby.
CHARLIE Well, somebody bloody has to.
JIN 오래 걸리지 않을거에요. 안정을 취해봐요.
CLAIRE You know I was out there for over a week -- days I can't remember. I mean, what if, what if they did something to the baby? I'm not ready for this. I'm not -- I'm so scared. I'm scared.
KATE I'm, I'm scared, too. But we're going to get through this together, okay?
JACK C'mon, Boone.
SUN It's not working.
JACK The blood's not the problem. It's the leg. All the blood's pooling there -- compartment syndrome. He didn't get this injury from a fall. Something crushed his leg.
JACK What are you doing?
SUN You've given him enough.
JACK Hurley.
HURLEY Whoa, dude. You alright, man? You're looking kind of goth.
JACK Where's Michael?
HURLEY The beach, I think.
JACK I need you to go get him for me, okay?
HURLEY What for?
JACK Just get him.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Hey, kiddo.
JACK Hey.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD How's the water?
JACK Oh, it's fantastic.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Screaming kid next to me in first class. How does that happen, huh? What you got there?
JACK Oh, Sarah wants us to write our own vows.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD 'My hearts skips beats at the sound of your voice. My skin warms to the touch of your fingers. Where you go, I will go,' etc. etc. This is very nice.
JACK Those aren't my vows. Those are hers. I stole them out of the room. Can't write mine.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Yeah, well, you're a doctor, not a writer.
JACK Right.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Right. Sarah is a beautiful girl.
JACK Hell, yeah, she is.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Do you love her?
JACK Absolutely.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Then why are you sitting out here?
JACK What if I can't be the husband, or the father, that I want to be? What if I asked her because I saved her life? Should I marry her, dad?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Commitment is what makes you tick, Jack. The problem is you're just not good at letting go.
MICHAEL You're saying Locke lied?
JACK He didn't fall. His leg was pinned under something -- something heavy.
MICHAEL Okay, Jack, wait. The cargo container? We've got to do this? What about the axe?
JACK We can't use the axe.
SUN What are you doing?
JACK The right leg is filling with blood. If I don't stop it I won't be able to save him.
SUN You don't mean that-
JACK The leg is dead.
JACK There's no other choice.
KATE Claire, I think this is about the time you're supposed to start pushing, okay? So, push.
KATE And, don't hold your breath, honey. You won't be able to push if you -- Claire? Claire, what are you doing? Oh, no, no, no, Claire, you need to push, right now. Don't do this, Claire, okay? You can't stop this -- this is happening. Your baby is coming and I need your help.
CLAIRE It's not going to want me.
KATE What?
CLAIRE It knows I don't want it -- that I was going to give it away. Babies know that stuff.
KATE Do you want this baby now? Hmm? Do you want it to be healthy and safe? Okay, then the baby knows that, too. You are not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours, but I need you to push, okay? Okay? Alright. 1, 2, 3, push. Good. Good, push!
CHARLIE Yeah, right. Okay.
SUN Jack.
JACK Let's go.
SUN Jack.
JACK On 3...
SUN Jack.
JACK 1, 2, 3...
SUN Why are you doing this? He's bleeding inside. You're not helping him! You can't save him, Jack. You just can't!
JACK Don't tell me what I can't do! Okay, 1, 2, 3, go.
JACK You don't need to see this.
MICHAEL If you need me, shout.
SARAH In sickness and in health, in good times and bad, I risk it all because I love you.
MINISTER Thank you, Sarah. Jack has also prepared his vows. Jack, if you would, please. Jack?
JACK I didn't write any vows. I've been trying to for a month, but I couldn't. So I started to wonder why that was. And as time went on it only got worse -- because I'm, because I'm not good at letting go. Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail. But I know one thing. I would've never been able to write anything as beautiful as what you just said. And last night, Sarah, when you were talking about the accident -- you got it all wrong. I didn't fix you. You fixed me. I love you, Sarah, and I always will.
BOONE Wait. Wait.
JACK I have to, if I don't...
BOONE I'm all messed up inside. You know it.
JACK This is our best chance.
BOONE There's no chance. Really. I mean, look where we are.
JACK I'm not going to let you give up.
BOONE I know you made a promise. I'm letting you off the hook. Let me go, Jack.
JACK I'm sorry.
BOONE Don't be.
KATE Breathe, c'mon breathe, breathe, okay, okay. Ready? I think it's close, c'mon. Go, go, go. That's really good. C'mon, I think it's close. Okay, good, good, good. I can see it. I can see the top of its head. I can see it. I can see it, okay. You're almost there. You're so close, you're so close. Ready, ready? C'mon, one more. Push, push, push, push, push! Oh, you have a little boy. Your baby boy.
CLAIRE I have a son. I have a son.
BOONE Tell Shannon -- tell Shannon -- tell her...
JACK It's a beautiful, healthy baby.
KATE Want to talk about it?
JACK Talk about what?
KATE Boone died, Jack.
JACK He didn't die. He was murdered.
KATE What? Jack, where are you going?
JACK To find John Locke.
