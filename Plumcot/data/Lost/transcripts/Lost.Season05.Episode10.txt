young_benjamin_linus BEN Hey Phil.
phil Hey.
young_benjamin_linus BEN I brought another sandwich for him. Chicken salad this time.
phil Yeah, I don't think it's the menu. He's not eating. Save yourself the trouble kid.
young_benjamin_linus BEN But Horace told me to.
phil Why does he care so much? That guy's a hostile.
young_benjamin_linus BEN That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
phil Whatever.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Brought you a sandwich. And a book. I read it twice. It's good.
sayid_jarrah Thank you.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Did Richard send you? Richard. He's your leader, right? It's just a camera. They can see, but they can't hear. Four years ago I ran away into the jungle and Richard found me. I said I wanted to leave. That I wanted to join you. So I've been patient. And if you're patient too, I think I can help you.
[Flashback#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 - A man rushes in through a doorway, frantically dropping his bags and shutting the door behind him. He scrambles along hallway into a room, whose door he deadbolts upon entering. He briefly stops to listen at the door. When he hears banging noises coming from outside the room, he rushes to a large wooden cabinet and begins emptying it of its contents. A safe is revealed inside. The banging noises continue as the man enters the combination and opens the safe. Suddenly, the room’s door bursts open and Sayid appears, holding a gun, which he points at the man.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 2 Подожди! Подожди! Подожди, не стреляй! Триста или четыреста тысяч евро. Они все твои. Пожалуйста, пожалуйста. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on, don't shoot! Three or four hundred thousand euros. It's all yours . Please, pleasе.
ben_linus How'd it go?
sayid_jarrah He tried to bribe me. It didn’t work.
ben_linus Of course it didn't.
sayid_jarrah Where to now?
ben_linus Nowhere. You're done.
sayid_jarrah What do you mean I'm done?
ben_linus We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends. It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah So that's it? I killed all those people for you, and now you're just walking away?
ben_linus You didn't kill them for me, Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations! Mission accomplished!
sayid_jarrah What do I do now?
ben_linus I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid.
horace_goodspeed Put out your hands. Come on.
sayid_jarrah Thank you.
horace_goodspeed It's nice to finally hear your voice. I'm Horace.
horace_goodspeed Now's the part where you tell me your name. I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle.
stuart_radzinsky Ask him about the model.
horace_goodspeed Radzinsky! I got this. Those handcuffs...are you having some kind of problem with your people? Because either you're in some kind of disagreement, which makes me want to help you, or you're a spy, trying to infiltrate us. So which is it?
horace_goodspeed Okay. I'm gonna give you an hour to decide whether you want to talk to me. But if you decide you don’t want to, then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level.
james_ford I think your bacon's ready.
dr_juliet_burke Hmm. I forgot.
james_ford What's on the TV? Ah.
dr_juliet_burke It's over, isn't it?
james_ford What's over?
dr_juliet_burke This. Us. Playing house. All of it. I never actually thought they'd come back.
james_ford So they're back! Nothing's changed.
dr_juliet_burke What if Sayid tells them who he is?
james_ford Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'. Hey. I got this under control.
james_ford Mornin' H.
horace_goodspeed Jim.
james_ford What's up?
horace_goodspeed Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke Horace.
horace_goodspeed I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem.
james_ford Why, what'd he say?
horace_goodspeed Nothing. Which is what worries me. We need to find out why he violated the truce. Why the hell he would come into our territory. I'm just going to have to have Oldham do his thing on him.
james_ford That psychopath? No way!
horace_goodspeed What choice do I have?
james_ford Just let me have a go at him alone.
horace_goodspeed Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man, he is not gonna talk.
james_ford Oh, he'll talk to me.
phil Mr. LaFleur!
james_ford Take your lunch Phil.
phil You going back there alone?
james_ford Take your lunch, Phil.
james_ford How you doin'?
sayid_jarrah A twelve-year-old Ben Linus brought me a chicken salad sandwich. How do you think I'm doing?
james_ford Sweet kid, huh?
sayid_jarrah How can you live with him here?
james_ford 'Cause I ain't got a choice.
sayid_jarrah Is that so?
james_ford Let's see how you feel after three years of livin' in the seventies. Lucky for you, I spent that time gettin' myself into a position to save your ass. I'm sorry, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah What are you doing?!
james_ford When I tell them I got your confession I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy.
sayid_jarrah What confession?
james_ford We're gonna say you were trying to defect. You're gonna offer some intel on the others in exchange for living with us.
sayid_jarrah And why in God's name would I want to do that?
james_ford What the hell else am I supposed to do with you?
sayid_jarrah Let me go!
james_ford And then what? I can’t just let you go!
sayid_jarrah Why not?
james_ford 'Cause these people trust me! I've built a life here – and a pretty good one. I let you go, all that goes away. So you got yourself a choice, Chief. Either you cooperate and join the party in Dharmaville, or you're on your own.
sayid_jarrah Then I guess I'm on my own.
hugo_reyes Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really bring out the ham.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks, Hurley.
hugo_reyes So... What's going on with Sayid?
dr_jack_shephard Don't know anything yet.
kate_austen What do you mean, you don't know anything? I thought you were at Sawyer's last night. What did he tell you?
dr_jack_shephard He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.
hugo_reyes And you're going to?
kate_austen I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.
hugo_reyes Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?
kate_austen Well, why wouldn't she?
hugo_reyes 'Cause they're together.
kate_austen What do you mean, they're together?
hugo_reyes "Together" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, "together" like you guys were. I thought it was kind of obvious. I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
dr_jack_shephard Hurley.
hugo_reyes Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles.
kate_austen Did you know?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen Hmm.
roger_linus You know what I can't figure out? Is how the hell you got caught. You hostiles are supposed to be the kings of the jungle. And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots?
sayid_jarrah And yet you're the one who mops up after them.
roger_linus Yeah, well... We'll see how cute you are once Oldham gets done with you, pal.
roger_linus What the hell are you doing here?
young_benjamin_linus BEN I was bringing you a sandwich.
roger_linus A sandwich?
roger_linus You never made me a sandwich in your life.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Yeah, well... I-I made one for myself...
roger_linus Uh-huh.
young_benjamin_linus BEN So... So I just thought that I'd bring you--
roger_linus Oh, yeah? You just...
young_benjamin_linus BEN Dad, don't!
roger_linus Don't you lie to me. What are you doin' down here?
roger_linus You made this sandwich for him, didn't you? Hmm?
young_benjamin_linus BEN Yes.
roger_linus Who told you to do that?
young_benjamin_linus BEN Nobody.
roger_linus Nobody?
young_benjamin_linus BEN I just thought that--
roger_linus You "just thought," huh? Go home.
young_benjamin_linus BEN
roger_linus Go on. I'll tell you what to think.
sayid_jarrah How did you find me?
ben_linus I looked.
sayid_jarrah What do you want, Ben?
ben_linus John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered.
sayid_jarrah Why would anyone kill him?
ben_linus I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution.
sayid_jarrah They're watching him?
ben_linus A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces.
sayid_jarrah And that's why you're here? You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man?
ben_linus You don't want to?
sayid_jarrah What makes you think I want to?
ben_linus Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah I'm not what you think I am. I don't like killing.
ben_linus Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you.
james_ford All right, last chance. You got anything to say?
james_ford Take him to Oldham.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 # I can't give you # # anything # # but love # # baby # # that's the only thing # # I've plenty of #]
horace_goodspeed Oldham.
horace_goodspeed Hey, man. Are we ready?
[##unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 dream a while, scheme a while # # you're sure to find # # happiness # # and I guess-- #]
sayid_jarrah Who is that man?
james_ford He's our you.
oldham Better put him in the restraints.
oldham Don't worry. They're for your protection. There are side effects to what I'm giving you. Open his mouth.
phil Open up.
oldham Don't be afraid. Just turn your mind off. Let it take effect.
oldham It's beyond your control, so fighting it is a poor use of your energies. You see, whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend. You will tell us the truth.
ben_linus There's somebody--somebody here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
sunhwa_kwon Who?
ben_linus The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
kate_austen Is that what this is about? This is insane. You are all crazy.
ben_linus Sayid, where are you going?
sayid_jarrah I don't want any part of this.
sayid_jarrah And if I see you again, it'll be extremely unpleasant for us both.
sayid_jarrah Ahh.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Do you have a menu?
bartender There you go. Sir? Another MacCutcheon?
sayid_jarrah Please.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 What's that run you?
sayid_jarrah Excuse me?
ilana_verdansky That scotch. What's a glass of that run you?
sayid_jarrah Whatever it is, it's worth it.
ilana_verdansky I don't understand why someone would pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.
sayid_jarrah If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me?
ilana_verdansky Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table. I'll have the rib eye, bloody.
bartender Yes, ma'am. Rib eye, bloody.
sayid_jarrah Are you a professional?
ilana_verdansky A professional what? You think I'm a prostitute? Mm. I'm not a professional anything. I just... Thought you looked sad. I like sad men.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry to hear that.
ilana_verdansky So... Other than drinking alone at bars...what do you do? For a living.
sayid_jarrah I'm between jobs at the moment.
ilana_verdansky So what did you do?
sayid_jarrah The only thing I was ever good at.
ilana_verdansky Then why did you quit?
sayid_jarrah I'm trying to change.
ilana_verdansky I know why you're sad now.
sayid_jarrah Do you?
ilana_verdansky When you are that good at something, there are always going to be people who tempt you into staying the same.
sayid_jarrah And how do you know so much about temptation?
ilana_verdansky Buy me a glass of that scotch, and I'll tell you.
horace_goodspeed Hello there. Hello?
oldham I'm going to ask you a few questions. I want you to relax and answer them truthfully... Not that you'll have any choice about it. What is your name?
sayid_jarrah Sayid. Sayid Jarrah.
oldham All right, Sayid. Why were you in handcuffs when we found you?
sayid_jarrah Because...because I am a bad man.
oldham Were you running away from your people?
sayid_jarrah What people?
oldham The hostiles.
sayid_jarrah I am not a hostile.
horace_goodspeed Then where did you come from, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah I came on a plane.
oldham What plane?
sayid_jarrah Ajira flight 3-1-6. And that's how I returned to the island.
oldham "Returned"? You've been here before?
sayid_jarrah Oh, yes. The first time, I was on Oceanic flight 8-1-5. It crashed. I was here for a hundred days. Then I left. Ask Sawyer.
oldham Who's "Sawyer"?
stuart_radzinsky Who cares?! None of this matters. Ask him about the Flame.
horace_goodspeed Quiet.
oldham What do you know about our stations here?
sayid_jarrah I know the Flame was a communication station. The Pearl was to observe other stations. The Swan was to study electromagnetism. But, of course, that was before the incident--
stuart_radzinsky The Swan?! How could he know what we were gonna name it? We haven't even built it yet! I told you! He saw the model! You see?! He is a spy!
horace_goodspeed Hey!
stuart_radzinsky I knew it!
horace_goodspeed Radzinsky! I'm not gonna tell you again. Cool it.
sayid_jarrah You're all going to die, you know.
horace_goodspeed What?
sayid_jarrah You're going to be killed.
horace_goodspeed How exactly would you know this, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Because I am from the future.
oldham Maybe I should've used half a dropper. Oops.
sayid_jarrah You... You used exactly enough.
dr_juliet_burke Bench grinder, lube equipment, drill press over here. Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here. How are you with a flat four engine? You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
kate_austen No, not really.
dr_juliet_burke It's okay. Jack told you about us...
kate_austen No. Hurley, actually.
dr_juliet_burke It's kind of a relief, actually. I wasn't quite sure how to do it without it sounding like I was telling you to stay away.
kate_austen It's fine.
horace_goodspeed All right... What do we do with him?
stuart_radzinsky We kill him.
james_ford Hold on a second. We're not killing anyone, right?
horace_goodspeed He violated the truce. What do you think they would do if they caught one of us?
james_ford Since when did we start acting like them? We're civilized.
HOACE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Yes, we are. We have a rule of law. And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself.
stuart_radzinsky Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind you, this man's seen things? He knows things. There's nothing to talk about. He's a spy.
james_ford You sure about that, Stu? He was trying to escape from the hostiles. He obviously has problems with his people.
stuart_radzinsky Yeah, and sharing our secrets are the quickest way for him to solve those problems.
HOACE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider.
stuart_radzinsky Consider? I mean, the longer he's among us, the--the more danger we're in.
james_ford I can talk to him, Horace. I just need more time.
stuart_radzinsky No, you had your chance, LaFleur!
james_ford Why are we on your clock, Radzinsky?
stuart_radzinsky Horace, you've got to call for a vote. Either we make a decision, or I call Ann Arbor...and they make it for us.
amy_goodspeed Radzinsky's right. Horace, please...
amy_goodspeed I can't... I can't sleep with one eye open. We have a baby now. We have to think about Ethan. We have to think about all the children here. How are we going to feel safe with this man around? I don't know what he's up to, but we can't keep him here. We have no choice.
horace_goodspeed Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All in favor of Radzinsky's solution, raise your hand.
stuart_radzinsky LaFleur?
horace_goodspeed I would really like to say it's unanimous.
ilana_verdansky Mmm. Just for the record, I really was just there for dinner.
sayid_jarrah Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?
sayid_jarrah Mmm.
ilana_verdansky I think it's too late for that.
ilana_verdansky Take it off.
ilana_verdansky You so much as flinch, and you're dead.
sayid_jarrah So who are you?
ilana_verdansky You asked me earlier if I was a professional. I am a professional. I was hired to bring you to Guam.
sayid_jarrah Who hired you?
ilana_verdansky The family of Peter Avellino--the man you killed in cold blood last year on a golf course in the Seychelles.
sayid_jarrah You're a bounty hunter?
ilana_verdansky Doesn't matter what I am. You're going to answer for what you've done.
james_ford Hit me in the face.
sayid_jarrah What?
james_ford Go on. You owe me one anyway, so make it a good one.
james_ford Then I want you to take these keys out of my pocket and let yourself out. The guard outside is Phil. He's a dimwit, so I reckon you can get his gun before he even realizes you're out. Just promise me you won't shoot him.
sayid_jarrah I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine right here.
james_ford They're gonna kill you. They just took a vote. Even the new mom wants you dead.
sayid_jarrah I'm going to stay here, James.
james_ford This morning, you were begging me to let you go. Why would you change your--
sayid_jarrah Because...when I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island...I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here.
james_ford To get shot? Then what? You're out of your mind.
james_ford Hey.
kate_austen Hi.
james_ford Why'd you come back?
kate_austen What?
james_ford Sayid just filled my ear full of some crap about his damn purpose, and I wanna know... Why'd y'all come back?
kate_austen Uh...
james_ford Why, Kate?
kate_austen I don't know why everyone else came back. I just know why I did.
james_ford What? What the hell?!
kate_austen Are you ok?
james_ford Craig! Grab a wrench, open those valves. Get the hoses going.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Okay.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Aah!
james_ford Erin, grab the fire gear! Bill, go help Craig.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell happened?
james_ford Three years--no burning buses. Y'all are back for one day... Get on that hose.
james_ford Man this hose!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Push it out!
james_ford All security! All security! This is LaFleur! We have a fire! Everyone get to building 15 now!
phil Roger that. I'm on my way.
sayid_jarrah What happened to your glasses?
young_benjamin_linus BEN My dad.
sayid_jarrah For bringing me the sandwich? I know. My father was a hard man as well.
young_benjamin_linus BEN I really hate it here. If I let you out...will you take me with you, to your people?
sayid_jarrah Yes, Ben, I will. That's why I'm here.
TANNOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode10 Attention, passengers. Ajira Airways flight 3-16 to Honolulu and Guam...
sayid_jarrah Are you sure we're going to Guam?
ilana_verdansky Where else would we be going?
sayid_jarrah Can I ask you a favor? Can we get the next plane?
ilana_verdansky Why?
sayid_jarrah I'm very superstitious when it comes to flying.
ilana_verdansky I'll buy you a rabbit's foot at the gift shop. This is the plane we're taking.
ilana_verdansky Sorry about the handcuffs, but at least we're in business.
ben_linus Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
hugo_reyes What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, hey, if you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
sayid_jarrah Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
ilana_verdansky What?
sayid_jarrah Are you working for him?
ilana_verdansky Who's Benjamin Linus?
sayid_jarrah He's a liar, a manipulator...a man who allowed his own daughter to be murdered to save himself... A monster responsible for nothing short of genocide.
ilana_verdansky Why would I work for somebody like that?
sayid_jarrah I did.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Whoa! Aah!
sayid_jarrah Hide!
sayid_jarrah Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Sayid. What are you doing here? How did you get out?
sayid_jarrah Sawyer let me go. They were going to kill me.
jinsoo_kwon What?
phil Attention. The prisoner escaped. The hostile is no longer in custody. Be on the lookout. He could be armed.
sayid_jarrah They don't know he released me. Please, Jin, I need to keep moving.
jinsoo_kwon Okay. Let me talk to him first. LaFleur, it's Jin here. Come in.
young_benjamin_linus BEN Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?
young_benjamin_linus BEN Come on. We better go. He called LaFleur.
sayid_jarrah You were right about me.
young_benjamin_linus BEN What?
sayid_jarrah I am a killer.
