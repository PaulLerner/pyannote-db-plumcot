michael_dawson John, John, I was hoping I could borrow one of these guns.
john_locke Is it supposed to be a secret?
michael_dawson Jack's asleep.
john_locke More target practice?
michael_dawson Well, you know, just want to stay sharp.
john_locke You got a date?
michael_dawson No. Old habits, you know.
john_locke Yes, I do.
michael_dawson Thanks, man. Hey, can I just get a couple of these bullets? I promise I won't...
michael_dawson Damn! I'm sorry...

michael_dawson I'm coming, Walt.
dr_jack_shephard Locke.
dr_jack_shephard John.
michael_dawson Stay in there. Stay.
dr_jack_shephard Michael, what are you...
michael_dawson Stay in there, Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, whatever's going on...
michael_dawson Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son and nobody is going to stop me, okay. Okay, that is my right. That is a father's right.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. What are you doing out here?
michael_dawson Nothing. Just getting some air.
dr_jack_shephard Come on. We should talk.
dr_jack_shephard How many?
james_ford Rifles and pistols? 11 total.
dr_jack_shephard That's it?
james_ford That's it. In case you forgot, they took 5 of 'em right off us.
dr_jack_shephard How long would it take us to get to their camp?
michael_dawson We leave now, move fast? Middle of the night tomorrow. Look, they have no idea I know where they are. They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go. Right now. Just the 5 of us.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, 5 is not enough. You said there's at least 20 of them. They've got our guns and we're not even sure if what you saw was...
michael_dawson Hey, I know what I saw! We take too many people, they'll hear us coming. I'm not taking a damn army across the Island, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Michael, you sure you're in the best place to be making decisions for all of us right now?
michael_dawson You got a son, Jack?
hugo_reyes They're dead! Ana Lucia and Libby are dead. I mean, we haven't even buried them yet.
dr_jack_shephard Me and you will take Libby, okay. Can you?
kate_austen Yeah, of course.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, would you?
james_ford Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard You should stay here. We'll bury them tonight, then we'll figure out what's next.
michael_dawson Hey, put your hands up. Put 'em up! Don't move.
danny_pickett Relax buddy. I ain't movin'. Why don't you just put that down...
michael_dawson Shut up!
danny_pickett You're Walt's old man, aren't you?
michael_dawson What?
tom_friendly What are you doing?! We need him.
tom_friendly Bag him quick. His friends are right behind us.
mr_eko Hello.
michael_dawson I didn't hear you come in, man.
mr_eko I left my shoes outside. They were muddy.
michael_dawson Did you find him? Henry?
mr_eko No.
michael_dawson I hear you're a priest.
mr_eko Yes.
michael_dawson I guess you believe in hell, then.
mr_eko For a brief time I served in a small parish in England. Every Sunday after Mass, I would see a young boy waiting in the back of the church. And then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said that the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek; and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand -- that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell -- that dog would be there waiting for him.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, are you alright?
michael_dawson Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard I was coming back to check on you.
michael_dawson Yeah, man. I had to get out of there. Just -- I have to get my son back.
dr_jack_shephard We're going to help you do that, Michael.
michael_dawson But, it's got to be the way I said, man. Just the 5 of us. Otherwise, it won't work. It won't work.
dr_jack_shephard I promise. We're going to figure that out.
michael_dawson No, I already have figured it out. It's got to be just the people who already know. You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley. That's it. Anybody else -- look, it puts him in more danger. You don't get to decide this. It's my son. It's my call. And that's the way it has to be.
dr_jack_shephard Then that's the way it'll be.
charlie_pace Hey. Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy. Hi. Have you seen Eko?
claire_littleton No.
charlie_pace You know, we're building a church.
claire_littleton Is there something you want, Charlie?
charlie_pace Yeah, I found something on the pallet I thought you might need.
claire_littleton Vaccine?
charlie_pace I don't know what we need a vaccine for, but I figured if anyone should have it, you and the baby should. It's alright. It's a pneumatic injector. You just put into your leg and it goes right in. Quite painless, really.
claire_littleton You seem to know a lot about it.
charlie_pace I tried it. I wanted to make sure it was safe before giving it to you and the baby.
claire_littleton Well, how do you feel? I mean, did it do anything? What did it, what did it do?
charlie_pace I feel fine. Anyway, it says you're supposed to give yourself a shot every 9 days. Alright? So, there's enough here for you and the baby for a while. That's it. I'll put it -- I'll put it... .
claire_littleton Thank you.
charlie_pace Welcome.
claire_littleton I should really feed him.
charlie_pace Yeah. Hey, Claire, did you think that maybe you and I could...
claire_littleton Oh my God! Michael's back.
sunhwa_kwon 여보, 여기도. ...Michael?
jinsoo_kwon 야! 너무 반갑다, 그 동안 얼마나 걱정했는데! 괜찮아? Okay?
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah. It's good to see you, too.
sunhwa_kwon Are you alright?
michael_dawson Yeah, I am. It's just -- I'm fine.
sunhwa_kwon 어머나! 어떻게 된 거야? Who?
michael_dawson Ana Lucia and Libby.
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 어떻게...?
sunhwa_kwon What happened to them?
michael_dawson They were murdered.
tom_friendly Hey there, Michael. Not going to hold that against you. Fair's fair. I took your boy. But don't do that again, okay.
michael_dawson Where is he you son-of-a-bitch?
danny_pickett Hey, look at what I found? She was following her friend about a half a click behind us.
tom_friendly You make one sound you'll never see your boy again. Gag him. Get ready with the torches. I'm going to talk to her people.
john_locke I think we'd better head back.
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard Just find the trail, John.
john_locke I've lost the trail.
dr_jack_shephard You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
john_locke Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running through the jungle, toward the sounds of gunfire, because I don't care about Michael.
dr_jack_shephard You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
tom_friendly You're exactly right, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Who are you?
james_ford He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft.
tom_friendly Why don't you point the gun down?
alex_rousseau It's okay. He's just delivering a message. He has to scare your friends to do it.
dr_jack_shephard I don't believe you.
tom_friendly You don't believe what?
dr_jack_shephard I think there's more of us than there are of you.
tom_friendly That's an interesting theory. Light 'em up!
tom_friendly Give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
dr_jack_shephard No.
tom_friendly I hoped it wouldn't come to this. Bring her out, Alex!
danny_pickett Go on.
alex_rousseau You.
danny_pickett Come on, Alex.
alex_rousseau Please?
danny_pickett Let's go. Up.
alex_rousseau Is Claire okay? Did she have the baby? Is it okay? Is it a boy or a girl?
tom_friendly Like I said -- curiosity.
james_ford You and me ain't done, Zeke.
tom_friendly His friends are going home. Divvy 'em up.
alex_rousseau Sorry.
james_ford What do you say, Doc? Here I was thinking the Irish drink when somebody dies.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not Irish.
james_ford Neither am I. So what happened out there in the jungle?
dr_jack_shephard Exactly what he said happened -- he found their camp...
james_ford I ain't talking about Mike. You and Freckles -- before you found him you all were gone all night.
dr_jack_shephard We were caught in a net.
james_ford What the hell is that supposed to mean?
dr_jack_shephard It means we got caught in a net.
james_ford Is that what they're calling it these days?
sayid_jarrah Is it true -- Henry's gone?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
sayid_jarrah Who's going after him?
dr_jack_shephard Locke and Eko went out in the middle of the night, but...
james_ford But we haven't seen either of them since.
sayid_jarrah Those are the guns, aren't they? What are you doing with them?
james_ford What do you think we're doing? It's time to finish this.
sayid_jarrah When do we leave?
james_ford In the morning.
dr_jack_shephard You're not coming, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Excuse me?
dr_jack_shephard Michael wants to keep it small. Me, Kate, Hurley, and him.
james_ford Yeah, well, him says even though Pippy Longstocking and the damn Grape Ape are ideal candidates for the Dirty Dozen -- I'm just going to say we might just want to bring the Red Beret.
dr_jack_shephard It's Michael's call. He knows where we're going.
sayid_jarrah It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.
james_ford Welcome aboard.
charlie_pace So, you wake up in the middle of the night; you grab your Jesus stick; you race off into the jungle. You don't call; you don't write?
mr_eko I'm sorry. I had work to do.
charlie_pace Right, yeah.
mr_eko Charlie, would you do me a favor? I was hoping you could bring my things from the beach here.
charlie_pace What for? You moving in here? Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?
mr_eko Yes. I'm moving in here.
charlie_pace Well, what about the church? You said we were supposed to be building it together, man.
mr_eko I am supposed to do something different now.
charlie_pace What am I supposed to do?
mr_eko Bring me my things.
charlie_pace Bring your own things.
mr_eko Charlie, please.
charlie_pace You better leg it, mate. Clock's ticking.
james_ford Got some good news for you. Captain Arab's in too. Cavalry rides at sunrise.
michael_dawson You told Sayid?
james_ford Yeah, I told Sayid.
michael_dawson You shouldn't have done that!
james_ford Oh, well I'm sorry. I just figure if we're going to war, we'd want the one guy who's actually been in a war. That a problem?
michael_dawson No, it's not a problem.
james_ford Alright then.
danny_pickett Get up.
michael_dawson Get off of me!
tom_friendly FRIENDLY You got a problem, Michael?
michael_dawson You march me day and night without any rest. Yeah, my problem is I'm tired.
tom_friendly FRIENDLY Well, I'd offer to knock you out and carry you, but we're here.
tom_friendly FRIENDLY Put him right over here. Tell her we're here.
danny_pickett I can't promise this won't hurt.
michael_dawson Ow, damn it!
danny_pickett Relax, just taking some blood.
michael_dawson Taking some blood for what? Who are you people? Where's my son?
danny_pickett That's it; all done. See you in the funny pages.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Hello, Michael.
michael_dawson Where's my son?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH My name is Ms. Klugh. I was hoping you might help me answer some questions. About Walt.
michael_dawson Where is he?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Is he your biological son?
michael_dawson What?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Are you his father?
michael_dawson Yes, I'm his...
beatrice_klugh KLUGH How old was he when he started speaking?
michael_dawson I, he...
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Did he have any illnesses growing up? Headaches? Fainting spells?
michael_dawson What? No! I don't -- I wasn't there. He was half way around the world. Why are you asking me all these questions?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Did Walt ever appear in a place he wasn't supposed to be? You say he was half way around the world -- did you see him?
michael_dawson I want my son! You bring him to me right now! I want to see my boy!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH For someone who wants his son back so badly, you don't seem to know much about him, Michael.
michael_dawson Hey, you're not coming.
sayid_jarrah Welcome back, Michael.
michael_dawson Look, I know Sawyer told you, alright. But, it's not going to work. You're not coming.
sayid_jarrah And why is it that I'm not coming?
michael_dawson Because you're going after the guy that escaped. And I'm going after my son.
sayid_jarrah Are you implying I'd let a desire for revenge compromise Walt's safety?
michael_dawson I'm implying that I decide who stays and who goes; and you stay. I know you want to help, right? But I've got to do this my way.
sayid_jarrah Of course. Good luck, Michael.
charlie_pace Bloody hell.
charlie_pace Are you kidding me? Did someone put you up to this?
dr_jack_shephard You were supposed to come right back. You were out in the jungle all night. What happened?
mr_eko We were unable to find Henry's trail.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I got that. Where's Locke?
mr_eko I do not know.
dr_jack_shephard We're burying Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.
mr_eko Thank you. I will mourn them in my own way.
james_ford Who's going to talk?
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford The funeral. Who's going to talk?
dr_jack_shephard I'm sure Hurley will want to say something about Libby.
james_ford I never even knew her last name. Ana Lucia.
dr_jack_shephard It's Cortez.
james_ford Cortez, there you go. I screwed her.
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford That's how she got my gun. Ana, she jumped me. We got caught in a net.
dr_jack_shephard Why are you telling me this, Sawyer?
james_ford Because you're about the closest thing I've got to a friend, Doc. And because she's gone. Well, at least now we get to kill to somebody.
michael_dawson Jack fill you in on the plan?
kate_austen What plan?
michael_dawson We're leaving first thing tomorrow -- back across the Island to their camp.
kate_austen Okay.
michael_dawson What about you, man? You coming with us?
hugo_reyes Why would I want to go?
michael_dawson Because they killed her!
kate_austen Michael, come on.
michael_dawson What do you say, Hugo?
hugo_reyes I'm sorry about Walt, dude. But I'm not coming.
michael_dawson You're sorry...!
kate_austen Michael.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Dinner time.
michael_dawson When are you going to do it?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH When am I going to do what?
michael_dawson Kill me. I've seen where you live. I know how to get here. You have been asking me asking me questions I don't know the answer to for a week. I don't even think my son is alive.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH He is alive, Michael. He's standing outside right now.
michael_dawson What, do you think I'm stupid?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH There's been a development since you came here, Michael. One of our people was captured by yours.
michael_dawson So, go get him back.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH We can't do that. But you can. And if you do, we'll let you and Walt go free.
michael_dawson I want to see my son.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Michael...
michael_dawson I want to see him! If he is out there you bring him in! You bring him in here right now!!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Pickett! You have 3 minutes.
michael_dawson Walt.
walt_lloyd Dad.
michael_dawson Let him go! Let him go! Get your hands off him, right now!
walt_lloyd Dad, don't.
michael_dawson Are you okay?
walt_lloyd Yeah.
michael_dawson I just -- did they hurt you?
walt_lloyd They make me take tests.
michael_dawson They make you what?!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH We're not going to talk about that.
walt_lloyd How's Vincent?
michael_dawson Vincent, he's great. He's great. He misses you. Hey don't, don't, don't be scared, man. Don't be scared. It's going to be over real soon, okay? I'm going to get you out of here, okay?
walt_lloyd They're not who they say they are. They're pretending.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Walt! You want me to put you in the room again?
michael_dawson Pretending? Pretending what?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH That's it. We're done.
michael_dawson No, wait. Hey wait, wait, wait. Come here, Walt. Wait, come here, Walt.
walt_lloyd Dad, don't leave me. Help me, please! Don't leave me!
michael_dawson I won't, man. I'm going to take -- I'm going to get you out of here. I promise you, I will get you out of here.
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad!
michael_dawson Let him go! Walt wait! Let go of him!
walt_lloyd I love you!
michael_dawson Walt, I'm going to get you out of here!
walt_lloyd I love you!
michael_dawson Walt, I love you too, Walt!
walt_lloyd Let me go! Let me go!
michael_dawson I'm going to get you out of here.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH After you release our man, I'm going to need you to do something else.
michael_dawson Whatever you want.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH I'm writing 4 names down -- 4 of your friends. We need you to bring them here. You have to bring only these 4 people, Michael. Just them. If you don't bring all the people on the list, you'll never see Walt again.
michael_dawson Okay, okay.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Do you understand, Michael?
michael_dawson Yes. What do I tell them.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Doesn't matter. Make up a story. They'll be angry enough to believe whatever you say.
michael_dawson Who's James Ford?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH You know him as Sawyer. You know the rest of them?
michael_dawson Yeah. I know them. If I do all this -- if I do what you say...
beatrice_klugh KLUGH You get your son back. You both go free.
michael_dawson Then I want the boat.
dr_jack_shephard When the plane crashed I was on my way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry to hear that.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. It seems like such a long time ago now. I was going to go right from the airport to the cemetery but I had no idea what I was going to say. Here we are again.
sayid_jarrah I think Michael has been compromised. Let's keep walking, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean "compromised"?
sayid_jarrah His actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth.
dr_jack_shephard Why would he lie to us?
sayid_jarrah Because I believe a father would do anything for his son. Because I believe Michael may have freed Henry. And because I believe he is leading you into a trap.
dr_jack_shephard You believe a lot, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah I also believe that Henry was one of them.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, let's go talk to him.
sayid_jarrah No, he must continue to believe he's in control.
dr_jack_shephard Why the hell would we want to do that?
sayid_jarrah So we can create an advantage.
dr_jack_shephard How?
sayid_jarrah I don't know yet. But we have one more night to figure that out.
dr_jack_shephard Ana Lucia Cortez was -- before we crashed she was a police officer. I don't think it was easy for her being here. But I think she did the best she could. She was a woman of few words, and I'm going to follow her example. Rest in peace, Ana.
hugo_reyes Libby was -- she was -- she -- Libby was a psychologist, or psychiatrist -- one of those. Either way, she probably helped a lot of people. She helped me. She was my friend. It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not. I'm going with you. Goodbye, Libby.
sunhwa_kwon Boat. Boat!
