sayid_jarrah What's that?
frank_lapidus Cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.
sayid_jarrah You don't know where your boat is?
frank_lapidus I know where it is.
sayid_jarrah Why are you flying directly into the thunderhead?
frank_lapidus Why don't you just sit back and let me do my job, huh?
sayid_jarrah Is that Penelope? She told Charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct?
desmond_hume Aye.
sayid_jarrah What do you expect to find when you get there?
desmond_hume Answers.
frank_lapidus Damn it!
frank_lapidus Hold on!
sergeant On your sodding feet, move, move, move!
sergeant What are you waiting for, Hume?
sergeant What's the matter, Hume? Did you not hear me?
desmond_hume I'm sorry, sir. I was...I was having a dream, sir.
sergeant You were having a dream, were you? And what were you dreaming about, that it took you so sodding long to get to your mark?
desmond_hume I was in a helicopter, sir. And there was a storm, sir. And I don't remember the rest, sir.
sergeant Well, at least it was a bloody military dream. Right! All of ya! In the yard, four minutes. And you can thank Private Hume for having to do it in double time. Move!
soldier 1 One, two, three!
REST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 Four!
soldier 1 One, two, three!
REST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 Five!
sergeant One hundred crunches! Go, go, go, go, go!
soldier 1 One, two three, four...
soldier 2 I hope your dream was worth this, mate.
desmond_hume Sorry brother. It's just that, I've never had a dream so vivid. It was like I was actually there.
sergeant Have you got something to say, Hume?
sergeant I asked you a question!
frank_lapidus We're almost through it. I see daylight!
sayid_jarrah What are you doing? Desmond! Are you alright?
desmond_hume Who are you? How do you know my name?!
dr_jack_shephard Alright. They took off a day ago. Why haven't we heard from them?
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm going to tell you again, as I've been telling you all night, doctor. I don't know! You heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat. What makes you think I know anything?
dr_juliet_burke Because you're not worried.
dr_charlotte_lewis Excuse me?
dr_juliet_burke Your boat's 40 miles off the coast, it should have taken them what, 20 minutes to get there? So why aren't you worried?
dr_charlotte_lewis Should I wring my hands together and whisper a prayer on their behalf?
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, hey, hey, c'mon. Maybe we should just, just tell them.
dr_jack_shephard Tell us what?
dr_charlotte_lewis Dan, let's not confuse anyone.
dr_juliet_burke Well, Daniel, maybe if you talk real slow, we'll be able to follow.
dr_daniel_faraday Your perception of how long your friends have been gone, it's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone.
dr_jack_shephard What does that mean?
dr_charlotte_lewis This is a mistake.
dr_daniel_faraday It'll be fine, it'll be fine. As long as Frank flew on the bearings I gave him. If he stayed on it, it'll be fine.
dr_jack_shephard And what if he didn't?
dr_daniel_faraday Then there might be side-effects.
sayid_jarrah We're at two thousand feet, sit down!
desmond_hume What am I doing here?!
frank_lapidus What the hell's going on?!
sayid_jarrah Something's wrong with Desmond!
desmond_hume How do you know my name?!
frank_lapidus Hold him there, Sayid!
sayid_jarrah I'm trying!
desmond_hume Let go of me!
frank_lapidus Keep him away from the stick! We'll be there in two minutes!
martin_keamy What are you doing back?
omar_idris Who are they?!
frank_lapidus Survivors of 815.
martin_keamy You shouldn't have brought them here, what the hell were you thinking?!
desmond_hume Alright, where am I?
martin_keamy Alright, just take it easy.
omar_idris Whoa.
desmond_hume Alright, who are you people?
omar_idris Whoa, buddy. Calm down.
desmond_hume What am I doing here? who are you people?
sayid_jarrah My friend is disoriented!
desmond_hume I'm not your friend! I don't know you! I don't know you!
martin_keamy When did he start doing this?
frank_lapidus He was fine when we took off. When we hit some weather... Hey, Faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector --
martin_keamy What's your name, my friend?
sayid_jarrah Sayid.
martin_keamy Okay, Sayid. Look, we're going to take your buddy down to the sick bay, okay.
sayid_jarrah I'm going with you.
martin_keamy Let a doctor look at him first, then you can come down. You got my word on that, okay?
omar_idris Alright.
desmond_hume Listen, listen. This is a mistake, alright?
omar_idris Settle down.
desmond_hume I don't know these people.
omar_idris I understand.
desmond_hume No, this is wrong! I'm not supposed to be—
desmond_hume —here!
soldier 1 Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-three...
sergeant Here? Here what? What the hell are you doing on your feet? Are you finished with your crunches, because you want to run?! Right! Squad, on your feet! Right face! Ten kilometers, go, go, go, go, go!
billy Keep moving, or so help me, I'll kill you myself!
billy What the hell's the matter with you, Des?
desmond_hume If I told you, you'd think I was crazy.
billy I already know you're crazy.
desmond_hume This morning, when I was in the yard doing crunches, I left.
billy What do you mean you left?
desmond_hume I was on a boat. And then I was back here...right where I started.
billy Des, if you're trying to get tossed out of service-
desmond_hume Billy, I'm telling you the truth, man.
billy Who else was on this...boat? Anyone you recognized?
desmond_hume Penny. There was a photo. Penny was in the photo.
billy What? Oi, Des...where you going?
soldier 3 Thanks for this morning, Hume.
martin_keamy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch your step. Watch your step. Take it easy.
desmond_hume I'm not here. This...this isn't happening.
martin_keamy You are here. And, this is happening. Look, we're going to take care of you.
desmond_hume Wh-wh-what am I doing here?
martin_keamy It's alright, you're gonna be okay.
desmond_hume Who are you people?
martin_keamy Well, my name is Keamy, and this is Omar. I'm from Vegas and he's from Florida, but as for where we are, I—
omar_idris The last port was Fiji. So at least we know we're still in the Pacific.
martin_keamy Alright, my friend. Now you just relax, okay? Now, we're gonna go get the doc, and he's gonna want to ask you some questions to help us sort all this out.
desmond_hume What do you mean, sort out? Wait a minute! What do you mean?
desmond_hume I'm not supposed to be here!
desmond_hume I'm not supposed to be here! Open this door! Open this door!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 Hey. Hey! Hey.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 It's happening to you too, isn't it?
sayid_jarrah What's happening to Desmond? Your friends know what's wrong with him.
frank_lapidus Well if they do, they're not sharing it with me.
sayid_jarrah Then perhaps you'll share how we took off at dusk and landed in the middle of the day.
frank_lapidus Listen. I don't know what's happening to your buddy, alright? But you gotta trust me when I tell you this. I am trying to help you.
sayid_jarrah You want to help me? Give me your phone. Let me call my people.
frank_lapidus You give me that weapon and I'll give you this phone.
frank_lapidus Be quick. And don't go trying to call Baghdad, those phones can only call each other.
dr_jack_shephard Hello?
sayid_jarrah Jack, it's Sayid. I'm on the freighter.
dr_jack_shephard Are you okay? Where the hell have you been?
sayid_jarrah Something happened during the flight, and now Desmond's in their sick bay.
dr_jack_shephard Hold on, hold on, hold on. Alright, you're on speaker.
sayid_jarrah On the helicopter, something happened to Desmond. He doesn't appear to recognize me or know where he is.
dr_jack_shephard Side-effects?
dr_daniel_faraday Wait, your friend, Desmond? Has he recently been exposed to high levels of radiation or electromagnetism?
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, look. Uh, we don't know why, but going to and coming from the Island, some people can get a little...confused.
dr_juliet_burke So, what, is this amnesia?
dr_daniel_faraday No, this is not amnesia.
desmond_hume Hey. Hey. Hey! Can you hear me? Are you alright? Hello?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 I was just on a ferris wheel.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 See, Ray? I'm not crazy. It's happening to him too, Ray. And it's going to happen to you. It's going to happen to all of us. Everyone! Once we start heading to that Island again.
ray Would you please step aside?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 No, Ray, Ray, no.
ray I need you to relax for a minute.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 No! It's not going to stop it, Ray, nothing can stop it, Ray, nothing can stop it!
ray And how are you feeling?
desmond_hume What the bloody hell is going on?!
ray I understand, you're disoriented.
desmond_hume You're not going to stick me with that, brother!
ray I don't want to stick you with anything. It's okay, I just want to check your eyes.
desmond_hume Why?
ray So I can help you.
ray What's your name?
desmond_hume Desmond.
ray Desmond. Desmond, why don't you tell me about the last thing you remem—
penelope_widmore Hello?
desmond_hume Penny?
penelope_widmore What do you want, Desmond?
desmond_hume Uh, Penny, listen. I'm in trouble, and I think something's happening to me, and I'm confused, and I need to see you.
penelope_widmore You broke up with me and then you joined the army. And now you call with the expectation that I still care about you? Yeah, I say you are confused, Desmond.
desmond_hume No, no, I'm not. It's... look, I've got two days leave starting tonight. Can I...can I come and see you?
penelope_widmore No. No, and don't you go showing up at the flat, either, 'cause I've moved.
desmond_hume Moved? Where?
penelope_widmore That doesn't matter. Look, Desmond, I'm going to go. Please, just don't call me again.
desmond_hume Look, look, now listen, Penny, Penny, I need—
desmond_hume —need you.
ray Did you just experience something, Desmond?
ray What the hell, Frank? You're not supposed to be down here, and definitely not with him.
frank_lapidus Sorry, doc, but I've got Faraday calling from the Island, and he needs to talk to this—
ray No, Faraday's not talking to my patient, now get out of here.
sayid_jarrah He's not your patient.
ray Hey!
sayid_jarrah Give Desmond the phone.
sayid_jarrah Give him the phone now!
desmond_hume Hello?
dr_daniel_faraday Desmond! Desmond, my name is Daniel Faraday. We met yesterday before you took off? But I'm guessing you don't remember that. Am I right?
desmond_hume Took off? What?
dr_daniel_faraday Desmond, we don't have long to talk, so I need you to tell me what year you think it is.
desmond_hume What do you mean, what year do I think it — it's 1996!
dr_daniel_faraday Alright, Desmond, Desmond look, you gotta tell me... where are you?
desmond_hume Um...um...I'm in some kind of sick bay...
dr_daniel_faraday No, no, no, no. Not right now, Desmond. Where are you supposed to be. Where are you in 1996?
desmond_hume Uh, Camp Millar, it's a... Royal Scots Regiment, it's just north of Glasgow.
dr_jack_shephard Dan. You might wanna—
dr_daniel_faraday No, no, no. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Desmond, listen. When it happens again, Desmond, I need you to get on a train. Get on a train and go to Oxford. Oxford University. Queens College Physics Department. Alright?
desmond_hume What, why?
dr_daniel_faraday Because I need you to find me.
dr_daniel_faraday Where is it? Where is it?
dr_charlotte_lewis What?
dr_daniel_faraday My journal. I need my journal, I won't believe him.
dr_jack_shephard Why does he think he's in 1996?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know, I don't know. It's unpredictable, it's a random effect. Sometimes it takes place for only a couple of hours, sometimes it's years.
dr_jack_shephard Wait, wait. This has happened before?
dr_daniel_faraday The phone now, please. Thank you. Desmond, you still there?
sayid_jarrah Talk to him! I can't hold them for long.
desmond_hume Yes! What've you got?
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, Desmond, listen. When you find me at Queens College, I need you to tell me to set the device to 2.342.
desmond_hume What?
dr_daniel_faraday Alright, you got it? 2.342! And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz. You got it Desmond?
desmond_hume 2.342 and oscillating at eleven...
dr_daniel_faraday Just remember that. 2.342 and eleven hertz, alright? And one more thing, Desmond. If the numbers don't convince me, I need you to tell me that you know about Eloise.
omar_idris Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy...
dr_daniel_faraday Desmond! Tell me that you know about Eloise!
dr_daniel_faraday ...not a single piece of original thinking. You do understand the concept of original, the opposite of derivative? Now I'm the one you need to impress, Mr. Hollister, and I'm not impressed. So go. Go try again.
desmond_hume Um, sorry. Are you Daniel Faraday?
dr_daniel_faraday And you are...?
desmond_hume Um...sorry, I'm Desmond Hume, and um...I was told I could find you here. I think I've ... just been to the future.
dr_daniel_faraday ...the future?
desmond_hume Yes. Uh, I spoke to you there, you told me to come here, to Oxford, to find you. You said you'd help me.
dr_daniel_faraday Why didn't I just help you there, in the future?
desmond_hume Sorry?
dr_daniel_faraday Why would I put you through the headache of time travel, you know? You know what I mean, it just seems a little... unnecessary. And don't you think that my esteemed colleagues could have come up with something just a little more believable, huh? Wha—what kind of a prank is that? Huh, paradox. So uninspired.
desmond_hume Set your device to um... 2.342 and make sure it oscillates at 11.
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, now you, you're going to tell me who told you those numbers.
desmond_hume You did.
dr_daniel_faraday No, this is — this is ridiculous.
desmond_hume I know about Eloise.
desmond_hume What, what is all this?
dr_daniel_faraday This is where I do the things Oxford frowns upon. Alright, this, this future version of me... uh, he referenced this meeting, right? Obviously, so, so I would remember you coming to Oxford, right? I would remember this, here, right now.
desmond_hume Actually, um, no.
dr_daniel_faraday No.
desmond_hume Maybe you just forgot.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, right, how would that happen?
desmond_hume So this, this is changing the future?
dr_daniel_faraday You can't change the future.
desmond_hume What's that for?
dr_daniel_faraday Radiation.
desmond_hume Do I get one?
dr_daniel_faraday You don't need one. For prolonged exposure, I do this 20 times a day.
desmond_hume So what do you put on your head?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah.
dr_daniel_faraday And this... this is Eloise.
desmond_hume What does this do?
dr_daniel_faraday This, if the numbers you gave me are correct, what this will do is unstick Eloise in time. Just like you.
desmond_hume What happened?
dr_daniel_faraday Wait, shhshhshh! She's not back yet...there she is. Okay, here goes everything.
dr_daniel_faraday Come on, come on, that's it, come on, that's it, yes, yes, yes, haha! Yes! Oh, it worked! This is incredible.
desmond_hume I'm sorry, how is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?
dr_daniel_faraday What is incredible, is I just finished the maze this morning. I'm not going to teach her to run it until an hour from now.
desmond_hume S-so you, you sent her to the future!
dr_daniel_faraday No, no, no. Her consciousness. Her mind.
desmond_hume So, so how does that help me?
dr_daniel_faraday You, what? I don't understand, am I supposed to help you? Didn't I send you back here to help me?
desmond_hume I don't know why you sent me here. All I know about you is, you, you end up on some bloody island.
dr_daniel_faraday An island. What island, where...why would I go to an island?
martin_keamy Desmond, give me the phone.
frank_lapidus Hey look! Hey, come on! Everybody relax, listen! Look! Daniel wanted to talk to the guy so we brought him the phone, that's all.
martin_keamy You let Faraday talk to him?
frank_lapidus He said he could help!
ray Faraday can't even help himself!
omar_idris Outside now. The captain wants to talk to you.
sayid_jarrah And I want to talk to your captain.
martin_keamy I'll be sure to let him know. In the meantime, have a seat.
desmond_hume I need to get back.
sayid_jarrah Back where? The island?
desmond_hume He said he could help me, said he could tell me what I needed to do.
sayid_jarrah Desmond, Desmond, can you please explain to me—
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 Desmond? You're Desmond?
desmond_hume Do I know you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 I'm George Minkowski. I'm the communications officer. Before they strapped me down here, all the calls to and from this boat came through me, in the radio room. And every so often, I'd get this flashing light on my console. An incoming call. We were under strict orders never to answer it.
desmond_hume So? What's that got to do with me?
george_minkowski Those calls came from your girlfriend. Penelope Widmore.
desmond_hume What happened?
dr_daniel_faraday Whoa, you're back, and you were out almost 75 minutes.
desmond_hume Out?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just whoof, went catatonic right in the middle of a sentence. I had to carry you to the chair. So I take it you were, you were in the future again?
desmond_hume Aye.
dr_daniel_faraday For how long?
desmond_hume I don't know...five minutes? Why does this keep happening?
dr_daniel_faraday In your case, I'm guessing that progression is exponential. Each time your consciousness jumps, it gets harder and harder to jump back. I would be careful crossing the street if I were you.
desmond_hume What happened to her?
dr_daniel_faraday She died.
desmond_hume Yeah, I can see that. How?
dr_daniel_faraday Brain aneurysm, probably. I dunno. I'll need to do an autopsy later.
desmond_hume Is that going to happen to me?
dr_daniel_faraday The effects seem to vary from case to case, but uh—
desmond_hume If these keeps happening, am I gonna die?!
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know. I think Eloise's brain short-circuited. The jumps between the present and the future...she eventually, she couldn't tell which was which — she had no anchor.
desmond_hume Wh...what do you mean, anchor?
dr_daniel_faraday Something familiar in both times. All this, see, this is all variables, it's random, it's chaotic. Every equation needs stability, something known. It's called a constant. Desmond, you have no constant. When you go to the future, nothing there is familiar. So if you want to stop this, then you need to find something there...something that you really, really care about...that also exists back here, in 1996.
desmond_hume This constant — can it be a person?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, maybe. But you have to make some kind of contact. Didn't you say you were off on a boat, in the middle of nowhere?
dr_daniel_faraday Uh...who're you calling?
desmond_hume I'm calling my bloody constant.
OPERATOR#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode05 The number you have dialed has been disconnected.
sayid_jarrah Hey, hey. You okay?
george_minkowski You look a lot older now, huh? Welcome back, Desmond.
desmond_hume I need to call Penny.
sayid_jarrah Calling your girlfriend is not our priority.
desmond_hume Listen, brother, I don't know you. But you seem to know me, so...so if you and me are friends, then I need your help. I need to call Penny, now.
george_minkowski Whoa! You boys are getting way ahead of yourselfs. Two days ago, someone sabotaged all the equipment. We lost all communication with the mainland. I probably could have fixed it, but then.. .then I went nuts.
sayid_jarrah Where's the radio room?
george_minkowski It's one deck up. I'll take you there. Come on.
sayid_jarrah And how do we get out of here?
george_minkowski Through the door.
george_minkowski Looks like you guys have a, a friend on this boat.
desmond_hume Hey, uh...your nose, brother.
sayid_jarrah It's clear. Let's g—
auctioneer The Black Rock set sail from Portsmouth England on March 22, 1845 on a trading mission to the kingdom of Siam, when she was tragically lost at sea. The only known artifact of this journey is the journal of the ship's first mate, which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates on the Ile Sante-Marie off the coast of Madagascar seven years later. The contents of this journal have never been made public, or known to anyone outside the family of the seller, Tovard Hanso. We open the bidding on lot 2342 at 150,000 pounds. 150,000, sir. For 160? Do I hear one six- 160, sir. 170, sir. 180 on the phone. 200,000 pounds. 220,000 pounds, 240? 260,000 pounds, sir. 280? On the phone I have 300,000...320. 340,000 pounds. 360? 380...
suited_guard GUARD This auction's reservation only, sir.
desmond_hume Listen, brother, I just need to speak to that gentleman, just for a moment, okay?
suited_guard GUARD I'm sorry.
auctioneer Sold, for 380,000 pounds to bidder 755. Thank you.
desmond_hume Just for a minute, alright? Mr. Widmore!
charles_widmore Desmond?
desmond_hume Can I have a word, sir?
suited_guard GUARD I'm sorry, Mr. Widmore, he—
charles_widmore No, no. It's fine. Walk with me.
charles_widmore Your word. Let's have it.
desmond_hume I need to get in touch with Penny. I don't know how to reach her, and her number's been disconnected.
charles_widmore There was a time when if you'd have asked her to marry you, I'm certain she would've said yes. Unfortunately, your cowardice won out instead. I take it you've had second thoughts, and you'd like her to give you another chance.
desmond_hume Why do you hate me so much?
charles_widmore It's not me who hates you. Here's her address... I'll let her tell you herself.
george_minkowski Desmond. I know... it's getting harder. It starts happening faster too.
sayid_jarrah Come on, let's move.
desmond_hume Hey, how did this happen to you?
george_minkowski We were anchored here. Waiting for our orders. Bored out of our minds. Me and Brandon — he's one of the crew members we took off the ship's tender. We just wanted to see the island. But Brandon started acting crazy...so we had to turn around.
desmond_hume Where is he?
george_minkowski In a body bag.
george_minkowski There.
sayid_jarrah Who did this?
george_minkowski You got me. But when the captain finds out, I feel sorr—
sayid_jarrah After your call, someone has to tell me precisely what is going on.
desmond_hume Can you fix it, brother?
sayid_jarrah I need a minute. Do you have the number to make the call?
desmond_hume Wake up, wake up, you've got to come back! You've got to come back—
sayid_jarrah Desmond! Do you know the number?
desmond_hume No.
sayid_jarrah Well, you better remember it.
desmond_hume It's 2004...
sayid_jarrah I didn't realize it was almost Christmas. It's been...
sayid_jarrah ...Desmond.
george_minkowski I...can't....get....back!
sayid_jarrah What happened to him?
desmond_hume The same thing that's gonna happen to me.
penelope_widmore Desmond? What are you doing here?
desmond_hume I had to... I mean, I tried to call you, but you disconnected your phone.
penelope_widmore Yeah, because I moved. Look, I don't know if you're getting the signals, Desmond, but I'm trying to make a clean break from you, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna—
desmond_hume Wait a minute, Pen, please wait. I just need to get your new phone number, okay?
penelope_widmore Why would I give you that?
desmond_hume Because I made a huge mistake, I never should have broken up with you, and, and and... and I know that now, and I'm sorry, and—
penelope_widmore Don't, just don't dare—
desmond_hume —and I understand. And I know it's... it's too late to change things, but I need to tell you something and, and I need you to listen to me, and I know it's going to sound ridiculous, but... please, Pen. I need you to listen to me.
penelope_widmore Just, say what you need to say and then go.
desmond_hume I know this doesn't make any sense, because it doesn't make any sense to me. But... eight years from now... I, I need to call you, and I, I can't call you if I don't have your number.
penelope_widmore What?
desmond_hume Look, Penny, just, just give me your number, and, and I, I know I've ruined things, and I know you think things are over between us, but they're not. If there's any part of you that still believes in us, just give me your number.
penelope_widmore And what's to say you won't call me tonight, or tomorrow.
desmond_hume I won't call for eight years. December 24, 2004. Christmas Eve. I promise. Please, Pen.
penelope_widmore If I give you the number, will you leave?
desmond_hume Aye.
penelope_widmore 7946-0893.
penelope_widmore All that, and you're not going to write it down?
desmond_hume It wouldn't do any good. You have to keep that number. You can't change the—
penelope_widmore Just get out, get out!
desmond_hume —just, just remember, December the 24th, 2004. If you still care about me you'll have to—
desmond_hume I'm not crazy, Penny! You have to believe me! You have to—
desmond_hume —trust me.
sayid_jarrah I do trust you. But you still have to remember that number.
desmond_hume 7946-0893. It's a London number.
sayid_jarrah Excellent timing...the patch is done, but I don't know how long the battery will last. I hope she's there.
desmond_hume I hope so too.
penelope_widmore Hello?
desmond_hume Penny?
penelope_widmore Desmond?
desmond_hume Penny...Penny, you answered. You answered, Penny.
penelope_widmore Des, where are you?
desmond_hume I'm... I'm, I'm on a boat. Um... I've been on an island, and— Oh my god, Penny. Is that really you?
