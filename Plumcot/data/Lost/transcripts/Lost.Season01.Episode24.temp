CHARLIE Claire, everybody's leaving.
CLAIRE Okay, well, I can't go anywhere, alright? I've got the baby, and I'm so tired, I can't carry him -- now he's wet, there's sand everywhere, I don't have anymore nappies.
CHARLIE Why don't you let me help.
CLAIRE No, nobody ever taught me how to do this, okay?
CHARLIE Claire, it's going to be okay.
CLAIRE Oh, why do people keep telling me that? Are they the ones with the baby?
SAYID We've got to get there before sundown. Once you reach the caves, stay there. The rest of us will be right behind you.
CHARLIE Sayid. I need a gun. Look, I know Jack gave them to you. I want one right now. I have to protect Claire.
SAYID Rousseau said the Others wouldn't be here until nightfall.
CHARLIE Rousseau is certifiable. What if they show up before then and-
SAYID The last time you handled a sidearm-
CHARLIE I killed a murderer. I did us all a favor.
SAYID Charlie, you're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons.
CHARLIE But you're not here all the time. You can't protect Claire. Look, I need a gun!
SAYID If you really want to help Claire, get her packed, carry her child to the caves. That's what she needs.
HURLEY How exactly does something like this happen?
DANIELLE Are you on the same Island as I am?
HURLEY I guess that explains it.
ARZT Hold on, wait, hold on. Hold, wait. What are we a couple miles inland? A tsunami probably swept it here, huh, right?
JACK Hey, hey, where are you going?
DANIELLE Explosives are in the hold of the ship.
JACK Rousseau, wait.
DANIELLE I did what you asked. You need dynamite, you don't need me. 
LOCKE Let her go, Jack.
JACK Who's going to lead us back?
LOCKE I'll lead us back.
JACK Damn it. You heard her -- the explosives are in the hold. Let's go.
ARZT Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite, not explore some ghost ship, you think I'm go-
JACK Alright, just stay out here.
HURLEY Uh, I'm going to stay out here and hang with Arnzt.
LOCKE Slaves. This ship must have been in route to a mining colony -- probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa -- Mozambique.
KATE Jack, John, over here.
ARZT And then my 3rd wife, she says, get this, she says, "I didn't sign up for this." Now you tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean? What, am -- am I boring you?
HURLEY Huh?
ARZT You know what? I'm -- I'm sorry, I'm so... I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough to be part of your merry little band of adventurers.
HURLEY What?
ARZT I know a clique when I see it. I teach high school, pal-y. You know, you people think you're the only ones on this Island doing anything of value. I've got news for you. There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash. And we are all people, too.
HURLEY O-kay.
KATE You know what? We could probably get it open if I just-
JACK No, no, no, we should take it outside.
KATE Why? We don't even know if it's...
JACK You're not prying open a crate that says explosives on the side with a pick axe, Kate.
LOCKE Yeah, I agree with Jack -- take it outside, open it there.
KATE Okay.
JACK I got it. You mind showing us the way?
ARZT And it's not just the teenagers, either. You know, the gym teachers -- you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria? No. They do not.
HURLEY Dude, this is all in your head.
ARZT Really? Then you explain to me why Kate gets the best pieces of wreckage to build her shelter? And the Korean guy? Does he catch fish for everybody on the Island? No, he does not. He doesn't. And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here. Now, would mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs because I can't figure...
ARZT What the hell are you people doing?! Wait, wait, stop, stop, right where you are. Alright, I want you to put that down carefully. Put it down carefully. Put it gently, gently. Damn it, carefully, gently, gently. Alright, now get out of there. Come away from there. C'mon, get out. Move away from it.
JACK What the hell are you doing?
ARZT Shhh. Be quiet. Do any of you have any idea what happens to dynamite in 90+ degree heat, huh? So you know? Any of you? It sweats nitroglycerin. Whoa, hey, what you doing? Did I ask you to come closer? Dynamite is nitroglycerin stabilized by clay. Nitroglycerin is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man. Hey, Kate give me your shirt. Now, princess, give me your shirt. I need to wrap the dynamite. Just throw it to me, right here. Be careful, c'mon, hurry up. Okay, good, now back up, back up, back up. Just back up. Get out of my way. Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin? Probably not -- because he blew his freaking face off. His lab assistant came into the room, saw that his mentor detonated, and he said, "Huh, I guess this stuff does work." Alright, we're not going to take any more of this stuff than we need because nitroglycerin is extremely temperamental, so we-
HURLEY Dude.
SUN 반으로 자를까요?  여기요.  어머 어떡해 미안해 미안, 뜨겁죠? 
JIN 괜찮아, 괜찮아. 됐어. 화장실이 어디 있어? 
SUN 저쪽... 저쪽에 있네요. 
AIRPORT COP Sorry for the inconvenience.
SAYID I'm sure you are.
AIRPORT COP Sir, your bag was unattended.
SAYID Am I free to go?
AIRPORT COP Yes, sir.
SAYID Good, I have a plane to catch.
HAWAIIAN SHIRT Hey, could you hand me a paper towel there, bud? A paper towel -- this one's broken.
HAWAIIAN SHIRT Oh, oh, you don't speak English. Sorry.
HAWAIIAN SHIRT 아, 페이퍼 타올이 여기 있네. 
JIN 뭐라고요? 
HAWAIIAN SHIRT 자네의 장인이신 백 회장님 밑에서 일하고 있지. 
JIN 여태까지 날 미행한거야? 
HAWAIIAN SHIRT 물론. 그리고 자네가 도망가려는 것도 알고 있지. 자네는 남은 시계를 캘리포니아에 있는 백 회장님 친구에게 전하라고. 만약 그렇게 못하면 자네는 그녀를 잃게 되겠지. 넌 자유의 몸의 아니야. 여태까지 그래왔고 앞으로도 계속. 
WALT Dad, look!
MICHAEL How does a place this big never get discovered?
SAWYER Don't know, but you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there.
MICHAEL Yeah, you build your resort. I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever.
WALT What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay?
MICHAEL I hope so, buddy. At least until we can get them some help.
SAWYER Redemption song is all I'll ever have...
MICHAEL You singing Bob Marley?
SAWYER No. Why, you like Bob Marley?
MICHAEL Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?
SHANNON Damn it!
SAYID Do you really need all that?
SHANNON Yeah, I do.
SAYID Why do you have to bring so much?
SHANNON Don't you have a hike to lead?
SHANNON I'm fine.
SAYID These belong to your brother.
SHANNON I need these things. I can't just leave them. What are we doing? Hiding? As if they won't find us. It's just -- it's too much. It's too much.
SAYID It won't be too much if I carry it for you. Now come on, I have a hike to lead.
KATE You okay?
HURLEY That was messed up.
KATE Yeah.
HURLEY He just...exploded in front of us. He was just trying to help. This is because I came.
KATE What?
HURLEY I'm kind of bad luck.
KATE Hey, it was an accident.
HURLEY An accident, yeah.
JACK Locke, we should think about this.
LOCKE Alright.
JACK Maybe this isn't the best way.
LOCKE It's the only way, Jack.
JACK How many do we need to blow the Hatch?
LOCKE Two should take care of the hinge, three to be safe.
JACK Safe?
LOCKE I'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it. You ever play "Operation"?
JACK Sure. Don't touch the sides.
LOCKE I -- I always got nailed on the funny bone. Bzzzt!
JACK You like to play games, John?
LOCKE Absolutely.
CHARLIE Okay, I know we're in a rush to escape to the caves, so I solved the turniphead transport issue. This is just a blanket from the plane. And then there's a piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo. Here you go. It's a Bjorn.
CLAIRE A bjorn?
CHARLIE Bjorn -- it's Dutch for baby carrier.
CLAIRE Yeah, thanks.
CHARLIE That's okay.
CLAIRE Thank you.
CHARLIE Oh, that's okay.
CLAIRE Thanks. I'll just put him in there.
CHARLIE It's really...
DANIELLE Sayid! Where is he?
CHARLIE Rousseau! What?
DANIELLE Sayid? Where is he?
CHARLIE He already left.
DANIELLE I need him now.
CHARLIE Jack and Kate...
DANIELLE There's no time. Where is Sayid?
CHARLIE Alright, just calm down, okay. I'll get him for you. Stay here, alright.
CLAIRE Okay.
CHARLIE Sayid! Sayid!
CLAIRE What happened out there?
DANIELLE What is his name? The child. What is his name?
CLAIRE Oh, I haven't named him yet.
DANIELLE May I hold him?
CLAIRE Why do you need Sayid?
DANIELLE You don't want me to hold him.
CLAIRE No, I just fed him. I don't think it's a good idea, okay?
DANIELLE Please.
CLAIRE Why did I do that? Why did I scratch you?
LILY What's going on?
CHARLIE My flight, my flight to LA leaves in a couple of hours -- so I've got to get moving, you know. 
LILY You want to do one more bump for the road?
CHARLIE It's all gone. We did it all last night. I have some champagne.
LILY You've got to have some left.
CHARLIE Mm-mm. No. It's done. I'll look you up next time I'm in Sydney, okay? I'll send you an autographed copy of my CD and then you can listen to it whenever you want.
LILY I don't want your piece of crap CD from your piece of crap band.
CHARLIE Last night in the bar you said you were a fan.
LILY Fine. I'm a huge fan. Drivethru is the best damned band ever. Now just give me a bump because I know you've got some.
CHARLIE Shaft. Drive Shaft. 
LILY What's that in your hand?
CHARLIE Nothing.
LILY Holding out on me?
CHARLIE Holding out on you? No, I'm not holding out...
LILY Give it to me.
CHARLIE Give you what? I'm not holding anything.
LILY Give it to me.
CHARLIE I've got nothing in my hand!
LILY Give it to me!
LILY Get up.
CHARLIE Get off.
LILY Get up. Let it go. Let it go.
CHARLIE What are you, crazy?
LILY Let it go.
CHARLIE Get off!
LILY Let it go!
CHARLIE Get off me.
LILY You're pathetic. You're pathetic.
CHARLIE Sayid! Sayid, Rousseau's on the beach. She needs you.
SAYID Rousseau? What for?
CHARLIE I don't know.
SUN Help! Someone! Help!
CHARLIE My god!
SAYID What happened?
SUN Her head.
CLAIRE Where -- where is my baby?
CHARLIE Oh, my god.
CLAIRE Is he alright?
SAYID Rousseau, was she alone?
CLAIRE Did she take my baby? Did she take my baby?!
SAYID Claire, which way did she go?
CLAIRE I don't know! She took my baby!
CHARLIE This is your fault! You brought her into the camp! If you had just given me a gun!
SAYID Do not hit me again. You want to waste time assigning blame? There's plenty to go around. She has a head start. If we leave now we can catch her.
CHARLIE How are we going to do that?!
SAYID Because I know where she's going.
CLAIRE I want my baby!
JACK We can carry all the sticks in my pack. The more insulation we stuff in the better.
LOCKE I think we should split them up.
JACK What?
LOCKE It's not smart to keep it all together. So, we split them up. If we need 3 sticks to blow the hinge then we should bring 6 -- 3 and 3 -- failsafe, in case one of us...
JACK You and me, then.
KATE No, I'm -- I'm taking one.
JACK It's not going to happen, no.
KATE This is why I came.
JACK Then, you wasted a trip.
KATE I need to do this.
JACK Kate, no one owes anyone anything.
KATE I'm carrying one.
JACK We're done here.
KATE This is not your decision.
JACK Kate, yes it is.
LOCKE We'll draw straws. They're coming. We don't have time to argue about who gets to risk their life, so -- we'll let fate decide.
KATE Works for me.
JACK What about you? You want to carry some dynamite, too? What?
HURLEY You got some... Arnzt on you.
LOCKE Short sticks carry the packs. Looks like it's me and you, Kate.
WALT So, what's this stuff even do?
MICHAEL Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening. And if there's anything out there, we'll see it on this radar screen here.
MICHAEL Here we go. C'mon, someone find us.
WALT Those are the messages everybody wrote.
SAWYER Sure are.
WALT They're private.
SAWYER Yep. I, for one, never knew how much Tracy missed her hubby and 2 kids back in Fresno. Yet she's sleeping next to good old Scott to keep her warm at night.
WALT That's Steve. Scott's dead.
SAWYER Whatever. It's alright, Kazoo, we've got to keep ourselves entertained. Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a 160 million dollars to leave to his mom.
WALT How would you like it if I read yours?
SAWYER You can't read mine because I didn't write one.
WALT Why not?
SAWYER Because the only one I ever wrote is to the man I'm going to kill.
WALT Why you going to kill him?
SAWYER Because I need to.
WALT Why?
SAWYER Because!
CHARLIE Are you bloody joking?! Why would she go for the black smoke?! Isn't that where the Others are supposed to be?!
SAYID The Others are precisely why she would go there. Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago. They took something from her, and now she believes she has something that they want.
CHARLIE She's making a trade?
SAYID I believe she is, yes.
CHARLIE That's insane. She's insane.
SAYID Don't try to apply reason to her actions. She's a mother who lost her child, just like Claire. This isn't about revenge. Don't make it personal.
CLAIRE I'm coming with you.
SAYID That's not a good idea, Claire.
CLAIRE This is my baby, okay?! I let her take him!
CHARLIE Hey, hey.
CLAIRE Don't tell me what to do, okay!
CHARLIE Calm down!
CLAIRE I am going to come with you! This is my fault and I'm coming and you can't stop me!
CHARLIE It's alright, Claire.
CLAIRE Get him back, Charlie. Get Aaron back.
CHARLIE Aaron?
CLAIRE Please, get him back.
CHARLIE Claire, I will get him back. Promise.
MICHAEL Hey, you want something to eat? I guess that's a no, then. If you're worried about Vincent, he going to be okay, man. Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time. -- Alright, I've got to call work, right over there. Don't go anywhere, okay?
MICHAEL No, I live in a studio apartment. I've got to be out the door in the morning for work by 5am. Who's going to watch him? How's he going to get to school? What's he going to do after school? I can't do this, ma. -- You know, I was -- listen, I was thinking -- I was thinking maybe you could take him. -- Look, ma, if it's a question of money, I... What am I supposed to do with him?! He's not supposed to be mine! He was never part of the plan. Yeah, I -- thanks a lot. Hey, man, I was, uh...
WALT I need new batteries.
MICHAEL Hey, want to try?
WALT What?
MICHAEL C'mon, come here. You drive for a while.
WALT Really?
MICHAEL Absolutely. Okay now, look, the most important part of this boat is the rudder. It's how you steer. You turn it gradually -- nothing sharp, okay. Push it this way.
WALT Where are we going?
MICHAEL Look, so, we're going approximately North by Northeast. So, hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane, or we hit some land.
WALT What do I aim for?
MICHAEL See that cloud on the horizon, right there?
WALT Yeah.
MICHAEL You aim for that.
WALT Yep.
MICHAEL Okay.
WALT Got it. -- How come you and my mom didn't stay together?
MICHAEL We tried. It just didn't work out, so -- our lives, our interests -- we just went in different directions.
WALT How come I never saw you?
MICHAEL Because your Mom didn't want me to. She did what she thought was best for you.
WALT She was wrong.
JIN Rudder!
MICHAEL Hey, we hit a log! We lost the rudder.
JIN Rudder! Rudder!
MICHAEL We're losing it! It's sinking!
MICHAEL Stop the boat. Stop the boat. Just pull the sail down. Right.
WALT Dad!
MICHAEL Sawyer! Sawyer! Give me the rope.
JIN Rope!
MICHAEL Sawyer!
SAWYER It's sinking!
SAWYER I can't reach it!
JIN 다시 던져봐.
MICHAEL Got it?
JIN 먼저 묶고!
MICHAEL Tie it around the rudder, we'll pull you in!
MICHAEL C'mon, buddy. You just saved our asses, buddy.
MICHAEL Here's your shirt. You should put that back on before you burn.
KATE Sorry.
JACK Yeah, well, luck of the draw.
LOCKE The sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take. If we want to get back to the Hatch we're going to have to hustle.
JACK Okay, this is how we do this. I'll lead -- Kate, you're right behind me, then Hurley. John, you bring up the rear. If you start to see me heading the wrong way-
LOCKE We should stagger our formation -- keep a safe distance from each other.
JACK Alright, we stagger. If anyone hears anything or sees anything...
HURLEY Like the security system that eats people?
JACK Yeah, like that. You two, you take your packs off, you put them down and you run. You got it?
KATE Got it.
LOCKE Yes, sir.
JACK Okay, let's do this.
SUN He died bravely.
SHANNON What?
SUN Your brother.
SHANNON Yeah. Thanks.
SUN Do you think all this -- all we've been through -- do you think we're being punished?
SHANNON Punished for what?
SUN Things we did before -- the secrets we kept, the lies we told.
SHANNON Who do you think is punishing us?
SUN Fate.
CLAIRE No one's punishing us. There's no such thing as fate.
SAYID Are you okay?
CHARLIE I'm fine, keep going.
SAYID We're losing the light. Try to keep up.
CHARLIE I'm coming. Sayid! Sayid! -- Sayid!
SAYID Over here.
CHARLIE Sayid?!
SAYID You can barely breathe. We're going to rest.
CHARLIE Rest? She's out there right now...
SAYID In another mile you're going to collapse. We're going to take a break.
CHARLIE Is this where Boone fell?
SAYID The plane was up there.
CHARLIE Where did it come from?
SAYID Based on the maps inside -- Nigeria.
CHARLIE Anyone on board?
SAYID Two men dressed as priests.
CHARLIE Priests?
SAYID Drug runners in disguise. The plane was loaded with heroin. Alright, now we go.
HURLEY So, dude? What do you think is inside of that hatch thing?
LOCKE What do you think is inside it?
HURLEY Stacks of TV dinners from the 50's, or something. And TVs with cable, some cell phones, clean socks, soap, Twinkies -- you know, for dessert, after the TV dinners. Twinkies keep for, like, 8000 years, man.
LOCKE I like Twinkies, too.
HURLEY C'mon, really, what do you think is inside?
LOCKE Hope. I think hope's inside.
HURLEY Whoever named this place Dark Territory? Genius.
KATE Yeah, I saw it. We've got to get out of here.
JACK Locke! What are you doing?
JACK Locke!
JACK Locke!
KATE Jack! Jack!
KATE Oh, my god.
JACK I need the dynamite. No, no, it's in my pack. Just go get it! Hurry, go! John, John.
LOCKE Let me go. Just let me go. I'll be alright. 
JACK No!
LOCKE Let me go. I'll be alright.
KATE Hang on. I've got it.
JACK Careful unwrapping it.
KATE Alright.
JACK Now throw it in.
LOCKE No!
KATE It'll blow us up.
JACK Just hurry, I can't hold him!
LOCKE Don't do this, Kate!
JACK Throw it in -- now, Kate!
MICHAEL Hey, your wife -- wife made this for you?
JIN Sun.
MICHAEL She sounded it out, huh -- so you could learn English?
JIN Yes.
MICHAEL Yeah, I wish she had made one for me. So what words are in here? English words -- what can you say?
JIN Ah, starboard, aft, port, sail, eat.
MICHAEL Yeah, right. She did you well. I hope you know how lucky you are, man. Back in business? Alrighty. Oh, hey, it's yours.
JIN You.
MICHAEL What?
JIN You.
MICHAEL Um, thank -- you. Thanks.
SUN I made you some tea.
CLAIRE I'm fine. Thanks.
SUN Aaron is a beautiful name. What does it mean?
CLAIRE I don't know what Aaron means.
SUN They will bring him back.
CLAIRE Don't say that.
SUN They will.
CLAIRE How do you know that?
SUN Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back.
CHARLIE There!
SAYID Charlie, wait.
SAYID Charlie! See, let me see. 
CHARLIE It's bleeding.
SAYID We need to put pressure on it.
CHARLIE Okay. Ow.
SAYID There.
CHARLIE Ow. Animal, what is she...
SAYID Keep the pressure on, like this.
CHARLIE Ow! Ow! Ow!
SAYID She's been here for 16 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. It's too deep. It's bleeding too much. You're going to have to go back.
CHARLIE No, I'm not going back! You're going to have to fix it.
SAYID I'm not a doctor.
CHARLIE You're a soldier! What do people do when you get wounded?! I'm not going back without that baby, Sayid.
SAYID Don't move. 
CHARLIE Gunpowder?
SAYID Remove the towel and tilt your head back. Remove the towel.
CHARLIE This is because I hit you, isn't it?
SAYID This is not going to be pleasant. You ready?
CHARLIE Yeah.
SAYID 1-2-3.
HURLEY Oh, man.
HURLEY I need my car. 20 minutes? Look, I can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday is tomorrow.
CHARLIE Some of us have a bloody flight to make!
HURLEY Excuse me, coming through. Excuse me.
HURLEY No, no, no!
HURLEY Excuse me, coming through, excuse me, excuse me. Look out, excuse me.
HURLEY Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. Or, today -- I don't know. I don't really get the whole time change thing, but I've got to make that flight.
TICKET AGENT I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You're confirmed for seat 20G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.
HURLEY What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.
TICKET AGENT Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?
HURLEY Fine, whatever. I'll buy the one next to it.
TICKET AGENT Alrighty. Here are two together.
HURLEY Book it.
TICKET AGENT Uh-oh.
HURLEY Uh-oh, what uh-oh?
TICKET AGENT It appears that your flight is already boarding in the Oceanic international terminal. Well, this is the domestic terminal. I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.
HURLEY Excuse me, sorry. Sorry, this is an emergency. I've got to cut through. Excuse me, dude. Dude?
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
HURLEY You've got to let me in. No, you don't understand...
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
HURLEY This is...
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
SECURITY AGENT Next.
ARZT Now? You're taking the computer out now?
HURLEY Hey, old guy! I'll give you 500 bucks to borrow your scooter.
OLD SCOOTER MAN I just had a hip replacement. I need this thing.
HURLEY Okay, 1600 bucks.
HURLEY Hey, hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! I've got to get on this flight!
GATE AGENT Sir, the jetway's closed.
HURLEY Please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane.
GATE AGENT Alright, one second. Hunter, this is Jenna, we've got one more... ta. This is your lucky day.
HURLEY 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16... 
KATE You say something?
HURLEY Nope.
KATE I thought I heard 23.
HURLEY Does that mean something to you?
KATE What?
HURLEY That number? 23?
KATE The guy who called the Feds on me, back in Australia, did it for a 23,000 dollar reward. Mean something to you?
HURLEY Nah, it's just a number. We better catch up -- can barely see them.
LOCKE We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.
JACK If we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there, John?
LOCKE What was what about?
JACK You asked me to let you go.
LOCKE That's right.
JACK That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go.
LOCKE It wasn't going to hurt me.
JACK No, John, it was going to kill you.
LOCKE I seriously doubt that.
JACK Look, I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John. I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
LOCKE I believe that I was being tested.
JACK Tested?
LOCKE Yeah, tested. I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
JACK Yeah, and what does that make you?
LOCKE Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
JACK Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
LOCKE The Island. The Island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the Island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
JACK Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
LOCKE Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
JACK And where does that path end, John?
LOCKE The path ends at the Hatch. The Hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch.
JACK No, no, we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive.
LOCKE Survival is all relative, Jack.
JACK I don't believe in destiny.
LOCKE Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
MICHAEL I turned it on a little while ago.
SAWYER Sayid said every hour.
MICHAEL Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks. If that battery runs out...
SAWYER The man said every hour.
SAWYER Nothing.
MICHAEL 5 minutes, no more.
SAWYER Aye, aye. You know what I like about you, Mike? You've got the patience of a saint.
MICHAEL Yeah? Why do you say that?
SAWYER I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago.
MICHAEL You would, huh?
SAWYER A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.
MICHAEL Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?
SAWYER My daddy never got a chance to beat me. He shot himself when I was 8.
MICHAEL Is that why you want to die, man?
SAWYER What?
MICHAEL Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out. Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else? The way I see it, there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die.
SAWYER Well, I ain't no hero, Mike.
SAWYER Is that what I think it is?
MICHAEL Something's out there.
GATE AGENT I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers -- well, no one seems to know where it is right now. And unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.
LOCKE There's not another flight until tomorrow.
GATE AGENT Yes, I'm aware of that, sir, but there's nothing I can...
JD Look, I can get Michelle, we can carry him on. Would you mind if we carry you on?
LOCKE No, that'll be fine.
MICHELLE Here we go. Here's your seat.
JD I'll get your bag, sir.
MICHELLE If you need anything just press the call button.
LOCKE Okay. Thank you.
LOCKE Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.
HURLEY Me? Oh, okay. Got it.
JACK Be careful.
HURLEY Can I have the flashlight? Because, uh, the torch with the dynamite thing, not making a whole lot of sense to me.
LOCKE Kate, you run the fuse, Jack and I will rig the charges.
KATE Okay.
CHARLIE What the hell is that?
SAYID There's no footprints, no tracks.
CHARLIE This is it? This is the black smoke? Where are they?
SAYID I don't know.
CHARLIE She's here.
SAYID Danielle!
CHARLIE You come out, right now!
SAYID Calm down.
SAYID Danielle! I can hear you, come out. Please, he needs his mother.
DANIELLE They were not here.
SAYID Danielle, you have to give us the baby.
DANIELLE I just wanted my Alex back. I thought if I gave them the baby...
SAYID It's okay. I know. It's okay.
CHARLIE I've got him. There never were any Others. You started the fires yourself!
DANIELLE No, I heard them whispering.
CHARLIE You're a nut job. You heard nothing!
DANIELLE I heard them say they were coming for the child. The Others said they were coming for the boy.
CHARLIE You're pathetic.
LOCKE Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse.
JACK I'll do it.
KATE This is as far as it goes.
LOCKE It's far enough. I'll light it. You take cover, there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.
JACK Hurley!
HURLEY Wait just a sec.
KATE So, what was that about back there?
JACK What was what about?
KATE Putting the dynamite in your pack.
JACK I made a judgment call.
KATE We drew straws.
JACK Sorry, I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us, Kate.
KATE You had no right to make that choice...
JACK Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me, Kate? That's your call. There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this, if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem. And I have to know that you've got my back.
KATE I've got your back.
LOCKE Are we ready?
HURLEY Wait a sec, wait a sec.
HURLEY No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop, we can't do this! Stop! Wait! Stop we can't do this! Stop! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! We can't do this! We can't do this! Stop! Wait! You've got to stop it!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad! Stop! What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad! The Numbers are bad!
JACK Hurley! Hurley stop!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad!
JACK Hurley! Hurley, you've got to get back!
SAWYER It's closer. It's closer. Give me the damn flare gun.
MICHAEL Hold on a sec.
SAWYER I'm telling you, it's closer. I'm telling you, look.
MICHAEL I know, okay. I've got one flare.
JIN 아무 것도 안 보여.
MICHAEL Okay, I know. You don't see anything. Okay.
SAWYER What the hell are you expecting to see?! In case you haven't noticed, it's dark!
WALT What is it? Is it a ship?
MICHAEL We don't know, little man. We don't know.
JIN Starboard? Port?
MICHAEL Uh, Port. Port.
JIN 반대로 가는데?
MICHAEL Okay, what the hell am I supposed to do about it?
SAWYER Hey, Han, you and Chewie want to slow down a second and talk to me here?! We have to fire the flare.
MICHAEL We don't know what it is. It could be anything -- a piece of floating junk. We don't even know if Sayid's radar works!!
SAWYER Have you ever known that guy to fix something up that don't work?
WALT It's moving away.
SAWYER Floating junk that knows how to steer, huh?
MICHAEL We're moving! It doesn't make-
SAWYER Look, are you going to give me the damn gun, or am I going to have to take it?!
MICHAEL What are you going to do? Shoot me?
WALT It's almost gone. -- C'mon.
MICHAEL Please, god.
WALT It's coming back! It's coming back!
MICHAEL Are we glad to see you!
BEARDED MAN What's going on?! What are you folks doing this far out here?!
MICHAEL We were, we were -- the plane crashed! We were on the Island for a month, man!
BEARDED MAN Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that?
MICHAEL We were on an Island -- oh, flight 815 -- hey, where are we?!
BEARDED MAN Well, it's a good thing we found you.
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah, we survived and there's a whole group of people on the...
BEARDED MAN Well, ain't that something?
MICHAEL Yeah!
BEARDED MAN Only, the thing is, we're going to have to take the boy.
MICHAEL What? What'd you say?
BEARDED MAN The boy, we're going to have to take him.
MICHAEL Hey, what the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
BEARDED MAN Just give us the boy.
MICHAEL I'm not giving you anybody.
BEARDED MAN Well, alright then.
