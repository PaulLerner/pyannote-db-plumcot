charlie_pace Anything?
dr_jack_shephard You keep asking if there's anything.
charlie_pace Pardon me for appearing desperate, but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit, he did say that no-one's going to find us unless we … get that transceiver working. So... is there anything?
dr_jack_shephard No.
charlie_pace Okay.
kate_austen What were you doing? In the bathroom?
charlie_pace I thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one tangible contribution to the trek.
kate_austen No. I'm glad you came. Charlie.
charlie_pace Every trek needs a coward.
kate_austen You're not a coward.
cindy_chandler You all right, sir?
charlie_pace I'm good. Thanks.
cindy_chandler Can I get you a water, or…
charlie_pace I'm fine. Thank you. Please?
cindy_chandler All right.
charlie_pace Excuse me.
rose_nadler Guess he really had to go.
cindy_chandler Sir, excuse me! Sir, excuse me!
shannon_rutherford Excuse me?
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Sir, are you all right?
charlie_pace Just a minute. Just a minute.
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Open the door now, sir. Sir!
boone_carlyle Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them. I see you found your bag. Come on, you want to give us a hand?
shannon_rutherford Not really. You're wasting your time. They're coming.
claire_littleton Is that your boyfriend?
shannon_rutherford My brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
claire_littleton I used to have a stomach.
shannon_rutherford You know what it is?
claire_littleton Not yet. I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
michael_dawson Uh, excuse me. Hey, uh … have you, uh ... have you seen my boy?
sunhwa_kwon 죄송해요. 저 영어 못 해요. 아 … 저, 제가 영어를 못 해요.
jinsoo_kwon 윗 단추가 열렸네. 채워라. 빨리!
michael_dawson I'm sorry. Walt! Walt?
walt_lloyd Vincent! Vincent! Come here, boy!
michael_dawson Hey! What did I tell you? After everything that's happened!
walt_lloyd I thought that maybe Vincent would be around!
michael_dawson I told you to stay on the beach!
walt_lloyd This is so close to the beach, I thought this would be okay…
michael_dawson Don't do that. You listen to me. I mean what I say. You understand?
michael_dawson What is this?
walt_lloyd I just found it.
michael_dawson Come here.
michael_dawson Hey guys. Come on, man. Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. Break it up. Break it up! Come on! That's it! It's over! That's it!
james_ford Son of a bitch!
sayid_jarrah I'm sick of this redneck!
james_ford You want some more of me, boy?
sayid_jarrah Tell everyone what you told me! Tell them that I crashed the plane! Go on! Tell them I made the plane crash!
james_ford The shoe fits, buddy!
dr_jack_shephard What is going on?
sayid_jarrah Ibn Al-Kalb!
dr_jack_shephard What's going on?
michael_dawson Look, my kid found these in the jungle.
james_ford And this guy was sitting in the back row of business class, the whole flight, never got up. Hands folded underneath the blanket.
sayid_jarrah Oh.
james_ford And for some reason - just pointin' this out - the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it.
sayid_jarrah Thank you so much for observing my behavior.
james_ford You don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
james_ford Come on, bring it!
kate_austen Stop!
kate_austen We found the transceiver, but it's not working. Can anybody help?
sayid_jarrah Yes. I might be able to.
james_ford Oh great. Perfect! Let's trust this guy!
hugo_reyes Hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect.
james_ford Shut up, Lardo.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Give it a break.
james_ford Whatever you say, doc. You're the hero.
boone_carlyle You guys found the cockpit? Any survivors?
dr_jack_shephard No.
sayid_jarrah It's dual band, military spec. Chances are, the battery is good, but - the radio is dead.
kate_austen Can you fix it?
sayid_jarrah I need some time.
rose_nadler Doctor, the... man with the shrapnel, I... I think you should take a look at him.
hugo_reyes Tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
sayid_jarrah Some people have problems.
hugo_reyes Tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
sayid_jarrah You're okay, too.
hugo_reyes Hurley. Uh, just…
sayid_jarrah Sayid.
hugo_reyes How do you know to do all that?
sayid_jarrah I was a military communications officer.
hugo_reyes Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
sayid_jarrah I fought in the Gulf War.
hugo_reyes No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - Air Force... Army?
sayid_jarrah The Republican Guard.
sunhwa_kwon 실례합니다. 준비 다 됐나 봐요. 당신을 찾아요.
kate_austen Is it working?
sayid_jarrah Seems to be. Except we're not picking up a signal.
kate_austen Why do we need to pick up a signal? Aren't we trying to send one?
sayid_jarrah Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars. The bars would show the radio is getting reception.
kate_austen We need the bars.
sayid_jarrah We could broadcast blind... Hope that someone—maybe a ship somewhere—picks up our distress call. But that could be a waste of the battery, which might not last that long. There is one thing we could try...
kate_austen What?
sayid_jarrah Seeing if we can get a signal from high ground.
kate_austen How high?
kate_austen How is he? Can you do anything?
dr_jack_shephard Pull out the shrapnel.
kate_austen But you said yesterday that if you took it out...
dr_jack_shephard I know. But that was yesterday. I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now. If I leave him like this, he'll be dead within a day. If I open him up... if I can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if I can find some antibiotics... he might be all right.
kate_austen I'm going on a hike.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry?
kate_austen Sayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it. Not from here.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, wait a minute.
kate_austen You're the one who said that we had to send out a signal.
dr_jack_shephard Look, you saw what that thing did to the pilot.
kate_austen Yeah, I did. What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
dr_jack_shephard Wait for me. I don't know how long this will be...
kate_austen Sayid said the batteries won't last.
dr_jack_shephard All right. If you see, or hear, anything... Anything. Run.
hugo_reyes What's that? What, that? What, eat that? Dude. Dude. I'm... starving... But, I'm nowhere near that hungry. No. No. No, thank you! No way, no.
michael_dawson The comic's in Spanish. You... read Spanish?
walt_lloyd No. I found it.
michael_dawson Tell you what We get home... I get you another dog.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! I need your help.
hugo_reyes Okay.
dr_jack_shephard I need you to help me go through the luggage. I need any kind of prescription medications you can find. Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin. Those are antibiotics.
hugo_reyes What's this for?
boone_carlyle What are you doing?
shannon_rutherford I think I was mean to him.
boone_carlyle What?
shannon_rutherford Isn't that the guy from the gate? He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class. He saved our lives.
boone_carlyle Come on, Shannon, we're trying to clear some of the wreckage. You should help out. You're just being worthless over here.
shannon_rutherford I'm being what?
boone_carlyle What do you want me to say? You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
shannon_rutherford I've just been through a trauma here, okay?
boone_carlyle We've all been through a trauma. The only difference is, since the crash, you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
shannon_rutherford You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it. I get it.
boone_carlyle I wish I didn't have to waste my time making fun of you. I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.
shannon_rutherford Screw you, you do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.
boone_carlyle I have a much better idea than you think I do.
shannon_rutherford No, you don't!
boone_carlyle Okay, Shannon. Then what are you thinking?
shannon_rutherford I'm going with them. On the hike.
boone_carlyle Yeah?
shannon_rutherford Yup. I'm going.
boone_carlyle No, you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
shannon_rutherford I'd like to come with you.
boone_carlyle She's not going. She doesn't want to go.
shannon_rutherford The hell I'm not.
boone_carlyle It's what she does. She postures.
shannon_rutherford You don't know what the hell I do!
boone_carlyle Makes really bad decisions to upset her family, which, at the moment, is me.
shannon_rutherford Shut up, and stop trying to be charming. I'm coming with you.
kate_austen I don't... know if that's such a good idea.
shannon_rutherford What are you? Two years older than me? Please. You're going, aren't you?
charlie_pace Yeah, are you?
shannon_rutherford Yup.
charlie_pace Yeah, I'm definitely going.
kate_austen Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
charlie_pace You couldn't tell from that, but she's actually really nice.
kate_austen You decided to join us.
james_ford I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
michael_dawson What you're looking for?
dr_jack_shephard Some sort of blade. How's your son?
michael_dawson Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.
dr_jack_shephard How old is he?
michael_dawson Nine... Ten—Ten. Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. The dog was on the plane, so... Kids, you know.
dr_jack_shephard Is it a Lab?
michael_dawson Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? I saw him yesterday, in the jungle.
michael_dawson What? Where?
dr_jack_shephard Over there. Couple hundred yards in or so. He looked good.
walt_lloyd What is it, like checkers?
john_locke Not really, it's a better game than... checkers. You play checkers with your Pop?
walt_lloyd No. I live in Australia with my mom.
john_locke You have no accent.
walt_lloyd Yeah, I know. We move a lot. She got sick. She died a couple of weeks ago.
john_locke You're having a bad month.
walt_lloyd I guess.
john_locke Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Archeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of ancient Mesopotamia. Five thousand years old. That's older than Jesus Christ.
walt_lloyd Did they have dice and stuff?
john_locke Mhhm. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
walt_lloyd Cool.
john_locke Two players. Two sides. One is light... one is dark. Walt, do you want to know a secret?
claire_littleton No. Tha- thank you. No, it's okay. No, really. Okay. Thanks.
claire_littleton Oh, gosh. I just felt it. I ju … Come here, feel this. Please. . Please. Please. Do you feel that? There! Right there, that's a kick! There! There, right there's a foot! Oh no, he's, wait, he's moving around. "He". "He". I guess I think you're a "he".
james_ford Okay! Wide open space! You should check the radio, see if we're good.
sayid_jarrah We're not going to have any reception here.
james_ford Just try it.
sayid_jarrah I don't want to waste the batteries.
james_ford I'm not asking you to keep it on all day.
sayid_jarrah We're still blocked by the mountain.
james_ford Just check the damn radio!
sayid_jarrah If I just check.. we might not have any juice left when we get to...
shannon_rutherford My god.
boone_carlyle What the hell's that?
kate_austen Something's coming.
charlie_pace It's coming towards us, I think.
kate_austen Come on, let's move.
shannon_rutherford I shouldn't have come. Aah!
sayid_jarrah Go! Go!
kate_austen Sawyer!
sayid_jarrah Let him go!
shannon_rutherford That's... that's a big bear.
boone_carlyle You think that's what killed the pilot?
charlie_pace No. No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
kate_austen Guys, this isn't just a... bear. That's a polar bear.
hugo_reyes You sure he's out?
dr_jack_shephard He's out.
hugo_reyes How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
dr_jack_shephard I don't.
hugo_reyes Hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay! Yeah, he's out. So—what do you want me...
dr_jack_shephard Look, it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness. But the pain might bring him around. And if it does, I need you to hold him down.
hugo_reyes Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
dr_jack_shephard Then don't look.
hugo_reyes Yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
dr_jack_shephard Just do the best you can. Okay? Don't look.
hugo_reyes Okay .
hugo_reyes Dude.
dr_jack_shephard Hand me those strips.
hugo_reyes Dude.
dr_jack_shephard Just hand me the strips, I need to get this bleeding stopped.
hugo_reyes I don't think I can.
dr_jack_shephard Oh.
hugo_reyes "Oh" what? What, what's going on, something in there?
dr_jack_shephard The strips. Just hand me the strips. Give it to me. Don't even think about it, Hurley. Don't even think a... Hurley! Hey! Damn it!
boone_carlyle That can't be a polar bear.
sayid_jarrah and KATE It's a polar bear.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, but... Polar bears don't usually live in the jungle.
charlie_pace Spot on.
sayid_jarrah No, polar bears don't live near this far south.
boone_carlyle This one does.
james_ford Did. It did.
kate_austen Where did that come from?
james_ford Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
kate_austen Not the bear. The gun.
james_ford I got if off one of the bodies.
sayid_jarrah One of the bodies.
james_ford Yeah, one of the bodies.
shannon_rutherford People don't carry guns on planes.
james_ford They do if they're a US Marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
kate_austen How do you know that?
james_ford I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. I thought it might come in handy. Guess what? I just shot a bear!
kate_austen So why do you think he's a Marshal?
james_ford Because he had a clip-on badge. I took that too. Thought it was cool.
sayid_jarrah I know who you are. You're the prisoner.
james_ford I'm the what?
sayid_jarrah You found a gun on a US Marshal. Yes, I believe you did. You knew where it was, because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun.
james_ford Piss off.
sayid_jarrah That's who you are, you son of a bitch.
james_ford Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.
sayid_jarrah But you are the prisoner.
james_ford Fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist. We can all play a part. Who do you want to be?
kate_austen Does anybody know how to use a gun?
charlie_pace I think you just pull the trigger.
sayid_jarrah Don't use the gun.
kate_austen I want to take it apart.
charlie_pace Oh.
sayid_jarrah There's a button on the grip. Push that, it will eject the magazine. There's still a round in the chamber. Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
james_ford I know your type.
kate_austen I'm not so sure.
james_ford Yeah. I've been with girls like you.
kate_austen No girl's exactly like me.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Can I get you a refill?
kate_austen No, I'm... I'm fine with this, thank you.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 You, sir? Can I get you anything? Cocktail? Soda?
marshal_edward_mars Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Coffee. Sure.
marshal_edward_mars You look worried. I'd be worried too, I was you. But you've got to stay positive, kiddo. You know, there's always that off chance that they'll believe your story. I know I sure do.
kate_austen I don't care what you believe.
marshal_edward_mars Oh, I know. That's true. That has always been true. You sure you don't want some more juice?
kate_austen Yeah, I'm sure.
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
kate_austen I have one favor to ask.
marshal_edward_mars Really? This ought to be good. What...
[The#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 turbulence causes the big drop with a woman hitting the ceiling. A big black/silver case hits the Marshal on the head. He passes out. The masks come down and Kate can't reach because of the handcuffs. She gets the key from the Marshal's pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. She puts her mask on and then puts a mask on the Marshal. The back of the plane rips off.
sayid_jarrah We should keep moving.
dr_jack_shephard No. No.
marshal_edward_mars Where is she?
dr_jack_shephard Who?
james_ford Oh! Now's a good time to check the radio! Not before.. but now!
sayid_jarrah We're up higher.
james_ford Yes, we are!
sayid_jarrah Bar. Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday!
kate_austen What is that?
sayid_jarrah Feedback.
kate_austen Feedback from what? What would do that?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
james_ford I'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio. This thing doesn't even work.
sayid_jarrah No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken. We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
charlie_pace Transmitting from where?
shannon_rutherford What?
sayid_jarrah Somewhere close. The signal's strong.
charlie_pace Somewhere close? You mean on the Island? That's great!
boone_carlyle Maybe it's other survivors.
shannon_rutherford From our plane? How would they even—
james_ford What kind of transmission is it?
sayid_jarrah Could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal...
kate_austen Can we listen to it?
sayid_jarrah Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
james_ford There's no transmission.
kate_austen Shut up.
charlie_pace The rescue party. It has to be. . It's French! The French are coming! I've never been so happy to hear the French!
kate_austen I never took French. What does she say?
sayid_jarrah D-Does anybody speak French?
boone_carlyle She does.
shannon_rutherford No, I don't. What?
boone_carlyle What the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in Paris!
shannon_rutherford Drinking, not studying!
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Iteration 7294531.
charlie_pace Okay. What's that?
sayid_jarrah Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
kate_austen "No, no, no" what?
shannon_rutherford What "no"?
sayid_jarrah The-the batteries are dying!
kate_austen How much time do we have?
sayid_jarrah Not much.
boone_carlyle I've heard you speak French! Just listen to this! Listen to it!
shannon_rutherford I can't!
james_ford You speak French or not? Because that would be nice.
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Iteration 17294532.
charlie_pace That voice is weird. What is that?
boone_carlyle Come on. Come on, Shannon!
kate_austen Come on!
sayid_jarrah Come on!
shannon_rutherford It's... it's repeating.
sayid_jarrah She's right.
boone_carlyle What?
sayid_jarrah It's a loop. "Iteration"—it's repeating the same message. It's a counter. The next number will end... "533".
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Iteration 17294533.
james_ford Does anyone know what the hell he's talking about?
sayid_jarrah It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... how long... .
james_ford Don't forget to carry the one, chief.
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Iteration 17294534.
shannon_rutherford She's saying .. "Please". She's saying, "Please help me. Please, come get me."
james_ford Or she's not! You don't even speak French!
kate_austen Let her listen!
boone_carlyle Shut up, man!
charlie_pace Guys, the battery. The battery.
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode02 Iteration 17294535.
shannon_rutherford I'm alone now. Uhm... On the Island alone. Please, someone come. The others, they're... they're dead. I-it killed them. I-it killed them all.
boone_carlyle That was good.
sayid_jarrah Sixteen years.
james_ford What?
sayid_jarrah Sixteen years. And five months. That's the count.
boone_carlyle What the hell are you talking about?
sayid_jarrah The iterations. It's a distress call. A plea for help. A mayday. If the count is right... It's been playing over... and over... for sixteen years.
boone_carlyle Someone else? Was stranded here?
kate_austen Maybe they came for them.
james_ford If someone came, why is it still playing?
charlie_pace Guys. Where are we?
