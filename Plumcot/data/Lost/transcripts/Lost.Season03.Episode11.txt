james_ford Ping-pong table? Where the hell did that come from?
dr_juliet_burke Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood. We made legs for it, paddles, now all we need is a ball.
james_ford Found it?
dr_juliet_burke It must've landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.
james_ford I thought the hatch collapsed.
dr_juliet_burke Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple. After that I don't ask questions. Just make myself a salad and move on.
james_ford Yeah, I can see that's working for you. Hey! You seen Kate around?
dr_juliet_burke Wow. She's not back yet? Hmm. You guys find anything we could use as a ball?
BACKGROUND#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode11 VOICE No.
james_ford Hey, that's my Guns and Ammo. Where the hell you get it?
paulo It was in the magazine stack. We share things now.
james_ford Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff. Stuff you all decided to have yourselves a little party with while you thought I was dead.
paulo Listen, hillbilly, if you want it that bad, take it.
james_ford Just keep it.
sayid_jarrah We need to eat.
john_locke Are we still on course?
sayid_jarrah We're still heading north on a bearing of 3 0 5. Yes.
john_locke I'm sensing a lack of confidence.
sayid_jarrah We've been walking for two days, following a compass bearing provided by the carvings on a stick!
john_locke And?
sayid_jarrah You really think we're just going to chance upon where The Others are?
john_locke I don't know what we're going to chance upon, Sayid, but my bearing is the only bearing we got.
sayid_jarrah I'm going to find some fruit, and then, John, we'll have a rational conversation regarding our next move.
james_ford You all looking for something like this?
dr_juliet_burke Cool, the ball.
james_ford Uh-uh. We need to do a quick prid quo first. I know I've been gone a while, and you thought the General Store was having a "going-out-of-business" sale. But now I'm back. And I want what’s mine.
nikki_fernandez Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.
james_ford A, it was mine to begin with when I took it. B, who the hell are you? And C, because I'm fair, I'm going to let you play me for it.
dr_juliet_burke Play ping pong?
james_ford That's right, Avalanche. You bastards put up your best player. One game. And when I crush them, you all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.
dr_juliet_burke If you lose?
james_ford I ain't gonna lose, but if I do, tell you what, name it.
jinsoo_kwon 소이어가 뭐래?
sunhwa_kwon 잠깐만, 내가 나중에 얘기 해 줄게. 나한테 좋은 생각이 생겼어.
james_ford Ooh, looks like crouching tiger and hidden dragon got something good. Lay it on me.
sunhwa_kwon No nicknames. If you lose, no nicknames for anyone for a week.
charlie_pace Nice!
james_ford You're on. Pick your player. I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.
john_locke You sure it's completely isolated?
sayid_jarrah I've circled the house. Nothing but jungles surrounding it. Here.
john_locke Does that dish still work?
sayid_jarrah A satellite dish of that size would have broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles. Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower. Is this it?
danielle_rousseau I have never been here before.
kate_austen The man in the house, you said you've seen him before?
sayid_jarrah On a video feed from the Pearl Station.
kate_austen So who is he?
sayid_jarrah Only one way to find out. We ask him.
kate_austen What's this for?
sayid_jarrah If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened. In case he is threatened, you cover me from here.
kate_austen Hey, where are you going?
danielle_rousseau I have no interest in that man inside the house. I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters. I'll wait for you by the stream, for those of you who survive.
arabic_man_1 MAN Najeev. Najeev. A man out front wants to see you.
sami Did you cook this?
sayid_jarrah Yes, I did.
sami Wow, it is delicious. My name is Sami.
sayid_jarrah Najeev. Thank you.
sami Please sit. Sit. Where are you from, Najeev?
sayid_jarrah I'm Syrian.
sami Please. والله يااخي, انت مبين عليك كثير انك عراقي مثلي.
sayid_jarrah What do you want from me?
sami You're an excellent cook. And I, I have a restaurant. Much nicer than this place. Come take a look. If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.
sayid_jarrah You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?
sami I'm offering you a job because we're outsiders here. And because, um, my chef just quit.
kate_austen No, he's been hit. He's been hit.
john_locke Not yet. Do you want to get shot too?
mikhail_bakunin I didn't cross the line! We had a truce! This is my land! You said I could stay here!
sayid_jarrah I'm not who you think I am! My name is Sayid Jarrah! I was on a plane that crashed here months ago!
mikhail_bakunin A plane?!
sayid_jarrah I'm unarmed, I swear!
mikhail_bakunin Stay right there!
john_locke Drop the rifle! Stop, right now. Back up. Back up.
kate_austen Are you all right?
mikhail_bakunin You really did crash here?
sayid_jarrah Over 40 of us, yes.
john_locke I'll go in first. Make sure it's ok.
kate_austen Who are you?
mikhail_bakunin My name is Mikhail Bakunin and I am the last living member of the DHARMA Initiative.
kate_austen Watch your step.
mikhail_bakunin Please. Sit. Here, let me...
sayid_jarrah You've had experience treating gunshot wounds?
mikhail_bakunin I spent some time in Afghanistan. I had experience with field medicine in the Soviet Army. In the kitchen, on the top shelf there is a medical kit. Will you bring it please?
sayid_jarrah It's alright, Kate.
sayid_jarrah How did you get here?
mikhail_bakunin I almost don't know where to begin.
sayid_jarrah Why don't you begin with the DHARMA Initiative.
mikhail_bakunin I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet Army. I was stationed at a listening post at Vladivostok. After the Cold War, after we lost the Cold War, my unit was decommissioned. I was dismissed from my life in the military. And after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies, I found myself wanting to do something good. So I replied to a newspaper advertisement.
sayid_jarrah An advertisement?
mikhail_bakunin 'Would you like to save the world?' it read. That's how I met them, the Initiative. They're very secretive, very rich, very smart.
sayid_jarrah So, when did you come to the island?
mikhail_bakunin 11 years now. I like computers, communications equipment, being alone like a lighthouse keeper. So they put me in this station. They called it The Flame.
sayid_jarrah What is the purpose of the flame?
mikhail_bakunin To communicate with the outside world, of course.
COMPUTER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode11 VOICE Ready to play? Ready to play?
COMPUTER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode11 VOICE Your move.
sayid_jarrah What happened to the DHARMA Initiative?
mikhail_bakunin They're all dead, of course. They foolishly initiated a war against The Hostiles, the purge they called it.
sayid_jarrah How did you survive this purge?
mikhail_bakunin By not participating in it. I told you, I like being alone.
sayid_jarrah And the hostiles allowed you to stay here?
mikhail_bakunin After it was over, four men appeared in the yard. They offered a truce. They said to imagine a line that extended all the way across the valley. As long as I did not cross it, I would be left alone. Then they took two cows and I never saw them again.
kate_austen They weren't interested in the satellite dish in the yard?
mikhail_bakunin Why would they be? It hasn't functioned for years.
sayid_jarrah Who are they, these Hostiles?
mikhail_bakunin I do not know. But they were here a long time before we were. A very long time.
sayid_jarrah I am looking for Sami.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode11 Sami!
sami Najeev! I'm so glad you came. What do you think? It's a simple place. We have simple customers. Ah, here's my wife. She is in charge of the kitchen. Amira, come meet the chef.
sayid_jarrah Pleasure to meet you.
sami Are you sure this is him?
amira Yes.
sayid_jarrah Look, I do not know who you think I am--
sayid_jarrah What did you just say?
mikhail_bakunin I told Nadia to be polite because you are my guests.
sayid_jarrah Nadia?
mikhail_bakunin Mm hmm. After Nadia Comaneci, the greatest athlete the world has ever known. We have the same birthday. Excellent work if I say so myself.
sayid_jarrah Thank you, Mikhail
mikhail_bakunin Perhaps I can begin to earn your forgiveness by offering you some iced tea. I will also check on your friend.
mikhail_bakunin Ha! Don't waste your time. For ten years I have tried to defeat that game. But it was programmed by three grand masters. And it cheats.
john_locke Hmm. Well, I've played a lot of computers and I'm pretty sure they don't know how to cheat. That's what makes being human so distinctly wonderful.
sayid_jarrah What's wrong?
kate_austen It just doesn't make any sense. Why would they let him stay here with all this stuff, all this equipment?
sayid_jarrah Actually it makes perfect sense.
kate_austen What are you talking about?
sayid_jarrah The reason they let him stay here is because he is not DHARMA. He is one of them.
kate_austen He shot you and you just let him- Why are we still sitting here?
sayid_jarrah We are sitting here, Kate, because I am certain he is not alone.
james_ford So, you really the number one draft pick, Grimace?
dr_juliet_burke Yep. Are we playing with the mercy rule?
james_ford Mercy rule?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, if I am like up 11-0 I, you know, automatically win.
james_ford You're going to go up 11-0.
dr_juliet_burke Well, any one of us.
james_ford Sure, we can have a mercy rule.
dr_juliet_burke Wanna volley for serve?
james_ford Tell you what, you can be my guest.
charlie_pace Take him down, Hurley!
dr_juliet_burke 0 serving 0.
charlie_pace Yes!
dr_juliet_burke 1-Nothing
mikhail_bakunin I grow the tea myself. So pardon its bitterness.
sayid_jarrah Any tea is good tea.
kate_austen You know how long it's been since we've seen ice?
sayid_jarrah I noticed a series of thick wires as I walked around the station.
mikhail_bakunin This is the hub. But they go around to various stations on the island.
sayid_jarrah And these cables, do any of them run into the ocean?
mikhail_bakunin Yes. There is an underwater beacon that emits sonar pings to help guide in the vessels.
sayid_jarrah By vessels, you mean submarines.
mikhail_bakunin Yes. The Initiative used it to bring us to the island. But I can only imagine that the Hostiles have either destroyed it or commandeered it by now.
sayid_jarrah That explains how they were able to get around my position and capture our sailboat.
mikhail_bakunin You have a sailboat?
sayid_jarrah Until we lost it to your Hostiles.
mikhail_bakunin That's very unfortunate.
sayid_jarrah Well, at least we were able to kill one of them.
mikhail_bakunin Why are we continuing to play this little game when we all know it has moved to the next stage?
sayid_jarrah Get some rope.
sami Drink.
sami You were a torturer, were you not, in the Republican Guard? Do you not recognize one of your victims? Do you not recognize the woman you tortured? Do you not recognize my WIFE?!
sayid_jarrah No I have never seen- You are confusing me with someone else.
sami Amira was arrested for harboring an enemy of the state. She was held for three months while she was questioned. Her arms bear the scars of those questions. So I assure you, Najeev, I am NOT confused.
sayid_jarrah My name is not Najeev. I'm Sayid Jarrah. I was in the Republican Guard and, yes, I was an interrogator. But I have never seen your wife. Maybe she saw me at the same facility, but I do not know her. I can remember every face of every person I interrogated.
sami She remembers your face. She remembers it so well that she recognized you from a mere glimpse as we walked by the restaurant where you worked!
sayid_jarrah What do you want from me?
sami I want you to admit what you did. And if you don't, you will leave this room in a bag.
kate_austen How do you know he is not alone?
sayid_jarrah The horse is still saddled outside, and the stirrups are set for someone much shorter than this man.
john_locke You think the Others sent someone out here to keep him company?
sayid_jarrah I think they sent someone out here because they lost communication.
john_locke Maybe when the sky turned purple.
sayid_jarrah That would be my guess.
john_locke Well, if they sent somebody out here, they're hiding pretty good. I checked every nook and cranny of this place.
sayid_jarrah Not every nook and cranny, John.
sami Are you ready to tell me the truth?
sayid_jarrah I have already told you the truth. I do not know you.
sami You tortured her.
sayid_jarrah No, I would never touch a woman. Do you think this will do any good? To make me confess to something I didn't do?
sami My wife confessed to something she didn't do. She confessed when you poured a pan of boiling oil all over her arms!
sayid_jarrah No I did not-
sami Admit it!
sami Admit it!
sayid_jarrah I can not admit to something I didn't do.
amira That is enough for today.
sami Then I will see you tomorrow.
COMPUTER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode11 VOICE Your move.
kate_austen What is it?
sayid_jarrah C4. Explosive. The entire place is wired.
kate_austen Why?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
dr_pierre_chang CANDLE Manual override complete. For pallet drop enter 24. For station uplink enter 32. for mainland communication enter 38.
dr_pierre_chang CANDLE The satellite dish is inoperable. Communications are down. For sonar access enter 56.
dr_pierre_chang CANDLE Sonar is inoperable. Has there been an incursion of this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
mikhail_bakunin Keep your voice low, and your hands in front of you.
sayid_jarrah Stop right there. Put the gun on the ground, now.
sayid_jarrah What are you doing?
kate_austen It's her! She was there! She was at the dock! She was there when we got kidnapped! She knows where Jack is!
sayid_jarrah Are there any more of you here?
sayid_jarrah Let's take her upstairs. John, we're coming up! John!
john_locke Out here!
mikhail_bakunin This is simple. Send her over to me and I release him, and we all go our separate ways.
john_locke Don't listen to him. If he was going to kill me, I'd be dead already.
mikhail_bakunin Shut your mouth!
sayid_jarrah Listen to me.
john_locke Sayid, do not let her go.
mikhail_bakunin I will execute you right here!
john_locke He's not going to do it!
sayid_jarrah Be quiet, John!
john_locke I'm the only thing keeping him alive!
mikhail_bakunin I swear to you!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Михаил.
sayid_jarrah Calm down everyone!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Михаил! Ты знаешь что делать.
mikhail_bakunin У нас есть ещё выход.
john_locke Sayid!
sayid_jarrah I'll handle this, John.
kate_austen John...
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Мы не можем рисковать.
mikhail_bakunin нет.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Ты знаешь условия.
mikhail_bakunin Есть другой выход.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Они взяли нас. Мы не дадим им пройти на территорию.
john_locke Don't let her talk to him!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Ты знаешь что делать.
sayid_jarrah Mikhail!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Это приказ!
mikhail_bakunin У нас всё ещё есть выход!
sayid_jarrah Stop!
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Just do it, Mikhail!
mikhail_bakunin Прости меня.
sayid_jarrah John!
mikhail_bakunin Finish it! Kill me.
dr_juliet_burke Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.
james_ford Sorry you hustled me, you mean.
dr_juliet_burke My mom had a table in her basement. And I played a lot at the instit— this place I hung out at. And I got kinda good.
james_ford Well, hooray for you.
dr_juliet_burke Looks like that last slam didn’t cause any long-term damage to your forehead. And you got three points which is better than nothing.
james_ford Is there something you want?
dr_juliet_burke I came to give you back your stuff. Cause I know you're the kind of guy who needs stuff.
james_ford Are you a shrink now?
dr_juliet_burke She'll be ok, dude- Kate. I know you're worried about her. But she's with Locke and Sayid. She's going to be fine.
james_ford Well, thanks for the pep talk—
dr_juliet_burke Uh uh. It's Hurley. Or Hugo if you want.
james_ford Get bent, Hugo.
kate_austen Ready to go, Locke?
john_locke Be there in a minute!
dr_pierre_chang CANDLE Has there be an incursion on this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
sayid_jarrah Danielle! Danielle! Tell me something. Were you ever a member of the DHARMA Initiative? Or was everything you said a lie? Of course, I'm wasting my breath.
mikhail_bakunin I was never a member. But everything else I told you was true. I moved into this station after the purge.
sayid_jarrah The purge? In which a group of scientists attacked your people?
mikhail_bakunin Believe what you want, but that is what happened.
danielle_rousseau Your friends, did he kill them?
sayid_jarrah No. They are collecting whatever is useful from the farmhouse. And now we have our ticket to where the Others live, where we will find your daughter, and Jack, and finally, perhaps, a way home.
mikhail_bakunin There is nothing you could do to me to make me lead you there.
sayid_jarrah I didn't say you were our ticket, did I? This is a map showing electrical and data cabling running from the Flame, here, to a place called the Barracks, here. It's comprised of houses and dormitories, with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community. Sounds like a place well worth visiting, don't you think?
mikhail_bakunin There will come a time when your guard is down. And when it is, I will not hesitate a moment before killing you. You should know this before you--
danielle_rousseau He is making an excellent point. You have a map. Why keep him alive?
amira After my husband and I first arrived to Paris, I was afraid to ever leave our apartment. So I would stare out in the window into the alley, and I would see this cat looking for scraps. One day some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box. I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box. I could hear him howl from three stories above. So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment. I rescued this cat and I brought him home. He sits with me when I read, sleeps with me, and he purrs. But, every once in a while, he will bite me or scratch me. He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now. So I forgive him when he bites me, because I remember what it is like to never feel safe. And that is because of you. So today, I ask only one thing of you I ask you now to show me the respect by acknowledging what you did to me. That it was you who questioned me, tortured me and that you remember me.
sayid_jarrah I remember you. I remember your face. Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq. I am sorry. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I am sorry.
amira I forgive you. When my husband returns, I will tell I made a terrible mistake, that it was not you, and he will release you.
sayid_jarrah Why? Why are you letting me go?
amira We are all capable of doing what those children did to this cat. But I will not do that. I will not be that.
danielle_rousseau We should kill him, Sayid. He already told us he would kill us.
sayid_jarrah No. He's my prisoner. I will decide his fate.
sayid_jarrah I can see you didn't see anything worth taking.
john_locke Actually I just played that silly chess game again. And now I can see why you didn't want me to beat it.
sayid_jarrah Meaning what?
sayid_jarrah What have you done, John? That place was our one hope of communication with the outside world!
john_locke The computer said that if there was an incursion of the station by the Hostiles, I should enter 77. So I entered 77.
sayid_jarrah We should go. If anyone is around this explosion's going to attract their attention.
