PHIL Hello Jin? Are you there?
PHIL Jin?! Can you hear me?
JIN Hello?
PHIL Jin? It's -- it's Phil, man. Where have you been? The hostile escaped. We're searching the east grid.
JIN He's headed north.
PHIL [on walkie How the hell do you know that?
JIN Because he attacked me. 
PHIL What? Where are you?
PHIL Jin?! You still there?
PHIL Jin!
BEN Please help.
HORACE Okay, everybody, listen up.
MAN Put it over there.
HORACE We don't know yet if another attack is coming. So everybody needs to be ready for your security assignments. Make sure you're in contact with your team leaders. LaFleur's got search parties out, but the hostile's got a good jump on us. We're pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion in order to escape.
HURLEY Uh...is he talking about Sayid?
JACK He was locked up. How would he start the fire?
HORACE Who are you?
JACK Jack Shephard. I'm...I'm new.
HORACE Well, Jack, the way he started the fire is he had help, okay? Somebody torched that van, and then that somebody let him out of his cell. And since the security cameras didn't pick up any hostiles crossing the perimeter, that means it was one of us.
HORACE Baxter, I want a full report on cleanup A.S.A.P.
BAXTER You got it Horace.
ROGER Hey, you.
ROGER Yeah, you.
ROGER You're in the motor pool, right?
KATE Uh, yeah.
ROGER Do you mind running that winch for me?
ROGER You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
ROGER Okay, no worries. Just throw this lever. When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.
KATE All right.
ROGER See? Simple. Don't do it till I'm ready. All right, crank her up.
KATE Okay. 
ROGER So they just stuck you in the motor pool when you got here?
KATE Yeah, pretty much.
ROGER Yeah, same thing happened to me.  Wait, hold. Hold it right there. That's good. Right there. That's good.  I guess they couldn't sucker anybody into getting on that sub if they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors.
KATE Well, ya gotta start somewhere.
ROGER What's your name?
KATE I'm Kate.
ROGER Welcome aboard, Kate. I'm Roger. Roger Linus.
KATE It's nice to meet you, Roger.
ROGER That's my kid.  That's my kid!
KATE Hi, handsome. Did you have a good sleep? Yeah, that's my boy.  Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away.  Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket save it for a rainy day.
KATE Hi.
CASSIDY Oh, my God! 
KATE Hi, Cassidy.
CASSIDY Oh, my God! I saw you on the news! I told all my friends, "I know that woman!"  Hi!
KATE This is Aaron.
CASSIDY Hi, Aaron.
KATE Say hi.
CASSIDY You survived a plane crash.  It's amazing. I never thought I'd see you again. What are you doing here?
KATE Sawyer sent me.
CASSIDY Sawyer. So that son of a bitch is still alive?
KATE He was when I left.
CASSIDY And he asked you to come here and give me an envelope full of money?
KATE Well, he -- he told me where to find you, and...said to take care of Clementine...his daughter?
CASSIDY Well, she's asleep in her crib right now. Want me to wake her up?
KATE I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you. I could've sent it, and I probably should have.
CASSIDY Why did you tell me all this? Why'd you trust me?
KATE Because I thought your daughter had a right to know that her father cared.
CASSIDY Why didn't he come back with the rest of you?
KATE The helicopter that we were on was running out of gas, so he jumped so that we could make it to the boat.
CASSIDY  What a coward.
KATE He was trying to do the right thing.
CASSIDY He was trying to get away from you. I told him he had a daughter. He never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her. So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero because he told you to come here and help us? Hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?
KATE They gave us a settlement after the crash, and I didn't need it all--
CASSIDY You don't have to explain it, Kate. You got the same look on your face I did when he ditched me. All I have for you is sympathy. Is it his?
KATE What?
CASSIDY Your son. Is it Sawyer's?
KATE No. No, I was pregnant before I met him.
CASSIDY That's not your baby, is it? Kate, you just told me that you and your friends cooked a story for the whole world about what happened on that island. So you tell me the truth about that? Why are you lying to me about him?
KATE Because I have to.
KATE What happened?
SAWYER What the hell are you doing here?
KATE That was Ben. That kid who was shot was Ben. Was it Sayid? Did he shoot him?
SAWYER Here's what you need to do, Kate--Keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions. 'Cause putting any attention on yourself is the last thing I need right now. Now scram. I don't want you around here.
KATE I just wanna know what's going on.
HORACE LaFleur.  What... What, uh... What's she doing here?
SAWYER This is, uh...
KATE I'm Kate.
SAWYER Kate. She's new over at the motor pool. I was seeing if she saw anything suspicious, but she didn't, so...you can run along, thanks.
HORACE Have you checked out the hostile's cell yet?
SAWYER I was a little busy trying to keep the town from burnin' down, Horace.
HORACE Okay. Well, then let's do it.
HORACE He didn't break out. Somebody let him out.
SAWYER These are janitor's keys.
HORACE We've only got three janitors. There's Roger, Willie and, uh, that new guy. I just met him. His name's Jack.
SAWYER Yeah. I just brought him in from the sub. I'll go talk to him. Miles, you wanna come with me? 
MILES Yeah, sure, boss. 
SAWYER  All right,I want you to find Jack and Hurley and Kate as quick as you can. Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.
MILES What for?
SAWYER 'Cause I don't want 'em talking to anybody else. Things are starting to spin out of control here.
MILES All right, I got it.
SAWYER All right, go.
ROGER Who did this? Do you know who did this to my son?
SAWYER Not yet, but we're working on it. How's he doing?
ROGER I don't know. Juliet told me to wait out here.
SAWYER Let me see if I can get an update for ya.
ROGER Thanks, Jim.
SAWYER Roger?
ROGER Yeah?
SAWYER You happen to have your keys with you?
ROGER Yeah. Why? What do you need?  I must've left them at...at the house.
SAWYER It's all right. Don't you worry about it. 
JULIET More gauze.
NURSE Here's some gauze.
JULIET Yeah, right here. Yeah.  If we can't stop the hemorrhaging, we're gonna have to pack the whole tract.
NURSE Okay.
SAWYER  Where's the doctor?
JULIET  At the Looking Glass station til Friday.
SAWYER How is he doing?
JULIET Not well.  Hold on.  He's still bleeding in there somewher, and I can't fix it.
SAWYER It's all right.
JULIET No, it's not all right. Someone needs to get in there who can find the damage that bullet did and fix it.  He needs a real surgeon.
JACK You're telling us we're under house arrest?
MILES No, you're all free to leave whenever you want...but I'll shoot you in the leg.
JACK  And whose idea was this?
MILES Who do you think?
KATE Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.
MILES What the hell are you doing, Tubby?
HURLEY Checking to see if I'm disappearing.
MILES What?
HURLEY "Back to the Future", man. We came back in time to the island and changed stuff. So if little Ben dies, he'll never grow up to be big Ben, who's the one who made us come back here in the first place. Which means we can't be here. And therefore, dude? We don't exist.
MILES You're an idiot. 
HURLEY Am I?
MILES Yeah. It doesn't work like that. You can't change anything. Your maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus. That is what always happened. It's just...we never experienced how it all turns out.
HURLEY This is really confusing.
MILES Yeah, well, get used to it. But the good news is that Linus didn't die, so that means the kid can't either. He'll be fine.
KATE Didn't look like he was gonna be fine. What if you're wrong?
MILES Well, if I'm wrong, then I guess we all stop existing, and none of it matters anyway then, does it?
SAWYER Doc, I need you to come with me.
JACK Come with you where?
SAWYER Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and we ain't gone none to put back in him. So we need you to show us where he sprung a leak.
JACK  No.
SAWYER What?
JACK No, I'm not coming with you.
SAWYER If you don't come with me, Jack, that kid's gonna die.
JACK  Then he dies.
KATE What are you doing?
JACK Making some sandwiches. I figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now. 
KATE He's just a boy, Jack. You can't just let him die.
JACK You heard Miles. We can't change what's already happened. This has nothing to do with me.
KATE Unless you're the one who's supposed to save him.
JACK 30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man...that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery. And then you're gonna come in and you're gonna beg me to operate on him because he's threatening to murder Sawyer. I've already done this once.  I've already saved Benjamin Linus, and I did it for you, Kate. I don't need to do it again. 
KATE This is our fault. We brought Sayid back. We caused this.
JACK You know, when we were here before, I spent all of my time trying to fix things. But...did you ever think that maybe the island just wants to fix things itself? And maybe I was just...getting' in the way?
KATE You know, I don't like the new you. I liked the old you, who wouldn't just sit around and wait for things to happen.
JACK You didn't like the old me, Kate.
MILES Hey! Where are you going?
JULIET  Just try to relax. You're okay.
NURSE I'm sorry. Juliet? One of the new people is here.  She heard Ben needed blood. Says she's a universal donor.
JULIET This might hurt for a second.  Good.  Very brave.  So James told me that Jack wouldn't help, but he didn't say why. 
KATE If I understood why Jack does what he does, I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.
JULIET Off island, did something happen with you two? 
KATE We were engaged. Does that count?
ROGER What's going on?
JULIET Roger, I asked you to wait outside.
ROGER No, what's going on with my kid?
JULIET Kate is giving us some fresh blood so we can transfuse Ben.
ROGER Well, I'm not waitin' outside.
KATE You know, he could stay with me, and you could check on Ben, and--and Roger here could keep me company, make sure I don't pass out.
JULIET Okay. Roger, have a seat. 
ROGER Thanks.
KATE Sure.
ROGER  He stole my keys.
KATE Sorry?
ROGER LaFleur asked me where my keys were. That bastard doesn't ask any questions he doesn't know the answers to...which means my son stole my keys so he could bust that animal out of jail.
KATE Why--why would he do that?
ROGER Because of me. You got kids?
KATE No.
ROGER I thought I was gonna be the greatest father ever. You know?  I guess it didn't work out that way.
KATE What about his mother? Is she still around?
ROGER No, she's dead. She died the day he was born.
KATE I'm sorry.
ROGER Yeah, me, too. I tried to do what I thought she'd want me to do, but...I guess a boy just needs his mother.
ROGER What's going on?
JULIET He's going into hypoxic shock.
ROGER What does that mean?! What's the matter with him?!
JULIET He needs more oxygen. Roger, get out of here!
ROGER What?
JULIET Get him out of here!
ROGER Wait! What--what is--wait a minute.
JULIET Please, Roger. Just wait outside.
HURLEY Let me get this straight.
HURLEY All this already happened.
MILES Yes.
HURLEY So this conversation we're having right now...we already had it.
MILES Yes!
HURLEY Then what am I gonna say next?
MILES I don't know. 
HURLEY Ha! Then your theory is wrong!
MILES For the thousandth time, you dingbat, the conversation already happened, but not for you and me. For you and me, it's happening right now.
HURLEY Okay, answer me this. If all this already happened to me, then...why don't I remember any of it?
MILES Because once Ben turned that wheel, time isn't a straight line for us anymore. Our experiences in the past and the future occurred before these experiences right now.
HURLEY Say that again.
MILES  Shoot me. Please. Please!
HURLEY Aha! I can't shoot you. Because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come back to the island on the freighter 30 years from now.
MILES I can die because I've already come to the island on the freighter. Any of us can die because this is our present.
HURLEY But you said Ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up and become the leader of the Others.
MILES Because this is his past.
HURLEY But when we first captured Ben, and Sayid, like, tortured him, then why wouldn't he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?
MILES Huh. I hadn't thought of that.
HURLEY Huh. 
ROGER How is he?
JULIET He's stable.
ROGER Is he gonna be okay?
JULIET He's got some fresh blood running through him, which is a good thing. Roger, I need you to go out to the medical station. There are some supplies there that we don't have here .
ROGER Okay. Hey, I just wanna say, I-I... I wanna say thanks. I know that you're doing everything you can... to save him, and...all right, I'm--I'm gonna go, okay? 
KATE Is he any better?
JULIET He's stable now. But I can't, um... I can't fix it.
KATE What about the sub? I mean, can we take him somewhere?
JULIET No. It's gone. It won't be back for a couple of months.
KATE But he can't die, right?
JULIET He is going to die. He is in a medical situation that is not resolveable.
KATE Okay, well, we can't just sit here and do nothing. I mean, there's got to be someone who can help him. We have an entire c... What?
JULIET Maybe there's something they can do.
KATE They?
JULIET The Others.
JULIET You got him?
KATE Yeah. Ready? Okay.
JULIET All right. One, two, three, go.
JULIET Okay, let's go.
JULIET I'm coming with you.
KATE No, no, no, no. If something goes wrong or we get caught, it doesn't matter for me, but you've got a whole life here. And besides, if Sawyer knew that I got you involved in this, he'd kill me. 
JULIET How are you gonna manage?
KATE I'll manage, don't worry. 
JULIET Kate.  Sawyer's gonna find out Ben's gone, and when he does, I have to tell him what happened. But I'll give you as much of a head start as I can. Good luck.
BEN There's someone...someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
SUN Who?
BEN The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
KATE Is that what this is about?  You knew about this.
JACK No. No, I was o--
KATE And that is why you were pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?!
JACK I wasn't pretending anything.
KATE This is insane. You guys are crazy.
JACK Kate--
KATE Jack, don't!
AARON Mommy, I'm thirsty.
AARON I need some milk.
WOMAN Price check on 2. Price check on 2.
KATE  Do you want chocolate milk or regular milk?
AARON Juice box.
KATE You don't want milk anymore?
AARON Juice box.
KATE Um...excuse me. Where are your juice boxes?
EMPLOYEE Aisle 5.
KATE Thank you very much.  Aaron?  Um, excuse me. Have you seen my son?
EMPLOYEE I'm sorry?
KATE A little 3-year-old blond?  Aaron? Aaron? Aaron?! Aaron!  Excuse me. I've lost my son. He's 3. He's a little blond boy.
MANAGER Don't worry, ma'am. I'll make an announcement. No, no, no. You have to seal off the store. You...  Aaron? Hey!
WOMAN Hey, is this your mommy? Honey, is this your mommy?
WOMAN I found him in the fruit section. I--he looked lost, I was getting eading to make an announcement.
KATE Thank you. Thank you very much.
KATE It's okay, honey. Mommy's got you. Mommy's got you.
BEN Um... tell my...
KATE Try not to talk, okay?
BEN Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.
KATE I know you gotta stop me...but I can't just let that kid die.
SAWYER  Damn it, Freckles. I ain't here to stop you. I'm here to help you.
CLEMENTINE Hi, Auntie Kate!
KATE Hi, Clementine. Is your mommy home?
CLEMENTINE Sure. I'll go get her.
KATE Okay.
CASSIDY They're going back? To the island?  Why in God's name would they wanna do that?
KATE I don't know. Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave.
CASSIDY Well, Jack sounds like a piece of work. You look exhausted. Drink this. Turl up on my bed. Take a nap. I'll watch your fella.
KATE I lost him.
CASSIDY What?
KATE I don't know what happened. We were in the supermarket, and I turned around for one second, and he was gone.  And, you know, the crazy thing is, is that... as scared as I was...I wasn't surprised. All I could think was, it's about time. Why would I feel that way? I mean, why would I expect him to be taken?
CASSIDY Because you took him, Kate.
KATE No, I...Claire was gone. I mean, she left him. I had to take him. He needed me.
CASSIDY You needed him. Sawyer broke your heart. How else were you supposed to fix it?
SAWYER Figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself?
KATE Well, the line's just right over there, right? The Others are on the other side.
SAWYER Well, they ain't right on the other side. We better get movin'.
KATE Hey. Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me?
SAWYER  When I found out Ben was gone, and Juliet told me what you were up to, I asked that exact damn question. Why are you helping Ben? And she said...no matter what he's gonna grow up to be, it's wrong to let a kid die.  So...that's why I'm doing this. I'm doing it for her.
JULIET Where's Jack?
MILES Uh he--he's in the shower. I think.
HURLEY Is he in trouble?
JULIET I just need to talk to him. You two mind giving us some privacy?
MILES Hey, ask me more questions about time travel.
JULIET I needed you.
JACK I'm sorry?
JULIET That kid was bleeding out. You're a surgeon, and I needed you.
JACK That kid is Ben.
JULIET That's not Ben yet. He's just a kid.
JACK Juliet, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
JULIET I'm not asking for your help, Jack. You made it pretty clear you weren't interested. It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.
JACK What?
JULIET She's trying to save him, and I sent James after her to help, because they actually care.
JACK I came back here because I care, Juliet. I came back here because I was trying to save you.
JULIET We didn't need saving. We've been fine for three years. You came back here for you. At least do me the courtesy of telling me why.
JACK I came back...because I was supposed to.
JULIET Supposed to do what?
JACK  I don't know yet.
JULIET Well, you'd better figure it out. 
KATE You know, I can take him for a while.
SAWYER Sure you can.
KATE You know, his father said that you think Ben broke Sayid out.
SAWYER Kid'll do almost anything if he's pissed off enough at his folks. 
KATE Is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter?
SAWYER Did you?
KATE Of course I did. 
SAWYER What's she like?
KATE Clementine?
SAWYER Yeah, Clementine.
KATE Oh, she's beautiful. Looks just like you when she smiles. She's growing up fast. Already has a little attitude.
SAWYER I bet you and Cassidy had a lot to talk about.
KATE She had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper.
SAWYER Yeah, what's that?
KATE She thought you were worried about what would happen if you didn't.
SAWYER You and me would've never worked out, Kate. I wasn't any more fit to be your boyfriend than I am to be that little girl's father.
KATE You seem to be doing all right with Juliet.
SAWYER Yeah. I've done a lot of growing up the past three years.
MAN Hands up!
MAN Do not move. I said don't move. This is a violation of the truce. You're over the line.
SAWYER We know. This kid's been shot. That's both of our problems. So unless you want to go to war, you're gonna take us to Richard Alpert, and you're gonna do it now.
KATE Mrs. Littleton. I'm Kate Austen.
CAROLE I know who you are. Come in. 
KATE Thank you.
CAROLE Your friend, Dr. Shephard came here last night, going on and on about some person named Aaron. When I asked him who that was, he ran out of here like the room was on fire.
KATE He's your grandson.  And your daughter, Claire...is alive.
CAROLE What are you talking about? Claire died in the plane crash.
KATE No, she survived. When we crashed, your daughter was eight months pregnant, and...she's the one who gave birth on the island, not me. We lied. There were other survivors, too. We just left them behind.
CAROLE Why? Why would you leave her there?
KATE Because she disappeared, and she left the baby behind. We looked everywhere, but...that's when I started taking care of Aaron. And when we were rescued, we didn't--we had to decide what to do with him. And I knew that she had wanted him to be adopted, but I couldn't. I had to protect him, so I said he was mine.
CAROLE Why did you lie? Why didn't you come to me in the first place?
KATE Because I needed him.  I'm sorry. You're gonna see that he's so sweet and kind and good.
CAROLE Where is he?
KATE Um, I checked in two doors down. He's asleep. I know that this is a lot for you to handle. But...when you're ready, he's waiting for you. I told him that you're his grandmother. That you'll take care of him while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.
CAROLE Where are you going?
KATE I'm going back to find your daughter.
KATE Bye-bye, baby. 
SAWYER Don't worry. We got 'em right where we want 'em.
MAN Shut up and keep moving'.
SAWYER What's it look like I'm doing?
RICHARD Hello there, James. 
SAWYER Where the hell did you come from?
RICHARD You asked my people to bring you to me. Here I am.  Is that Benjamin Linus?
SAWYER You two know each other?
RICHARD What happened to him?
KATE He was shot.
RICHARD And who might you be?
SAWYER She's with me.
RICHARD And why are you here?
KATE 'Cause we need you to save his life. Can you?
RICHARD If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.
KATE What do you mean by that?
RICHARD What I mean is that, he'll forget this ever happened, and that...his innocence will be gone. He will always be one of us. You still want me to take him?
KATE Yes.
MAN Richard... You shouldn't do this without asking Ellie. And if Charles finds out--
RICHARD Let him find out. I don't answer to either of them
KATE Wh-where are you taking him? 
SAWYER Come on.
LOCKE Hello, Ben. Welcome back to the land of the living.
