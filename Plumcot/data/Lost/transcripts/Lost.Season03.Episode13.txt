john_locke No.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER Are your parents living?
john_locke I, I was raised in foster care. I never really knew my parents.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER Have you ever considered seeking out your biological parents?
john_locke Ah, I, ah.. I don't see how that's relevant.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER It's relevant, Mr. Locke, because if the government's going to continue paying your disability insurance, I have to figure out whether or not your condition has improved. So. How's your appetite?
john_locke Fine.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER I see you've stopped submitting your therapy bills for reimbursement.
john_locke That's 'cause I stopped going. Waste of time.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER It's just a temporary suspension, Mr. Locke. As soon as you resume your sessions, you can reapply.
john_locke You think I'm temporarily disabled?
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER Depression can be temporary, yes. And since you see fit to stop going to therapy, I guess you're all better.
john_locke Guess I am.
GOVERNMENT#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 WORKER Next!
tom_friendly Over here!
kate_austen What is he doing...?!
john_locke Shhh!
tom_friendly Good hands!
dr_juliet_burke Jack!
kate_austen She's the one who helped me and Sawyer escape.
dr_jack_shephard What's up?
dr_juliet_burke Okay, I think it's going to be tomorrow.
kate_austen Hey, what?
sayid_jarrah Danielle.
kate_austen John, Rousseau's gone.
dr_jack_shephard Can you feel anything?
ben_linus So how do you feel?
john_locke This is going to be more complicated than we thought.
sayid_jarrah So what exactly are you saying? We simply start shooting people and hope for the best?
kate_austen We came here to rescue Jack, and that's what we're going to do.
sayid_jarrah But obviously the circumstances have changed. He may not want to be rescued.
kate_austen That is not him! That's not Jack. They must have done something to him. When they captured us, they drugged us.
sayid_jarrah He didn't appear to be drugged, Kate.
kate_austen They kidnapped him! Held him prisoner! He wouldn't just forget that!
sayid_jarrah I agree. But until we know why, we're putting our lives at risk.
kate_austen I'm not leaving him, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah You may not have a choice.
john_locke It's Jack. The first time I saw him he was risking his life pulling people out of burning airplane wreckage. If he's shaking hands with the Others, I'm sure he has a good reason. We just have to go down there and find out what it is.
sayid_jarrah What do you suggest?
john_locke We wait till it's dark, we approach Jack when he's alone... and if he wants out, we get him out.
AUTUMN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 Here's what we know, Crystal The Bolivian gold deposits were stolen last night around 2 a.m.
CRYSTAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 Um, that means...?
AUTUMN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 The Cobra!
CRYSTAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 He's back! Ah, get down!
AUTUMN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 I've been shot!
CRYSTAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 I can't find him!
AUTUMN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 There! Behind winged victory! I think he's armed!
CRYSTAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 I can get him!
peter Hello. John Locke?
john_locke I'm sorry. No solicitors. I have a sign.
peter Uh, I'm not... I'm not trying to sell you any... Listen, my name's Peter Talbot. I, uh, I just need a couple of minutes to talk to you.
john_locke Talk about what?
peter My mother, actually. I think she might be in some trouble.
john_locke You've got the wrong John Locke.
peter How many kidneys do you have?
peter She met him two months ago. Love at first sight, is what she said. Guy was charming, sweet, funny. His name's Adam Seward. He's a retired computer entrepreneur from Ontario.
peter Anyway, Adam had something... special. My mom just went ga-ga for him right out of the gate. After two months of knowing him, she agrees to marry the guy. And something about him, it... Something in my gut told me that he was after something, so I... I had to check him out.
john_locke Well, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with me.
peter Well, what this has to do with you, Mr. Locke, is that you donated one of your kidneys to Adam Seward. Only his name was different back then. He used to be Anthony Cooper.
peter All I could find were his medical records. And I saw that he was the recipient of a kidney transplant from... you... so I figured, hey, someone gave the guy his kidney; how bad could he be? Right?
john_locke Well, it, it was an anonymous donation. I never met him.
peter Are you sure?
john_locke Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
john_locke Sayid, you guard the front. I'll go around and cover the back. You head in through the side door.
kate_austen I'm going in alone?
john_locke It's better if you're the first one he sees.
kate_austen All right.
kate_austen Hi.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing here?
kate_austen I came to get you.
dr_jack_shephard Get out of here! Right now. Go.
kate_austen Jack...
dr_jack_shephard Kate! They're watching me!
dr_jack_shephard Get out of here!
kate_austen I'm not leaving you!
dr_jack_shephard Yes you are!
OTHER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 Get down! Get down!
ryan_pryce Get her down! Get her down!
dr_jack_shephard Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!
ryan_pryce Step back, Doc. Step. Back.
ryan_pryce Hold him still!
kate_austen Jack! Jack?! Jack!
ryan_pryce Who else is with you?
kate_austen Jack...
dr_jack_shephard Just answer the question, Kate.
ryan_pryce OK, one more time. Who else is with you?
kate_austen Nobody. Nobody else; it was just us.
ben_linus Alex?
ben_linus John!
john_locke Shhh. Keep your voice down.
ben_linus All right. It's all right, John. You don't have to point the gun at me. I can tell you where Jack is.
john_locke I'm not looking for Jack. I'm looking for the submarine.
john_locke The submarine. Where is it?
ben_linus I'm not sure what you mean, John. What submarine?
john_locke The one you use to travel to and from the island. The one your man Mikhail told me about, right before I killed him.
alex_rousseau Dad? Who are you talking to?
ben_linus Alex, don't come in here!
alex_rousseau What do you--?! What--?! Ah! Dad--?!
john_locke Tell her to be quiet!
ben_linus Alex, please!
tom_friendly Ben? You awake?
tom_friendly I'm coming in!
ben_linus What is it?
tom_friendly It's Austen and Jarrah. They're here. Somehow they found us.
ben_linus Where are they now?
tom_friendly We captured them. We're holding them over at my place. Want me to help you get out there?
ben_linus No. Separate them. I want to know how they found us.
tom_friendly What about Juliet and Shephard? Tomorrow, in the morn—
ben_linus Let me worry about that. Just go.
tom_friendly Got it.
ben_linus Richard? Wait a minute.
tom_friendly I'll wait outside.
ben_linus I want you to bring me the man from Tallahassee.
richard_alpert What do you need him for?
ben_linus Just do it. Now.
richard_alpert OK.
john_locke The man from Tallahassee? What is that? Some kind of code?
ben_linus No, John, unfortunately we don't have a code for "There's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head." Although we obviously should.
john_locke Sayid — he had a pack with him. I want her to retrieve it.
ben_linus ...OK. But you should know, John, my daughter currently hates me. So I'm not sure holding me hostage is your best option—
alex_rousseau Dad! I'll get your bag.
are#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 looking at flowers for their upcoming wedding.]
charlie_pace TALBOT I'm looking for something really stunning, something that will grab everyone's attention on the table. Honey? What do you think of this one?
anthony_cooper That looks good. What do you think?
charlie_pace TALBOT I like it. Maybe just a little larger.
anthony_cooper Yeah. Larger would be good. Um, I'll go over there and take a look.
anthony_cooper Hello, John.
john_locke Going to be a big to-do, or just the two of you and a preacher? I guess you couldn't invite me, huh? That would make for... awkward introductions.
anthony_cooper How did you even know that I was going to--?
john_locke I know... because her son came to me and asked why I gave you a kidney. He's on to you. But he doesn't have any proof, so he came to me, hoping I would vouch for you.
anthony_cooper What did you say to him?
john_locke You're conning her, aren't you? You're going to marry her for her money, right?
anthony_cooper What is it you want, John?
john_locke I want you to end it. I want you to call off the wedding.
anthony_cooper Why are you doing this?
john_locke Because. Because it's not fair! You make people think that you're their family. And then you leave their life in ruins. And I'm not going to let you do it again! You're going to call off your engagement and go... or I'm going to tell her the truth. I want to hear you say it! You say you're going to leave!
anthony_cooper OK, John. You got it.
ben_linus Would you mind helping me get into my chair? No tricks, I promise. I just want some dignity. You of all people should understand what it means to want some dignity.
ben_linus Thank you. So tell me, John. How do you expect to pilot our submarine? I mean, it's a complicated piece of machinery. You don't just press "submerge".
john_locke I'll figure something out. For all you know I was a commander in the navy.
john_locke Put your arm around my neck. I'll lift under your knees.
ben_linus What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikhail that means you were in the communications station. Which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning to pilot the submarine anywhere, are you? You're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke.
john_locke You don't know me at all.
ben_linus I know you were born in California. I know you were raised in foster care. I know you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin, pushing papers at a company that manufactured industrial boxes. I know you spent the four years prior to your arrival on this island in a wheelchair. And I know how you ended up in it. Tell me, John. Did it hurt?
john_locke I felt my back break. What do you think?
tom_friendly I didn't think I'd see you again so soon, Kate.
tom_friendly Be careful in here.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard They hurt you?
kate_austen No. They hurt you?
dr_jack_shephard No.
kate_austen What is all this?
dr_jack_shephard This is where they live.
kate_austen And the people they took? The kids?
dr_jack_shephard They're all safe.
kate_austen Safe? So you're with them now.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not "with" anyone, Kate.
kate_austen What did they do to you?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing.
kate_austen Then why are you acting like this?
dr_jack_shephard There's no w- You- There's no way that I could-
kate_austen I came here to help you! So why don't you just tell me why you're...
dr_jack_shephard I told you not to come back here for me!
kate_austen I didn't think you meant it.
kate_austen What did they do to you, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I made a deal with them. They're going to let me go.
kate_austen Where?
dr_jack_shephard Home.
kate_austen When?
dr_jack_shephard First thing in the morning. I can bring back help. It's our best chance--
kate_austen You trust these people? They are liars! Why would you believe a word that...
dr_jack_shephard I trust them because you told me to, Kate. When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.
kate_austen Jack... What did they tell you?
dr_juliet_burke Jack, we need to go.
dr_jack_shephard I'll be right there.
dr_jack_shephard I asked that you not come back here for me and I wish... I wish that you hadn't.
dr_jack_shephard But I will come back here for you.
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON John Locke?
john_locke Yeah...?
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Detective Mason. That's Detective Reed. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
john_locke No, of course not.
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?
john_locke No, I don't think so.
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Thin, brown hair, 20s?
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON If it will be helpful, we believe he was here in your apartment two days ago.
john_locke Oh! Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, he was a solicitor. I, I, uh, I, I sent him away.
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 million dollars. So I'm curious, what exactly was he selling you door-to-door?
john_locke Well, I... Look, I told you I don't know him, so...
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Then why was your name and address on a piece of paper in his pocket, Mr. Locke?
john_locke Why were y... would you be looking through his pockets?
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Because Peter Talbot's dead.
ben_linus It wasn't easy, you know. Being in that hatch with you all that time. Knowing you had no business walking around. Knowing I couldn't even ask you about it without telling you who I really was.
john_locke So ask me now. Now that I know who you really are.
ben_linus Was it immediate? It started the moment you got here?
john_locke Yeah.
ben_linus And you were just walking? The feeling returned right after the crash? That day?
john_locke That's what immediate means, Ben. You're wondering why it hasn't happened for you. You're not recovering as fast as you'd like. How long has it been since Jack fixed you? A week? Now that I think about it, how'd you get sick in the first place?
ben_linus Are you afraid it'll go away, John? Is that why you want to destroy the submarine? Because you know if you ever leave this island you'll be back in the chair?
john_locke You got anything to eat?
ryan_pryce Hey. Go on home, kid. You know you're not supposed to be here.
alex_rousseau My father sent me to get his pack.
ryan_pryce ... Why?
alex_rousseau I don't know, Ryan, but he told me to get it.
ryan_pryce All right. Here you go.
sayid_jarrah You're Alex, aren't you?
ryan_pryce Hey! Can it.
alex_rousseau How do you know my name?
sayid_jarrah Because you look like your mother.
alex_rousseau My mother is dead.
sayid_jarrah I'm sure that's what they told you.
ryan_pryce Get going, Alex.
ryan_pryce Keep your mouth shut.
john_locke Where do you get electricity?
ben_linus We have two giant hamsters running in a massive wheel at our secret underground lair...
john_locke Yeah, that's funny.
ben_linus There's leftovers in the refrigerator. Help yourself.
ben_linus I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.
john_locke Mmm. I never really appreciated chicken until right now.
ben_linus I know you think you need to do this, John, but if you blow up my submarine, I have a big problem with my people.
john_locke Is that supposed to be an incentive not to blow it up?
ben_linus I was born on this island. Not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.
john_locke So you're lying to them?
ben_linus No! They're here because they want to be here! Some of them are just not ready to make a full... commitment yet. But you, John ... You've already made that commitment.
ben_linus And now you have a choice. Because if you stop and if you think, I can show you things. Things I know you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand. Picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you, John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island, there's a very large box ... and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box, there it would be. What would you say about that, John?
john_locke I'd say I hope that box is big enough to imagine yourself up a new submarine.
ben_linus Why are you so angry, John?
john_locke Because you're cheating! You and your people. Communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you... you come and go as you please... you use electricity and running water and guns... You're a hypocrite! A pharisee. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place really was... you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator!
ben_linus You've been here 80 days, John. I've been here my entire life! So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?
john_locke Because you're in the wheelchair, and I'm not.
ben_linus Did you have any problems?
john_locke OK, here's how this is going to work. She's going to take me to the sub. Once we're there, I'll let her go.
ben_linus John, she's done enough. Let me take you.
john_locke I don't want you to slow me down. Come on. Let's go.
ben_linus John, before you go you should know—! Jack and I made a deal. In less than an hour he's leaving this island on that submarine, and it's a one-way ticket. The anomaly wiped out our communications. We have no way of contacting the outside world. Which means when that sub leaves, it can never come back. So whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go, the end result is the same. No one will find this island.
john_locke Let's go. Come on.
alex_rousseau You know he's manipulating you, right?
john_locke How's that?
alex_rousseau That's what my father does. He manipulates people. He makes you think it's your idea, but it's his.
john_locke I'll have to keep that in mind.
alex_rousseau The submarine is down there. At the end of the dock.
john_locke I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I know you don't owe me anything, but I need to ask you for one last favor.
ben_linus You don't knock?
dr_jack_shephard I need you to let my friends go. After I'm gone.
ben_linus And if I said no, would that stop you from leaving?
dr_jack_shephard Of course it would.
ben_linus Your friends are only here to rescue you, but you seem to be doing a good job of rescuing yourself, so... I suppose there's no reason to keep them here.
dr_jack_shephard Do I have your word on that?
ben_linus You have my word.
ben_linus I'll let them go, just as soon as you've left the island.
ben_linus Well, I guess this is it.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you, Ben, for keeping your promise.
ryan_pryce Hey! Hold it right there. Get your hands up! Get down! I said get down!
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing here, John?
john_locke I'm sorry, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry for what?
john_locke What did you do?
anthony_cooper John!
john_locke Tell me. Tell me you didn't do it!
anthony_cooper What are you talking about?
john_locke Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!
anthony_cooper What? You think I had something to do with Peter's death?!
john_locke I tell you to end things with his mother, and the next thing you know, he's dead!
anthony_cooper John, now calm down, please. Think about what you're saying. Why would I kill Peter?
john_locke He was on to you!
anthony_cooper John, I've been doing this for a long time. I'm not sweating some rich kid.
john_locke Then why are you still here?!
anthony_cooper What do you mean?
john_locke I tell you to leave, you tell me you're going to leave town! Why are you still here?!
anthony_cooper Now listen, John. I'll be honest with you. I didn't end it. I was looking for an angle. I wanted to make some money before I skipped out. But then all this happened.
anthony_cooper Peter died and everything just went straight into the tank. She's devastated. She's called off the wedding. There's no profit in it, John. I'm a con man, not a murderer.
john_locke She called off the wedding?
anthony_cooper She said she couldn't deal with it. She needs to be alone.
john_locke So if I were to call her, right now, that's what she would tell me?
anthony_cooper Phone's right over there, John.
john_locke What's her number—
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON Mr. Locke, we know this isn't what you want to hear, but your father's gone. We know he fled to Mexico shortly after your... encounter, then... he disappeared. I'm sorry, but he could be anywhere in the world right now.
kincaid All right detectives, that's enough. Mr. Locke has work to do today.
DETECTIVE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode13 MASON We'll let you know if anything develops.
kincaid John, John, John. We have got ourselves quite a day ahead of us, my friend. It's a fine time to get you up out of that bed.
john_locke No. I don't want to.
kincaid I don't remember asking.
kincaid Now. Most people struggle with this at first, but don't worry, you'll get used to it.
john_locke Uh, no, no, please, I, I, I can't do this—
kincaid John. You fell eight stories and survived, OK? I don't want to hear about what you can't do. Now let's go. It's going to be all right.
john_locke No, I don't, no, I don't think...
kincaid It's going to be fine, John. Come on.
john_locke I don't think I... think I can...
kincaid You're fine. Ah... there you go. There you go, buddy. See? Wasn't that bad, was it? I'll be right back, buddy.
ben_linus Well, John, you've really gone and done it now.
john_locke You don't have to pretend to be disappointed anymore. We both know you wanted it to happen. That's why you left the C-4 in Sayid's bag because you wanted me to make it happen.
ben_linus Uncuff him please, Richard.
richard_alpert You going to do anything stupid?
john_locke No, sir.
ben_linus Do you remember earlier, John, when you called me a cheater? When you said I didn't deserve to live on this island? Well get this There I was, shaking hands with Jack, and thinking I'd give almost anything to come up with a way to stop him from leaving... because to let him go would be a sign of weakness, of failure, of defeat. People would see that. They would know it. And that, John, would be the end of me. But to kill him... that would be cheating. Because my people also heard me make a promise, and to break my word... that would be the end of me too. And then you came striding out of the jungle, John, to make my dream come true.
john_locke You're not going to start talking about the magic box again, are you?
ben_linus No, John. I'm going to show you what came out of it.
ben_linus When I asked you earlier if it hurt when you suffered your injury, I think you misunderstood me. Seems fairly obvious that when a person's back smashes into a hard surface after being thrown from a building, that that's going to sting a little. But I really wasn't asking about the physical pain.
john_locke What, do you want to know if it hurt my feelings?
ben_linus No, John. I wanted to know what it felt like when your own father tried to kill you.
ben_linus He's the reason you destroyed the submarine, isn't he? You're afraid. You're afraid of him, and this is the one place he can never find you. This is the one place he can never get to.
john_locke What do you want from me?
ben_linus I don't know how it happened, but you seem to have some communion with this island, John, and that makes you very, very important. You have no idea what you're talking about, of course, but in time you'll have a better understanding of things. So what do I want? I want to help you, John.
john_locke Why?
ben_linus Because I'm in a wheelchair and you're not. Are you ready to see?
john_locke Dad?
