john_locke Charlie. Charlie. How about you and I go for a walk?
charlie_pace No. No thanks, Locke. I think I'm going to stay in today.
john_locke Come on. Fresh air will do you good.
kate_austen I take better pictures than that. Smaller, too, if you want something for your wallet.
dr_jack_shephard I just came by for a few things and this was. . . this was with my stuff. .
kate_austen So you're not staying?
dr_jack_shephard Call me a broken record, but caves are a natural shelter. And a hell of a safer than living here on the beach.
kate_austen You're mad at me.
dr_jack_shephard No. Kate, I'm -- I just don't understand why you won't come with me. Us. It's maybe a mile up there, if that.
kate_austen We crashed 8 days ago, Jack. I'm not setting up a house here.
dr_jack_shephard I want off this Island too, but we both know that's not gonna happen any time soon.
kate_austen Sayid has a plan.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, to find the source of the distress code, I know.
kate_austen The signal's coming from somewhere on the Island. If we can find it. . .
dr_jack_shephard The signal has been running on a loop for 16 years, Kate. And the woman that left it, she wasn't rescued. What makes you think it's gonna be any different for us?
kate_austen I believe it.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I wish I shared your faith.
james_ford Wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself.
kate_austen What do you want, Sawyer?
james_ford Heard the doctor was vacating the premises. Thought I'd best lay claims to my new digs before somebody else did . I could fix this place up real good. Might even find somebody to share it with me .
dr_jack_shephard I'll talk to you later.
charlie_pace Locke, is that you?
charlie_pace Bless me father, for I have sinned.
charlie_pace It's been a week since my last confession.
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 Go ahead my son.
charlie_pace Last night I had physical relations with a girl I didn't even know.
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 I see. Anything else?
charlie_pace Yeah. Uh, right after that I had relations with another girl. Then straight after that I watched while they had relations with each other. You see, it's, it's my band, father, Drive Shaft. We've been playing the clubs in Manchester. And, uh, we've been getting some heat, a following, you know, and, uh, the girls. There's some real temptations that come with the territory, if you know what I mean.
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 Well, we all have our temptations, but giving in to them, that's your choice. As we live our lives it's really nothing but a series of choices, isn't it?
charlie_pace Well, then, I've made my choice. I have to quit the band.
liam_pace And the meek shall inherit the earth.
charlie_pace Liam, what are doing? This is a church.
liam_pace Relax, choir boy. I bring good tidings of great joy. We've just been signed. A recording contract. You're gonna be a rock god.
john_locke Nice work, Charlie. You make excellent bait.
charlie_pace I'm glad I could oblige. Now give me my bloody drugs.
charlie_pace Did you hear what I said? I want my drugs back. I need 'em.
john_locke Yet you gave them to me. Hmm.
charlie_pace And I bloody well regret it. I'm sick, man. Can't you see that?
john_locke I think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie. And I'm going to prove it to you. I'll let you ask me for your drugs three times. The third time, I'm going to give them to you. Now, just so we're clear, this is one.
charlie_pace Why? Why? Why are you doing this? To torture me? Just get rid of them and have done with it?
john_locke If I did that you wouldn't have a choice, Charlie. And having choices, making decisions based on more than instinct, is the only thing that separates you from him .
sayid_jarrah Three antenna. Three points of a triangle. One here on the beach. Another, Kate will position in the jungle, roughly two kilometers in, and the third I'll take to high ground, up there. If the French transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation, I'll be able to locate the source. But there are two complications.
boone_carlyle Of course there are.
sayid_jarrah The power cells I grafted onto the antennas are dry. There's no telling how long they'll last. A minute -- maybe more, maybe less.
kate_austen So we have to wait until we're in position before we switch them on.
boone_carlyle Wait. Wait a second. How are we going to be able to tell that we're actually in the right position? We have no way to communicate with each other.
kate_austen Bottle rockets?
sayid_jarrah Thank God for fireworks smugglers. Now, when I'm in position I'll fire off my rocket. When you two see it, you fire yours. As soon as the last one has gone up we all switch on our antennas.
kate_austen Okay, but you said there are two complications.
sayid_jarrah The battery in the transceiver is dead. Without the transceiver all of this is for nothing. Something from a laptop computer would probably work, but I've not been able to find anything.
kate_austen I think I might know where to look.
kate_austen You're hoarding like a pack rat since the crash and you don't have a single laptop?
james_ford We are testy. Still upset about your little break up? You and Jacko?
kate_austen It must be exhausting.
james_ford What's that?
kate_austen Living like a parasite -- always taking, never giving.
james_ford Well, you got me pegged, don't you?
kate_austen I get it now. You don't want off this Island because there's nothing for you to go back for. Nobody you miss. And no one misses you.
james_ford Oh, you're feeling sorry for me.
kate_austen I don't feel sorry for you. I pity you.
james_ford All you had to do was say please.
hugo_reyes Dude, what's in these things, cinderblocks?
dr_jack_shephard I packed everything I thought might be useful here without leaving the others shorthanded.
charlie_pace Hey, you guys need a hand? . I used to load the band's equipment, before we had roadies, way back in the day. Here let me.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, the zipper's...
dr_jack_shephard ...broken.
charlie_pace Sorry, just trying to help.
dr_jack_shephard I know, I know, it's okay. Hey, want to help me grab the rest of those bags?
hugo_reyes Oh, could I?
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?
charlie_pace Oh, uh, I have a headache.
dr_jack_shephard Diazepam. That's for anxiety.
charlie_pace I was looking for aspirin.
dr_jack_shephard Pretty strong stuff for a headache.
charlie_pace Yeah, right.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, you okay? You're looking a little...
charlie_pace No, it's nothing, it's just a headache.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, leave it. Go get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated. Charlie, I got it. Go take care of yourself, man. We don't need you right now.
liam_pace Come on, Charlie boy. We can't do this without you. You are bloody Drive Shaft.
charlie_pace Watch the language.
liam_pace This is our shot at the big time. What? You don't want to be famous?
charlie_pace It's not about all that. I only care about the music.
liam_pace Yeah, your music. Your songs that got us signed. I'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them. And you want to take away my chance to be somebody?
charlie_pace Liam, it's not about you. It's -- I love the band. It's not who I am. Sometimes I just get lost in it.
liam_pace Won't happen -- because I'll be there looking out for you. We'll look out for each other. That's what brothers do, right? Right?
charlie_pace Wait, wait, wait wait wait. Just promise me one thing. If things get too crazy no matter what, if I say we're done, we walk away.
liam_pace We walk away.
charlie_pace Liam, promise.
liam_pace We walk away. You're the rock god baby brother.
sunhwa_kwon 손목을 의사에게 좀 보여줘야겠어요.
jinsoo_kwon 괜찮아. 나아지겠지. 옷이 그게 뭐야? 너무 야하잖아. 긴 거로 입어.
sunhwa_kwon 긴 건 너무 더워요.
hugo_reyes Hey, dude. This yours?
charlie_pace Oh yeah. You're probably wondering because I play bass in Drive Shaft. I wrote a bunch of tunes on that -- You, All, Everybody.
hugo_reyes Listen, uh, man. Jack just wants you to find another place for it. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way.
charlie_pace You know? A lot of people look up to me. They respect me. And you, you just treat me like I'm some bloody child! Like I'm some useless joke!
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about?
charlie_pace Charlie's not good enough to do this, Charlie's just in the way. Put Charlie onto that.
dr_jack_shephard Sit down. Let me take a look at you man.
charlie_pace Oh, you're going to look out for me, yeah?! We'll look out for each other, that's how it is?! I'm not interested!
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, just calm down, alright. You're not yourself.
charlie_pace You don't know me! I'm a bloody rock god!
hugo_reyes Oh, no.
hugo_reyes Charlie, where's Jack? Where's Jack?
hugo_reyes Jack, Jack can you hear me?
charlie_pace I don't know what happened. We were just talking and it -- and it came down on us -- all happened so fast.
hugo_reyes Dude, we gotta get help. Charlie, go down to the beach and get help.
charlie_pace Okay, I'm on it.
hugo_reyes And make sure you tell Kate!
kate_austen What we're doing -- chasing some phantom distress signal -- what are the odds of this working?
sayid_jarrah No worse than the odds of our surviving that plane crash.
kate_austen People survive plane crashes all the time.
sayid_jarrah Not like this one. The tail section broke off while we were still in the air. Our section cart wheeled through the jungle and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes. How do you explain that?
kate_austen Blind, dumb luck?
sayid_jarrah No one's that lucky. We shouldn't have survived.
kate_austen Sorry, Sayid, some things just happen, no rhyme, no reason.
charlie_pace Hey, hey, we need help.
michael_dawson What's wrong, man?
charlie_pace It's Jack, he's trapped.
boone_carlyle What?
charlie_pace A cave collapsed. We don't even know if he's alive. Come on, we've gotta go.
michael_dawson Hey, uh, uh, Scott?
steve_jenkins I'm Steve.
scott_jackson I'm Scott.
michael_dawson We've got an emergency, grab a couple of guys and let's go.
charlie_pace We've got to go now.
boone_carlyle Shannon, you have to be ready to do something really important, okay? At 5 o'clock sharp you have to be ready to turn that antenna on over there. There's a switch at the base.
shannon_rutherford Why?
boone_carlyle Because Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal. But the antenna's power's really weak so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets. Then you fire this one. Then you turn on the antenna. Got it?
shannon_rutherford The switch is where now?
boone_carlyle Did you hear a word I said? Can you or can't you do it?
shannon_rutherford Yeah, I can.
boone_carlyle Okay, okay.
charlie_pace Wait. Kate. Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
james_ford Sorry sport, you just missed her. Her and Mohammad headed into the woods about 10 minutes ago.
charlie_pace Which way?
james_ford Don't sweat it, amigo. I know which way they went.
charlie_pace Yeah, but-
james_ford I'll tell her. You just keep doing... whatever it is you do around here.
charlie_pace What the hell was that?
liam_pace That was another kick ass show. You were bloody brilliant.
charlie_pace I sing the chorus to You All Everybody.
liam_pace Oh yeah, sorry about that. . Got caught up in the moment. The crowd wanted it, you know.
charlie_pace Yeah, I know. If I start and then you come in after me...
liam_pace She's cool. Let her in. (to Charlie) I won't let it happen again. I promise. (Liam gets the groupie, pulls out some drugs and Charlie sees). Chill, baby brother.
michael_dawson Wait. Hey wait.
hugo_reyes Jack's in there.
michael_dawson Let me check it out before you start moving things around. If it's unstable...
hugo_reyes Well, how do you know-
michael_dawson 8 years of construction work. Hey Walt, get back, man, I don't want you near the rocks, okay, and take the dog with you.
walt_lloyd You guys need Mr. Locke.
hugo_reyes Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is.
michael_dawson Alright, this area here is load-bearing. We've got to dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in on itself. Here, we dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse. Four at a time, by hand, until we can find some kind of shovel. We take shifts, and go slow. Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks that we clear out and bring the water to whoever is working, okay. Let's move.
james_ford Hey.
kate_austen What the hell are you doing here?
james_ford Easy. Just came to tell you something.
kate_austen What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say?
james_ford Just came to tell you, you were right about me that I don't help anyone but myself. Well, here I am, ready to pitch in.
kate_austen You're here to help?
james_ford Hey, you act anymore surprised and I'm going to get offended.
john_locke Something wrong, Charlie?
charlie_pace Yeah, Jack. He's a -- there's been an accident at the caves. Jack's trapped in a cave-in.
john_locke Is anyone trying to get him out?
charlie_pace Yeah, there's a bunch of people there now.
john_locke Then why aren't you with them? You didn't come here to tell me about Jack, did you?
charlie_pace I want my stash, Locke. I can't stand feeling like this.
john_locke Come here. Let me show you something. . What do you suppose is in that cocoon, Charlie?
charlie_pace I don't know, a butterfly, I guess?
john_locke No, it's much more beautiful than that. That's a moth cocoon. It's ironic, butterflies get all the attention; but moths -- they spin silk, they're stronger, they're faster.
charlie_pace That's wonderful, but...
john_locke You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling. It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, I could help it, take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free. But it would be too weak to survive. The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it. Now this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back . Ask me again and it's yours.
michael_dawson Hey, we're through, we got a hole.
hugo_reyes Jack? Jack? Can you hear me, Jack? Come on dude, answer me.
hugo_reyes I hear him.
boone_carlyle He's alive.
hugo_reyes Jack, bro, you okay?
dr_jack_shephard I'm pinned. I can't move. I can't move.
hugo_reyes What do we do? How do we get him out?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie was with me.
hugo_reyes He's okay. He made it out.
michael_dawson Hey listen, Jack, we're going to get you out of there, okay?
sayid_jarrah We'll place the second antenna here. You want to help?
sayid_jarrah Attach this antenna up in that tree, as high up as you can.
james_ford Golly, thanks, boss. .
sayid_jarrah Five o'clock. Watch for my flare, then it's your turn. I don't trust him.
kate_austen Who does?
sayid_jarrah I don't trust him with you.
kate_austen I can handle him.
michael_dawson Okay, we can't safely make that tunnel any bigger, but since Jack can't get out, one of us is going to have to go in and un-pin him.
hugo_reyes What, crawl through that?
boone_carlyle I think we need someone smaller.
jinsoo_kwon 내 와이프가 당신들 때문에 위험에 빠지는 걸 볼 순 없어.
hugo_reyes Dude, we don't understand Chinese.
michael_dawson Korean, man. They're Korean.
charlie_pace I'll do it.
hugo_reyes Charlie?
michael_dawson No, man. Look, you're still too shook up. I might be able to squeeze through...
charlie_pace Hey, who's going to take care of your son if something happens. She's got a husband, he's got a sister. I'm alone here, no one on the Island. Let me do this.
james_ford Still ain't five, just like the last time you checked your watch.
kate_austen I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal. Remember, I'll fire the flare, you set off the antenna.
james_ford I just thank the good lord I've got you here to keep reminding me.
kate_austen It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
james_ford So what is it about that guy -- Jack. What it is about him makes you all weak in the loins.
kate_austen Do you try to be a pig, or does it just come naturally?
james_ford So, he's a doctor, right? Yeah, the ladies dig the doctors. Hell, give me a couple of band aids, a bottle of peroxide, I could run this Island too.
kate_austen You're actually comparing yourself to Jack?
james_ford The difference between us ain't that big, sweetheart. I guarantee you, if he had survived a few more weeks on this Island you'd have figured that out.
kate_austen What did you just say?
james_ford Ah, damn. Didn't I tell you? Word from the valley is Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in.
kate_austen What?
james_ford Look at the bright side, now you have someone else to pity.
michael_dawson Listen, man, go slow. Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you.
charlie_pace Anything else?
michael_dawson Yeah, good luck.
boone_carlyle Be safe man.
hugo_reyes Good luck, Charlie.
charlie_pace Alright, thanks guys.
liam_pace Everybody wants more, everybody wants to have a piece. All these people, they can't leave you alone when you're...
charlie_pace Bloody hell.
liam_pace Hey, baby brother, grab a bird and sit down.
charlie_pace Get out. You too, get out.
liam_pace Oh, I spilled on myself.
charlie_pace Out!
liam_pace Out?
charlie_pace Come on, now!
liam_pace Come back in five minutes.
charlie_pace Sound check, you missed sound check, you don't show up for rehearsal. We've got a show in an hour.
liam_pace Oooh, show. I like shows.
charlie_pace Alright, that's it. After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour.
liam_pace What?
charlie_pace We walk away.
liam_pace Are you off your head?
charlie_pace We're walking away like we said we would if things got...
liam_pace Walk away and go where?
charlie_pace Liam, you're killing yourself with this junk, you're destroying Drive Shaft!
liam_pace I am Drive Shaft! Nobody even knows who the sodding bass player is! This is it, Charlie -- end of the rainbow. You really think you can walk away? Then what, eh? Face it, if you're not in this band, what the bloody hell use are you?
charlie_pace Liam?
liam_pace Piss off!
michael_dawson Charlie? Charlie move! Charlie?
charlie_pace Hi. I'm... I'm here to rescue you.
hugo_reyes I say we try again.
boone_carlyle We can't just leave them.
hugo_reyes If we don't move, they're going to run out of air.
michael_dawson Would you stop talking, I'm trying to think.
kate_austen Where is he? Where is he?
michael_dawson Kate.
kate_austen Where is he? Where's Jack?
hugo_reyes He's in there.
kate_austen Does anyone know if he's alive? Is he alive?
michael_dawson We don't know. Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug, but it collapsed.
kate_austen Why is nobody digging?
charlie_pace Okay, one, two, three. . Sorry, Jack. Sorry. You alright?
dr_jack_shephard My shoulder's dislocated.
charlie_pace What?
dr_jack_shephard You're going to have to pop it back in.
charlie_pace No, I can't.
dr_jack_shephard I need your help on this, man.
charlie_pace I can't do it, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Yes you can. Yes you can.
charlie_pace Okay, what do I -- what do I do?
dr_jack_shephard Take my hand...
charlie_pace This hand? Okay, okay, wait, okay, okay .
dr_jack_shephard Now, when I tell you to, pull as hard as you possibly can.
charlie_pace Jack, I don't know, I don't, I don't...
dr_jack_shephard You can do this, Charlie.
charlie_pace Okay, okay, okay, okay.
dr_jack_shephard Now.
liam_pace Charlie? What are you doing here?
charlie_pace A bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while?
liam_pace Of course you can. Why didn't you call, you lunatic. . What are you doing in Sydney?
charlie_pace It's all lined up, Liam. 8 weeks on tour opening for some band called Meat Coat. First gig's in Los Angeles. LA, Liam. This is a chance to get back on a label, a real one.
charlie_pace This is our comeback.
liam_pace Charlie, I don't want to come back.
charlie_pace Yeah, right. Well, here's the thing. They won't book Drive Shaft without you. So I'm asking as a brother, the way you asked me.
liam_pace You were with me the night I missed Megan's birth. You were the one I was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a sodding fix. Oh man, you're still using, aren't you?
charlie_pace Don't change the subject.
liam_pace That's why you haven't been returning my calls.
charlie_pace Look, are you going to go on tour with us or not?
liam_pace You said you were going to get some help, man.
charlie_pace I lost your sodding number, okay?
liam_pace You're still a junkie.
charlie_pace You did this to me! It was about the music! The music, Liam. You took that away from me.
liam_pace Listen, why don't you stay with us for a few weeks. Karen and me, we can get you help. Sydney's got some really good programs.
charlie_pace Forget it.
liam_pace Don't go.
charlie_pace Thanks for your help, brother.
liam_pace Stay, please. I'm just looking out for you!
charlie_pace You never looked out for me! I have a plane to catch.
dr_jack_shephard How long has it been, Charlie?
charlie_pace I don't know what you're going on about.
dr_jack_shephard How long since your last fix?
charlie_pace Almost a day and a half.
dr_jack_shephard How's the withdrawal treating you? Any hallucinations?
charlie_pace Apart from the conversation I had with you about an hour ago in the jungle, no, not really.
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't you say anything? I could've helped you through this.
charlie_pace Yeah, you think I'm useless, and a junkie to boot.
dr_jack_shephard Useless? You're not useless. That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me. I won't forget that.
charlie_pace For the rest of our lives?
dr_jack_shephard At the rate we're using our oxygen in here, that won't be too long.
charlie_pace This place, it reminds me of confession, those little claustrophobic booths.
dr_jack_shephard I wouldn't have taken you for a religious man.
charlie_pace I used to be. Hey, you want to hear my confession? Might take a while.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, I'm no saint, either. What's wrong?
charlie_pace It's a moth.
dr_jack_shephard A what?
charlie_pace Right behind you, look. There's a bloody moth in here. Look.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, what are you doing?
michael_dawson Hey Kate, you need to take a break.
kate_austen I'm fine.
michael_dawson We've got enough people to dig. You keep going at this pace your going to kill yourself.
charlie_pace There's light.
dr_jack_shephard What?
charlie_pace I can see light.
walt_lloyd Hey, it's the doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Ow, easy, my shoulder, careful.
hugo_reyes How'd you get out?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, Charlie found a way out.
hugo_reyes Dude, you rock.
sayid_jarrah Alright everyone, now it's your turn.
shannon_rutherford We're in Malibu part of the year, but the guys there are such idiots.
.#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07
shannon_rutherford Dammit! Dammit, dammit, dammit. .
sayid_jarrah Come on, come on, one more. Come on Kate. Come on.
sayid_jarrah Yes. Yes. Where are you? Yes!!! Where are you? Where are you?
hugo_reyes Dude, you feeling okay? You look a little...
dr_jack_shephard Flu. He's got the flu.
hugo_reyes Oh man, that's rough after all you've been through. Take it easy, man.
charlie_pace I think I'm going to stretch my legs.
walt_lloyd This place is cool. Can we live here?
kate_austen Made you something.
dr_jack_shephard Awww. My very first sling.
kate_austen How's that?
dr_jack_shephard Good. Thank you.
kate_austen So these are the safe caves you've been going on about.
dr_jack_shephard This was a fluke. Michael checked out the integrity of the rest of the caves and gave them an okay. So you're heading back to the beach, huh?
kate_austen Sayid should be back there by now and if his plan worked then...
dr_jack_shephard Then we're one step closer to getting off this Island.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks for the sling, Kate.
kate_austen You're welcome.
charlie_pace Give them to me.
john_locke This is the third time. Are you sure you really want them?
charlie_pace I've made my choice.
john_locke I'm proud of you, Charlie. Always knew you could do it.
