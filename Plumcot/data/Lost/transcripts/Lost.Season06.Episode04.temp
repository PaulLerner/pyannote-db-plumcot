JOHN Oh, come on...
HELEN John?
HELEN Are you okay?
JOHN Yeah... I'm fine.
HELEN Come on, let's... let's get you inside.
JOHN Okay.
HELEN Well how long will that take?
HELEN The wedding is in October. Look, I'm just gonna have to call you back. Yeah.
HELEN I am so sick of caterers... and bands and... picking fabrics for chair backs. What do you say we just get my parents and your dad and do it shotgun style in Vegas?
JOHN No, you deserve better than that, Helen. We can do this. I know we can.
JOHN I like... this one.
HELEN That one?
JOHN I meant this one.
HELEN You are a very sweet man.
JOHN I know.
HELEN So? How was the conference?
JOHN Boring.
HELEN Who's uh... who's Dr. Jack Shephard?
JOHN Oh. I met him at lost luggage when I went to fill out the forms. He... he lost something too.
HELEN He's a spinal surgeon?
JOHN Yeah. Nice guy. He offered me a free consult.
HELEN You should call him.
JOHN Aw, he was just bein' polite, Helen.
HELEN So what? I mean... what are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon? I mean, who knows? Maybe it's destiny.
JOHN Maybe it is.
LOCKE Alright, Richard. Time to talk.
RANDY Welcome back, Colonel. Wow. You got a nice tan in Australia. Did you miss us?
JOHN Sure I did, Randy.
RANDY So? How was the conference, John?
JOHN It was okay. I didn't really learn anything.
RANDY No?
JOHN But um... I made some good contacts, though.
RANDY Really? That's interesting. See uh... Ken Fisher called and said you had to cancel your lunch with him.
JOHN Right, right... I was a little under the weather that day. Probably jet lag.
RANDY Really? 'Cause then the seminar people called and said you hadn't picked up your credentials. I did some checking... and it seems you didn't attend a single event. Since we sent you to Sydney on the company's dime... where the hell were you?
JOHN Look, Randy... I'm really sorry. Why don't we just call it my vacation week?
RANDY I thought you wanted that vacation week in October. You know, for your wedding.
JOHN Please, Randy... look, I know I shouldn't have lied. But where I was... it's personal. And I... and I really don't want to talk about it.
RANDY Okay, John. Hey... you're fired.
LOCKE Thirsty?
LOCKE Richard, I'm sorry I hit you in the throat and dragged you off the beach but I had to do something.
RICHARD What do you want?
LOCKE What I've always wanted. For you to come with me.
RICHARD Why do you look like John Locke?
LOCKE I knew he'd get me access to Jacob. Because John's a candidate. Or at least he was a candidate...
RICHARD What do you mean? What do you mean a candidate?
LOCKE Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
RICHARD Any of what?
LOCKE Oh, Richard... I'm sorry. You mean, you've been doing everything he told you all this time and he never said why?
LOCKE I would never have done that to you. I would never have kept you in the dark.
RICHARD And what would you have done?
LOCKE I would have treated you with respect. Come with me... and I promise I will tell you everything.
RICHARD No.
LOCKE Are you sure about that, Richard? Because people seldom get a second chance...
RICHARD I'm not going anywhere with you.
LOCKE Alright, I'll--
RICHARD What?
LOCKE I'll be seeing you, Richard. Sooner than you think.
BEN Am I interrupting?
ILANA Tell me what happened to them.
BEN Alright. But there's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me...
ILANA Try me.
BEN John Locke killed them.
ILANA All by himself?
BEN Yes. He turned into a pillar of black smoke and killed them right before my eyes.
ILANA Did he kill Jacob as well?
BEN Yes...
ILANA Then where's his body?
BEN Locke kicked him into the fire and he burned away.
BEN Locke... do you know why he carried Richard into the jungle?
ILANA He's recruiting.
LOCKE Hello, James.
SAWYER I thought you were dead.
LOCKE I am.
SAWYER Here's to being dead.
LOCKE You're taking this extremely well.
SAWYER Taking what extremely well?
LOCKE That I'm here.
SAWYER I don't give a damn if you're dead. Or time travellin' or... the ghost of Christmas past. All I care about is this whiskey. So bottoms up! Get the hell out of my house.
LOCKE This isn't your house, James.
SAWYER The hell it ain't...
LOCKE No. You just lived here for awhile. This was never your house.
SAWYER Who are you? 'Cause you sure as hell ain't John Locke.
LOCKE What makes you say that?
SAWYER 'Cause Locke was scared. Even when he was pretendin' he wasn't. But you? You ain't scared.
LOCKE What if I told you I was the person who could answer the most important question in the world?
SAWYER And what question is that?
LOCKE Why are you on this island?
SAWYER I'm on this island because my plane crashed. Because my raft blew up. Because the helicopter I was on was ridin' one too heavy.
LOCKE That's not why you're here. And if you come with me, I can prove it.
SAWYER Well, I guess I better put some pants on.
JOHN Okay! Okay!
JOHN Come on!
HURLEY Dude! Dude! What are you doin'?
JOHN What am I doin'? What the hell are you doin'? Did you ever park a car in your life? You're practically in my spot!
HURLEY I'm sorry...
JOHN Yeah...
HURLEY But... you know, there's a handicapped spot right over here.
JOHN Yeah? Yeah, okay... but I don't have to park there! I can park anywhere I want! You need to stay inside the lines!
HURLEY I'm really sorry. They were supposed to reserve a spot for me, so... you know, I just... parked here.
JOHN I haven't seen you before. Do you work here?
HURLEY Actually, I own the company.
HURLEY Hugo Reyes.
JOHN John Locke.
HURLEY Cool. What do you do here, John?
JOHN Actually... nothing. My boss just fired me.
HURLEY Oh? Who's your boss?
JOHN His name is Randy. But uh--
HURLEY Randy Nations?
JOHN Yeah.
HURLEY Yeah... that guy is a huge douche. Want me to talk to him for you?
JOHN No. That's okay...
HURLEY Tell you what, John. I own a temp agency too...
HURLEY Call this number and tell them that Hugo said to hook you up with a new job, pronto.
HURLEY And chin up. Things are gonna work out.
LAPIDUS He's gettin' pretty ripe!
ILANA Where is everybody?
SUN They left. They said they were going to the temple.
ILANA Right now, that's the safest place on the island. We should go there too.
SUN Are you alright?
ILANA I'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here!
SUN What makes you think that I'm going with you?
ILANA Because... you want to find Jin.
SUN What do you know about my husband?
ILANA I know that if he's on the island... and if he's alive... then he'll be at the temple. Let's get moving!
SUN What about John? We need to bury him.
LOCKE What were you doing alone in that house, James?
SAWYER Drinkin'.
LOCKE Where are the rest of your friends?
SAWYER Some temple somewhere...
LOCKE Why aren't you with 'em?
SAWYER You know what? How 'bout we just don't talk?
LOCKE You got it.
SAWYER Who the hell's that?
LOCKE You can see him?
SAWYER The kid? Hell yeah I can see him.
LOCKE Hey!
BOY You know the rules. You can't kill him.
LOCKE Don't tell me what I can't do...
LOCKE Don't tell me what I can't do!
SAWYER Locke! Locke! Look, whoever you are, you got about twenty seconds and then I'm outta here!
RICHARD Where is he?
SAWYER What the hell are you doin' here?
RICHARD Where is he?
SAWYER Locke? He ran off into the jungle after some kid.
RICHARD We need to go! Now!
SAWYER Go where?
RICHARD To the temple! Let's go! Let's go!
SAWYER You know what? I've been to the temple and I think I'm stickin' with Locke.
RICHARD That man is not John Locke!
SAWYER I know.
RICHARD Then why are you with him?
SAWYER Because he's got answers. He says he knows why I'm on this island. Unless you wanna tell me why I'm here, Richard...
RICHARD Don't be naive! He's not gonna tell you anthing, he's gonna kill you!
SAWYER If he wanted to kill me he could have done it a dozen times already...
RICHARD You don't understand what you're dealing with! He doesn't just want you dead, he wants everyone dead! Everyone you care about! All of 'em! And he won't stop--
LOCKE Who were you talking to?
SAWYER Nobody. You ever catch up to the kid?
LOCKE What kid?
SAWYER Right... let's get on with it, shall we?
LOCKE Yes, James. Let's get on with it.
WOMAN What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
JOHN Excuse me?
WOMAN What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
JOHN What uh... I don't know what that has to do with--
WOMAN Just say whatever comes to mind.
WOMAN Would you describe yourself as a people person?
JOHN May I speak to your supervisor?
WOMAN Of course. I'll go get her.
ROSE Good morning, mister... Locke?
JOHN Yeah.
ROSE I'm Rose Nadler, the office supervisor. What can I do for you?
JOHN Uh... what you can do, Mrs. Nadler, is spare me the questions about what kind of animal I am and hopefully place me in a job.
ROSE Absolutely. What kind of placement are you looking for?
JOHN Well, I see here that you have a listing for a site coordinator...
ROSE Construction site coordinator. Uh... I'm not sure that's a good match.
JOHN Well, if experience is the issue, I have--
ROSE Experience isn't the issue.
JOHN Look... Mr. Reyes told me if I came down here I would be taken care of.
ROSE And Mr. Reyes is my boss, so if he said that, I can make it happen for you. If you want to work construction, you got it.
JOHN Thank you.
ROSE I'm not finished. I will send you down there tomorrow and then, the day after, you will be back in my office. Look, Mr. Locke... let's try to be a little more realistic.
JOHN And what do you know about realistic?
ROSE I have cancer. Terminal cancer.
JOHN I'm sorry...
ROSE When the doctors first told me, I had a hard time accepting it. But eventually... I got past the denial part. And I got back to living whatever life I've got left. So, how about we find you a job you can do?
SAWYER Do you read?
LOCKE Excuse me?
SAWYER Books. Do you read books?
LOCKE Sure. Who doesn't?
SAWYER My favorite's Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men. You know that one?
LOCKE Nope. A little after my time...
SAWYER It's about these two guys, George and Lennie. Lennie's kinda slow... causin' George problems... so George walks him into the woods and tells him to look out yonder and picture the pretty little house they're gonna live in some day. Then he shoots Lennie in the back of the head.
LOCKE Well that doesn't sound like a happy ending.
SAWYER It ain't.
LOCKE What's on your mind, James?
SAWYER I'm wonderin' what would happen to you if I put a bullet in your head.
LOCKE Why don't we find out?
SAWYER What are you?
LOCKE What I am is trapped. And I've been trapped for so long that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before I was trapped, I was a man, James. Just like you.
SAWYER I'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
LOCKE You can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... to feel pain, anger, fear... to experience betrayal. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. So if you wanna shoot me, shoot me. But you're so close, James. It would be such a shame to turn back now.
BEN Why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?
ILANA Because the people there need to see the face of what they're up against.
BEN And whats to stop what they're up against from changing his face?
ILANA He can't; not anymore. Hes stuck this way.
ILANA Does anyone want to say anything?
ILANA Didn't any of you know him?
BEN Alright, I knew him. John Locke was a...a believer, he was a man of faith, he was... a much better man than I will ever be. And I'm very sorry I murdered him.
LAPIDUS Weirdest damn funeral I've ever been to.
WOMEN Hello, Dr. Shephard's office?
WOMAN Hello? Can I help you?
JOHN No, no you can't.
HELEN Who was that on the phone?
JOHN No one.
HELEN No one? John, I just heard you talking on the phone.
JOHN I was uh, I was calling Dr. Shephard.
HELEN Good for you. When are you going to see him?
JOHN I'm not going to see him.
HELEN Well, uh, I don't understand, why wouldn't you-
JOHN I got fired, Helen.
HELEN Coming!
MAN Ma'am, Oceanic courier. Delivering your lost luggage. Sign here to accept the delivery.
HELEN Thanks.
MAN Okay, thanks.
HELEN Okay, John. Talk to me. How did you get fired?
JOHN I lied to Randy, I didn't go to the conferences in Sydney.
HELEN What?
JOHN Open the case, Helen.
HELEN What are these for?
JOHN My walkabout.
HELEN Your, your what?
JOHN My walkabout. An adventure in the outback. Man against nature. But they wouldn't let me go. And I sat there yelling at them. Shouting at them that they couldn't tell me what I can't do. But they were right. I'm sick of imagining of what my life could be out of this chair, Helen. What it would be like to walk down the isle with you because its not gonna happen. So if you need me to see more doctors, have more consults, if you need me to get out of this chair, I don't blame you. But I don't want you to spend your life waiting for a miracle because there is no such thing.
HELEN There are miracles, John. And the only thing I was ever waiting for was you.
SAWYER Nice view. Now what?
LOCKE Now we go down.
SAWYER Down where?
LOCKE Down there.
SAWYER No offense, but you already died. So this is great that this isn't a big deal for you. But if you think I'm climbing down there first, your off your damn mind.
LOCKE It's no problem, I'll go first.
LOCKE Coming, James?!
LOCKE James!
SAWYER Locke!
LOCKE Hold on, come on. Come on, I got you, come on. Come on. Come on.
SAWYER What is this place?
SAWYER What the hell's that all about?
LOCKE Inside joke.
SAWYER So this is what you wanted me to see? A hole in the cliff; with some rocks on a scale; that's why I'm here?
LOCKE No.
LOCKE That's why you're here.
LOCKE That, James, is why you're all here.
JOHN Alright, speed it up, all the way. No cheating, come on now. Come on, all the way, you can catch up. Bring it in, bring it in, all the way. Good job. Good job.
JOHN Alright, everyone, please open your textbooks to chapter four. Today, we are going to talk about... the Human reproductive system.
JOHN Do you know where the- Excuse me, can you tell me where the teacher's lounge is?
KID Yeah, its over there.
JOHN Thank you.
MAN Alright, I know I sound like a broken record, but how many times do we have to go over this? If you have the last cup of coffee, you remove the filter and throw it away. Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.
JOHN Actually, I was just hoping for some Earl Grey.
BEN Tea? Now there's a gentleman drink. I don't believe we met.
BEN Ben Linus, European History.
JOHN John Locke, Substitute.
BEN Well, welcome.
SAWYER Who wrote all this?
LOCKE His name was Jacob.
SAWYER Was Jacob?
LOCKE He died yesterday.
SAWYER You don't seem to upset about it?
LOCKE I'm not.
SAWYER Why are all the names crossed out?
LOCKE There not all crossed out.
SAWYER "Shephard". That Jack Shephard?
LOCKE He's not the only one.
SAWYER Reyes. That's Hugo, right?
SAWYER What's the eight about?
LOCKE Jacob had a thing for numbers. Sixteen, Jarrah.
LOCKE Forty-Two, Kwon; I don't know if it's Sun or if it's Jin.
LOCKE Here, four, Locke. I think we both know him.
LOCKE Last but not least, number 15, Ford.
LOCKE That would be you.
SAWYER Why would he write my name on this wall? I never even met the guy.
LOCKE Oh no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.
LOCKE At some point in your life, James, probably when you were young and miserable and vulnerable. He came to you, he manipulated you, pulled your strings like you were a puppet. And as a result, choices you thought were made, were never really choices at all. He was pushing you, James. Pushing you... to the Island.
SAWYER Why the hell would he do that?
LOCKE Because, you're a candidate.
SAWYER Candidate for what?
LOCKE He thought he was the protector of this place. And you, James, have been nominated to take that job.
SAWYER And what does that mean?
LOCKE It means you have three choices. First, you can do nothing and see how all this plays out. And possibly, your name will get crossed out.
LOCKE Second option. You can accept the job. Become the new Jacob. And protect the Island.
SAWYER Protect it from what?
LOCKE From nothing, James. That's the joke, there is nothing to protect it from, its just a damn Island. And it will be perfectly fine without Jacob or you, or any of the other people; whose lives he wasted.
SAWYER You said there were three choices?
LOCKE The third choice, James, is that we just go. We just get the hell off this Island. We never look back.
SAWYER How do we do that?
LOCKE Together. So what do you say, James? Are you ready to go home?
SAWYER Hell yes.
