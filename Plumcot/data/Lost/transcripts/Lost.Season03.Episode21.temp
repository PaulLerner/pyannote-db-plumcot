CHARLIE Anyone want to venture a guess as to what Jack's going to be showing us out here in the middle of nowhere?
HURLEY I dunno. Stuff. Probably secret stuff.
CHARLIE Why does everything have to be such a secret? How about some openness for a change?
HURLEY We kept the parachute lady secret.
CHARLIE Ah, that's different.
CLAIRE Different how?
CHARLIE Well, because we weren't out there playing football with them—
CHARLIE What?
DESMOND Nothing.
CHARLIE Wait. You had one of your flashes again, didn't you?
DESMOND No, Charlie. I didn't.
JACK We're here.
JACK A couple of nights ago, Juliet came to me and she told me everything that Ben had sent her here to find out which of our women were pregnant...
KATE So what, you guys were doing tests on us?
JULIET No, but that's what he wanted me to do. I've been leaving tapes at the medical station. You all heard what he said; they're coming tomorrow. Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
SAYID While I appreciate your honesty, Jack, it doesn't explain why you brought us out here.
JACK DANIELLE!
JACK Show 'em.
JACK When Juliet told me they were coming, the first thing I thought was, "Where the hell are we gonna hide this time?" But hiding's pointless. They're just gonna keep coming back. So I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days she's been bringing dynamite back from the Black Rock. For the very first time we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it, and they have no idea that we're gonna be waiting for 'em. So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's gonna be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.
CHARLIE Oh, bloody hell!! Why are we even doing this?!
LIAM Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
CHARLIE Headlining? We're playing Clitheroe — the arse-end of nowhere.
LIAM A gig's a gig. We're building our fan base.
CHARLIE Will our fan base pay for a new sodding tire?
LIAM Only if we show up. So let's just get on with it, shall we?
CHARLIE You know what, Liam? You get on with it. I quit.
LIAM You giving up?
CHARLIE There's nothing to give up on! We're broke. The album's not selling. We're a bloody joke—
DRIVER Hey, shut it! Listen!
CHARLIE That's us. We're on the radio.
LIAM That we are.
CHARLIE We're on the bloody radio!
LIAM I told you, baby brother, we're gonna be bloody rock stars!
NAOMI Can I ask you something?
CHARLIE Yeah?
NAOMI Who are you people about to go to war with?
CHARLIE Now that's a long story. Wanna ask me something else?
NAOMI You having a laugh?
CHARLIE No, of course not. I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.
NAOMI You're from Manchester then?!
CHARLIE I am. My band got its start at the Night and Day bar on Oldham Street.
NAOMI What band?
CHARLIE Oh, we're called Drive Shaft.
NAOMI Yeah, yeah, I know you.
CHARLIE We had our moment in the sun—
NAOMI No, not that, the crash. You're the dead rock star. They made a big deal out of you when they found the plane — huge memorial service, new album.
CHARLIE There's a new album?
NAOMI Yeah. God, it was everywhere... a greatest hits thing.
NAOMI Hey, look on the bright side. You're not really dead, right?
CHARLIE Yeah, right.
ROUSSEAU We need more wire so we can trigger these from a safe distance.
JACK I can get some people to start stripping the plane wreckage.
ROUSSEAU Good. I should be able to finish rigging these tents in the next 24 hours. We'll be ready by tomorrow night.
SAYID We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
JACK Not now.
SAYID If you're angry I doubted you, I'll be happy to make a sincere apology later, but now we have a means of—
JACK Look I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid—
SAYID And I am trying to get us off this Island, Jack!
SAYID I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency. If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can go there, switch off your message, and call for help.
ROUSSEAU That signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it. What makes you think that you'll have better luck?
SAYID But Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore. I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they will hear us—
JULIET No, they won't.
SAYID And why is that?
JULIET We're jamming it.
JACK What?
JULIET Ben is using one of the DHARMA stations to block all of the signals off of the Island except for ours.
SAYID What station?
JULIET They call it the Looking Glass.
SAYID The Looking Glass.
JULIET Yes, but it's underwater. I have no idea where it is.
SAYID I believe I do.
CLAIRE Look, I know Jack thinks it's best, but, you know, what if they're coming for him again?
CHARLIE Claire, listen to me. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to protect Aaron. I promise. Everything is going to be fine.
DESMOND Er, sorry. Er, Charlie. Can you give me a hand with something?
CHARLIE Yeah, Desmond. Course.
CHARLIE So, you ready to tell me what you saw this morning?
DESMOND Aye.
CHARLIE Right. So how's it happen this time?
CHARLIE Come on, Des. You can tell me. I can take it.
DESMOND What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter. A helicopter that lifts off — leaves this Island.
CHARLIE Are you sure?
DESMOND Aye.
CHARLIE A rescue helicopter on this beach?
CHARLIE This Island — that's what you saw?
CHARLIE We're getting bloody rescued! I thought you were gonna tell me I was gonna die again!
DESMOND You are, Charlie.
CHARLIE Wait, what?
DESMOND If you don't, none of it will happen. There won't be any rescue. I'm sorry, brother, but this time — this time you have to die.
MR. PACE Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on, Charlie! Jump in. I'm gonna catch you boy!
CHARLIE No. You're just going to back away.
MR. PACE Don't be daft. Jump in.
CHARLIE No.
MR. PACE I promise, Charlie, I'm gonna catch ya.
LIAM No he won't.
MR. PACE Zip it, you! Don't listen to your brother. Just jump on in. There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. I'll catch ya, I promise.
CHARLIE I did it!
MR. PACE You've got it.
CHARLIE Seen it!
MR. PACE You're swimming, Charlie, you're swimming!
DESMOND What are you writing?
CHARLIE Nothing. All right, tell me.
DESMOND You sure you wanna know? I mean it might be easier if you jus—
CHARLIE Yeah. I want to know.
DESMOND You're inside a hatch. It's, er... a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch... light goes off... and then you drown.
CHARLIE When?
DESMOND I don't know.
CHARLIE You sure you saw Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter?
DESMOND Aye.
CHARLIE So, before I drown, I just have to flip a switch.
DESMOND That's right.
CHARLIE Where is it, then?
SAYID Now this is the Looking Glass. Its an underwater DHARMA station. Please, can you tell me anything you might know about this place?
JULIET I've never been down there. I don't know anyone who has.
JACK Why not?
JULIET There was some accident. Ben told us that the station was completely flooded.
JACK Well, if it's flooded then how does it still work?
SAYID How it still works is irrelevant. The question is, how do we get it to stop working, so we can use the satellite phone. The diagram shows that the Looking Glass is connected to the Island by a cable. I feel sure that this is the very same cable down the beach which runs into the ocean. So if we follow the cable, it should lead us to the station.
JACK So how are we gonna get in?
SAYID We swim in. There's a moon pool. A room with an open floor at the base of the station, big enough for a submarine to dock. Even if the station's flooded, I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it.
JACK What about swimming back out?
JACK No. No, I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission just to flip a switch.
SAYID But someone has to do it or we'll never leave this Island.
CHARLIE I'll do it. Swim down, turn off that bloody switch, swim back up. Piece of cake.
JACK Charlie, you don't even know what we're talking about.
CHARLIE I was junior swim champion in Northern England. I can hold my breath for four minutes. I know exactly what you're talking about, Jack.
JACK No. And there's no reason to do this now. We're going to focus on the Others, and then we'll deal with this.
SAYID Wait a minute. We have the chance to signal for a rescue.
JACK Look, for 90 days I've been asked to make decisions for this entire camp. There you go. I just made one.
BERNARD Rose, that's a sailor's hitch. It's not gonna hold. You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
ROSE Oh, so now you're knot expert.
BERNARD Well, trust me, it's, uh...
BERNARD How did you do that?
ROSE Watch and learn, dear. Watch and learn.
JIN 나한테는 언제 말해 줄 거야? 자기야, 제발. 테이프 들을 때 줄리엣이 우리 이름을 거론하던데. 모두 다 당신을 보고 있었어. 혹시 임신때문에 그런 거 아니야?
SUN 나 우리 애기 봤어요. 
JIN 뭐? 
SUN 줄리엣이 검사실에 데려갔는데, 그랬는데... 
JIN 그래, 괜찮대? 
SUN 응, 아주 건강하대요. 
HURLEY Hey!!! Look, there!!! Look!!
SAWYER Get off him, dammit, it's OK.
SAYID What?! He's one of them!
SAWYER I know, I know, it's OK. He was in the cage next to me. I know this guy. What the hell are you doing here, Karl?
KARL They're coming. My people.
SAWYER Sorry you came all this way for nothing, but we already know.
KARL Then why are you still here?
SAWYER Because when your people show up here tomorrow night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
KARL Tomorrow? No. No, they're coming tonight. They're coming right now!!!
ALEX Hey! When'd you get back?
BEN Just now.
ALEX Where's Locke?
BEN Here's your gun back.
RICHARD Ben, what's going on?
BEN Where's Ryan?
RICHARD He's at his tent, are you...
BEN It's time to get them.
RICHARD But you said tomorrow.
BEN Jacob wants it to happen now.
RICHARD Look, what happened out there--did John see...
BEN John had an accident. Ryan!
RYAN Yes sir.
BEN If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp?
RYAN Well, if I take my ten best, we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.
BEN Then you'd better get going.
RICHARD No, no, Ben, wait, moving at this schedule, Juliet may not be ready. What if she hasn't had time to...
BEN Then we'll take all their women. And we'll sort out the ones we need later.
RYAN And the men?
BEN If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em.
RYAN All right.
ALEX Karl. It's me.
KARL I thought you were bringing rabbit.
ALEX You have to go. Now.
KARL What? Did he find out I was out here?
ALEX No. But he's sending Pryce to their beach camp right now, you have to warn them.
KARL Warn them?
ALEX You have to go, now!
KARL I thought they were going to just take the pregnant women.
ALEX If you take the outrigger, you'll get there a few hours before them.
KARL Whoa, wait, Alex...
ALEX He's gonna kill them, Karl! Austen and Ford saved your life. You owe them. You better take this.
KARL If I get caught, your father's gonna kill me this time.
ALEX Is he my father?
ALEX Now go.
JACK Is that everything?
KARL Yeah.
JACK You trust him?
KARL You don't trust me? What about her!
KARL She's a spy. She's supposed to mark the tents of the pregnant women with white rocks so they can take them.
JULIET They know, Karl, but thanks.
HURLEY So what are we going to do?
SUN We have to leave now. Hide.
BERNARD Where? It's their Island; if they wanna kill us, they'll find us.
JACK The sun's gonna go down in a few hours. Do we have enough wire yet?
ROUSSEAU Not even close.
JACK We've gotta figure out a different way of setting the dynamite off.
SAYID We could shoot.
JACK We don't have enough guns. He said that ten of them are coming, armed.
SAYID Not the Others, the tents. We can camouflage the dynamite next to the tents. Target it from our positions at the tree line.
JACK Juliet marked three tents, that means we need three guns.
HURLEY Whoa!
KARL Here. You can have mine too.
ROUSSEAU I'll be your third.
JACK We'll take your gun, but you're not staying here. You're gonna lead everyone to the radio tower. Everyone.
CLAIRE Radio tower?!
JACK Now, if this doesn't work, we can't risk losing the chance of getting in contact with Naomi's boat, so everything has to happen at the same time. Charlie? You still up for a swim?
CHARLIE Yeah, I believe I am.
DESMOND I'll go with him.
JACK OK. We better get to it.
LIAM Ho ho ho. It's here, baby brother. Christmas is here. Oi, are these the birds from row two? Well done, mate. Well, as you have spent another year as the only drug-free rock star in the world, I'm gonna share a little known fact with you. Father Christmas lives just down the street from here.
CHARLIE Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
LIAM Indeed he does. And in case you haven't noticed, baby brother, Finland is the bloody North Pole. Therefore, a very special gift for you this year.
CHARLIE Liam, no. Mum gave you that. You're the first born. It was her father's and his father before that...
LIAM And it's a family heirloom, and that's why we named the band after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know. But Charlie--let's be honest--we both know I'm a sodding mess. But you, you're different. You're gonna get married, have a family, a baby. I'll be lucky if I hit thirty.
CHARLIE Don't say that, Li.
LIAM The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie. So please, take it. Mum would have wanted it this way. Pass it on to your little one someday. I need to know it's safe.
CHARLIE I'll hold on to it. But I won't take it. Hey, fits. Look at that.
LIAM Happy Christmas, baby brother.
CHARLIE You need some help?
CLAIRE Why didn't you tell me you were going to do this?
CHARLIE I didn't want you to worry.
CLAIRE Well, it's dangerous, isn't it? Swimming into some underwater station.
CHARLIE It's what needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, Claire. Now you've gotta promise me something. While I'm gone, don't worry about me.
CLAIRE 'K.
CHARLIE I'll take him.
CLAIRE Thanks.
CHARLIE Hey! All right turnip head, now you take care of your Mum while I'm away, OK? I love you.
CHARLIE See you soon.
CLAIRE Be careful Charlie, 'K?
CHARLIE Yeah.
CHARLIE Sorry, guys. Thanks, man.
WOMAN Hey, help me! Help! Help! Help!
CHARLIE OI!!!
WOMAN Help!
CHARLIE Oi! Get the hell away from her.
CHARLIE What are you doing? Leave her alone!
CHARLIE You OK, Miss?
NADIA Yes, I think so, yes.
CHARLIE Here you go. Pardon me while I have a heart attack. The last time I was in a fight I was eight years old. And I lost.
NADIA Well, that makes you even more of a hero, doesn't it?
CHARLIE I just did what anyone would do.
NADIA Three people walked by the alley.
CHARLIE What?
NADIA They saw me, but they just kept on going. You are a hero, sir. And don't let anyone ever tell you differently.
CHARLIE What's that?
DESMOND It's a weight belt. Should bring you down quicker than swimming. Well, every second counts.
CHARLIE So I just take it off when I hit bottom, swim up through the moon pool, into the station, swim into whichever room has the yellow blinking switch, flip it. Nothing to it.
DESMOND So how long can you really hold your breath for?
CHARLIE Does it matter?
BERNARD You want me to hit another one?
SAYID No, you've made your point.
ROSE Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting in Montgomery County.
BERNARD I know what I'm doing.
ROSE No, you don't. Pheasants don't shoot back.
BERNARD Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose. I just have to shoot a tent. And I'll be right behind ya.
ROSE Then I'm staying, too.
JACK No, you're not, Rose.
JACK Everyone's gathering down at the south end of the beach. No one's staying behind but the shooters.
ROSE Says who? You wanna give me your word that nothing's going to happen to my husband, then I go.
JACK I'll give you my word that if we don't kill everyone that shows up here in about an hour, it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.
ROSE I like you better since you got back, Jack. You're almost an optimist. Come on. If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes, let's get ya into something dark.
JACK You better get going. Rousseau says it's about a day's walk up to the radio tower.
SAYID I'm not taking them to the tower. You are.
JACK Excuse me?
SAYID You're not staying behind.
JACK This was my idea.
SAYID And I'm perfectly capable of executing it.
JACK I owe them!
SAYID What are you more concerned about, killing the Others, or getting our people off this Island? This afternoon you said you were our leader. It's time for you to act like one. Lead them to the radio tower, Jack. And then take us all home.
HURLEY Dudes, wait! I heard. I heard what you're doing. I wanna come with. Everyone — they're all going to the radio tower ... and I'm sick of trekking and, you know, explosions. I think I can help you guys out. I'm a really good paddler.
CHARLIE You can't go, Hurley.
HURLEY Why not?
CHARLIE Because... you're too big! You won't fit in the boat.
HURLEY That's uncool, man.
CHARLIE Wait, wait, wait!
HURLEY Dude, it's fine. I don't even wanna go on your stupid boat.
CHARLIE Catch up with you later. Just remember I love you, man.
HURLEY Yeah, whatever, love you too.
JACK You got water in there? Good, good. How about you, lot of water? Good.
KATE Hey.
JACK Hey.
KATE So here we go again, huh?
JACK Here we go again.
JULIET The tents are all marked. We're set.
JACK Sayid find the third shooter?
HURLEY Ready, Claire? Need a hand with the little guy?
CLAIRE Er, no, thanks. I'm OK. How's my little sweetheart? We're just going to go for a little walk, so hold onto Mum, OK?
DESMOND This is it. Ready?
CHARLIE Hiya. Do you want a blanket?
CLAIRE Oh, thanks. I got one.
CHARLIE Well, you're warming for two, take mine.
CLAIRE Thank you.
CHARLIE So, first plane crash?
CLAIRE What gave it away?
CHARLIE Ah, you can always spot the newbies. We're gonna be OK, you know.
CLAIRE Are we?
CHARLIE We're alive, we're on a beautiful Island. We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it, the helicopters will come and take us all home.
CLAIRE You really think they'll find us?
CHARLIE Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?
CLAIRE Thanks.
CHARLIE I'm Charlie.
CLAIRE I'm Claire. Nice to meet you, Charlie.
CHARLIE It's nice to meet you.
DESMOND We're here.
CHARLIE I want you to give this to Claire for me.
DESMOND What is it?
CHARLIE It's the five best moments of my... sorry excuse for a life. My greatest hits. You know, memories. They're all I've got.
DESMOND You don't have to do this Charlie.
CHARLIE What?
DESMOND I'll go.
CHARLIE No, you--your flashes.
DESMOND Maybe I keep seeing you die because I'm supposed to take your place.
CHARLIE What about your girl, Penny?
DESMOND What about your girl? Besides, I might be luckier than you. Keep your memories to yourself. I'll take it from here.
CHARLIE I don't know what to say.
DESMOND Well, you could tell me where the, er, weigh belt is.
CHARLIE Right there behind you.
CHARLIE You and I both know... you're not supposed to take my place, brother.
CHARLIE I'm alive. AH! I'm alive!!!!
