sunhwa_kwon Oh.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
sunhwa_kwon Good morning, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Need a hand?
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard You know, I came by your tent earlier. Has Jin gone?
sunhwa_kwon Oh. He went off with Charlie, Hurley and Desmond. Did you need him?
dr_jack_shephard Actually, I was looking for you, wanted to see how you were doing with your pregnancy.
sunhwa_kwon Oh, I'm doing fine. A little tired, but that's normal, right?
dr_jack_shephard Sure. Any morning sickness?
sunhwa_kwon Not anymore.
dr_jack_shephard Any bleeding?
sunhwa_kwon Why are you asking me all these questions, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I'm just checking in. I mean, now that I'm back, I just wanted to make sure that you were doing OK.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you. I'm OK.
dr_jack_shephard Great.
sunhwa_kwon 여보세요?
jinsoo_kwon 여보?
sunhwa_kwon 진수씨? 어우, 징그럽게... 벌써부터 무슨 여보야.
jinsoo_kwon 이제 유부녀인데 빨리 익숙해져야지.
sunhwa_kwon 자기야, 우리 집에 정말 잘 어울리는 침대보 샀어요.
jinsoo_kwon 당신이 좋다면 물론 나도 좋지. 나 지금 집이야, 점심시간에 잠깐 들렀어.
sunhwa_kwon 어, 그래? 집이 엉망이지?
jinsoo_kwon 박스가 장난이 아니네. 하지만 우리 잠자리만큼은 확실하게 끝냈지.
sunhwa_kwon 어우, 정말 내가 못살아!
jinsoo_kwon 나 다시 회사 들어가 봐야 돼. 일찍 들어갈게.
sunhwa_kwon 여보.
jinsoo_kwon 네, 여보?
sunhwa_kwon 정말 정말 사랑해요.
jinsoo_kwon 나도 사랑해.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 아가씨 맞지?
sunhwa_kwon 네, 맞아요.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 그렇구나, 축하해. 신랑이 아주 잘 생겼네.
sunhwa_kwon 제가 운이 좋았죠.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 정말 운이 좋았던 것 같아. 아가씨 아버님이 백자동차 백 회장님 맞지? 굉장한 부잣집 따님이시네.
sunhwa_kwon 전 아빠 사업엔 별 관심 없어요.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 신랑의 부모에 대해서는 아무 것도 적은 게 없잖아.
sunhwa_kwon 그 사람 부모님은 돌아가셨어요.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 그래?
sunhwa_kwon 누구시죠?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 잘못하면 신랑의 배경이 폭로가 될수 있잖아. 우리나라 제일의 권력의 딸이 하찮은 어부 자식과 결혼한다는 사실이 알려진다면...
sunhwa_kwon 상관 없어요. 전 이미 그 사람 아버님이 어부라는 것도 알고 있어요.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 그래? 그럼 몸 팔던 여자의 아들이라는 것도 알고 있어?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐라구요!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 3일 후에 5시에 여기서 보지. 나올 때 달러 10만 불 준비해 가지고 와. 정말 사랑한다면 내 요구 조건을 들어줘야 진실을 감출 수 있을 걸?
jinsoo_kwon Who is she?
desmond_hume I've no idea.
hugo_reyes She seems to know you, dude, she just said your name.
desmond_hume I've never seen her before in my life.
charlie_pace She's waking up.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo!
hugo_reyes She's trying to talk. We should get her some water.
desmond_hume Give me a hand.
charlie_pace Yeah.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo!
charlie_pace What's she saying?
desmond_hume Don't know.
hugo_reyes It's Spanish, dude.
desmond_hume Wait, you understand her then?
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo!
hugo_reyes She says she's dying.
desmond_hume Oh god!
charlie_pace It's a branch. She must have hit it on the way down.
desmond_hume Right, get her pack! We haven't got much in this first-aid kit. See if there's anything we can use in there.
hugo_reyes What if this is a rescue? What if she came for us? Wha... I mean, is she gonna be OK? We can't let her...
desmond_hume Just go and start looking!
jinsoo_kwon We get Jack. Jack.
charlie_pace We have to get her to Jack as soon as possible. She could be our way off the Island.
desmond_hume No, if we move her, it'll make it worse.
charlie_pace Well, we just let her bleed to death?
desmond_hume No, we... we need to bring Jack here.
charlie_pace It's an eight-hour walk, one way!
desmond_hume Then I'll run.
charlie_pace You out of your mind? It's not safe. It's gonna be dark soon, who knows who's out in this jungle. In case you haven't forgotten, there are people on this Island trying to kill us.
desmond_hume Nobody knows we're here!
hugo_reyes Oops.
jinsoo_kwon 짠! 당신 좋아하는 찌개 사왔어.
sunhwa_kwon 고마워요. 이 박스만 정리하구요.
jinsoo_kwon 그냥 두고 빨리 먹자. 그건 나중에 하면 되잖아.
sunhwa_kwon 이 사진, 저 쪽 테이블 위에 올려놓을까?
jinsoo_kwon 사모님이 알아서 하시죠.
jinsoo_kwon 내 평생 학사모를 써도 이렇게 섹시한 여자는 처음이야.
sunhwa_kwon 왜 당신 가족 사진은 하나도 없어요?
jinsoo_kwon 어, 내가 어렸을 때 우리 집에는 카메라가 없었어.
sunhwa_kwon 한 장도 없다구? 그래도... 아버님 유품이나 편지 한 장도 없다구?
jinsoo_kwon 아버진 내가 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨어.
sunhwa_kwon 당신이 16살 때 아버님이 돌아가셨다고 하지 않았어요?
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 소리야? 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨다니까?
sunhwa_kwon 아니 지난번에 당신이...
jinsoo_kwon 당신이 잘못 들었겠지! 근데 그건 왜 자꾸 묻는데?
sunhwa_kwon 그냥... 아니에요. 미안해요.
jinsoo_kwon 식기 전에 빨리 먹자.
sunhwa_kwon How's this?
kate_austen That's perfect. Thank you.
sunhwa_kwon What do you think happened to Jack? While he was with the Others. Since he's been back, he seems different.
kate_austen He says that he was pretty much a prisoner, and the only reason why he cooperated was 'cause he thought they'd let him off the Island.
sunhwa_kwon Do you believe him?
kate_austen Why wouldn't I?
sunhwa_kwon He came to me. Asking about my pregnancy.
kate_austen Well, what, would that have anything to do with—
sunhwa_kwon What if... What if the Others want my baby? He's been there alone for over a week. How do we know he isn't working with them?
kate_austen He's not working with them.
sunhwa_kwon Do you know something, Kate?
kate_austen It's Juliet. She was their doctor, their... their fertility doctor studying pregnant women, and... when Claire was sick, she told me and Jack... the reason the Others wanted her baby was for research.
kate_austen Sun, wait, you don't have to do this.
sunhwa_kwon Go away, Kate.
sunhwa_kwon I want to know about your research.
kate_austen Sun...
sunhwa_kwon What happens to pregnant women?
dr_juliet_burke You're pregnant? Are you sure? How do you know?
sunhwa_kwon I asked you a question — everyone else might be alright with you washing your clothes and eating our food, but I want to know what's going on. I want answers. What are you people doing? Why are you taking children? What happens to pregnant women on this Island? What happens to—
dr_juliet_burke They die. They all die.
kate_austen Sun, come on, let's go.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18
hugo_reyes What's she saying?
jinsoo_kwon Chinese. Not Korean.
charlie_pace Maybe we should just pull it out.
desmond_hume No, you'll just make it worse.
charlie_pace Have you forgotten what's at stake here? Or is this just another one of your flashes — whose getting an arrow in the neck this time?
desmond_hume Lest you forget, she said my bloody name! She had a photo of me and my girlfriend. Do I understand?! I understand better than the lot of you!
hugo_reyes Hey, guys, chill.
desmond_hume We've wasted enough time already.
charlie_pace You're not leaving us.
desmond_hume Just get out of my way, Charlie.
charlie_pace No.
desmond_hume Hey, Jin!
charlie_pace Jin!
desmond_hume Jin!
desmond_hume Who are you? I said, who are you?!
charlie_pace He's the guy who shot Sayid. Kate told us he lived out in that station Locke blew up. He's an Other.
hugo_reyes I thought Locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy.
desmond_hume You've got five seconds to talk, or I fire this gun brother.
mikhail_bakunin That's a flare gun.
desmond_hume And how do you think it'll feel? Taking a flare to the chest at this range.
mikhail_bakunin As your friend pointed out, I already died once this week.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18
desmond_hume You understand her.
mikhail_bakunin She's speaking Italian. She said she's dying, she needs help. I was a Soviet Army field medic, I can offer you my services.
charlie_pace Wait, what are you doing?
desmond_hume I'm saving her.
mikhail_bakunin This branch has punctured her lung. It's filling with blood. If it is not ventilated soon, she's going to die.
desmond_hume Well, do it. Help her.
mikhail_bakunin If I fix her, you must let me walk away as if I never came upon you.
desmond_hume What you need?
sunhwa_kwon 혹시, 권 선생님이세요?
woojung_paik KWON 그렇소만... 선 맞지?
sunhwa_kwon 감사합니다.
woojung_paik KWON 그래... 결혼식은 잘 치렀겠지?
sunhwa_kwon 네, 멋있었어요. 제 생애 가장 행복한 날이었거든요.
woojung_paik KWON 그래, 그건 그놈도 그랬을거다.
sunhwa_kwon 아버님. 왜 저희 결혼식에는 오시지 않으셨어요?
woojung_paik KWON 그놈이 나에 대해서 뭐라고 하던?
sunhwa_kwon 그 사람은... 아버님이 돌아가셨다고... 왜요?
woojung_paik KWON 자신의 과거가 부끄럽고 창피해서...
sunhwa_kwon 그래서 아버님은 진수 씨가 어렸을 때 어머니가 돌아가셨다고 말씀하신 거에요?
woojung_paik KWON 그 놈 애미... 그 여잔 남자가 많았어. 그 놈을 낳고 바로 떠나버려서 혼자서 내가 그 놈을 키웠어. 내가 그 놈의 애비인지도 확실치 않아. 그렇지만... 그 핏덩이를 누가 키우겠어?
woojung_paik KWON 아가야... 정말 이쁘구나. 내 아들이 사랑하는 여자를 만나게 되어 정말 기쁘구나. 진수에게는 날 만났다거나 지 애미가 살아있다는 말은 절대 하지 않았으면 한다. 절대로... 이 늙은이를 봐서라도, 이 사실로 그 녀석의 자존심이 다치지 않았으면 해.
dr_juliet_burke Be quiet. Don't move. You want me to help you and your baby, I have answers to your questions, but you have to come with me right now. Just you and me. Nobody else.
sunhwa_kwon If what you said was true, that means I'm already dead. Why should I go anywhere with you?
dr_juliet_burke Because there may be a hope for you yet.
sunhwa_kwon Where are we going?
dr_juliet_burke There's a medical station near here, they have an ultrasound machine.
sunhwa_kwon Claire and Kate told me about that place. It was abandoned, they found nothing there.
dr_juliet_burke Well, that's because they didn't know where to look.
sunhwa_kwon What are you going to do to me?
dr_juliet_burke I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the DOC. Erm, date of conception. The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant, give or take a day. If you got pregnant off the Island then you and your baby will probably be OK, but if you got pregnant here... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. When was the last time you and your husband had sex?
sunhwa_kwon I would rather not talk about that.
dr_juliet_burke Look, I know that it's personal, but if I know when, then I...
sunhwa_kwon Isn't that what the machine will do?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah.
sunhwa_kwon Then let's keep walking.
BUSINESSMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 위조된 운송 허가증을 저희가 아직 얻지 못했습니다, 회장님.
woojung_paik PAIK 한소 재단에서 우리 측에서 장비를 제공하지 않았다고 난리 났다는데?
paiks_secretary 회장님, 따님이 오셨습니다.
BUSINESSMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 1 축하합니다.
sunhwa_kwon 감사합니다.
BUSINESSMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 2 행복하게 사시길 바랍니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 갑자기 이 아빠를 찾아온 용건이 뭘까?
sunhwa_kwon 부탁이 있어요.
woojung_paik PAIK 우리 공주님, 무슨 부탁이 있으실까?
sunhwa_kwon 저... 저 필요한게... 저 10만 불이 필요해요.
woojung_paik PAIK 어디다 쓰려고?
sunhwa_kwon 그건 말씀드릴 수가 없어요.
woojung_paik PAIK 그렇다면 내가 무엇 때문에 너에게 그 돈을 줘야 하지?
sunhwa_kwon 전 지난 27년 동안... 아빠가 무슨 일을 하시는지도 알면서도 모른 척 해왔어요. 아빠 뜻에 어긋나는 행동을 한 적도, 생각해 본 적도 없어요. 더구나 싫은 내색은 한 번도 하지 않았구요. 저 앞으로도 계속 그럴 거에요, 물론 아빠가 제 부탁을 들어주신다는 조건 하에... 이유는 묻지 마세요.
woojung_paik PAIK 이유는 묻지 말라고? 이 세상이 니가 생각하는 것처럼 그렇게 호락호락한 줄 알아?
sunhwa_kwon 제가 사랑하는 사람의 자존심을 지키기 위해서에요.
woojung_paik PAIK 네 남편 때문에 그러는구만.
woojung_paik PAIK 그 놈 때문이라면 이 돈은 그 놈이 앞으로 갚아야 할 빚이야. 공장장 일은 그만두고 이제부터 내가 시키는 일만 하게 될거다.
mikhail_bakunin What else do you know about this woman? Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?
hugo_reyes Just a book, fancy radio phone thingy.
mikhail_bakunin Does it work?
hugo_reyes Like I'd tell you.
mikhail_bakunin One of you must help. The rest, clear the way, I need space.
desmond_hume I'll do it.
mikhail_bakunin Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.
mikhail_bakunin We need to evac the air now! Hold her steady. Steady!
desmond_hume Yeah, I heard ya!
desmond_hume Is that... normal?
mikhail_bakunin Gause! Desmond grabs some material and places it on the wound.] Tape it, be careful. Covering needs to be hollow, the wound needs to breathe.
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 Eu não estou só... Eu não estou só.
desmond_hume What did she say?
mikhail_bakunin Thank you. She said thank you for helping me.
dr_juliet_burke It's right down here.
sunhwa_kwon Why are you doing this?
dr_juliet_burke What?
sunhwa_kwon Helping me.
dr_juliet_burke Once upon a time, I told women that they were pregnant, and their faces... it was the best news they ever got in their entire life. Then I came here. I've lost... nine patients in the last three years. I'm helping you because I want to tell you that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here. I'm helping you because I wanna give good news again.
sunhwa_kwon I slept with another man.
dr_juliet_burke Oh.
sunhwa_kwon Before we got to the Island. Jin and I, we were having trouble, we weren't... And I had a friend. It was a mistake.
dr_juliet_burke We all make mistakes.
sunhwa_kwon Which way?
dr_juliet_burke Will you help me move this forward?
dr_juliet_burke OK.
sunhwa_kwon Why is this room hidden?
dr_juliet_burke Don't worry about it.
sunhwa_kwon What is this place? Tell me.
dr_juliet_burke It's where we brought the women to die.
mikhail_bakunin She's fine. Keep the wound as clean as you can, she should be better in a day.
charlie_pace A day? Her lung was punctured.
mikhail_bakunin On this Island, the wounds are a bit different. Maybe a day and a half. I did as I promised. She will live.
charlie_pace You can't seriously be considering letting him go.
desmond_hume Just go.
charlie_pace Are you kidding? He's one of them!
desmond_hume So what would you have me do Charlie? We gotta make a stretcher and carry her. How we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?
charlie_pace We need some rope, I'll take responsibility.
jinsoo_kwon Phone. Phone!
desmond_hume No, Jin.
jinsoo_kwon Phone.
desmond_hume Jin, it's all right!
charlie_pace No, let him, Desmond!
desmond_hume Jin! Come back here!
charlie_pace Oi! Let him!
desmond_hume Jin, it's all right, Jin!
desmond_hume Jin, let him go! Jin, let go!
jinsoo_kwon Phone!
charlie_pace You stole this.
mikhail_bakunin How could you respect me if I didn't try?
charlie_pace How about I take your other eye? Would you respect that?
mikhail_bakunin Sorry, what?
desmond_hume Charlie, don't, Charlie!
charlie_pace No!
desmond_hume Charlie, let him go!
charlie_pace This is a mistake! We can't keep letting these people go!
desmond_hume We gave him our word! Go on, get out of here.
sunhwa_kwon The baby isn't Jin's. We tried to have a baby back in Korea and couldn't. And the doctor... he told me Jin was infertile.
dr_juliet_burke And then you came here.
sunhwa_kwon What?
dr_juliet_burke Did you know that the average male sperm count is between sixty and eighty million? But on the Island, it's five times that. We call that good odds. You ready?
sunhwa_kwon Yes.
dr_juliet_burke OK, now lift your shirt up a little. It's cold.
sunhwa_kwon Will I see the baby?
dr_juliet_burke Maybe, it's your first trimester, so it's a little iffy. If you don't see a heartbeat, don't worry about it, it's just early.
sunhwa_kwon How does it work?
dr_juliet_burke Well, I take a measurement of the foetus, and that will tell us when your baby was conceived, and then we'll know who. You OK?
sunhwa_kwon I lose either way. If I'm going to live, that means the baby's not Jin's.
dr_juliet_burke Do you still want to do this?
sunhwa_kwon Yes.
dr_juliet_burke OK, moment of truth.
jinsoo_kwon 여보?
sunhwa_kwon 여보?
jinsoo_kwon 오늘 회사에 왔다면서? 왜 나한테는 들르지 않았어?
sunhwa_kwon 당신이 바쁠 것 같아서요.
jinsoo_kwon 아무리 바빠도 당신 볼 시간은 있지.
sunhwa_kwon 다음엔 꼭 들를게요.
jinsoo_kwon 우편물 온거 없어?
sunhwa_kwon 아, 미안. 깜빡했네.
jinsoo_kwon 열쇠는 어디 있어?
sunhwa_kwon 거실에 있는 내 가방 안에요.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨! 잠깐만요!
jinsoo_kwon 이거 무슨 돈이야?
sunhwa_kwon 그거... 아빠가 주신 거에요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐 때문에?
sunhwa_kwon 가구도 사야 되구... 우리 신혼여행도 가야 되잖아.
jinsoo_kwon 그 정도는 내가 할 수 있잖아. 신혼여행... 가구 같은 거는 시간이 좀 걸리겠지만 열심히 일해서 내가 다 해줄게. 무슨 일이 있어도 당신은 내가 책임질거야.
sunhwa_kwon 알아요.
jinsoo_kwon 드려. 그렇지 않아도 아버님에게 너무 많은 신세를 졌는데, 더 이상 그러고 싶지 않아. 부탁해.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨... 사랑해요.
jinsoo_kwon 정말?
sunhwa_kwon 정말.
dr_juliet_burke There it is. There's your baby. Can you see?
sunhwa_kwon I can see it. Is it a boy or a girl?
dr_juliet_burke Oh, it's... it's a little early. But, um, do you see that little flutter? That's the heart beating. It's very strong, it's very healthy. OK, you crashed here ninety days ago. The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago, so around fifty-three days. You got pregnant on the Island.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry, I am so sorry Sun. I will do everything that I can...
sunhwa_kwon It's Jin's!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 난 안 나타나는 줄 알았어.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨 어머니라고 왜 말씀하지 않으셨어요?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 낳기만 했지 내가 그 놈 애미라고 말할 순 없잖아.
sunhwa_kwon 저희 집이 어떤 집안이라는 거 잘 알고 계시죠? 내 남편은 당신이 죽은 걸로 알고 있어. 다음엔 당신에게 무슨 일이 일어날지 나도 장담 못해.
sunhwa_kwon So how long do I have?
dr_juliet_burke Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester, nobody made it to their third.
sunhwa_kwon That gives me two months. I am... very happy the baby's Jin's. You gave me good news, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke It was my pleasure, Sun. I'm gonna go back inside and make sure that I didn't miss anything. I don't wanna take the chance that we didn't cover our tracks. Do you wanna wait out here?
sunhwa_kwon All right. Juliet. Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Ben, it's six AM on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with husband. He was sterile before they got here. I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
dr_juliet_burke I hate you.
charlie_pace You can't trust 'em, you know.
desmond_hume What's that?
charlie_pace The Others. The one you let go. He'll be back tomorrow with five of his mates. Should have killed him.
jinsoo_kwon Charlie. Tight.
charlie_pace Oh, OK.
desmond_hume You know brother, by my count, you've killed more of them than they've killed of you.
charlie_pace They started it. You know, just 'cause one comes traipsing back with Jack and Kate doesn't mean that we can trust 'em now.
hugo_reyes Mom?
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 Where am I?
hugo_reyes Take it easy, you just had a giant branch...
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 Where am I?!
hugo_reyes I dunno. You're on an Island. Are you here to rescue us? Are there more of you? Can you make your phone work?
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 Who are you?
hugo_reyes Hugo Reyes. I crashed here on Oceanic Flight 815. A bunch of us survived. Is that why you're here? Were you looking for us?
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 815? Flight 815? The one from Sydney?
hugo_reyes Yeah!
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 No, that's not possible.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy, but we found food, and a hatch...
PARACHUTIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode18 No. No, Flight 815 they, they found the plane. There were no survivors. They were all dead.
hugo_reyes What?!
