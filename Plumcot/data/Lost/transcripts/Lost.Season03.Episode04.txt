desmond_hume You've, um, you've got a problem with your roof.
claire_littleton What?
desmond_hume Look, maybe you should move down the beach, just for tonight. That way I can fix it -- make some improvements.
claire_littleton That's really nice of you to offer, but, um, Aaron just feel asleep so I should just...
desmond_hume No, it'll be worth it. I promise.
charlie_pace Whatcha doing, brother?
desmond_hume I was just offering to fix this roof here.
charlie_pace Fine. If there's a problem I'll fix it. I'm quite handy. I was building a church before Eko exploded.
desmond_hume Right, well, just trying to help, huh.
claire_littleton Thanks. What was all that about?
charlie_pace I don't know. We're going to have to get that guy another button to push.
dr_juliet_burke How are you doing today, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Great.
dr_juliet_burke You seem frustrated.
dr_jack_shephard Am I going to keep watching cartoons or are you going to tell me why I'm here?
dr_juliet_burke I hope you like blueberry. If not, I can...
dr_jack_shephard Should I talk to Benjamin?
dr_juliet_burke Sorry?
dr_jack_shephard Should I talk to Benjamin? Because I'm starting to think that you're just the person who brings me my food.
dr_juliet_burke You can talk to him all you want. But he won't tell you anything.
dr_jack_shephard You work for him?
dr_juliet_burke No, I don't work for him.
dr_jack_shephard He's in charge?
dr_juliet_burke Well, it doesn't work that way over here, Jack. We make decisions together.
dr_jack_shephard Really? Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck he seemed happy to just let you die. I mean, it felt like he made that decision on his own.
dr_juliet_burke You don't know what you're talking about. I don't answer to him.
ben_linus Juliet, I need you.
dr_juliet_burke Can it wait?
ben_linus The sub is back. We have a situation, so come with me now.
danny_pickett Time for work.
james_ford Sound a little stuffy there, Chinatown. You need to blow your nose?
danny_pickett Just give me an excuse.
james_ford I thought I just did. What do I got to do -- talk about your mother?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 Danny, are you there?
danny_pickett Yeah?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04
danny_pickett Hold on. Okay, go.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04
danny_pickett What? Where are they?
tom_friendly She's hurt bad, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke Keep her steady.
danny_pickett She's going to be fine, right? She's going to be okay?
kate_austen What happened?
james_ford We happened.
kate_austen What?
james_ford Been on this rock long enough to realize they ain't in the business of shooting each other. We did it. Our team.
kate_austen You smiling?
james_ford Damn right I'm smiling. 'Cause we just got our ticket outta here.
kate_austen What are you doing? Whenever you're ready to fill me in.
james_ford Shush up, I'm thinking.
james_ford You know that chick they brought in on the stretcher -- that's broken nose man's girl.
kate_austen They call him Pickett.
james_ford Well, Pickett is distracted at the moment.
kate_austen So?
james_ford Watch and learn, little lady. There's juice pumping into this box from somewhere. Next time someone comes to pull me out, I'm going to wait until they step in my little swimming hole, then I grab 'em. Zap! They fall back from the shock -- I snag the keys. Bet the bears never thought of that.
kate_austen You're both going to get electrocuted.
james_ford Yeah, but I felt the jolt. I can take it. The other guy -- he ain't going to be ready for it. What, you think I'm crazy?
kate_austen No, I'm actually impressed.
james_ford Well, wipe the stars out of eyes, sweetheart -- 'cause we're going to do this.
kate_austen So, what about Jack?
james_ford What about him? We don't even know if he's here. Hell, we don't even know if he's alive. We gotta take care of us. It's every man for himself, Freckles.
GUARD#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 Alright, Ford. That's enough.
PRISON#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOUGH The problem is I was following your hands, not your eyes.
james_ford The problem is you old and dumb.
james_ford Who's the punching bag?
PRISON#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOUGH Just got here -- name's Munson. Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil, but they never found the money.
james_ford I'll be damned.
PRISON#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOUGH If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights, Munson would be a dead man.
james_ford That son of a bitch.
james_ford You get little mints on your pillow at night, too?
munson Sorry?
james_ford You're here, what, a week? And you're on tote bag duty? I've been here 9 months; I'm still pushing trash.
munson What does that mean?
james_ford You think the warden's breaking up those fights because you're cute, Costanza? He's making a play for that 10 mil. First step -- butter you up, give you a plum job. Step two -- warden will reach out to your wife -- use her against you. Textbook con.
munson And you're telling me this out of the kindness of your...
james_ford Advice is free, Murgatroyd. Last 9 months that warden's made my life a living hell. He gets that 10 mil you ain't got? I might just have to kill myself.
warden_harris HARRIS Hey.
james_ford Well, howdy, warden.
warden_harris HARRIS He bothering you, Munson?
james_ford So what brings you to the sewing shop, Boss?
warden_harris HARRIS Don't think I can't extend your stay, Ford. All it takes is one call. One call. How about you get that trash?
james_ford Oh, yeah, the big kahuna.
james_ford Lunch already?
ben_linus What do you weigh?
james_ford What?
ben_linus What do you weigh?
james_ford 180, give or take.
ben_linus How old are you?
james_ford 32.
ben_linus Don't lie.
james_ford 35.
ben_linus Good.
james_ford Sayonora, sucker.
james_ford What did you do?
ben_linus We turned it off.
kate_austen Sawyer!
kate_austen Hey!
tom_friendly 2 days since the sky turned purple. We've been blind. Our comms are all down -- I can't get them back up again. And in case you forgot, Colleen's in critical...
ben_linus Juliet's taking care of her.
james_ford Where am I? What the hell are you doing to me? Let me up!
ben_linus Jason.
james_ford Let me up!
jason Bite down on this please.
james_ford You bite down on it.
ben_linus It's for the pain.
james_ford What?!! Wait! Let me up! No!
ben_linus God, I hate needles.
james_ford No! What are you doing?!
jason No, you have to go through the sternum -- the sternum, like in the movie.
matthew I know. I know.
james_ford No!!!
matthew 1, 2...
desmond_hume Don't mind me, brother. I'm just going to take one of your clubs. Hurley said it would be alright.
paulo Hurley, huh? Does this mean you're off to save the day?
desmond_hume So, uh, I can take one of these?
paulo Take the five iron; I never use it. That way when you die in the jungle, doing whatever you're doing, I don't have to go looking for it.
desmond_hume Thanks, mate. You know, you might want to square your shoulders a bit more.
paulo You play golf?
desmond_hume I'm Scottish. Cheers.
james_ford What the hell?
ben_linus Shhh.
ben_linus Hey. Hey, come on. Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on.
james_ford What are you doing?
ben_linus Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop.
james_ford Come on, what are you doing?
ben_linus Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it.
james_ford What's your problem?
ben_linus Come on, come on, come on.
james_ford Did you just kill that bunny?
ben_linus You know what a pacemaker is?
james_ford What?
ben_linus They stick them in the tickers of people who've had by-pass work whose hearts need just a little jump -- a kickstart. The rabbit had a small pacemaker set to deliver its kickstart should it get too excited, or anxious, or frightened -- or should it try to escape. Assuming you were telling the truth about your age and weight your resting heart rate should be about 70 beats per minute. Your active heart rate, however, that would be about 140 -- which is the point at which your pacemaker will cause your heart to explode. Which is how I know that you're going to start behaving now. The watch monitors your pulse. If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps, you're going to want to relax yourself. Do some deep breathing, some yoga.
james_ford If you want me dead, why don't you just shoot me and get it over with?
ben_linus Because we're not killers, James. Oh, and one other thing -- Kate...
james_ford You touch her, I swear...
ben_linus You tell her what we did, what we put in you -- that we're watching you -- you tell her any of these things -- we'll put one in her, too.
kate_austen Sawyer? Sawyer, are you okay?
tom_friendly That's so you can clean yourselves up. And Kate, if any of that doesn't fit, just give me a holler, okay?
kate_austen What happened? What did they do to you?
james_ford Nothing, they just asked me questions. It ain't important.
kate_austen Talk to me. What happened?
james_ford Look, I told you. Nothing happened. So quit asking.
kate_austen Turn around.
kate_austen What's that?
james_ford It's just my watch. It's busted.
kate_austen When did you get a watch?
james_ford Look, I don't tell you everything! Just leave me alone, damn it. Put some clothes on.
cassidy_phillips Hello, Sawyer.
james_ford It's James Ford. And I know you know that because you got it right when you pressed charges.
cassidy_phillips You're mad at me?
james_ford Well, look where I am.
cassidy_phillips What did you want me to do? You conned me.
james_ford Something you want?
cassidy_phillips Yeah. Yeah, there is.
james_ford Come on, I got license plates to make.
james_ford What's this?
cassidy_phillips This is your daughter.
james_ford What do you want?
cassidy_phillips Well, first I wanted you to know.
james_ford Then what? You think I'm going to take one look at this picture and turn into Father Knows Best?
cassidy_phillips We're living in this little place in Albuquerque. It's near the University...
james_ford Why are you telling me this?
cassidy_phillips I just thought you could write her a letter. Her name's Clementine.
james_ford What the hell am I going to write, "Dear Goo-goo, Ga-ga?" She's a baby. She ain't mine.
cassidy_phillips Sawyer, she is...
james_ford I ain't got no daughter.
kate_austen I've been checking out my cage and I think if I climb to the top I can squeeze through those bars. They're spaced farther apart up there.
james_ford Don't bother.
kate_austen What are you talking about?
james_ford I'm talking about being smart. I think we should chill out here a while -- get the lay of the land.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 Under control...
ANOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE Yeah?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode04 ... it was a mistake bringing those two here.
dr_jack_shephard What did you do to Sawyer?
dr_juliet_burke Nothing.
dr_jack_shephard I heard him yelling. You've got blood on your clothes.
dr_juliet_burke Jack. Jack!
dr_jack_shephard What did you do to him?!
dr_juliet_burke It's not his blood.
dr_jack_shephard Then whose blood is it?
dr_juliet_burke It's the blood of a woman who's dying. Jack, I, I need your help.
kate_austen It's Jack. Jack!
james_ford Doc!
kate_austen Jack!
james_ford Doc! Doc!
kate_austen Jack! Jack!!
ben_linus Have you lost your mind? You bring him here?
dr_juliet_burke He's a doctor. He can help.
ben_linus Well, this is not why...
dr_juliet_burke Do you want her to die? Come on.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
dr_juliet_burke Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
dr_juliet_burke Those aren't hers. Come on.
danny_pickett What's he doing in here?
dr_juliet_burke Danny, he's here to help.
danny_pickett Tell him who did this. He ought to know that.
dr_juliet_burke Danny.
dr_jack_shephard I need him out of here.
dr_juliet_burke Danny, get out.
tom_friendly Come on, Danny. Let's go.
dr_juliet_burke Go.
danny_pickett No way; she's my wife.
tom_friendly Danny, they got it.
dr_juliet_burke I got the bullet out, but she's still bleeding.
dr_jack_shephard Right upper quadrant; it's swelling badly.
dr_juliet_burke No, I padded it.
dr_jack_shephard I need you to clamp under the liver so I can get a look back there.
dr_juliet_burke I'm not a surgeon.
dr_jack_shephard I know. But I need you to do this.
dr_juliet_burke Here.
dr_jack_shephard She's got a retro-hepatic caval bleed. It's behind the liver, that's why you missed it. I need lap pads -- as many as you got. Alright, another one.
dr_jack_shephard The crash cart, now. Juliet, I need paddles.
dr_juliet_burke It's broken. We've had... Jack, we haven't had anything happen before. We didn't -- we have -- I don't...
dr_jack_shephard Time of death ... she's gone.
danny_pickett They did this! They did this!
tom_friendly Danny, wait. Danny, wait, no.
james_ford Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Hoss. Take it easy. Take it easy!
danny_pickett Shut up!! Do you love this guy?
kate_austen What?
danny_pickett I said do you love him?!!
kate_austen Stop!
danny_pickett Do you love him?! Do you love him?!!
kate_austen Leave him alone!!
danny_pickett Do you love him?!
kate_austen What are you doing? Stop!!
danny_pickett Do you love him !
kate_austen Yes! I love him!! I love him!! Please.
danny_pickett Lock him up!
munson I need to talk to you.
james_ford Sorry, I'm busy.
munson It's important. Please.
munson You were right. I loved her. I thought she -- I really thought she...
james_ford 10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, Killer -- tends to change things. That's why you never get attached -- because once you care, that's when they can come at you.
munson What did your's want? I saw you the other day with a woman. What did she want?
james_ford Something I ain't got. That all? You had yourself a good cry? You mind if I go back and see if George gets his farm?
munson I need you to move it. The money.
james_ford The money you didn't steal?
munson We both know I did. Lila's hired a PI. She's going to find it. Do this for me. You have to.
james_ford No. It's too dangerous. I'll be a walking target.
munson If you don't help me the warden will get it all. He'll win. Please. Please.
kate_austen Are you okay?
james_ford Dandy. Guy hits like a girl. No offense.
kate_austen Why did he do that?
james_ford Hell if I know. These people ever make any sense to you?
james_ford What are you doing? What are you doing?
kate_austen What does it look like?
james_ford Hang on a second, Freckles.
james_ford I told you, the time ain't right.
kate_austen You're the one that said we had to go.
james_ford Well, that was before...
kate_austen Before what?! I don't know what they did to you. But I know you're scared enough to lie about it. And that scares me more than anything that they have done to us before.
james_ford Wait. Wait! What are you doing?
kate_austen I'm getting you out of here.
james_ford Don't.
kate_austen I'm not leaving you, Sawyer. I can get it open.
james_ford No. You're already out. You've got to go. You've got to leave me!
kate_austen What?
james_ford Run!
kate_austen What did they do to you?!
james_ford Will you go!!
kate_austen What is that thing?
james_ford Run. Just go. It's every man for himself.
kate_austen Why didn't you fight back?! Tell me the truth for once in your life!
james_ford If you really love me -- go.
kate_austen I only said that so he'd stop hitting you.
james_ford Run. Hurry! What the hell are you doing? Kate?! Damn it, Freckles, go. Every man for himself.
kate_austen Live together, die alone.
tom_friendly You know Danny wants to kill him.
ben_linus Danny can wait.
tom_friendly Should I bring Shephard back?
ben_linus No, I want him to sit with her for a while longer.
dr_juliet_burke I'm, I'm sorry they -- they, uh, had to put handcuffs on you. Um, I'm a fertility doctor. I'm not used to death.
dr_jack_shephard What was her name?
dr_juliet_burke Cole; it was short for Colleen. I shouldn't have, uh -- I should have come to get you sooner.
dr_jack_shephard It wouldn't have mattered. There wasn't any more that you could have done. She was -- she was dead before you put her on the table.
dr_juliet_burke Are you just saying that to make me feel better?
dr_jack_shephard I don't care about making you feel better.
dr_juliet_burke I'm going to take you back now. Um, I'm sorry for bringing you here.
dr_jack_shephard Who's x-rays are those? Outside? Those are spinal x-rays. They belong to a man about 40 years old. And whoever he is, he has a very large tumor on his L-4 vertebrae. And I just happen to be a spinal surgeon. So, you tell me, Juliet, who am I here to save?
hugo_reyes Is that -- art?
desmond_hume Nope. Just an experiment.
hugo_reyes Okay. You want some fruit salad?
desmond_hume Thanks, I'm not hungry. You might want to wait a minute.
hugo_reyes Why's that?
ben_linus Good morning. Let's go for a walk.
warden_harris HARRIS I have to be honest, Ford. When they first brought you here, I thought you were nothing more than a dumb hick. Now I know better. You're a dumb hick that knows how to steal.
james_ford Can we just get this over with?
warden_harris HARRIS Yeah, let's. You remember Agent Freedman from the Treasury Department?
agent_freedman FREEDMAN So, what have you got?
james_ford 10 million's in a red Bronco parked in a Stor-Quik facility in Sawgrass, right off 441, unit 23C. That's where your money is.
warden_harris HARRIS As agreed, the last 6 years of your sentence have been commuted.
agent_freedman FREEDMAN As soon as the truck is recovered and the funds confirmed, your commission will be processed. Now, how would you like that?
james_ford Set up a new account. It don't matter what bank, just make it in Albuquerque.
agent_freedman FREEDMAN Okay.
james_ford Put it in the name of Clementine Phillips.
agent_freedman FREEDMAN Okay, Clementine Phillips.
james_ford And I want it so there's no way she can ever find out who the money's from.
warden_harris HARRIS Who's Clementine Phillips?
james_ford We done?
warden_harris HARRIS Congratulations, Ford, you just lied and cheated your way out of prison. You're a free man.
ben_linus Not much further, James -- just at the top of the next rise.
james_ford What's up there?
ben_linus Something I want you to see.
james_ford That little place you always wanted, George?
ben_linus Sorry?
james_ford What, don't you read? It's from Of Mice and Men. You'd like it -- puppies get killed.
james_ford Bring me up here to kill me? Make that thing you put inside of me blow up my damn heart?
ben_linus Your heart's not going to blow up, James. The only thing we put inside you was doubt. Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor, but nothing more. Look. We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker.
james_ford How do I know that's the same bunny? That you didn't just paint an 8 on another one?
ben_linus You don't.
james_ford You son-of-a-bitch.
ben_linus The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you.
james_ford What the--?
ben_linus You ever been to Alcatraz -- take the tour? Right now you're standing on a small island roughly twice the size of Alcatraz. And that over there -- that's your island -- the one you've come to know and love. I just wanted you to know there's nowhere to run.
james_ford You did all this just to -- just to keep me in a damn cage?
ben_linus We did all this because the only way to gain a con man's respect is to con him. And you're pretty good, Sawyer. We're a lot better. Funny thing is, us telling you about the pacemaker wasn't what kept you in line. It was when I threatened her. You work so hard to make her think you don't care -- that you don't need her, but, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. It don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell you, I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick."
james_ford What the hell are you talking about?
ben_linus It's from Of Mice and Men. Don't you read? Come on, let's get you back to your cage.
