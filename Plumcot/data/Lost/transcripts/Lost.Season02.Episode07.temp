ZACH Emma -- my sister, my sister. Emma! Emma!
ANA LUCIA I'll be right back.
EKO She's not breathing.
ANA Watch out.
EKO Come with me.
EKO Don't look. She will be fine.
ANA LUCIA Good, let it out. You okay?
EMMA Where's my mom?
ANA LUCIA I don't know.
EMMA She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
YELLING MAN Help! Help! Anybody see my wife? Pam!
ANA LUCIA We're not there yet. I promise, we're going to get you home soon, okay.
EKO Excuse me, would you look after the children? There is something I have to do.
CINDY Uh, okay.
EKO Stay with this nice woman. I'll be back in a minute.
DONALD Ow, my leg, my leg! Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?
LIBBY No, it's not that bad. I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe in Vermont. I was on this run -- going pretty fast -- I was racing this cute ski patrol guy. I went off this mogul, lost my edge and, bam!
LIBBY Snapped my left leg. Now that -- that was bad.
ANA LUCIA You a doctor?
LIBBY A year of med school before I dropped out. I'm a clinical psychologist. You saved that girl's life -- you a doctor?
ANA LUCIA No.
GOODWIN Help! Hey, I need some help! There's somebody in the jungle, come on. He's alive!
BERNARD Help! Please help me! Help! Help!
GOODWIN We should climb up there -- I'll hold him steady, you pull him...
ANA LUCIA No, wait. What's your name?!
BERNARD Bernard!
ANA LUCIA You're going to be alright, Bernard. I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you!
BERNARD Is he dead? I think he's dead.
GOODWIN We should climb up there.
ANA LUCIA No. I need you to focus, Bernard! Unbuckle your seatbelt! Now grab the branch next to you!
BERNARD I don't think I can do that.
ANA LUCIA Those seats are going to fall.
ANA LUCIA Come on, you can do it. Bernard!
ANA LUCIA Alright, hold on tight, okay! I'm coming up to get you!
LIBBY Does anybody have any water?
ANA LUCIA You couldn't find any matches?
GOODWIN Dry ones? You can ask around but I couldn't find any. It'll be dark soon, let me get a signal fire started so they can find us.
ANA LUCIA What are you, a boy scout?
GOODWIN Grown up version -- I'm in the Peace Corps.
ANA LUCIA They still have that?
GOODWIN I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
ANA LUCIA What's your name?
GOODWIN Goodwin.
ANA LUCIA I'm Ana Lucia.
BERNARD I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
EKO Yes.
BERNARD Were any of them African-American?
EKO No.
BERNARD Oh, it's my wife -- I can't find her.
EKO I will pray for her.
BERNARD Where the hell are the rescue planes?
EKO I will pray for them, too.
ANA LUCIA What was that?
ANA LUCIA Libby, watch the kids.
GOODWIN Over here.
LIBBY It's alright. It'll be okay.
ANA LUCIA What happened?
ANA LUCIA No wallets, no cell phone, no keys. Nothing.
ANA Hey, are you okay?
NATHAN Look, 3 of the people are missing -- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy, and the German who was helping us with the injured.
ANA LUCIA Did you see anything?
NATHAN No, I didn't.
ANA LUCIA Where did they come from? How many there were?
NATHAN No, I didn't see anything. Who are these people?
ANA LUCIA I don't know. They're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes. These people were here before us.
ANA LUCIA We need to get off the beach. We need to find a safer place.
NATHAN We've got kids and people that are seriously hurt. Where are we going to go? How are we going to move them? And what about the signal fire? How are we going to get rescued if we're off the beach?
GOODWIN Nathan's right.
ANA LUCIA They have satellites -- the black box -- we don't need a fire for them to find us.
CINDY Yes, we do. Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication; we were turning back. We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction. They don't know where to look.
LIBBY It's Donald, his leg. The infection is getting worse. He'll be the 4th to go.
ANA LUCIA What are we supposed to do about that?
LIBBY Would you like some chicken? You haven't said a word in a week. Why aren't you talking? Hey, it wasn't your fault, you know. You were just defending yourself.
GOODWIN That'll work.
ANA LUCIA Eh, I heard a pig or something out there. Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow. What?
ANA LUCIA Where were you?
NATHAN I had to go to the bathroom.
ANA LUCIA We have a system for that. We go in pairs.
NATHAN Yeah, sorry.
UNKNOWN VOICE Behind you! Behind you!
EMMA Help us, please!
LIBBY The kids! They took the kids!
LIBBY They took Jim! and Eli! Nancy's gone! They're gone!
ANA LUCIA Which way did they go? Which way did they go?!! Wake up! Wake up!! Who are you? Talk to me. Wake up!
GOODWIN She's dead. She's dead.
GOODWIN What are you doing? Is that a knife?
GOODWIN What is that?
ANA LUCIA It's a list.
LIBBY A list of what?
ANA LUCIA 9 -- of us.
ANA Nothing? They drag 9 people into the jungle -- the kids -- and there's no sign of them? Now's not a good time to talk? What needs to happen to make you say something?!
NATHAN Hey, calm down, let's figure this out.
ANA LUCIA Calm down? Let's figure this out? Here are the names of every single person they took -- all 9 of them -- what they were wearing -- what they look like -- one of them had a list of us.
NATHAN They could have gotten our names from the people they already took.
ANA LUCIA Nobody knew anybody's names the first night.
NATHAN Maybe they're watching us?
ANA LUCIA You were gone for 2 hours yesterday.
NATHAN What?
ANA LUCIA Where were you?
NATHAN I was going to the bathroom.
GOODWIN Hey, stop! We're all scared. Let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything.
BERNARD He's right. Why would they try to infiltrate us -- that's crazy.
LIBBY Well, whoever they are they know we are here. We need to leave this beach.
ANA You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
GOODWIN I think it's time we let it go out.
ANA LUCIA 5 minutes.
BERNARD We've been walking for 3 days straight, Ana.
ANA LUCIA And you're still here. 5 minutes.
NATHAN You know what? You want to keep walking, go ahead -- fresh water -- rock wall at our backs -- lots of fruit trees -- right here looks pretty good to me.
ANA LUCIA Fine, okay. This'll work.
LIBBY Hey.
ANA LUCIA Hey.
LIBBY Back at the beach -- the night they came back -- you said that Nathan was gone for 2 hours? That he was missing? Creeps me out, Ana. Do you really think it's possible that one of us is one of them?
ANA LUCIA Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
BERNARD Are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this?
NATHAN Oh yeah, give me another stick.
BERNARD Oh, hey, Ana.
BERNARD Ana?!
NATHAN What are you doing?
ANA LUCIA You and I are going to have little talk, Nathan.
NATHAN You, let me out of here right now. You let me out. You let me out!
ANA LUCIA He wasn't on the plane.
BERNARD What?
ANA LUCIA We were in the air for 2 hours -- I didn't see him once -- not once.
GOODWIN It's a big plane, Ana, just because you didn't...
CINDY No, I didn't see him either. I'm pretty good with faces, you know, with the passengers, and I did not see him.
GOODWIN You're not all serious.
LIBBY He never talks about himself, Nathan. Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
BERNARD No, if he really were one of them why would he still be here?
ANA LUCIA I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
NATHAN Will you let me out, Ana?
ANA You got a problem with this?
NATHAN What are you doing? Let me out.
ANA LUCIA Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are you from, Nathan?
NATHAN Canada.
ANA LUCIA What were you doing in Australia?
NATHAN Company retreat.
ANA LUCIA Where are they?
NATHAN What?
ANA LUCIA The rest of your retreat -- where are they?
NATHAN They weren't on the plane. I stayed a couple extra days to sight-see.
ANA LUCIA How come nobody saw you on the plane, Nathan?
NATHAN I was in the lavatory.
ANA LUCIA For 2 hours?
NATHAN I don't remember seeing you on the plane, Ana Lucia.
ANA LUCIA That's because you weren't on it.
ANA LUCIA Where are the kids, Nathan? Where are the kids? Not talking to me anymore? What's that behind you? Get up! I said get up! 
ANA Who gave him food?
CINDY What happened?
ANA LUCIA I'm trying to find out what they did to us. And you're taking care of him?
BERNARD I didn't do anything. And what if you're wrong, Ana? We don't even know if there is a spy.
ANA LUCIA Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one -- his -- Nathan's.
LIBBY Well, they haven't come since you put him in there.
ANA LUCIA Who did it?
ANA LUCIA You?
GOODWIN I'm worried about you, Ana. You've had him down there 4 days.
ANA LUCIA I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
GOODWIN Do you have any kids, Ana?
ANA LUCIA No.
GOODWIN We should let him go. We're not savages.
ANA LUCIA If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already. That's tomorrow.
GOODWIN Grab the rope. I'll pull you up. Ana Lucia's -- I think we all think that she's going to hurt you. Now, you need to get away from here. There's some fruit in there, now just go.
NATHAN Which way's the beach?
GOODWIN That way, maybe 5 miles.
GOODWIN Morning.
ANA LUCIA Morning.
CINDY Ana Lucia, he's gone!
ANA LUCIA What?
CINDY He's gone. Nathan's gone.
BERNARD Ana, what are you going to do?
ANA LUCIA They found us, it's time to move.
CINDY What is it?
ANA LUCIA I don't know -- some sort of bunker.
LIBBY Do you think it's theirs?
ANA LUCIA What are you doing?
LIBBY What is this place?
GOODWIN It looks like some sort of storage facility.
ANA LUCIA Hey, come over here.
ANA LUCIA What was that? Get it.
BERNARD What else in here?
LIBBY It's a glass eye.
BERNARD Look at this. It's a radio.
BERNARD Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?
GOODWIN The hills are blocking it. If we want a signal we need to get to higher ground. I'll do it.
ANA LUCIA I'll go with you.
GOODWIN Nah, you should stay here, Ana -- get this place set up as a shelter.
ANA LUCIA We can all get it set up. We can make it back in a couple of hours, let's go.
ANA LUCIA Why do you think they're doing this?
GOODWIN Why do I think who's doing what?
ANA LUCIA Them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
GOODWIN Maybe they're not attacking us.
ANA LUCIA Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then -- no real harm done.
GOODWIN Good point.
ANA LUCIA Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
GOODWIN That first night they took the strongest of us -- our quiet friend -- three other guys. They're all athletic, tough, threats.
ANA LUCIA They didn't take you.
GOODWIN Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed. Want to take a break?
ANA LUCIA Yeah, that's a good idea.
GOODWIN Can I have the knife?
ANA LUCIA Thank you. Where do you think they got it? I mean, they don't even wear shoes. How'd they get an army knife?
GOODWIN Sorry?
ANA LUCIA The knife -- it's U.S. military. Here I'll show you. You see the tang stamp? This knife's probably 20 years old. You don't see these anymore, yet here it is, on this Island. Weird, huh? Can I ask you something?
GOODWIN Sure, Ana.
ANA LUCIA When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash -- how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
GOODWIN I heard him shouting from the beach.
ANA LUCIA From the beach?
GOODWIN Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
ANA LUCIA Did he see you out there? Is that why you pretended to be one of us? You ran out of the jungle 10 minutes after the crash, you weren't wet. You were never even in the ocean. Where are they -- your friends? Nathan -- what did you-
GOODWIN If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane, I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
ANA LUCIA Did you kill him?
GOODWIN Nathan was not a good person. That's why he wasn't on the list.
ANA LUCIA What about the kids? Did you kill them, too?
GOODWIN Children are fine. They're better off now.
CINDY Where's Goodwin?
ANA LUCIA We're safe here now.
ANA LUCIA Why are you wasting your time with that thing? There's no signal.
BERNARD I only turn it on a couple minutes a day. It really doesn't...
BOONE Hello. Hello, anybody out there? Mayday. Mayday.
BERNARD Is there someone there?
BOONE Hello! Hello!
CINDY Who is that? Oh my god!
BOONE Can you hear me?
BERNARD Repeat your transmission, please.
BOONE Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815! Please copy!
BERNARD We're the survivors of flight 815.
BERNARD No, wait a minute. What are you doing?
ANA LUCIA It's them. It's them. They're trying to draw us out -- trying to find us.
BERNARD No, he said 815; he said flight 815.
ANA LUCIA They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
BERNARD What if there really are other survivors out there?
ANA LUCIA There are no survivors. This is our life now. Get used to it.
ANA LUCIA What are you looking at?
EKO Going to be okay.
ANA LUCIA What, you're talking now?
EKO It's been 40 days.
ANA LUCIA You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
EKO You waited 40 days to cry.
CINDY Libby.
CINDY Turn him over.
LIBBY Is he alive? Get Ana Lucia, quick!
EKO Who are you? Where are you from?
JIN 
BERNARD He doesn't even speak English.
ANA LUCIA That doesn't mean anything.
CINDY Ana, we found him in the water.
ANA LUCIA He has a broken hand cuff on his wrist.
EKO I'm not sure that he's a threat.
ANA LUCIA He's running!
JIN Michael, Sawyer!
SAWYER Jin!
JIN Others! Others! Others!
ANA LUCIA Hit me.
EKO Hit you?
ANA LUCIA You think they're okay? Let's find out. Hit me.
MICHAEL What was that?!
