HURLEY Sayid?
SAYID Hello, Hurley.
HURLEY I think visiting hours are over, Dude.
SAYID This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me.
HURLEY Come with you where?
SAYID Somewhere safe.
HURLEY And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
SAYID Because circumstances have changed.
HURLEY What circumstances?
SAYID Bentham's dead.
HURLEY What?
SAYID Two days ago.
HURLEY What happened?
SAYID They said it was suicide.
HURLEY What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "Bentham"? His name is—
SAYID Don't say it. We're being watched.
HURLEY Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia.
SAYID I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.
HURLEY We're not going back, are we?
SAYID No. Just somewhere safe.
HURLEY Okay then. Hold on a sec.
HURLEY Checkmate, Mr. Eko.
SAYID Where's the freighter?
LAPIDUS I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again.
SAYID How much fuel?
LAPIDUS Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump.
JACK As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.
HURLEY Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!
LOCKE Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.
BEN That's not my problem, John.
LOCKE Hang on, man. Hang on!
KEAMY Wherever you go... Widmore... he'll find you.
BEN Not if I find him first.
LOCKE Hey. No. No. Hey. Hey! Hey!
MICHAEL You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go!
JIN You go. Go. I stay.
DESMOND Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!
JACK Did he say "bomb"?
DESMOND Don't land!
JACK What are you doing?!
LAPIDUS I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!
DESMOND No! Don't land! No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!
JACK How long till we can fly again?
LAPIDUS Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!
DESMOND Give it to me. I'll do it.
LAPIDUS Here! Somebody pump some gas!
JACK I'll handle the fuel.
LAPIDUS Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go!
KATE Hey, Sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go.
SUN Jin's below with Michael. I can't—
KATE No, no, there's no time! There's no time. We have to go.
SUN I won't leave him!
KATE Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin. All right?
LAPIDUS Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island.
MICHAEL Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man.
JIN No, I can find—
MICHAEL Hey, come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to your wife and get her home.
JIN Thank you, Michael.
MICHAEL You're welcome. Go.
JACK Hey! Not yet!
LAPIDUS Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go!
JACK Kate! Come on!
KATE Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind.
JACK Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now.
LAPIDUS Let's go!
DESMOND Give me a minute! No! Wait!
SUN Where's Jin?
JIN 자기야! 자기야! 여기야! 여기야! 나 아직 여기 있어!
SUN It's Jin! No! Jin! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
LAPIDUS We can't do it!
SUN We have to! We need to go back!
CHRISTIAN You can go now, Michael.
MICHAEL Who are you?
SUN Jin! Aah!
SUN Jin!
SUN Go back lower! We have to go find Jin!
JACK Sun, there's nobody down there!
SUN You can't see anything from here!
LAPIDUS We didn't get enough fuel! We can't go back!
SUN Go lower! I know he's there!
SAYID Sun, I'm—Sun, I'm so sorry. He's not—
SUN He's down there! I know he's down there!
LAPIDUS We gotta go!
SUN No! I'm not leaving him!
SAYID Can't get to him!
SUN No, we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around!
JACK Sun! Sun! It's gone!
JACK He's gone.
KATE Shh. Shh.
JACK Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.
LAPIDUS You got it.
SUN No! No! No! No!
SUN 어, 엄마. 
MRS. PAIK 얘, 누가 너하고 얘기하고 싶대! 지연아, 엄마하고 얘기 좀 해볼래?
JI YEON 엄마, 엄마. 
SUN 우리 예쁜 딸! 
MRS. PAIK 얘, 너 어디 있니? 
SUN 런던에 있어요. 일 마무리 하고 오늘 밤에 출발해요. 
MRS. PAIK 그래, 그럼 여행 안전하게 잘 해. 
SUN 그럴게요, 엄마. 집에서 봐요. 
WIDMORE All right, guys. Thanks.
SUN Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?
WIDMORE Yes.
SUN I'm Sun Kwon... Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of Paik Industries.
WIDMORE Yes, of course. How is your father?
SUN Excellent, thank you.
WIDMORE Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.
SUN Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?
WIDMORE I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Kwon.
SUN Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore... just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them...
SUN Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island.
WIDMORE Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me?
LOCKE Why?
BEN "Why" what?
LOCKE Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?
BEN Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses.
BEN I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.
LOCKE What are you doing?
LOCKE I asked you a question!
BEN If I were you, I'd duck.
BEN I better change.
SAWYER Nice day for a swim.
JULIET What are you doing here?
SAWYER Decided to take a dip.
SAWYER Whatcha celebratin'?
JULIET I'm not celebrating.
SAWYER Is that our boat?
JULIET It was.
LOCKE What's that for?
BEN I'm going somewhere cold.
LOCKE Then where is mine?
BEN You don't need one because you're not going with me.
LOCKE Yes, I am going with you.
BEN No, John, you're not.
LOCKE Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions—
BEN He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences.
LOCKE What consequences?
BEN Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid.
LOCKE Waiting for me?
BEN Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.
LOCKE What do I tell 'em to do?
BEN You'll find your way, John. You always do.
RICHARD Hello, John. Welcome home.
BEN I hope you're happy now, Jacob.
DESMOND Yeah, what is that?
LAPIDUS Where's the island? Where's the island?! Where the hell's the island?!
HURLEY It's gone.
LAPIDUS Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!
JACK There's another smaller island close by they took us to!
LAPIDUS I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing but water in every direction!
LAPIDUS Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel!
LAPIDUS Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves!
SAYID Desmond! The life raft!
LAPIDUS Hold on!
KATE Where's Jack?!
LAPIDUS Kate! Where is he?!
SAYID Are you okay?
KATE Hurley, carry the baby.
LAPIDUS Sayid, are you all right?
SAYID Yes!
HURLEY Jack!
LAPIDUS Where's Desmond?
KATE Get the baby.
HURLEY I got him.
LAPIDUS Desmond?! Jack! Give me a hand!
SUN Here you go.
JACK Get him to the raft. Get him to the raft. Get him up in the raft. We've gotta get him in the raft.
HURLEY Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?
KATE Oh, my god.
JACK Oh, come on, Desmond.
JACK One, two, three.
JACK Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
HURLEY Yeah.
JACK Yeah. Yeah.
JACK Yeah, you're all right.
HURLEY You're all right, man. You're okay.
HURLEY Desmond.
JACK That's it. You're all right. That's it.
JACK It's okay. It's okay. We're alive. 
KATE Hello?
KATE Hello? Who's there?
KATE Don't move. Don't you touch my son!
KATE Claire? How did y—
CLAIRE Don't bring him back, Kate. Don't you dare bring him back.
KATE I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
HURLEY Is he okay?
KATE He's fine. It's a miracle.
HURLEY I can't believe he did it.
KATE Who did what?
HURLEY Locke. He moved the island.
JACK No, he didn't.
HURLEY Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, Dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.
LAPIDUS God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! There's a boat! You see it?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Does it see us?
DESMOND I think it does!
SAYID Hey!
HURLEY AND DESMOND Hey!
LAPIDUS Is it turning? It's turning! Hey! Hey!
JACK We're gonna have to lie.
KATE What?
JACK We're gonna have to lie.
SAYID Lie about what?
JACK Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island.
LAPIDUS Jack... now, I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?
JACK Your freighter... those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the bottom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there—someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind?
KATE Jack, we can't. We can't pull it off.
JACK Just let me do the talking.
MAN Aponta adiante, lá! Lá!
MAN Uma jangada. Cheio de gente! São oito deles!
MAN De onde eles vieram? De onde eles vieram?
HENRIK Ei, aqui! Dá uma olhada aqui!
MAN Depressa! Pega uns cobertores e a caixa de primeiros socorros. Traga pra aqui agora.
HENRIK Uma jangada com pessoas, Ms. Widmore! Ms. Widmore, venha à proa!
PENNY Throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern!
DESMOND Penny? Penny! Penny!
PENNY Are you okay?
DESMOND I'm—I'm fine. I'm fine. H—how did you find me?
PENNY Your phone call... I have a tracking station. 
DESMOND I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again.
MAN Não, não, não. Não faz isso. Não faz isso. Tá bom, tá bom, tá bom. Chega pra lá. Chega, chega.
DESMOND Uh... this is—this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.
KATE Hi.
PENNY Hi.
DESMOND Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.
HURLEY Hi.
DESMOND This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is—this is Penny.
JACK It's nice to meet you, Penny.
PENNY Hi.
JACK But we need to talk.
HURLEY What's this place called?
SAYID Membata.
HURLEY Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?
SAYID Because it's the only way to keep them safe.
JACK How long till we'll hit land?
LAPIDUS Well, if the wind's not too brutal... eight, nine hours. Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.
JACK Well... it's been a pleasure, Frank. I hope we never see each other again.
LAPIDUS Roger that, Doc. 
PENNY Bye, sweetheart.
DESMOND Are you sure about this, brother?
JACK Are you sure?
DESMOND As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.
JACK Don't let him find you, Desmond. And I'll see you in another life, brother.
DESMOND Aye. I guess you will.
JACK All right. Let's go home.
BEN Hello, Jack.
BEN Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?
JACK Yes, he did.
BEN When did you speak to him?
JACK About a month ago.
BEN And Kate?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too.
BEN And what did he say to you?
JACK He told me... that after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back.
BEN Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark.
JACK Why are you here?
BEN I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.
JACK Are you... Sayid—I don't even know where Sayid is. Hurley... is insane. Sun blames me for... and then Kate... She won't even talk to me anymore.
BEN Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you.
JACK How?
BEN I have a few ideas.
BEN Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too.
