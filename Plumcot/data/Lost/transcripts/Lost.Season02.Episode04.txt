jinsoo_kwon Hi there, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Jin, you're here.
jinsoo_kwon I sure am.
hugo_reyes Dude, you speak English.
jinsoo_kwon No, you're speaking Korean.
hugo_reyes 나?
hugo_reyes 저 친구 여기서 뭐하는거야?
jinsoo_kwon Everything's going to change.
hugo_reyes 뭐?
jinsoo_kwon Everything's going to change. Have a cluckity-cluck-cluck day, Hugo.
kate_austen Hurley!
kate_austen You fell asleep?
hugo_reyes No, I was just -- resting my eyes.
kate_austen The Numbers are written right there.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I remember the Numbers.
kate_austen Locke went back to the beach. So, I'll be taking the next shift.
hugo_reyes Awesome.
kate_austen Jack told me about your job. At least we have jobs again, right?
hugo_reyes Hurray for us.
james_ford Ain't life grand. What I wouldn't give for a cup of water right now.
jinsoo_kwon 나를 올려 줘. 어서! 포기 하지 마!
james_ford No way. No more human pyramids -- just forget it.
michael_dawson Hey. Hey! Hey, let us out of here!
james_ford No. Just -- chill!
michael_dawson Every minute I spend down here is another minute my boy is still out there.
james_ford Well, let me break it down for you, Mikey. Right now, Rambina and her buddies are trying to figure out what to do with us. Until they make up their damn mind there ain't nothing we can do.
jinsoo_kwon 어깨에 상처가 아주 심해보여.
james_ford Ah, yeah. Why don't you pee on it?
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 Grab the rope. Please.
james_ford Don't do it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Climb the rope or I shoot your friend.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You next.
james_ford Don't do it. She's bluffing. The gun's only got one bullet. She ain't going to waste it-
james_ford Ow, son-of-a-bitch. Ow, God.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Grab the rope.
james_ford You want me, Hotlips, you're going to have to come down here and get me -- -- bitch.
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 JO 4, 8, 15, 16, and 23, with the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share in, a near record jackpot.
lotto_girl OFFICIAL That's right, Mary Jo, because this is the 16th week without a winner.
carmen_reyes Hugo? Hu.. Hugo! Hugo, wake up. Wake up!
hugo_reyes Stop, ow, ow, mom, stop. I just slipped.
carmen_reyes Slipped sitting down? Is it your heart?
hugo_reyes Mom, I'm fine.
carmen_reyes You're lying. I always know because you don't look me in the eye.
hugo_reyes I'm not lying.
carmen_reyes Then tell me what happened, huh?
hugo_reyes It must be something I ate.
carmen_reyes Yes, it must be something you ate because you eat basura, and you don't exercise.
hugo_reyes I do exercise.
carmen_reyes Falling down is not exercise. The only time you move is to lift a drumstick from the bucket. Everyday it's the same thing, Hugo -- you work, TV, chicken. You have to change your life, Hugo. You think someone else will change it for you? Maybe if you pray everyday, Jesus Christ will come down from heaven, take 200 pounds and bring you a decent woman, and a new car. Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.
hugo_reyes Maybe I don't want to change. Maybe I like my life.
carmen_reyes Oh, that must be Jesus. Hola, momento. Yes, it is Jesus! He wants to know what color car you want!
charlie_pace Hurley, we need to have a little chat. Don't worry, mommy's off for a walk, so it's just you, me and the baby. Spill it.
hugo_reyes Spill what?
charlie_pace What's in it?
hugo_reyes Uh, nothing, really.
charlie_pace You've been out there an entire day and night -- looking at nothing?
hugo_reyes Well, I guess it's kind of like a bunker, you know, from WWII, only newer.
charlie_pace What's in it?
hugo_reyes I don't know.
charlie_pace But somehow you know it's a bunker?
hugo_reyes Well, I guess someone told me.
charlie_pace You're going to lie to me? You're going to lie to the baby?
hugo_reyes Dude, look, I'd never lie.
charlie_pace Oh, and the time you told you were worth 150 million dollars?
hugo_reyes It's 156 million.
charlie_pace I'm sorry, I must have confused it with the 900 trillion I am worth myself. And this baby's made of chocolate lollipops. So, if you'll excuse us, I'm going to flap my wings and fly off this Island!
hugo_reyes Hey, Rose.
rose_nadler Hey yourself.
hugo_reyes So, doing laundry, huh?
rose_nadler Indeed I am. You want to hand me those dirty clothes over there? Thank you.
hugo_reyes Don't you want to know what happened?
rose_nadler What happened?
hugo_reyes You know, out there. Everyone's asking me what's in the Hatch.
rose_nadler That's your business, honey.
hugo_reyes Don't you want to know?
rose_nadler Well, whatever it is, it's not going to help get this laundry done, now is it?
hugo_reyes Well, actually, it sort of is.
hugo_reyes It's around here somewhere.
rose_nadler Someone actually lived down here?
hugo_reyes Uh-huh.
rose_nadler Oh. What -- what is it for?
hugo_reyes It's kind of a long story.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley? Who else did you tell?
hugo_reyes No one. I swear. Dude, it's a big job. I needed -- help.
rose_nadler Hello, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Rose.
hugo_reyes She's cool. She won't tell anyone.
rose_nadler Honey, I don't even know what I would say.
rose_nadler All this is food?
dr_jack_shephard It's only a matter of time before we have to tell everyone what we found down here. So, do you know what to do?
hugo_reyes Inventory of all of it, and figure out how we make it last.
dr_jack_shephard And in the meantime, nobody gets anything -- no exceptions. That's your responsibility, Hurley. Okay?
rose_nadler What's that?
hugo_reyes You don't want to know.
hugo_reyes DHARMA Initiative Salad Dressing - Ranch composite. Sounds tasty.
hugo_reyes Apollo bars? Ever hear of these?
rose_nadler Huh-uh, but candy is candy. That's what Bernard always says. Talk about a sweet-tooth. That man has a mouth full of sweet-teeth.
hugo_reyes Bernard, that was your husband?
rose_nadler Is my husband.
hugo_reyes Oh, but, I thought he was in the back of the plane. I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
rose_nadler Oh, no, no -- that's okay. Don't feel bad. Bernard is fine. I know it. You want to get the canned tuna?
hugo_reyes Everyone's going to hate me, Rose.
rose_nadler Now that's just plain silly. You're about the only one on this Island that everybody loves.
hugo_reyes Well, that'll change.
kate_austen Hey, you guys happen to find any shampoo in here?
rose_nadler Yeah, there's some right over here.
hugo_reyes Uh, Kate, you can't take...
kate_austen Thanks, Hurley.
rose_nadler It's just one bottle.
hugo_reyes That's where it starts.
johnny Hey, Hugo. You okay, man?
hugo_reyes Yeah, I'm fine.
randy Reyes, my office, now!
randy You want to tell me something, Reyes?
hugo_reyes Uh, no.
randy You sure about that?
hugo_reyes Uh, yeah?
randy This is last night's surveillance tape.
randy You owe the company for an 8 piece dark meat combo.
hugo_reyes I didn't eat 8 pieces!
randy You want to watch the whole tape? Oh, and while you're here, how many times do I get to tell you those napkins cost money, alright? It's two per customer -- two. We are not made of money here at Mr. Clucks, Reyes. I'm not made of money. Are you made of money? Because if you're made of money -- maybe you don't want to work here. So get it together. What -- is that a problem, Reyes?
hugo_reyes Dude, I quit.
hugo_reyes Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
johnny Dude, are you okay?
hugo_reyes I'm, I'm fine.
johnny Randy's losing his brain in there.
hugo_reyes You should get back in there or he'll have you scrubbing johns for the rest of the week.
johnny Doubt it. I quit, too.
hugo_reyes What?
johnny Looks like we've got ourselves a day off. Who needs money when you've got good looks?
john_locke You can come out now. I saw you back at the rock, and then at the mangrove tree. In fact, I walked in a big circle. I'm not sure how you didn't realize it.
charlie_pace Alright, you don't have to insult me.
john_locke You want to tell me why you've been following me, Charlie?
charlie_pace Yeah. Quite simply, John, there are a lot of secrets around here, and I'm tired of being at the bloody kid's table. I got Claire's baby back. I didn't go swanning off to the Black Rock on the bloody A-Team mission, but I would have if someone had asked me. I think I'm entitled to some sodding answers around here.
john_locke What do you want to know?
dr_jack_shephard How's it going?
sayid_jarrah It's not. On the other side of this door there's more concrete. I'd say it's at least 8 to 10 feet thick.
dr_jack_shephard You see this?
sayid_jarrah Interesting. Good thing this is titanium. Almost no magnetic attraction. But we're not going to get in up here.
dr_jack_shephard Up here?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps we can go under it.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 Grab the rope.
james_ford I ain't doing nothing 'til I know if my friends are okay.
michael_dawson So, we're friends now, huh?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Do it now, or the rope comes up.
james_ford Howdy boys. Thanks for the rescue.
michael_dawson Everything's cool. We had a talk and they believe we were on the plane, too.
james_ford Swell, I guess we can all sue Oceanic together.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What you got there?
james_ford Nothing.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You got a rock? You looking for some revenge? You've got 3 seconds to drop it.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 Ana...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA 1, 2...
james_ford Now, hold on...
james_ford Ow, you didn't say 3.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Shut up. When I tell you to do something, you do it -- I say move, you move -- I say stop, you stop. I say jump, what do you say?
james_ford You first.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You don't like the rules, I toss your ass back in the pit right now, you understand?
james_ford I understand.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA It's getting dark, we're moving out.
james_ford Moving out where?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What did I just tell you?
james_ford Sorry, forgot. Just one thing, though -- you hit me again, I'll kill you.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Let's go.
charlie_pace He pushed that button every 108 minutes?
john_locke He did indeed.
charlie_pace But how is that possible? I mean, didn't he sleep?
john_locke Don't know -- didn't get a chance to ask him.
charlie_pace And after all that time, he just up and left? I mean, why? Where'd he go?
john_locke Don't know. I tried to track him, but he didn't leave much of a trail. I guess he figured he found his replacements.
charlie_pace Meaning us?
john_locke Meaning us.
charlie_pace It -- sounds a bit nutty, doesn't it?
john_locke It is what it is, Charlie.
charlie_pace And what happens if we don't push it?
john_locke We're not going to find out. I'm setting up a system. I'm still working on it, but it looks like it's going to be two person shifts every 6 hours or so.
charlie_pace Shifts? Pushing a button?
john_locke Oh, and there's a record player.
charlie_pace What's Hurley been doing there?
john_locke He's in charge of the food.
charlie_pace Food?
charlie_pace Hey mate? Where you been?
hugo_reyes Hey, I've been -- around.
charlie_pace I know, Hurley.
hugo_reyes You know what?
charlie_pace I know about the food. Locke told me everything.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well, Locke's lying.
charlie_pace Oh yeah, is he lying about the button we have to push every 108 minutes or the Island will explode?
hugo_reyes It's not going to explode!
charlie_pace Ah , come on.
hugo_reyes Look, Jack put me in charge. Look, I don't even want...
charlie_pace Is there peanut butter?
hugo_reyes What?
charlie_pace Peanut butter -- nutty, creamy, staple of children everywhere.
hugo_reyes Uh, yeah. A couple jars.
charlie_pace Brilliant. How about you give us one? -- It's for Claire.
hugo_reyes No can do, man.
charlie_pace You're saying no to a nursing mother?
hugo_reyes It's not like that.
charlie_pace Oh, it's exactly like that. You know, I never thought this would happen but it did. You've become one of them.
hugo_reyes One of them?
charlie_pace Them - the man... management! I thought we were friends. You've changed, man.
johnny Drive Shaft - more like Suck Shaft.
hugo_reyes I'm going to go check out the headphones.
johnny Sure, headphones.
starla Hu-go.
hugo_reyes Star-la.
starla Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?
johnny We're currently exploring other opportunities.
starla You quit?
hugo_reyes I did.
johnny He's mixing it up today. He's off the rail. Somebody get a straitjacket.
hugo_reyes Hey, can I try those on?
starla You're messing with my worldview here, Hugo. You're my rock. I mean if you quit your job the next thing you know bees will stop making honey, and flowers will die, and, hell, the whole damn thing will fall apart.
hugo_reyes So, Starla!
hugo_reyes Sorry. Uh, well, The Hold Steady is playing the Troubadour this weekend, and I was wondering -- maybe Friday...
starla Um, I have to work.
hugo_reyes Oh, no, I didn't mean...
starla I could probably go Saturday. Is that cool?
hugo_reyes Yeah, that's totally cool.
johnny Dude, you've been crushing on this girl for months and doing nothing. Today you're fricking Fabio. Seriously, man, what has gotten into you?
hugo_reyes Nothing, I just wanted to ask her out before...
johnny Before what?
hugo_reyes Nothing.
sayid_jarrah This is the last duct. I believe we're under the area where we began. They poured concrete all the way down here, too.
sayid_jarrah Just as thick.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe there's a way around it.
dr_jack_shephard What is all this stuff?
sayid_jarrah My best guess? There's a geothermal generator behind this wall. That's the power source. Careful with these pipes, they're very hot.
dr_jack_shephard That's it -- nothing -- it's blocked. So what do you think, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah What do I think about what, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard This place -- the computer? What do you think is going on?
sayid_jarrah The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl.
dr_jack_shephard Did you hit something?
sayid_jarrah I don't think so. It's coming from over there.
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to check it out.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard You, um, you took a shower.
kate_austen I had to see if it worked.
dr_jack_shephard How was it?
kate_austen Uh, pressure sucked, it kind of went cold at one point, and it smelled a little bit like sulfur but -- it was a shower.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I know what you mean.
kate_austen You could use one.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe a little later.
kate_austen I'll leave the shampoo for you.
libby_smith I'm Libby.
michael_dawson Michael.
libby_smith How many of you -- you know, on the other side of the Island?
michael_dawson When we left, around 40. How many of you survived?
libby_smith 23 of us.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 Are you alright?
james_ford Now you give a damn.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 I said I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.
james_ford A misunderstanding is when you bring me lemonade instead of iced-tea.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I said no talking.
james_ford He was talking to me.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We're here.
james_ford What are you going to do -- beam us up?
michael_dawson I thought you said there were 23 of you.
libby_smith There were.
claire_littleton Hi, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon What's wrong?
claire_littleton I -- I found something out in the water, and I told Shannon about it, and we thought you should know about it. It's the messages from the raft. We thought you should decide what to do.
hugo_reyes Why'd you tell Charlie, man?
john_locke Because he asked, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well you shouldn't have. You should have listened to me about coming down here, period. Now it's all going to change, everything.
john_locke Change is good, Hugo.
hugo_reyes You know, people say that, but it's not true, man. Trust me, I know. And guess who gets to be the bad guy who has to say no you can't have peanut butter for the cute blonde and her poor Island baby. You know who? It's me. -- You know what? I'm not going to do it. Find someone else to deal with the chow, man.
john_locke No, we all have our jobs, Hugo. My job is to convince people to push a button every 108 minutes without them knowing why -- or for what. Wanna trade?
hugo_reyes I don't want to do this, man!
john_locke Yeah, I've had a lot of jobs I didn't want to do. I still did them. I'm sorry, Hugo, you don't get to quit.
hugo_reyes Okay, then.
johnny Be careful.
hugo_reyes Dude, I am!
johnny You got it?
hugo_reyes Yeah, I got it.
johnny Alright, let's go.
johnny Do you think we got enough gnomes?
hugo_reyes Okay, we're good.
johnny This is genius.
hugo_reyes A little to the left, dude, and more of an angle.
randy Hey!
johnny Run!
johnny Cluck you, Randy!
johnny Freedom!
hugo_reyes Dude, what are you doing?
johnny Freedom! So, anything else you want to do tonight -- you better let me know now -- because our day off is just about over, Huggy Bear. In about 10 hours we going to have to find ourselves some new employment. I hear Pizza Bin is hiring, or we could try our luck at, ah, Gyro-Rama. But I do kind of dig the chick who works at the Bin.
hugo_reyes Dude, promise me something.
johnny Okay, what?
hugo_reyes Promise me that no matter what happens, we'll never change -- this will never change.
johnny Okay. Oh, I know what this is about. I know why you've been acting so weird lately. You're getting that, uh, that, uh, stomach stapling surgery thing, aren't you?
hugo_reyes I'm not getting surgery.
johnny Awe, c'mon man, it's cool. I mean, I could still be all surprised and be like, ooh, my, Hurley, wow, is that you?
hugo_reyes Listen, Johnny, I'm serious. Promise me that you and I will always stay the same.
johnny I'll do you one better. Not only will I stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it. Can I borrow 2 bucks?
rose_nadler What have you got there, Hurley?
hugo_reyes Uh, it's dynamite.
rose_nadler Dynamite? Well, what are you doing with it?
hugo_reyes I'm sorry, but I can't let it happen again.
johnny Why is there a news crew here?
hugo_reyes Dude, we shouldn't go here. Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here.
johnny Maybe somebody got shot.
rose_nadler Why are you doing this, honey?
hugo_reyes Look, just get out of here, Rose.
rose_nadler But you're going to hurt somebody.
hugo_reyes Not if I do it from outside the door. It's thick, and I'll make sure there's nobody around first. So, please, will you just go?
rose_nadler Uh-uh, you hauled me off of the beach and you dragged me into this place -- the least I can get is an explanation before you blow it up!
hugo_reyes You don't get it! This is going to mess it all up!
johnny Dude, somebody won the lottery!
hugo_reyes Let me tell you something, Rose! We were all fine before we had any potato chips! But now we've got these potato chips and everybody's going to want them! So Steve gets them, and Charlie's pissed -- but he's not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me!
GAS#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode04 STATION CLERK That's the guy! That's the guy!
hugo_reyes And I'm going to be in the middle of it! And then it's going to be well, what about us -- why didn't I get any potato chips? C'mon, help us out, Hurley. Why did you give Kate the shampoo? And why didn't I get the peanut butter? Then, they'll get really mad and start asking why does Hugo have everything -- why should he get to decide? Then they'll all hate me. I don't know what to do.
hugo_reyes Come on, Jack. The inventory's done, this is the only way.
dr_jack_shephard Are you serious?
hugo_reyes Dude, there's enough food in there to feed one guy, 3 meals a day for another 3 months. We have 40 people, it's just not going to work. You put me in charge, this is what we're doing.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
hugo_reyes Okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, okay.
hugo_reyes Okay.
bernard_nadler Um, excuse me. Hi. Back where you guys, uh, where you came from -- is there a woman named Rose there?
james_ford Black chick in her 50's?
bernard_nadler Is she, is she okay?
michael_dawson Yeah, man, she's okay.
bernard_nadler Oh, oh.
michael_dawson Michael, I'm Michael.
bernard_nadler Thank you, Michael. I'm, I'm Bernard.
michael_dawson Okay, it's okay. She's good.
