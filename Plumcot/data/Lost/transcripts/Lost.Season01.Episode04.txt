michael_dawson Walt, you gotta keep that dog quiet.
walt_lloyd I don't know what's wrong with him. Come on, Vincent, cut that out.
michael_dawson Sorry, hey, sorry, sorry.
kate_austen What is it?
claire_littleton Somebody's in there.
sayid_jarrah Everyone in there's dead.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer.
james_ford Right behind you, Jackass.
kate_austen Jack?
james_ford I'm gonna shed some light on this thing.
dr_jack_shephard Run.
hugo_reyes Oh crud, now what?
sayid_jarrah They're gone.
charlie_pace What the bloody hell was that?
john_locke Boars.
dr_jack_shephard Those boars were looking to feed. We have to get rid of the bodies.
charlie_pace Bury them? There's a whole bunch in there.
sayid_jarrah More than twenty. Digging will be difficult without shovels.
dr_jack_shephard We're not burying them. We need to burn them.
kate_austen They're people.
dr_jack_shephard I know they're people, Kate.
sayid_jarrah Burning the remains, they deserve better than that.
dr_jack_shephard Better than what? Being eaten by wild animals? Because that's what's going to happen. Any bodies we bury are not going to stay buried for very long. Look, I know this seems harsh, but that fuselage in the sun—it's not about what they deserve. They're gone, and we're not.
sayid_jarrah What you say may be true, but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest—it's not right. No regard for their wishes? Their religions?
dr_jack_shephard We don't have time to sort out everybody's god.
charlie_pace Really, last I heard we were positively made of time.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I'm not happy about it either, but we crashed a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place. It's been 4 days, no one's come. Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood, dried brush, and turn that fuselage into a furnace. Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we start the fire.
charlie_pace If he's so eager to burn the bodies why are we waiting until sundown?
kate_austen He's hoping someone will see it.
kate_austen Looks like I'm not the only who couldn't sleep last night.
sayid_jarrah There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood.
kate_austen You don't agree with Jack. What are you making?
sayid_jarrah Too soon to talk about. I'm not sure it will even work.
kate_austen You're trying to pick up the transmission aren't you? The one we heard on the transceiver.
sayid_jarrah If the French woman's transmission has truly been playing on a loop for 16 years then there must be a power source on the Island. A significant one.
kate_austen And you can find it?
sayid_jarrah Hypothetically, yes. I'm making an antenna of sorts. With a few of these mounted at different points on the Island I may be able to use the transceiver to triangulate the signal, find out where it's coming from.
kate_austen So what can I do to help?
sayid_jarrah It appears you are as anxious to get off this Island as I am.
walt_lloyd Catch the ball, catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy, good job Vincent.
michael_dawson Hey, hey, where you going, man?
walt_lloyd Nowhere, I just thought I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.
michael_dawson Hey, why don't you help your dad with the wood. I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day anyway.
walt_lloyd At least he talks to me. Come on, Vincent.
hugo_reyes What's your problem? Hand them over.
james_ford How about no?
hugo_reyes There's other people here or don't you give a crap?
james_ford Well if one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share...
hugo_reyes Oh that's bull and you know it. You're not happy unless you're screwing over everybody...
james_ford Hey I'm peachy, pork pie.
dr_jack_shephard Guys, knock it off.
james_ford Stay out of this, Metro.
dr_jack_shephard What's going on?
hugo_reyes Jethro here's hoarding the last of the peanuts.
james_ford My own stash. I found it in there.
dr_jack_shephard What about the rest of the food?
hugo_reyes There is no rest of the food, dude. We kind of—ate it all.
shannon_rutherford What?
dr_jack_shephard Okay everybody, just calm down.
sayid_jarrah We can find food. There are plenty of things on this Island we can use for sustenance.
james_ford And exactly how are we going to find this sustenance.
john_locke We hunt.
kate_austen How'd you get that knife on the plane?
john_locke Checked it.
dr_jack_shephard You either have very good aim, or very bad aim, Mr...
michael_dawson Locke. His name is Locke.
dr_jack_shephard Okay Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting?
john_locke We know there are wild boar on the Island. Razorbacks, by the look of them. The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets, 100, 150 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar-like tusks, and a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it, and slit its throat.
james_ford And you gave him his knife back?
dr_jack_shephard Well, if you've got a better idea.
james_ford Better than the three of you wandering into the magic forest to bag a hunk of ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife? Hell no, it's the best idea I ever heard.
hugo_reyes Who is this guy?
john_locke Yes?
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Colonel Locke, is this line secure?
john_locke Line secure GL12, go ahead.
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Target area is acquired. Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours. Repeat we are a GO.
john_locke Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.
randy Locke. I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today. Not 1230; not 1215; noon.
john_locke I heard you the first time, Randy.
randy And no personal calls during office hours, Colonel.
dr_jack_shephard So? Hunting boar, now, huh?
kate_austen Who says it's my first time boar hunting?
dr_jack_shephard Uh-huh. Tell me something, how come every time there's a hike into the heart of darkness you sign up? You know what's in there.
kate_austen Actually, I don't. And neither do you.
dr_jack_shephard What's your feel on our new friend?
kate_austen Seems to know what he's doing.
dr_jack_shephard Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives?
kate_austen If I didn't know any better, I'd say your worried about me, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard If I didn't know any better, I'd say you have a problem staying in one place for very long, Kate. So, you want to tell me why you're really going?
kate_austen Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard—find the source.
dr_jack_shephard This isn't about boars.
kate_austen I'm a vegetarian.
walt_lloyd But why can't I come?
michael_dawson Because I said so.
michael_dawson Hi, hi, excuse me. Um, I am going off, away, to hunt, and um, I was wondering if you could keep an eye on my boy, Walt. And, I'm Michael. Anyway, could you watch him for me, until I come back?
sunhwa_kwon 아... 아드님은 제가 잘 돌보고 있을게요. 예...
michael_dawson Sorry I don't understand, but you're cool with this, right?
walt_lloyd I don't need a babysitter.
michael_dawson Come on, Vincent needs you here. And, hey, cheer up. This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke a little better.
sunhwa_kwon 너무 걱정하지 마. 아버지 괜찮으실 거야.
walt_lloyd Yeah, whatever.
claire_littleton Excuse me. Doctor?
dr_jack_shephard Claire, right? How's the .
claire_littleton Oh, he's good, yeah, thanks. Um, I thought maybe you should see this . Someone found it in there. They're collecting all the belongings. They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristin. They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me. I remember because they looked so happy.
dr_jack_shephard I don't understand, Claire, what am I supposed to do with this?
claire_littleton Oh, well, um, some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of memorial service, or something. You could lead it.
dr_jack_shephard Uh, no, I don't think it...
claire_littleton Well, you know, just a few words, or we could just read their names from passports, and drivers...
dr_jack_shephard Look, it's not my thing.
claire_littleton Oh, okay. Maybe I'll do it.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, sounds fine. Whatever everybody wants.
boone_carlyle That woman's still sitting there.
shannon_rutherford Mmmhmmm.
boone_carlyle Her husband was on the plane.
shannon_rutherford Right.
boone_carlyle Are you even listening to me?
shannon_rutherford What's a four letter word for I don't care?
boone_carlyle I just think somebody should go talk to her.
shannon_rutherford I nominate you, Captain America. You just can't help yourself, can you?
boone_carlyle Yeah, well, at least you don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you.
shannon_rutherford I'm not going to starve.
boone_carlyle Right, what are you going to eat?
shannon_rutherford The ocean's full of fish.
boone_carlyle I hate to break it to you—the ocean is not going to take your gold card.
shannon_rutherford You really don't think I can't catch a fish?
kate_austen You find something?
john_locke The ground here has been rooted up. That's how boars get the majority of their food, they dig. Afterwards they generally wallow in the dirt, rub up against the trees, scoring them with their tusks.
michael_dawson Okay. So what's all that mean?
john_locke Means we're close.
shannon_rutherford Hi.
charlie_pace Hi. (putting the drugs back in his pocket). Shannon, right?
shannon_rutherford Yeah. Are you doing anything?
charlie_pace Me? No, I was just, uh. What are you doing?
shannon_rutherford I was just going to go for a walk. Do you want to come?
charlie_pace Yeah, yes, sure.
shannon_rutherford Can I ask you something?
charlie_pace Oh, I wondered when this was going to come up. Yes, I'm the bass guitarist in Dri…
shannon_rutherford Do you know anything about fishing?
charlie_pace What? Fishing? My grand-dad used to take me out, taught me everything he knows. Everything he knew, he's dead now, god rest his soul. Yeah, I'm like a … I'm a fishing fiend. I mean England's an island so I just throw it in and … fish.
shannon_rutherford Good.
boone_carlyle Hey doc, you got a second?
dr_jack_shephard What's up?
boone_carlyle The woman's been sitting over there by herself. Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband? I don't think she's had anything to eat or drink. Think maybe you can go talk to her?
dr_jack_shephard Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist. I mean, maybe you should...
boone_carlyle I just thought you might want to do it. You're the one that saved her life.
dr_jack_shephard Hi. Rose, right? Remember me, seat 23A? I'm the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence. Everybody's getting pretty worried about you, Rose. If you want to be alone that's fine, but you have to take care of yourself. You should really drink. Okay. We don't have to talk. Let's just sit for a while.
kate_austen Your son, how's he handling all of this?
michael_dawson A hell of a lot better than I am.
kate_austen You must be proud. He's a brave kid.
michael_dawson Yeah. I can't take credit for that. I wasn't part of his life. Till his mother passed away, two weeks ago.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I didn't know.
michael_dawson That's okay. There were living in Sydney the past couple of years. I flew out last week, you know, to go get him. What were you doing in Australia?
john_locke Shhh.
michael_dawson Hey, quit giving us the steal signal.
kate_austen He's bad.
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Move. You've got to move Col. Your troops are across enemy lines.
john_locke Patience, the quality which you lack, GL12, is the hallmark of a leader.
randy Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. While you're at it, tell me about this Col. thing. I cruised your file in human resources, you've never been in any of the armed forces.
john_locke I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's my lunch hour, I can play a game.
randy Well, tell me, what's a Walkabout? "Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback."
john_locke You have no right taking that off my desk.
randy So, you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?
john_locke Not that you would understand, but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal, where one derives strength from the earth. And becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, I'm going, Randy. I've already made a reservation.
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Wow. John you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?
randy Helen? Well, what's this Locke, you've actually got a woman in your life.
john_locke That's none of your business.
randy What is it with you Locke? Why do you torture yourself? I mean, imagining you're some hunter? Walkabouts? Wake up, you can't do any of that.
john_locke Norman Croucher.
randy What? Norman what?
john_locke Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher, double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mt. Everest. Why? It was his destiny.
randy That's what you think you've got, old man? Destiny?
john_locke Just don't tell me what I can't do.
kate_austen He's hurt. John? Can you hear me? Locke? John you okay?
kate_austen Locke?
john_locke I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, Helen, I just got the wind knocked out of me is all.
kate_austen Helen?
john_locke What?
kate_austen You called me Helen.
john_locke Did I?
john_locke Which way did that boar go?
kate_austen Michael's hurt. We have to get him back to camp.
john_locke Yeah, you take him back to camp. I'm going to get that boar.
kate_austen What are you talking about?
john_locke I'm fine. I can do this.
kate_austen John, you can't.
john_locke Don't tell me what I can't do.
charlie_pace Did you get it?
hugo_reyes Dude, quit asking me that.
charlie_pace Sorry. You, you said you knew how to fish.
hugo_reyes Yeah, off the Santa Monica pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to try and poke one with a sharp stick.
charlie_pace Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, thanks.
hugo_reyes Anything to keep me far away from that fuselage and that freakin' redneck jerk. Damn it, crap, crap, son of a...
charlie_pace You let me have a go?
hugo_reyes Knock yourself out. Okay, here comes one. Put your weight into it. Now, you see it? Wait for it, wait... now. . Dude, you've got to try to pin it.
charlie_pace You see how close I was? No, you said I had to corner it.
claire_littleton Excuse me, your name's Sayid, right?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
claire_littleton I just found this. It's got your name on it. .
sayid_jarrah I thought I'd lost this. Thank you.
claire_littleton Sure.
rose_nadler His fingers swell.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry?
rose_nadler Bernard, my husband, his hands swell up whenever we fly.
dr_jack_shephard The altitude.
rose_nadler He started having me hold onto his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip. Always wore it around my neck for safe keeping. Just until we landed. You know, doctor, you don't have to keep your promise.
dr_jack_shephard Promise?
rose_nadler The one you gave me on the plane. The one you made me—to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom. I'm letting you off the hook.
dr_jack_shephard Well, you're not going to get rid of me that easily. Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone. You're suffering from Post Traumatic Shock.
rose_nadler Aren't we all?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I guess we are.
rose_nadler You have a nice way about you. A good soul, patient, caring. I suppose that's why you became a doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks but I was just kind of born into it. Family business.
john_locke I have never felt so alive. Getting to finally tell Randy off was... life changing. I mean it, now I'm free to do all those things I ever wanted to do. Things that I know I was destined to do, like we talked about Helen.
helen_norwood That's wonderful John. I'm happy for you, really.
john_locke I haven't even told you the best part. You remember the authentic aboriginal Walkabout?
helen_norwood Sure. That's all you've talked about for weeks.
john_locke Yeah, well, I'm going to do it. I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week. And I've, uh. I bought two tickets. Helen?
helen_norwood John, we've talked about this. I like you and I've enjoyed talking with you these past few months.
john_locke 8 months.
helen_norwood I'm not allowed to meet customers.
john_locke Customer? Is that what I am to you?
helen_norwood This isn't really normal. I mean, it isn't what I do. I don't know, maybe you should find a... I don't know... a therapist?
john_locke I have a therapist.
helen_norwood John.
john_locke I thought you understood Helen. You know me better than anyone.
helen_norwood John, if we talk any longer, I'm going to have to charge you for another hour. That's another 89.95 and...
john_locke Look, I don't care about the money. I just...
helen_norwood I'm sorry John, I've got to go.
john_locke Helen, Helen. Helen!
kate_austen Hey, hey wait a minute. Rest here for a minute.
michael_dawson I thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest. What are you doing?
kate_austen Trying to boost the transceiver signal. I'm going to climb this tree and attach the antenna.
michael_dawson You're going to climb that?
kate_austen Yeah. Don't worry. I've climbed a lot worse.
kate_austen Locke.
james_ford Hey, uh...
claire_littleton Hey.
james_ford These were, um. I found these the other day when I was... Aw hell, just, just take it.
claire_littleton Thank you.
walt_lloyd What is that?
walt_lloyd Oh, I get it. It's like toothpaste.
sunhwa_kwon
walt_lloyd Chia?
walt_lloyd Dad!
hugo_reyes So, like, what happened out there?
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Hey, hey!
walt_lloyd Your leg's all messed up. Does it hurt?
michael_dawson It's okay. It's not as bad as it looks.
james_ford The mighty huntress returns. What's for dinner, hon-
kate_austen Not now.
walt_lloyd So, it was like a boar fight?
michael_dawson Not too much of a fight. It was more like me getting gored.
walt_lloyd So, um, where's Mr. Locke?
boone_carlyle I don't think that hunt went very well. The bald guy never came back.
shannon_rutherford Wait, they didn't bring back any food at all?
boone_carlyle Did you hear what I just said? Somebody might have died out there.
shannon_rutherford Well, we're all going to die if somebody doesn't do something.
charlie_pace There you are. As promised, you and I will be dining of fresh catch of the day.
shannon_rutherford Oh, my fish!
charlie_pace I hope you don't mind al fresco. It was no problem. You know what, that one actually gave me a hell of a tussle, but you have to get inside the mind of the fish, you know.
boone_carlyle I don't believe you.
charlie_pace I got it in the shallows, I cornered it.
shannon_rutherford What's the matter? Can't stand to see me fending for myself?
boone_carlyle I'm sorry about this, seriously.
charlie_pace No, no, it's okay.
shannon_rutherford What are you apologizing to him for?
boone_carlyle For you. For using him—using this poor guy like you use everyone else.
shannon_rutherford Oh, whatever.
boone_carlyle Somewhere in that twisted little brain, you think this proves that you can take care of yourself.
shannon_rutherford I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?
boone_carlyle That's low Shannon, even for you.
shannon_rutherford Oh, go rescue a baby bird or something.
dr_jack_shephard Rose, after the sun goes down, we're going to burn the fuselage. It's just something that we have to do. There's going to be a memorial service back at the camp for those—for those who didn't make it. For everyone to say goodbye.
rose_nadler I'd like to be there for that.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. . Maybe if you'd like to say something, you know, about your husband.
rose_nadler What?
dr_jack_shephard I'm just saying if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard.
rose_nadler Doctor, my husband is not dead.
dr_jack_shephard Rose, he was in the tail section of the plane. It broke off in mid-flight. I'm sorry, but everyone who was in the rear of the plane's gone.
rose_nadler They're probably thinking the same thing about us.
rose_nadler Doctor? You coming?
kate_austen I'm sorry. I guess I should've gotten a warranty.
sayid_jarrah I suppose I'll just try again. Of course, I have no welding iron, no rivets, scorched wiring. And it seems I must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what it is I'm actually doing.
kate_austen Sayid, I'll try it again.
sayid_jarrah We'll try it again.
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
sayid_jarrah Excuse me.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
kate_austen Is this when you say "I told you so?"
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm not big on rubbing it in.
kate_austen Locke, um. Locke's gone. That thing, it was moving in his direction. There wasn't time. What's going on?
dr_jack_shephard The fuselage is ready to go. Some of the others decided, um … I guess there's going to be some words said over the fire...
kate_austen That's good.
dr_jack_shephard ... names read, I think.
kate_austen I just don't think they're ready to hear about some of the things that we've...
kate_austen Jack? Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Locke.
claire_littleton Judith Martha Wexler from Denton, TX, guess she was going to catch a connecting flight. Um, she wore corrective lenses and she was an organ donor, or at least would have been. Steve and Kirsten, I don't know their last name, but they were really in love and were going to be married. At least, wherever they are now, they're not alone.
claire_littleton ... video store receipt lists his overdue charges for Willie Wonka and A Little Princess. Looks like he hadn't traveled much... as far as I can tell from his passport.
kate_austen You seen Jack?
claire_littleton ... Wollstein, Harold, seat 23C.
claire_littleton That's all we have on Harold, his name on a boarding pass... I just wish there was something more... Goodbye, Harold.
michael_dawson Nice work.
john_locke What?
claire_littleton Millicent Louise D'Agostino
michael_dawson The boar. Nice work, you know, killing it.
claire_littleton ...Teaneck, NJ.
michael_dawson Just thought I should say something. So that thing, the monster, whatever. She said it was headed right towards you. Did you see anything? Get any kind of look at it?
john_locke No.
travel_agent The Walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. It's trekking across vast stretches of desert, rafting bloody treacherous waters.
john_locke Look, you've got no idea who you're talking to. I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. I probably know more than you on the subject.
travel_agent In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone...
john_locke Look, I booked this tour a month ago, you've already got my money. Now, I demand a place on that bus.
travel_agent You misrepresented yourself...
john_locke I never lied.
travel_agent By omission, Mr. Locke. You neglected to tell us about your condition.
john_locke My condition is not an issue. I've lived with it for 4 years. It's never kept me from doing anything.
travel_agent Look, unfortunately it is an issue for our insurance company. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people.
john_locke Hey, don't talk to me about fair.
travel_agent I can get you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. That's the best I can do.
john_locke No. I don't want to go back to Sydney. Look I've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus, right now, I can do this.
travel_agent No, you can't.
john_locke Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. . You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever. This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. (yelling) I'm supposed to do this, dammit. Don't tell me what I can't do. Don't tell me what I can't...
