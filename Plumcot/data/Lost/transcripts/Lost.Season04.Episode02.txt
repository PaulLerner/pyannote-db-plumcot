MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 Sorry, Ron. Drone's got nothing but seafood at five thousand meters below. You picking up anything with yours?
RON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Zip. Trying to get her a peek over this ridge as soon as I can. Sonar's picking up something now.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 Hey, you wanna switch feeds?
RON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Roger that.
RON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 I'm headed on a bearing of about 137 from the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map. But don't hold your breath.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 Magnetometer's picking up a hell of a lot of anomalies around here.
RON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Chests full of doubloons?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 Keep dreaming, Ron. Let's swing round to the next grid and recalibrate.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 Are you getting this?
RON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 What, what's up?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 It's... It's an airplane. Oh my god, it's Oceanic 815.
regina This haunting footage comes to us from the Christiane I, a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean. For more than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the Sunda Trench off Bali, in search of the remains of sunken trading ships. Late last night, the Christiane deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs, that verified what the National Transportation Safety Board had long feared, that the commercial...
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 1 How do you want your eggs, Dan? So what happened, they find that missing plane? Dan? Dan? Dan, why are you so upset?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 I can't find my vest!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 Check under your seat!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 I already did!
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Get ready!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 Here, just take mine!
PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Everybody out now!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 Hey, genius, go!
dr_daniel_faraday No!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 2 Go!
dr_daniel_faraday No!
dr_daniel_faraday Hey there. Are you Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm Jack. Who are you?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm Daniel Faraday. I'm here to rescue you.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Dan, the chopper, how many of you were on it?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, four, including me.
kate_austen So what happened to the rest of them?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, yeah, I, er, I have no idea, I dunno how many were able to get out before it went down, I just, I jumped and I lost my, er, what do you call it, my pack, and my phone was in my pack, if I had my phone, I would just, er...
kate_austen We have a phone.
dr_daniel_faraday You have a phone.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you.
george_minkowski Minkowski.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, George. It's Daniel.
george_minkowski Dan, the chopper comm went dead, what the hell happened up there?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, I dunno, George, there was an electrical storm, all the instruments, they... I think they went down. But listen, I made contact with some of the survivors, and we were just, er...
george_minkowski Dan, am I on speaker?
dr_daniel_faraday Would you give me just one sec?
kate_austen Don't worry. Naomi covered for us. They don't know what Locke did to her.
dr_jack_shephard You sure about that?
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, so the boat hasn't heard from anybody else yet, but, er, their GPS transponders, my team and I are all wearing these, the transponders will send the locations back to the ship, and then the ship will send all the locations back into the phones. Er, oh, there we are, there's my signal right there, and hopefully we'll get the signals for the rest of the team soon. Will you help me find 'em?
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely.
dr_daniel_faraday Okay, thank you. Hey, where are the rest of your people?
kate_austen Most of them are back at the beach.
dr_daniel_faraday Most of them?
hugo_reyes Dude. What's wrong with you? You're gonna get struck by lightning.
john_locke The storm's about to pass, Hugo.
hugo_reyes It's a friggin' monsoon, we gotta...
john_locke Let's go.
james_ford Why are you going East? Thought you said the Barracks were due South.
john_locke Because, James, we have to make a little detour first.
james_ford Detour to what?
john_locke There's a cabin I have to go to.
hugo_reyes I thought the cabin was back that way.
john_locke What did you say, Hugo?
hugo_reyes I, er, thought you were talking about the airplane cabin.
james_ford Why are we wasting our time going to some shack, anyway?
john_locke Because we're supposed to.
james_ford Right. Like you were supposed to throw a knife into that Naomi chick's back.
john_locke Uh-huh.
james_ford You mind telling us who you're getting your orders from, Colonel Kurtz?
john_locke I got 'em from Walt.
dr_juliet_burke Jack still isn't back. Anything?
sayid_jarrah No. But it's a big Island. The freighter could be approaching from the other side.
dr_juliet_burke That's the spirit.
sayid_jarrah Juliet, you lived amongst the Others. Why would Ben say the people coming here intend to do us harm?
dr_juliet_burke Because he's a liar. And he's trying to scare us, that's what Ben does. Or, because the people coming here intend to do us harm. How many guns do you have left?
kate_austen Hey. That from your chopper?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, yeah yeah yeah, that, er, they had to reduce the weight load when we started going down. I guess that's why they pushed me out.
dr_jack_shephard What's this for?
dr_daniel_faraday Erm, I'm not in charge of packing, so...
dr_jack_shephard You're not, huh?
dr_daniel_faraday We should, er...
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Daniel, why did you bring the gun?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, as a precaution.
dr_jack_shephard Precaution against what?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, okay, see, erm, rescuing you and your people. Can't really say it's our primary objective.
dr_jack_shephard Then what is?
dr_daniel_faraday It's Miles, it's Miles, come on!
james_ford What the hell do you mean you saw Walt? In a dream?
john_locke No dream, it was Walt. Only, taller.
james_ford Taller? What, like a giant? Okay, what exactly did Walt tell you?
john_locke He said I had work to do. That I had to stop this woman, Naomi, from bringing the rest of her people here.
james_ford What, you didn't ask any follow-up questions?
john_locke Ben had shot me and left me for dead. Walt saved my life, so I pretty much took him at his word.
james_ford He shot you? Yet here you are fit as a fiddle tromping through the jungle.
john_locke The bullet went in one side, came out the other. I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there. Anything else?
dr_daniel_faraday Down there. Hey, Miles! Miles!
kate_austen He dead?
miles_straume Back up, handsome.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, whoa whoa whoa, Miles! Take it easy, it's okay! They're here to help us. It's okay, Miles, they're just trying to help.
miles_straume Hey! Back away from him! Hands where I can see 'em!
dr_jack_shephard Kate, it's alright, it's okay.
miles_straume So you're Kate. You wanna tell me where Naomi is?
kate_austen What?
miles_straume Naomi, the woman you killed. Where is she?
CAR#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 RADIO ...Oceanic 815, it can only be described as the worst case scenario. With the plane accounted for, and a salvage mission unlikely, authorities are confirming all three hundred and twenty-four passengers dead.
miles_straume Ms Gardner? I'm Miles Straume. We spoke on the phone earlier.
ms_gardner Oh oh oh, please come in.
miles_straume Which room is it?
ms_gardner It's upstairs at the end of the hall.
miles_straume I get paid in advance. Two hundred, cash only.
ms_gardner You told me a hundred over...
miles_straume That was before my buddy at the police station told me your grandson was murdered. It's gonna be two hundred.
ms_gardner Fine.
miles_straume No matter what you hear, don't come up.
miles_straume You're not doing your grandmother any good staying here, man. You're causing her a lot of pain. I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone, but the only way I'm gonna be able to do that is if you tell me where it is. So where is it?
miles_straume You can go now.
ms_gardner Did it work?
miles_straume Yeah. He's at peace now. Here, you get a refund, half off. Wasn't as tricky as I thought.
ms_gardner Thank you. Thank you.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, Miles, hey, hey, hey, what you doing? What are you doing? These are good people.
miles_straume Then why'd Naomi use the damn code? Yeah, you remember when she said tell my sister I love her, well she doesn't have a sister. That's what we're supposed to say if we get captured, have a gun to our heads. Like right now, Jack here would say tell my sister I love her, you get it?
dr_jack_shephard We didn't kill your friend.
miles_straume Then take me to her body.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, what about Charlotte, what about Frank?
miles_straume Take me to Naomi!
kate_austen Listen, Naomi was killed, but not by us, it was, it was a man by the name of John Locke. He's not with us anymore.
miles_straume Kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again...
kate_austen Even if I took you to her body you wouldn't know what happened...
miles_straume I'll know! Now take me to her body.
ben_linus Alex. Alex, hey.
alex_rousseau What?
ben_linus Something I need to tell you.
karl_martin Keep your mouth shut, Mr. Linus.
ben_linus Karl! Now, if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me Ben.
james_ford Easy, kid, guy's just trying to get in your head. Go take a walk or something.
ben_linus Mind if I ask you a question, James?
james_ford Yeah, I do.
ben_linus Why'd you leave Kate behind?
james_ford Wasting your time, Yoda.
ben_linus I know it's not pleasant, but, let's face it, you really don't stand a chance now...
james_ford Chance of what?
ben_linus James. Look at yourself. Yes, on this Island you're brave, daring, handsome, you're someone, but if you left with them, back in the real-world a low-life scam artist like you could never compete with a first class surgeon. I think Kate was really upset when you made your choice to come with us. Thank god she has Jack there to comfort-
john_locke James! Don't!
james_ford Don't what! Anyone wanna tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?
john_locke We're keeping him alive because he's been on this Island a lot longer than any of us. Because he has information we need. And because apart from his mouth, he's completely harmless.
james_ford His mouth put that hole in your gut?
john_locke Okay, James. Let's execute him, right here, right now, in front of his daughter.
james_ford It's only a matter of time before he gets us, Johnny, and I bet he's already figured out how he's gonna do it. So you walk him.
kate_austen What is he doing?
dr_daniel_faraday The light is strange out here, isn't it? It's kinda, like, it doesn't scatter quite right.
kate_austen Dan, your name's Dan, right? Listen, Dan. I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right? So why don't you just put that away?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, because, erm, Miles would kill me.
kate_austen We're just trying to help.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, you're wasting your breath. Why don't we just let this play out and see what happens, okay?
miles_straume They didn't kill her. Happened like they said it did.
dr_daniel_faraday It's Charlotte, only three kilometers from here.
miles_straume Alright then, let's go get her.
miles_straume I said let's go.
dr_jack_shephard You need to put the guns down.
miles_straume What?
dr_jack_shephard Put the guns down.
miles_straume Now why would I do that?
dr_jack_shephard Because our friends are out in the jungle right now holding a gun at your head, and his head. So I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding. Just put the guns down.
miles_straume Come on, how stupid do you think I-
dr_jack_shephard I dunno, Miles, how stupid are ya?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 How many different languages do you have to read that in before you believe it's true?
dr_charlotte_lewis How many different languages are there?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 He wants to know if we're lost.
dr_charlotte_lewis Remind him the people in our line of work are terrible at keeping secrets. I know about the dig.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 He says the site is closed.
dr_charlotte_lewis Then tell him to open it.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Dinosaur?
dr_charlotte_lewis Not by a few million years. It's an Ursus maritimus.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Wait, Ursus as in bear?
dr_charlotte_lewis As in polar bear.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Charlotte, we're in the desert. This is a hoax, right?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 He wants to know what you're doing with the hammer.
dr_charlotte_lewis Excavating.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Is that a collar?
dr_charlotte_lewis Hi.
john_locke Hi yourself.
dr_juliet_burke We were worried when you didn't get back so we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks for that, for what it's worth.
dr_juliet_burke Don't mention it.
kate_austen Someone could have told me that the cavalry were here.
dr_jack_shephard I gave you that... wink.
sayid_jarrah What are your names?
dr_daniel_faraday Er, I'm Daniel Faraday, and this is Miles...
miles_straume Don't tell him my last name.
dr_daniel_faraday I guess it's just Miles.
sayid_jarrah What do you do for a living, Daniel?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm a physicist. Well, I guess you could call me a physicist, I don't really like being pigeon-holed into one...
miles_straume Dan, I swear to God, you say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.
sayid_jarrah And what do you do, Miles?
miles_straume I collect soil samples.
sayid_jarrah Oh, that's nice. Well, maybe you can help me. You say you're not here on a rescue mission, and the world at large believes us to be dead. But here we are alive and well, and you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.
miles_straume Oh my God, you guys were on Oceanic Flight 815! Wow! That better?
dr_charlotte_lewis I can't believe you're alive. How many of you are there?
hugo_reyes Why do you wanna know?
dr_charlotte_lewis Why wouldn't I wanna know?
hugo_reyes Forty-eight of us survived the crash, that's not counting the tail-section. They're pretty much all dead now...
john_locke Hugo.
dr_charlotte_lewis So you've all been living here this entire time. Is that your baby?
claire_littleton Yeah, this is Aaron.
dr_charlotte_lewis Did you have him here on the Island?
claire_littleton Mmhmm.
dr_charlotte_lewis That's amazing.
dr_charlotte_lewis Well, I've about a million more questions I want to ask you, but they can wait until we get you back to the freighter. We all got one of these transponders, so if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay?
john_locke This team of yours, how many of you are there?
dr_charlotte_lewis Four, including me.
john_locke And what happened to your helicopter?
dr_charlotte_lewis I dunno, the pilot was trying to put it down.
john_locke Where?
dr_charlotte_lewis I dunno. I had to jump, it was chaos. I'm lucky to be alive.
john_locke Get up, you're coming with us.
dr_charlotte_lewis Wha- What? We need to stay where we are so they can find us.
john_locke See, there's your problem. We don't wanna be found.
miles_straume I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you.
sayid_jarrah It can't hurt to try and call someone else.
miles_straume Oh, it can hurt.
miles_straume What'd you do?
sayid_jarrah I didn't do anything.
sayid_jarrah Your friend, Charlotte, she's moving. And she's moving fast.
dr_jack_shephard She's running from something.
sayid_jarrah According to this, she's right here.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte! Charlotte!
kate_austen Over there, over there.
kate_austen Vincent.
dr_jack_shephard Locke's got her.
TV#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 REPORTER We wanna caution our viewers that the images they are about to see are graphic in nature. Viewer discretion is advised. Authorities have released dramatic footage of the sunken remains of Oceanic Flight 815. The National Transportation Safety Board has set up a hotline for family members of the Oceanic victims. The NTSB has begun the victim identification process.
TV#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 REPORTER We have confirmation that this is the pilot, Captain Seth Norris. In a statement, the NTSB said that quote...
TV#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 REPORTER ...recovery of the bodies will be next to impossible. We can only hope that identification will provide closure to the families of the victims. Unquote.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 OPERATOR National Transportation Safety Board, Oceanic hotline.
frank_lapidus Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 OPERATOR Yes, sir, are you a family member of the deceased?
frank_lapidus No I'm not, but I got some information on the crash, may I please speak to your supervisor.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 OPERATOR Sir, if you could just tell me...
frank_lapidus Look, I'm staring at the television right now, you're broadcasting footage of the wreckage and saying that that's the pilot Seth Norris.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 OPERATOR Yes, sir?
frank_lapidus Well, that's not him.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 OPERATOR Please hold.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 VOICE Who am I speaking with?
frank_lapidus Doesn't matter who I am, you're showing footage of Seth Norris and that's not him. Listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at nineteen, he always wore his wedding ring and I'm telling you there's no ring on that body.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 VOICE Sir, it's likely the ring fell off.
frank_lapidus I'm telling you, that is not him.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 VOICE How exactly is it that you know all about Captain Norris?
frank_lapidus Because I was supposed to be flying Oceanic 815 on that day.
dr_charlotte_lewis That's them. That's somebody from my team.
dr_charlotte_lewis What's wrong with you people? We're here because of you. I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter because you called us for help.
hugo_reyes Maybe we should go see who launched that flare.
claire_littleton Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, John.
john_locke She's lying. And whatever they came for it, isn't us. We keep moving forwards as planned.
james_ford Sure! Who are we to argue with taller ghost Walt?
dr_charlotte_lewis You know what? You people do whatever you want.
john_locke I want you to come with us.
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm not asking for permission, and if you think you're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my-!
james_ford What did you do, you son of a bitch.
dr_charlotte_lewis Vest.
john_locke What?
dr_charlotte_lewis Vest. Vest.
dr_daniel_faraday Is he alive?
dr_jack_shephard I've got a pulse.
dr_daniel_faraday Frank? Frank? Hey, hey. Frank?
dr_daniel_faraday You okay?
miles_straume What happened?
frank_lapidus We got struck by lightning.
dr_daniel_faraday Frank, where's Charlotte?
frank_lapidus She bailed out just before we went down. I don't know where she is.
miles_straume Where's the chopper?
frank_lapidus I saw a cow.
miles_straume Hey, hey, Lapidus, where's the chopper? Where did it crash?
frank_lapidus Crash? The hell kind of pilot do you think I am? I put her down safe and sound, right over there.
naomi_dorrit So this is the team.
matthew_abaddon You familiarized yourself with their profiles?
naomi_dorrit Unfortunately, yes. With respect, these are the wrong people for a mission like this. None of them have field experience, military training.
naomi_dorrit You can't just drop them in unprotected. It'll be a disaster.
matthew_abaddon They're not unprotected, they have you.
naomi_dorrit There's only so much I can do.
matthew_abaddon Your modesty is positively charming.
naomi_dorrit This is a high risk covert op in unstable territory. It's dodgy enough without having to babysit a headcase, ghost buster, anthropologist and a drunk.
matthew_abaddon To be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot.
naomi_dorrit It's madness. What if we find survivors from 815?
matthew_abaddon There were no survivors.
naomi_dorrit I know, but what if there are survivors?
matthew_abaddon There were no survivors of Oceanic 815. Don't ask questions, just do what you were hired for. Every member of this team was selected for a specific purpose. Everything relies on you getting them in, getting them out, and preventing anyone from getting killed. Think you can do that?
naomi_dorrit Sure. Why not?
dr_jack_shephard Well?
sayid_jarrah There's some minor damage, but the mechanical systems are intact.
dr_jack_shephard So it'll fly then?
sayid_jarrah Absolutely.
miles_straume Can I have the phone now?
dr_jack_shephard Tell you what, I'll give you the phone if you tell me what you people are doing here.
miles_straume I'll tell you what we're doing here if you give me the phone.
dr_jack_shephard Don't say anything about your sister.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode02 Hello?
miles_straume Regina, it's Miles. I need to talk to Minkowski.
regina Minkowski can't come to the phone right now.
miles_straume It's important, go get him.
regina Miles, he can't come to the phone right now.
miles_straume Alright, have him call me when he can.
regina I gotta go.
miles_straume Whoa whoa whoa, what are you doing with her?
dr_daniel_faraday We're taking her with us.
miles_straume What's the point? That's not Naomi, it's just meat.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, we can't just leave her here.
frank_lapidus Miles is right. We burned up most of the damned fuel flying around that storm. We barely got enough to get back to the freighter, we're not carrying any unnecessary weight. I'll take her on the next run. I promise, Dan.
dr_jack_shephard There's a blanket over there by my backpack, would you get it?
kate_austen Yeah.
frank_lapidus Look as bad as it feels?
dr_juliet_burke How bad does it feel?
frank_lapidus What's your name again?
dr_juliet_burke Juliet.
frank_lapidus Juliet. Juliet what?
dr_juliet_burke Juliet Burke.
frank_lapidus Juliet Burke. You weren't on that plane, were you?
frank_lapidus Miles!
miles_straume Yeah?
frank_lapidus This is Juliet, and she was not on the plane.
miles_straume What? You sure?
frank_lapidus You know how many times I studied that damn manifest? Believe me there's no Juliet Burke on that plane. She's a native.
miles_straume Really... where is he?!
dr_jack_shephard Back off!
dr_juliet_burke Where's who?
miles_straume You wanna know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here!
miles_straume We're here for Benjamin Linus.
miles_straume Now where is he?
ben_linus James, listen to me! Please!
james_ford Keep your mouth shut!
john_locke You okay?
dr_charlotte_lewis I feel like I've got a cinder block on my chest, but I'll survive.
john_locke I'm sorry you got shot. I didn't intend for that to happen.
dr_charlotte_lewis Really? Because it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself.
john_locke What good would you be to me dead?
dr_charlotte_lewis I feel much more comfortable now. Thanks.
james_ford I guess this is the part where I'm supposed to say I told you so.
john_locke James, I stand corrected.
james_ford You want me to do it?
john_locke No, it's my mess, I'll clean it up.
alex_rousseau No, wait!
john_locke Danielle, you should escort Alex away from here.
alex_rousseau No, no!
danielle_rousseau Let's go. Come on, Alex.
karl_martin She's right, let's go.
john_locke Anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now.
claire_littleton John, we should talk about this.
john_locke Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby?
ben_linus John, listen. I have information that you need. I have answers.
john_locke What is the Monster?
ben_linus What?
john_locke The black smoke, the Monster, what is it?
ben_linus I don't know.
john_locke Then goodbye, Benjamin.
ben_linus Her name is Charlotte Lewis! Charlotte Staples Lewis. Born July second, nineteen seventy-nine, Essex, England. Parents David and Jeanette. Eldest of three, all girls. She was raised in Bromsgrove. Did her undergraduate studies at Kent. Took her PhD in Cultural Anthropology at Oxford. She's here with two other team members and a pilot. Their names Daniel Faraday, Miles Straume, and Frank Lapidus.
ben_linus Your instinct was right, John. These people are a threat, and if you shoot me you'll never know how great a threat they were. Because I know what they're doing here. I know what they want.
james_ford What do they want?
ben_linus Me, James, they want me.
john_locke How do you know all this?
ben_linus Because I have a man on their boat.
