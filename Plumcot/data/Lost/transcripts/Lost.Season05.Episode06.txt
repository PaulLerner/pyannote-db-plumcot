hugo_reyes Help! Anyone!
hugo_reyes Help, Jack!
hugo_reyes Help! Anyone!
hugo_reyes Help!
hugo_reyes Help!
hugo_reyes Help!
hugo_reyes Help!
dr_jack_shephard It's okay. You're okay. Relax.
hugo_reyes Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
hugo_reyes Oh, my God!
dr_jack_shephard We can stand.
hugo_reyes What?
dr_jack_shephard We can stand.
hugo_reyes Oh. Oh, my God. It really happened.
dr_jack_shephard Kate. Kate. Kate, can you hear me?
kate_austen Oh. Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Are you okay?
kate_austen Are we...
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. We're back.
kate_austen What happened?
eloise_hawking I thought I said all of them.
ben_linus This is all I could get on short notice.
eloise_hawking Guess it'll have to do for now. All right. Let's get started.
eloise_hawking Shall we?
dr_jack_shephard What is this place?
eloise_hawking The DHARMA Initiative called it the Lamp Post. This is how they found the island.
dr_jack_shephard Did you know about this place?
ben_linus No. No, I didn't.
dr_jack_shephard Is he telling the truth?
eloise_hawking Probably not.
eloise_hawking Aha. Here we go.
eloise_hawking All right. I apologize if this is confusing, but... Let's pay attention, yes? The room we're standing in was constructed years ago over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy. That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world. The people who built this room, however, were only interested in one.
sunhwa_kwon The Island.
eloise_hawking Yes. The island. They'd gathered proof that it existed. They knew it was out there somewhere, but they just couldn't find it. Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum on the theoretical notion that they should stop looking for where the island was supposed to be and start looking for where it was going to be.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean, "Where it was going to be"?
eloise_hawking Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly, as it turned out, that the Island was always moving. Why do you think you were never rescued? Now while the movements of the Island seem random, this man and his team created a series of equations which tell us, with a high degree of probability, where it is going to be at a certain point... in time. Windows, as it were, that while open, provide a route back. Unfortunately, these windows don't stay open for very long. Yours closes... in 36 hours.
desmond_hume Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the Island? Willingly?
sunhwa_kwon Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?
desmond_hume I came here to deliver a message. Daniel Faraday—your son—sent me here. He wanted me to tell you that he and all the people on the Island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. He said you.
eloise_hawking But I am helping, dear.
desmond_hume Consider the message delivered.
eloise_hawking I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Desmond, but the Island isn't done with you yet.
desmond_hume This woman cost me four years of my life—four years that I'll never get back because you told me that I was supposed to go to the Island! That it was my bloody purpose! You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully. These people—they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, and we are just the pieces. Whatever she tells you to do... ignore it. You say the Island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the Island.
eloise_hawking Jack... the binder in your hands shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates where I believe the Island will be in little more than a day from now. There's a commercial airliner flying from L.A. to Guam. It's going to go right through our window. Ajira Airways, Flight 316. If you have any hope of the Island bringing you back, it must be that plane. You all need to be on it. It must be that flight. If you... want to return, you need to recreate as best you can the circumstances that brought you there in the first place. That means as many of the same people as you are able to bring with you.
dr_jack_shephard And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us? What if we're it?
eloise_hawking All I can tell you is the result would be... unpredictable.
dr_jack_shephard So that's it? We just get on that flight, and we just hope that it works? That's all?
eloise_hawking No, that's not all, Jack... at least, not for you.
eloise_hawking Come on in.
dr_jack_shephard Ben and Sun-
eloise_hawking Heard what they needed to hear, and this does not concern them. Oh. Here we are.
dr_jack_shephard What's this?
eloise_hawking It's John Locke's suicide note.
dr_jack_shephard Uh... I, uh... I didn't know.
eloise_hawking Well, why would you? Obituaries don't see fit to mention when people hang themselves, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Why would he kill himself?
eloise_hawking Ohh... there are many reasons, I'm sure, but the only one that matters is this—he is going to help you get back. John is going to be a proxy. A substitute.
dr_jack_shephard A substitute for who?
eloise_hawking Jack... who do you think? You need to, as best you can, recreate the conditions of the original flight... which is why you need to give John something of your father's. You have to get something that belonged to your father, and you need to give it to John.
dr_jack_shephard What?
eloise_hawking That's what you have to do.
dr_jack_shephard My father... is gone. My father has been dead for three years. You want me to... a—and to give it to Locke?! He's in a coffin! This is ridiculous!
eloise_hawking Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is and start asking yourself whether or not you believe it's going to work. That's why it's called a leap of faith, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Sun?
ben_linus She left.
dr_jack_shephard And Locke? I mean... his body? The coffin?
ben_linus I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport. What did she say to you, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing that matters. Who is she? Why is she... helping us? How does she know all this?
ben_linus Thomas the Apostle. When Jesus wanted to return to Judea, knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, "Let us also go, that we might die with him." But Thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... when he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... that he needed to touch Jesus' wounds to be convinced.
dr_jack_shephard So was he?
ben_linus Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you going?
ben_linus Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine—just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Hello? Yeah, this is him. M—he did what?
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 This is the fourth time he's left. He's gotta follow the rules, or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I understand.
magician And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Ray.
ray_shephard Hey, Jack.
magician As for my next trick, I need someone to pick a card.
dr_jack_shephard Wanna get out of here?
ray_shephard The sooner the better.
magician Would you please pick one? Look at it.
dr_jack_shephard You wanna tell me why you took off this time, Ray?
ray_shephard Do I really need to answer that?
dr_jack_shephard Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?
ray_shephard Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.
dr_jack_shephard You packed a bag?
ray_shephard Of course I did. One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away. They won't ever find me either.
dr_jack_shephard Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, Ray.
ray_shephard But what would I do without my magic shows?
dr_jack_shephard Let me help you unpack, Granddad.
ray_shephard So how are you, kiddo? You seeing anyone special? Whatever happened to the girl that you brought by with you that time? The pretty one with all the freckles? What was her name?
dr_jack_shephard Kate. We're not together anymore.
ray_shephard Oh. Well, look at the bright side—more time to come visit me.
dr_jack_shephard I'd love to, Granddad. I really would, but... I think I might be... might be going away for a while.
ray_shephard Where's "away" exactly?
dr_jack_shephard Somewhere better than here.
ray_shephard Touché.
dr_jack_shephard Are these yours, Granddad?
ray_shephard No. Those were your father's. Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died. Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.
dr_jack_shephard These shoes... can I take them?
ray_shephard Be my guest.
dr_jack_shephard Kate? What are you doing here?
kate_austen Are you still going back to the Island?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.
kate_austen Then I'm going with you.
dr_jack_shephard Kate... what happened? Where's Aaron? Where—
kate_austen No, don't ask questions. If you want me to go with you... you'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about Aaron. Do you understand, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
kate_austen Thank you.
kate_austen Morning.
dr_jack_shephard Morning.
dr_jack_shephard Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice. You still like milk and two sugars?
kate_austen Yeah, sure. Those don't make much sense for the Island. You might want to consider hiking boots.
dr_jack_shephard Those were my father's. When I went to pick up his body in Sydney, my dad didn't have any nice shoes. My mother wanted to have the funeral as soon as I landed back in L.A. But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet? And so I—I had these old white tennis shoes, and I just said, "Use these. Put these on him." 'Cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me. Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.
kate_austen So why don't you get rid of 'em? Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?
kate_austen Go ahead. I- I'll see you at the airport, okay?
dr_jack_shephard Hello?
ben_linus Hello, Jack. Are you there?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Is everything all right?
ben_linus Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, and I need you to pick up Locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop, corner of Grand and Hayes.
dr_jack_shephard Why? Wh-what's happened to you?
ben_linus Just do it. Please.
dr_jack_shephard Are you Jill? Ben sent me.
jill I know who you are, Dr. Shephard. Come on in.
jill What's in the bag? Sorry. Ben said to give you the van. I gotta pull it around back. Give me about five minutes.
dr_jack_shephard Wherever you are, John... you must be laughing your ass off that I'm actually doing this. Because this... this is even crazier than you were. And here. You can have that back. I've already heard everything you had to say, John. You wanted me to go back. I'm going back. Rest in peace.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 ON INTERCOM Attention, passengers on flight...

MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 OVER P.A. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ajira Air. This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus, and on behalf of the entire flight crew, welcome aboard. Currently we're right on schedule, flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet. So sit back, relax and enjoy the in-flight movie.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me, ma'am?
FLIGHT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 ATTENDANT Mr. Shephard, can I help you?
dr_jack_shephard Um, I need to talk to the pilot. Frank Lapidus and I are old friends, and if you could just tell him I'm onboard, I'd really appreciate it.
FLIGHT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 ATTENDANT All right, but you just have to go sit down because you can't be near the cockpit door when it's open.
dr_jack_shephard Sure. I understand.
FLIGHT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode06 ATTENDANT Captain, I have a passenger named Jack Shephard. He says he knows you. Okay, sir.
frank_lapidus Well, hello, Doc. Small world. What are you doing going to Guam?
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing here, Frank?
frank_lapidus Well, I picked this gig up about eight months ago. I fly this route all the time. Sometimes I take the big birds into New ... Delhi. Is... that Sayid? And Hurley. Wait a second. We're not going to Guam, are we?
dr_jack_shephard How can you read?
ben_linus My mother taught me. I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing.
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
ben_linus Waiting for something to happen.
dr_jack_shephard And what is gonna happen?
ben_linus You tell me, Jack. You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.
dr_jack_shephard Did you know that Locke killed himself?
ben_linus No. No, I didn't.
dr_jack_shephard They found this stuffed in his pocket. And I've been trying to get rid of it, but it's like it's... following me. I know it sounds crazy, but... it feels like John needs me to read it.
ben_linus Why don't you then?
ben_linus Is it because you're afraid?
dr_jack_shephard Afraid of what?
ben_linus Afraid that he blames you, that it's your fault he killed himself.
dr_jack_shephard Was it my fault?
ben_linus No, Jack, it wasn't your fault. Let me give you some privacy.
hugo_reyes Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.

dr_jack_shephard I don't know. After that light, I... I woke up in the jungle.
kate_austen So this is it? It's just us?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure. Do either of you remember crashing?
hugo_reyes Crashing? No. One second, I'm being tossed around. The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.
kate_austen Where's Sun and Sayid? Where's Ben?
dr_jack_shephard All right. Let's spread out, search the jungle. We come across anybody from the plane, we'll—
