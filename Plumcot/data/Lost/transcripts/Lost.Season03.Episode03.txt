claire_littleton When did John get back? And what's he doing? Where's he been? Where's everyone else? Don't you think you should go find out?
charlie_pace So you're gone for a whole day after a massive hatch detonation -- you don't call, you don't write? Sorry, am I interrupting something?
charlie_pace What, you can't speak John? You're mute? I am sorry about that. So where are Eko and Desmond? Are they off being mute and building structures, as well? I know; you can't speak. You need to speak? To me? What do you want to--? Sand? You need to speak to the sand? Trees? Yeah, I've heard they're wonderful conversationalists. Hey! I don't understand! Who do you need to speak to? Church? Sky? Island? Island? You need to speak to the island?
charlie_pace I need your help? Since when do you need my help?
charlie_pace I need you to stand guard? Oh yeah, so you can talk to the island. Dangerous. Well, amusing as the mute game invariably is, you are aware, John, that I detest you, aren't you? You do remember repeatedly punching me in the face and accusing me of using heroin when I was not.
charlie_pace What the sodding hell is a sweat lodge?
john_locke Where you headed?
restaurant_patron Eureka.
john_locke I can get you as far as Bridgeville. Come on, hop in. Come on.
john_locke My name's John.
restaurant_patron Eddie.
john_locke Hi, Eddie.
restaurant_patron Hey.
john_locke Nasty day to be hitching.
restaurant_patron That's for sure.
john_locke You don't mind my asking -- what's in Eureka?
restaurant_patron I heard there was some work there cutting timber.
john_locke Oh, is that what you do?
restaurant_patron That might be what I do. I don't know. All I know is I had to get out of where I came from. Mom's dead. Dad's a drunk.
john_locke Hey look at that, the rain is passing.
restaurant_patron What, did you rob a bank?
john_locke Afraid so.
sheriff Can I see license and registration, please?
john_locke Was I speeding, officer?
sheriff Tail light's out. Can you both please step out of the vehicle? What you got back here?
john_locke Guns and groceries.
john_locke Now, the transactions logs and the paperwork for all of them is in the red notebook right there in that duffel. So are we free to go?
sheriff I could still take you in for picking up a hitchhiker.
restaurant_patron That's my uncle. I called him. He picked me up.
sheriff Get out of here.
restaurant_patron So what is with all the guns, uncle?
charlie_pace What's that? You're not taking drugs are you, John? I only ask because of the strict zero tolerance policy you've enacted, and I wouldn't want you to have to start punching yourself in the face.

charlie_pace Yeah, I know, I get it. You're going to go in your little magic hut and I'm going to stand out here in case you devolve into a monkey.
charlie_pace Don't come in -- okay. Okay, I get it.
boone_carlyle Hi, John. It's good to see you again. What's that, John? Oh, you're sorry. That's okay. I was the sacrifice the island demanded. Don't worry; you'll speak when you have something worth saying. I'm here to help you find your way again. So you can bring the family back together. Come on, I want to show you something.
boone_carlyle John, you're going to need that.
boone_carlyle John, someone in this airport is in serious danger. You are the only one who can save them.
boone_carlyle Not them, they'll be fine -- for a while.
boone_carlyle I think Sayid's got it.
boone_carlyle Not Hurley.
boone_carlyle Forget it. He's helping himself.
boone_carlyle There's nothing you can do for them. Not yet. First you have to clean up your own mess.
boone_carlyle Come up here, John.
boone_carlyle Clean it up, John.
boone_carlyle They've got him. You don't have much time.
charlie_pace John! What happened? Are you alright?
charlie_pace What are you doing?
john_locke I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.
charlie_pace Eko's cross.
john_locke He was dragged this way.
charlie_pace Dragged? By what?
john_locke By a polar bear.
charlie_pace Sawyer killed the polar bear.
john_locke He killed a polar bear.
charlie_pace What's that, John? Blood?
john_locke I'm going to go on alone, Charlie. You go back to Claire.
charlie_pace Well, I'll take my chances.
john_locke You don't want to go with me, Charlie. Bad things happen to people who hang around with me.
john_locke Hey, Bobby.
restaurant_patron What's that?
john_locke That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.
restaurant_patron A what?
john_locke Anybody who wants can go in there, light a fire, get it nice and hot -- meditate.
restaurant_patron Then what?
john_locke And then you're supposed to figure out what to do with your life -- you know, what direction to take -- go on in there and figure out if you're a farmer or a hunter.
restaurant_patron So, which are you, John?
john_locke Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie. He's looking for some logging work, but I convinced him to come home and have some supper with us first.
mike Nice to meet you, Eddie.
restaurant_patron Nice to meet you.
jan Any friend of John's is a friend of ours.
mike John's a very special guy.
jan Grab a spot.
mike So, you like Geronimo Jackson, huh?
restaurant_patron Uh, yeah, yeah, they're alright. It's one of my dad's old shirts.
mike Your dad has excellent taste. Listen up, people. John brought a guest to supper. So everyone, this is Eddie . Eddie, this is everyone.
restaurant_patron Nice to meet you.
mike John, you want to say some grace?
john_locke Yeah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the food and the friends. And thanks for the rain today so that Adam will stop grumbling about the drought . And for me, thank you for helping me stop being so angry. And for helping me find a real family -- because they're a hell of a lot better than the one I used to have. So, let's eat. Amen.
jan Amen, let's dig in.
restaurant_patron Thank you. Thank you.
charlie_pace Is that the hatch?
john_locke What's left of it.
charlie_pace What happened?
john_locke Looks like it imploded.
charlie_pace What's that?
john_locke It's an active kill -- meaning that whatever was eating this is going to be back for more.
charlie_pace If you want to say polar bear you can just say it.
john_locke Alright, polar bear.
john_locke Run!
hugo_reyes Dude.
hugo_reyes They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer. And they sent me back to tell everyone else that we can't ever go over there. Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch, Henry -- he was there. He's, like, their leader. So, what do we do?
john_locke Do what they told you. Go back to the camp and tell the others.
hugo_reyes You're not going to do anything?
john_locke I am doing something. Go back to the beach, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Wait, where are you guys going?
charlie_pace The island told Locke he has to save Eko.
hugo_reyes Save him from what?
charlie_pace Well, apparently, a bear's got him. It's just made an active kill. You may want to hustle.
hugo_reyes Bear? What bear?
charlie_pace What's that? More fur?
john_locke This way.
charlie_pace You know, when I used to get high, I'd watch nature programs on the Beeb. Polar bears are meant to be quite clever. Very clever. They're like the Einsteins of the bear community.
restaurant_patron She likes you, man.
john_locke She does not.
restaurant_patron Oh, yeah, she does.
john_locke She does not.
restaurant_patron Yeah, she does.
john_locke She's, like, half my age, man. You'd be better off with her.
restaurant_patron Uh-uh, no. Lizzy's too granola for me. What she really wants is a daddy -- like everyone else here. You should take advantage of that.
john_locke That's not really funny, Eddie.
restaurant_patron It was a joke. It was a joke. I'm sorry.
restaurant_patron How come you never talk about your dad, John?
john_locke Nothing worth talking about.
restaurant_patron What's going on in that greenhouse over there? Maybe they need a hand with that fertilizer?
john_locke No, no, no, no. They're okay. They're okay. Come on, we've got orchard duty.
restaurant_patron What's the big secret, John?
john_locke Sorry?
restaurant_patron The greenhouse -- what have you guys got in there? What are you hiding? Because every time I go near it, you and just about everyone else acts all weird.
john_locke Look, you're a guest here. These things take time.
restaurant_patron I've been here for 6 weeks.
john_locke Eddie, nothing's--
restaurant_patron I'm not blind, man. Did you forget you had a duffel bag full of guns when you brought me here?
john_locke Mike and Jan welcomed you here with open arms. They feed you. They give you a place to stay.
restaurant_patron And Mike and Jan fold their hands every night before chow and talk about how we're family. But your family's got too many secrets. Now, I see the fertilizer going into that greenhouse. I know what's going on, and I want in.
john_locke In on what?
restaurant_patron Whatever you guys are trying to blow up. What's so funny?
john_locke I'll talk to Mike and Jan.
charlie_pace You really think Eko's in there? Let's hurry up and do this, maybe the bear's out finishing his lunch.
john_locke You're not going in there, Charlie.
charlie_pace What?
john_locke I'm going to do this alone.
charlie_pace You don't get to tell me what I can't do. If I want to go in there, I'll go in there.
john_locke Why?
charlie_pace What?
john_locke Why do you want to go in there?
charlie_pace I don't need a reason!
john_locke Then go back.
charlie_pace You go back. You don't have a good reason to go in there either.
john_locke I'm going in there because I'm supposed to go in there.
charlie_pace If it all goes to plan, we probably won't even see the bear, will we?
john_locke And hopefully, he won't smell us.
charlie_pace Hairspray? Now, I hate to be the one to point this out to you...
john_locke It's not for me.
hugo_reyes Bear? Is that you? Who's there?
desmond_hume You alone, brother?
hugo_reyes Uh, yeah.
hugo_reyes Whoa! Dude! I'm not alone.
desmond_hume Beach camp's right over there. Can you get me some clothes?
hugo_reyes What happened to yours?
desmond_hume I woke up in the jungle like this.
hugo_reyes So, like, the hatch blew off your underwear?
desmond_hume Fine, you want to discuss this in great detail right now?! Let's do it.
hugo_reyes No, no, that's okay. I've got something in here. How do you feel about tie-dye?
john_locke Hey Kim! Hey, Mike and Jan in?
kim Yeah, they were looking for you.
john_locke Good, good. Good timing then, huh?
kim Go on in.
mike Got all the cash?
jan In the bag.
mike What bag?
jan The one with the money in it!
mike What about the bank records?
jan Leave them.
mike Shouldn't we sort out what they can trace?
jan There is no time, Mike.
john_locke What's going on?
jan What does it look like?
john_locke I don't...
mike You screwed up, John. You blew it, big-time.
john_locke What are you -- what? What are you doing? Are you leaving? Why?
jan That is why, you idiot!
mike John, your friend's a cop.
mike Do you know how much jail time we'd get for this much weed?
jan Nice picture, huh? Got him fresh out of the academy.
john_locke No -- that -- he was hitchhiking. He told me he was going to Eureka. How could he possibly--?
jan He was waiting for you, John! He has been here for 6 weeks gathering evidence because you brought him here.
john_locke Mike, that's impossible.
mike He played you for a sucker. Now it's over.
john_locke No, wait. No, wait, wait. Stop! We don't know what he's told them. He hasn't even been in here yet. If he's still gathering evidence and trying to make a case then it's not too late.
jan Not too late for what?
john_locke To protect us. To protect all of us. It's not too late to fix this. I can fix this.
mike How are you going to do that, John? Huh?
john_locke Eko!
mr_eko John.
charlie_pace Is he okay? Is he alive? Is he alright?
john_locke He's alive.
charlie_pace Turn him over. Turn him over.
john_locke Charlie, we've got to get out of here.
charlie_pace Okay, let's get him up.
hugo_reyes So, when you say "turn the key" you mean like key, key?
desmond_hume It was a failsafe key.
hugo_reyes That seems kind of convenient.
desmond_hume I'm sorry?
hugo_reyes I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time why didn't you, like, use it?
desmond_hume I didn't know what would happen.
hugo_reyes So what did happen?
desmond_hume The failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly -- made the hatch implode.
hugo_reyes You didn't implode.
desmond_hume No.
hugo_reyes You're not going to, like, turn into the Hulk, or something. So is that what made the blender noise? And the sky turn purple?
desmond_hume I'm afraid I missed that, brother.
hugo_reyes Right, you were failsafing. Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated. And Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too, right before they got bags pulled over their heads.
desmond_hume Don't worry. Locke's going to go after them. He said so in his speech.
hugo_reyes What? What speech? All he said was he was going to go save Eko and kill bears.
desmond_hume Right. Right, of course. I'm sorry. I'm just a bit shook up.
john_locke I burned that bear pretty good. I don't think he's going to be coming after us.
charlie_pace Now that we've survived this suicide mission are you going to tell me what you saw?
john_locke What I saw?
charlie_pace In the spirit tent.
john_locke I saw Boone.
charlie_pace Boone? What did he have to say for himself?
john_locke He told me I had to clean up my own mess.
charlie_pace Well, dead as he may be, I agree with Boone. If you kept pushing that button like Eko told you to...
john_locke We wouldn't have had to save him in the first place. Yeah, Charlie, that's what cleaning up your own mess means.
charlie_pace Spoken like someone who's had a few too many messes to clean.
restaurant_patron No deer, huh?
john_locke Nope.
restaurant_patron You talk to Mike and Jan yet?
john_locke Yeah, I sure did.
restaurant_patron What did they say?
john_locke They said that I should bring you by the greenhouse tonight after supper and that they would explain everything.
restaurant_patron Cool, that's great.
restaurant_patron What, did you see something?
restaurant_patron John? What are you doing?
john_locke Did you know it would be me?
restaurant_patron What?
john_locke In the truck? Did you know it would be me driving? Did they choose me?
restaurant_patron They? John, I have no idea what you're talking about.
john_locke I didn't load that one. So how about you just answer the question, Eddie?
restaurant_patron Yeah, they chose you, John.
john_locke Why?
restaurant_patron Because you hadn't been here long, didn't have a criminal record, and psyche profiles said you would be amenable for coercion.
john_locke Amenable for coercion?
restaurant_patron Hey! Lower the gun, John. Okay? This isn't personal.
john_locke What's not personal?!
john_locke Stop. Stop.
restaurant_patron I'm sorry, John, but you're not going to shoot me. You're not a murderer. You're a good man. You're a farmer.
john_locke Nope. Not a farmer. I was a hunter. I'm a hunter.
restaurant_patron I'm going to walk away now, John.
charlie_pace Hey, John? You hear something?
john_locke It sounds like a stream.
charlie_pace Yeah.
john_locke Let's put him down -- maybe get some water in him.
charlie_pace I'll go. You stay here.
john_locke I'm sorry. Sorry I ever doubted you. Sorry I gave up on my faith in the island. I messed up. Now our people are captured -- if I'd just listened to you -- if I'd just let you keep pushing the button. I could have gone with them, protected them. I could have saved them.
mr_eko You can still protect them. You can still save them.
john_locke I don't even know where they are.
mr_eko You will find them. After all, you are a hunter, John.
charlie_pace Did you say something?
john_locke He's awake. Eko? Eko?
charlie_pace Maybe we should just get him back, John.
john_locke Yeah.
charlie_pace You alright?
john_locke Yeah, just keep walking.
charlie_pace Hey!
claire_littleton John? Charlie?
paulo What happened?
charlie_pace We got him.
hugo_reyes Is he alive?
nikki_fernandez We need Jack.
john_locke Take him in.
hugo_reyes Jack's not coming back. They've got him.
claire_littleton What? What are you talking about, Hurley?
nikki_fernandez Jack's gone? I don't understand. Okay, when were you planning on telling us this, Hurley?
paulo What do you mean "they"? Who's "they"?
john_locke They are the Others. And, yes, they've taken Jack, and Kate and Sawyer.
paulo How? What happened?
claire_littleton What about Sun and Jin and Sayid? Are they okay?
john_locke I don't know. I'm going to find our friends. I don't know how yet, but I will. We're going to find them. All of them. And then we're going to bring them home. But first things first, we've got to look out for Mr. Eko. So, Paulo and Nikki, bring towels and water. Claire, we've got to clean him up so bring all the first aid supplies.
charlie_pace Not a bad speech.
hugo_reyes Whoa.
charlie_pace Whoa, what?
hugo_reyes I just got hit with, you know, deja vu.
charlie_pace Okay. Well, when that wears off can you get bandages from the kitchen?
