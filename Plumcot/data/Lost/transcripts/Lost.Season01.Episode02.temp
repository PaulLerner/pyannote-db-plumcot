CHARLIE Anything?
JACK You keep asking if there's anything.
CHARLIE Pardon me for appearing desperate, but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit, he did say that no-one's going to find us unless we … get that transceiver working. So... is there anything?
JACK No.
CHARLIE Okay.
KATE What were you doing? In the bathroom?
CHARLIE I thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one tangible contribution to the trek.
KATE No. I'm glad you came. Charlie.
CHARLIE Every trek needs a coward.
KATE You're not a coward.
CINDY You all right, sir?
CHARLIE I'm good. Thanks.
CINDY Can I get you a water, or…
CHARLIE I'm fine. Thank you. Please?
CINDY All right.
CHARLIE Excuse me.
ROSE Guess he really had to go.
CINDY Sir, excuse me! Sir, excuse me!
SHANNON Excuse me?
CINDY Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
JD Sir, are you all right?
CHARLIE Just a minute. Just a minute.
JD I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.
JD Open the door now, sir. Sir!
BOONE Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them. I see you found your bag. Come on, you want to give us a hand?
SHANNON Not really. You're wasting your time. They're coming.
CLAIRE Is that your boyfriend?
SHANNON My brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
CLAIRE I used to have a stomach.
SHANNON You know what it is?
CLAIRE Not yet. I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
MICHAEL Uh, excuse me. Hey, uh … have you, uh ... have you seen my boy?
SUN 죄송해요. 저 영어 못 해요. 아 … 저, 제가 영어를 못 해요.
JIN 윗 단추가 열렸네. 채워라. 빨리!
MICHAEL I'm sorry. Walt! Walt?
WALT Vincent! Vincent! Come here, boy!
MICHAEL Hey! What did I tell you? After everything that's happened!
WALT I thought that maybe Vincent would be around!
MICHAEL I told you to stay on the beach!
WALT This is so close to the beach, I thought this would be okay…
MICHAEL Don't do that. You listen to me. I mean what I say. You understand?
MICHAEL What is this?
WALT I just found it.
MICHAEL Come here.
MICHAEL Hey guys. Come on, man. Hey.
JACK Hey. Break it up. Break it up! Come on! That's it! It's over! That's it!
SAWYER Son of a bitch!
SAYID I'm sick of this redneck!
SAWYER You want some more of me, boy?
SAYID Tell everyone what you told me! Tell them that I crashed the plane! Go on! Tell them I made the plane crash!
SAWYER The shoe fits, buddy!
JACK What is going on?
SAYID Ibn Al-Kalb!
JACK What's going on?
MICHAEL Look, my kid found these in the jungle.
SAWYER And this guy was sitting in the back row of business class, the whole flight, never got up. Hands folded underneath the blanket.
SAYID Oh.
SAWYER And for some reason - just pointin' this out - the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it.
SAYID Thank you so much for observing my behavior.
SAWYER You don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
SAWYER Come on, bring it!
KATE Stop!
KATE We found the transceiver, but it's not working. Can anybody help?
SAYID Yes. I might be able to.
SAWYER Oh great. Perfect! Let's trust this guy!
HURLEY Hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect.
SAWYER Shut up, Lardo.
JACK Hey! Give it a break.
SAWYER Whatever you say, doc. You're the hero.
BOONE You guys found the cockpit? Any survivors?
JACK No.
SAYID It's dual band, military spec. Chances are, the battery is good, but - the radio is dead.
KATE Can you fix it?
SAYID I need some time.
ROSE Doctor, the... man with the shrapnel, I... I think you should take a look at him.
HURLEY Tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
SAYID Some people have problems.
HURLEY Tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
SAYID You're okay, too.
HURLEY Hurley. Uh, just…
SAYID Sayid.
HURLEY How do you know to do all that?
SAYID I was a military communications officer.
HURLEY Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
SAYID I fought in the Gulf War.
HURLEY No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - Air Force... Army?
SAYID The Republican Guard.
SUN 실례합니다. 준비 다 됐나 봐요. 당신을 찾아요.
KATE Is it working?
SAYID Seems to be. Except we're not picking up a signal.
KATE Why do we need to pick up a signal? Aren't we trying to send one?
SAYID Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars. The bars would show the radio is getting reception.
KATE We need the bars.
SAYID We could broadcast blind... Hope that someone—maybe a ship somewhere—picks up our distress call. But that could be a waste of the battery, which might not last that long. There is one thing we could try...
KATE What?
SAYID Seeing if we can get a signal from high ground.
KATE How high?
KATE How is he? Can you do anything?
JACK Pull out the shrapnel.
KATE But you said yesterday that if you took it out...
JACK I know. But that was yesterday. I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now. If I leave him like this, he'll be dead within a day. If I open him up... if I can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if I can find some antibiotics... he might be all right.
KATE I'm going on a hike.
JACK Sorry?
KATE Sayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it. Not from here.
JACK Kate, wait a minute.
KATE You're the one who said that we had to send out a signal.
JACK Look, you saw what that thing did to the pilot.
KATE Yeah, I did. What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
JACK Wait for me. I don't know how long this will be... 
KATE Sayid said the batteries won't last.
JACK All right. If you see, or hear, anything... Anything. Run.
HURLEY What's that? What, that? What, eat that? Dude. Dude. I'm... starving... But, I'm nowhere near that hungry. No. No. No, thank you! No way, no. 
MICHAEL The comic's in Spanish. You... read Spanish?
WALT No. I found it.
MICHAEL Tell you what We get home... I get you another dog.
JACK Hey! I need your help.
HURLEY Okay.
JACK I need you to help me go through the luggage. I need any kind of prescription medications you can find. Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin. Those are antibiotics.
HURLEY What's this for?
BOONE What are you doing?
SHANNON I think I was mean to him.
BOONE What?
SHANNON Isn't that the guy from the gate? He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class. He saved our lives.
BOONE Come on, Shannon, we're trying to clear some of the wreckage. You should help out. You're just being worthless over here.
SHANNON I'm being what?
BOONE What do you want me to say? You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
SHANNON I've just been through a trauma here, okay?
BOONE We've all been through a trauma. The only difference is, since the crash, you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
SHANNON You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it. I get it.
BOONE I wish I didn't have to waste my time making fun of you. I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.
SHANNON Screw you, you do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.
BOONE I have a much better idea than you think I do.
SHANNON No, you don't!
BOONE Okay, Shannon. Then what are you thinking?
SHANNON I'm going with them. On the hike.
BOONE Yeah?
SHANNON Yup. I'm going.
BOONE No, you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
SHANNON I'd like to come with you.
BOONE She's not going. She doesn't want to go.
SHANNON The hell I'm not.
BOONE It's what she does. She postures.
SHANNON You don't know what the hell I do!
BOONE Makes really bad decisions to upset her family, which, at the moment, is me.
SHANNON Shut up, and stop trying to be charming. I'm coming with you.
KATE I don't... know if that's such a good idea.
SHANNON What are you? Two years older than me? Please. You're going, aren't you?
CHARLIE Yeah, are you?
SHANNON Yup.
CHARLIE Yeah, I'm definitely going.
KATE Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
CHARLIE You couldn't tell from that, but she's actually really nice.
KATE You decided to join us.
SAWYER I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
MICHAEL What you're looking for?
JACK Some sort of blade. How's your son?
MICHAEL Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.
JACK How old is he?
MICHAEL Nine... Ten—Ten. Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. The dog was on the plane, so... Kids, you know.
JACK Is it a Lab?
MICHAEL Yeah.
JACK Yeah? I saw him yesterday, in the jungle.
MICHAEL What? Where?
JACK Over there. Couple hundred yards in or so. He looked good.
WALT What is it, like checkers?
LOCKE Not really, it's a better game than... checkers. You play checkers with your Pop?
WALT No. I live in Australia with my mom.
LOCKE You have no accent.
WALT Yeah, I know. We move a lot. She got sick. She died a couple of weeks ago.
LOCKE You're having a bad month.
WALT I guess.
LOCKE Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Archeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of ancient Mesopotamia. Five thousand years old. That's older than Jesus Christ.
WALT Did they have dice and stuff?
LOCKE Mhhm. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
WALT Cool.
LOCKE Two players. Two sides. One is light... one is dark. Walt, do you want to know a secret?
CLAIRE No. Tha- thank you. No, it's okay. No, really. Okay. Thanks.
CLAIRE Oh, gosh. I just felt it. I ju … Come here, feel this. Please. . Please. Please. Do you feel that? There! Right there, that's a kick! There! There, right there's a foot! Oh no, he's, wait, he's moving around. "He". "He". I guess I think you're a "he".
SAWYER Okay! Wide open space! You should check the radio, see if we're good.
SAYID We're not going to have any reception here.
SAWYER Just try it.
SAYID I don't want to waste the batteries.
SAWYER I'm not asking you to keep it on all day.
SAYID We're still blocked by the mountain.
SAWYER Just check the damn radio!
SAYID If I just check.. we might not have any juice left when we get to...
SHANNON My god.
BOONE What the hell's that?
KATE Something's coming.
CHARLIE It's coming towards us, I think.
KATE Come on, let's move.
SHANNON I shouldn't have come. Aah!
SAYID Go! Go!
KATE Sawyer!
SAYID Let him go!
SHANNON That's... that's a big bear.
BOONE You think that's what killed the pilot?
CHARLIE No. No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
KATE Guys, this isn't just a... bear. That's a polar bear.
HURLEY You sure he's out?
JACK He's out.
HURLEY How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
JACK I don't.
HURLEY Hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay! Yeah, he's out. So—what do you want me...
JACK Look, it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness. But the pain might bring him around. And if it does, I need you to hold him down.
HURLEY Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
JACK Then don't look.
HURLEY Yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
JACK Just do the best you can. Okay? Don't look.
HURLEY Okay .
HURLEY Dude.
JACK Hand me those strips.
HURLEY Dude.
JACK Just hand me the strips, I need to get this bleeding stopped.
HURLEY I don't think I can.
JACK Oh.
HURLEY "Oh" what? What, what's going on, something in there? 
JACK The strips. Just hand me the strips. Give it to me. Don't even think about it, Hurley. Don't even think a... Hurley! Hey! Damn it!
BOONE That can't be a polar bear.
SAYID and KATE It's a polar bear.
SHANNON Yeah, but... Polar bears don't usually live in the jungle.
CHARLIE Spot on.
SAYID No, polar bears don't live near this far south.
BOONE This one does.
SAWYER Did. It did.
KATE Where did that come from?
SAWYER Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
KATE Not the bear. The gun.
SAWYER I got if off one of the bodies.
SAYID One of the bodies.
SAWYER Yeah, one of the bodies.
SHANNON People don't carry guns on planes.
SAWYER They do if they're a US Marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
KATE How do you know that?
SAWYER I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. I thought it might come in handy. Guess what? I just shot a bear!
KATE So why do you think he's a Marshal?
SAWYER Because he had a clip-on badge. I took that too. Thought it was cool.
SAYID I know who you are. You're the prisoner.
SAWYER I'm the what?
SAYID You found a gun on a US Marshal. Yes, I believe you did. You knew where it was, because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun.
SAWYER Piss off.
SAYID That's who you are, you son of a bitch.
SAWYER Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.
SAYID But you are the prisoner.
SAWYER Fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist. We can all play a part. Who do you want to be?
KATE Does anybody know how to use a gun?
CHARLIE I think you just pull the trigger.
SAYID Don't use the gun.
KATE I want to take it apart.
CHARLIE Oh.
SAYID There's a button on the grip. Push that, it will eject the magazine. There's still a round in the chamber. Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
SAWYER I know your type.
KATE I'm not so sure.
SAWYER Yeah. I've been with girls like you.
KATE No girl's exactly like me.
MICHELLE Can I get you a refill?
KATE No, I'm... I'm fine with this, thank you.
MICHELLE You, sir? Can I get you anything? Cocktail? Soda?
MARSHAL Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
MICHELLE Coffee. Sure.
MARSHAL You look worried. I'd be worried too, I was you. But you've got to stay positive, kiddo. You know, there's always that off chance that they'll believe your story. I know I sure do.
KATE I don't care what you believe.
MARSHAL Oh, I know. That's true. That has always been true. You sure you don't want some more juice?
KATE Yeah, I'm sure.
CINDY Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
KATE I have one favor to ask.
MARSHAL Really? This ought to be good. What...
[The turbulence causes the big drop with a woman hitting the ceiling. A big black/silver case hits the Marshal on the head. He passes out. The masks come down and Kate can't reach because of the handcuffs. She gets the key from the Marshal's pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. She puts her mask on and then puts a mask on the Marshal. The back of the plane rips off.
SAYID We should keep moving.
JACK No. No.
MARSHAL Where is she?
JACK Who?
SAWYER Oh! Now's a good time to check the radio! Not before.. but now!
SAYID We're up higher.
SAWYER Yes, we are!
SAYID Bar. Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday! 
KATE What is that?
SAYID Feedback.
KATE Feedback from what? What would do that?
SAYID I don't know.
SAWYER I'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio. This thing doesn't even work.
SAYID No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken. We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
CHARLIE Transmitting from where?
SHANNON What?
SAYID Somewhere close. The signal's strong.
CHARLIE Somewhere close? You mean on the Island? That's great!
BOONE Maybe it's other survivors.
SHANNON From our plane? How would they even—
SAWYER What kind of transmission is it?
SAYID Could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal...
KATE Can we listen to it?
SAYID Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
SAWYER There's no transmission.
KATE Shut up.
CHARLIE The rescue party. It has to be. . It's French! The French are coming! I've never been so happy to hear the French!
KATE I never took French. What does she say?
SAYID D-Does anybody speak French?
BOONE She does.
SHANNON No, I don't. What?
BOONE What the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in Paris!
SHANNON Drinking, not studying!
RADIO Iteration 7294531.
CHARLIE Okay. What's that?
SAYID Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
KATE "No, no, no" what?
SHANNON What "no"?
SAYID The-the batteries are dying!
KATE How much time do we have?
SAYID Not much.
BOONE I've heard you speak French! Just listen to this! Listen to it!
SHANNON I can't!
SAWYER You speak French or not? Because that would be nice.
RADIO Iteration 17294532.
CHARLIE That voice is weird. What is that?
BOONE Come on. Come on, Shannon!
KATE Come on!
SAYID Come on!
SHANNON It's... it's repeating.
SAYID She's right.
BOONE What?
SAYID It's a loop. "Iteration"—it's repeating the same message. It's a counter. The next number will end... "533".
RADIO Iteration 17294533.
SAWYER Does anyone know what the hell he's talking about?
SAYID It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... how long... .
SAWYER Don't forget to carry the one, chief.
RADIO Iteration 17294534.
SHANNON She's saying .. "Please". She's saying, "Please help me. Please, come get me."
SAWYER Or she's not! You don't even speak French!
KATE Let her listen!
BOONE Shut up, man!
CHARLIE Guys, the battery. The battery.
RADIO Iteration 17294535.
SHANNON I'm alone now. Uhm... On the Island alone. Please, someone come. The others, they're... they're dead. I-it killed them. I-it killed them all.
BOONE That was good.
SAYID Sixteen years.
SAWYER What?
SAYID Sixteen years. And five months. That's the count.
BOONE What the hell are you talking about?
SAYID The iterations. It's a distress call. A plea for help. A mayday. If the count is right... It's been playing over... and over... for sixteen years.
BOONE Someone else? Was stranded here?
KATE Maybe they came for them.
SAWYER If someone came, why is it still playing?
CHARLIE Guys. Where are we?
