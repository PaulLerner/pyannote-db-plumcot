MICHAEL John, John, I was hoping I could borrow one of these guns.
LOCKE Is it supposed to be a secret?
MICHAEL Jack's asleep.
LOCKE More target practice?
MICHAEL Well, you know, just want to stay sharp. 
LOCKE You got a date?
MICHAEL No. Old habits, you know.
LOCKE Yes, I do.
MICHAEL Thanks, man. Hey, can I just get a couple of these bullets? I promise I won't...
MICHAEL Damn! I'm sorry...
LOCKE Naw, that's alright. I got it.
MICHAEL Come on. Where are you?
MICHAEL You okay?
MONITOR ok, no time, come soon?
MICHAEL I'm ready. Coming NOW. You said north -- north WHERE?
MONITOR when they take me out. there's huge rocks with a big HOLE in the middle by the beach. you'll know when you see.
MICHAEL It's gonna be okay. I'm coming.
MICHAEL I'm coming, Walt.
JACK Locke.
JACK John.
MICHAEL Stay in there. Stay.
JACK Michael, what are you...
MICHAEL Stay in there, Jack!
JACK Hey, whatever's going on...
MICHAEL Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son and nobody is going to stop me, okay. Okay, that is my right. That is a father's right.
JACK Hey. What are you doing out here?
MICHAEL Nothing. Just getting some air.
JACK Come on. We should talk.
JACK How many?
SAWYER Rifles and pistols? 11 total.
JACK That's it?
SAWYER That's it. In case you forgot, they took 5 of 'em right off us.
JACK How long would it take us to get to their camp?
MICHAEL We leave now, move fast? Middle of the night tomorrow. Look, they have no idea I know where they are. They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go. Right now. Just the 5 of us.
JACK No, no, 5 is not enough. You said there's at least 20 of them. They've got our guns and we're not even sure if what you saw was...
MICHAEL Hey, I know what I saw! We take too many people, they'll hear us coming. I'm not taking a damn army across the Island, Jack.
JACK Michael, you sure you're in the best place to be making decisions for all of us right now?
MICHAEL You got a son, Jack?
HURLEY They're dead! Ana Lucia and Libby are dead. I mean, we haven't even buried them yet.
JACK Me and you will take Libby, okay. Can you?
KATE Yeah, of course.
JACK Sawyer, would you?
SAWYER Yeah.
JACK You should stay here. We'll bury them tonight, then we'll figure out what's next.
MICHAEL Hey, put your hands up. Put 'em up! Don't move.
PICKETT Relax buddy. I ain't movin'. Why don't you just put that down...
MICHAEL Shut up!
PICKETT You're Walt's old man, aren't you?
MICHAEL What?
TOM What are you doing?! We need him.
TOM Bag him quick. His friends are right behind us.
EKO Hello.
MICHAEL I didn't hear you come in, man.
EKO I left my shoes outside. They were muddy.
MICHAEL Did you find him? Henry?
EKO No.
MICHAEL I hear you're a priest.
EKO Yes.
MICHAEL I guess you believe in hell, then.
EKO For a brief time I served in a small parish in England. Every Sunday after Mass, I would see a young boy waiting in the back of the church. And then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said that the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek; and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand -- that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell -- that dog would be there waiting for him.
JACK Hey, are you alright?
MICHAEL Yeah.
JACK I was coming back to check on you.
MICHAEL Yeah, man. I had to get out of there. Just -- I have to get my son back.
JACK We're going to help you do that, Michael.
MICHAEL But, it's got to be the way I said, man. Just the 5 of us. Otherwise, it won't work. It won't work.
JACK I promise. We're going to figure that out.
MICHAEL No, I already have figured it out. It's got to be just the people who already know. You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley. That's it. Anybody else -- look, it puts him in more danger. You don't get to decide this. It's my son. It's my call. And that's the way it has to be.
JACK Then that's the way it'll be.
CHARLIE Hey. Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy. Hi. Have you seen Eko?
CLAIRE No.
CHARLIE You know, we're building a church.
CLAIRE Is there something you want, Charlie?
CHARLIE Yeah, I found something on the pallet I thought you might need.
CLAIRE Vaccine?
CHARLIE I don't know what we need a vaccine for, but I figured if anyone should have it, you and the baby should. It's alright. It's a pneumatic injector. You just put into your leg and it goes right in. Quite painless, really.
CLAIRE You seem to know a lot about it.
CHARLIE I tried it. I wanted to make sure it was safe before giving it to you and the baby.
CLAIRE Well, how do you feel? I mean, did it do anything? What did it, what did it do?
CHARLIE I feel fine. Anyway, it says you're supposed to give yourself a shot every 9 days. Alright? So, there's enough here for you and the baby for a while. That's it. I'll put it -- I'll put it... .
CLAIRE Thank you.
CHARLIE Welcome.
CLAIRE I should really feed him.
CHARLIE Yeah. Hey, Claire, did you think that maybe you and I could...
CLAIRE Oh my God! Michael's back.
SUN 여보, 여기도. ...Michael?
JIN 야! 너무 반갑다, 그 동안 얼마나 걱정했는데! 괜찮아? Okay?
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah. It's good to see you, too.
SUN Are you alright?
MICHAEL Yeah, I am. It's just -- I'm fine.
SUN 어머나! 어떻게 된 거야? Who?
MICHAEL Ana Lucia and Libby.
JIN 아니, 어떻게...?
SUN What happened to them?
MICHAEL They were murdered.
TOM Hey there, Michael. Not going to hold that against you. Fair's fair. I took your boy. But don't do that again, okay.
MICHAEL Where is he you son-of-a-bitch?
PICKETT Hey, look at what I found? She was following her friend about a half a click behind us.
TOM You make one sound you'll never see your boy again. Gag him. Get ready with the torches. I'm going to talk to her people.
LOCKE I think we'd better head back.
SAWYER What?
JACK Just find the trail, John.
LOCKE I've lost the trail.
JACK You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
LOCKE Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running through the jungle, toward the sounds of gunfire, because I don't care about Michael.
JACK You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
TOM You're exactly right, Jack.
JACK Who are you?
SAWYER He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft. 
TOM Why don't you point the gun down?
ALEX It's okay. He's just delivering a message. He has to scare your friends to do it.
JACK I don't believe you.
TOM You don't believe what?
JACK I think there's more of us than there are of you.
TOM That's an interesting theory. Light 'em up!
TOM Give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
JACK No.
TOM I hoped it wouldn't come to this. Bring her out, Alex!
PICKETT Go on.
ALEX You.
PICKETT Come on, Alex.
ALEX Please?
PICKETT Let's go. Up. 
ALEX Is Claire okay? Did she have the baby? Is it okay? Is it a boy or a girl?
TOM Like I said -- curiosity. 
SAWYER You and me ain't done, Zeke.
TOM His friends are going home. Divvy 'em up.
ALEX Sorry.
SAWYER What do you say, Doc? Here I was thinking the Irish drink when somebody dies. 
JACK I'm not Irish.
SAWYER Neither am I. So what happened out there in the jungle?
JACK Exactly what he said happened -- he found their camp...
SAWYER I ain't talking about Mike. You and Freckles -- before you found him you all were gone all night.
JACK We were caught in a net.
SAWYER What the hell is that supposed to mean?
JACK It means we got caught in a net.
SAWYER Is that what they're calling it these days?
SAYID Is it true -- Henry's gone?
JACK Yeah.
SAYID Who's going after him?
JACK Locke and Eko went out in the middle of the night, but...
SAWYER But we haven't seen either of them since.
SAYID Those are the guns, aren't they? What are you doing with them?
SAWYER What do you think we're doing? It's time to finish this.
SAYID When do we leave?
SAWYER In the morning.
JACK You're not coming, Sayid.
SAYID Excuse me?
JACK Michael wants to keep it small. Me, Kate, Hurley, and him.
SAWYER Yeah, well, him says even though Pippy Longstocking and the damn Grape Ape are ideal candidates for the Dirty Dozen -- I'm just going to say we might just want to bring the Red Beret.
JACK It's Michael's call. He knows where we're going.
SAYID It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.
SAWYER Welcome aboard.
CHARLIE So, you wake up in the middle of the night; you grab your Jesus stick; you race off into the jungle. You don't call; you don't write?
EKO I'm sorry. I had work to do.
CHARLIE Right, yeah.
EKO Charlie, would you do me a favor? I was hoping you could bring my things from the beach here.
CHARLIE What for? You moving in here? Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?
EKO Yes. I'm moving in here.
CHARLIE Well, what about the church? You said we were supposed to be building it together, man.
EKO I am supposed to do something different now.
CHARLIE What am I supposed to do?
EKO Bring me my things.
CHARLIE Bring your own things.
EKO Charlie, please.
CHARLIE You better leg it, mate. Clock's ticking.
SAWYER Got some good news for you. Captain Arab's in too. Cavalry rides at sunrise.
MICHAEL You told Sayid?
SAWYER Yeah, I told Sayid.
MICHAEL You shouldn't have done that!
SAWYER Oh, well I'm sorry. I just figure if we're going to war, we'd want the one guy who's actually been in a war. That a problem?
MICHAEL No, it's not a problem.
SAWYER Alright then.
PICKETT Get up.
MICHAEL Get off of me!
MR. FRIENDLY You got a problem, Michael?
MICHAEL You march me day and night without any rest. Yeah, my problem is I'm tired.
MR. FRIENDLY Well, I'd offer to knock you out and carry you, but we're here.
MR. FRIENDLY Put him right over here. Tell her we're here.
PICKETT I can't promise this won't hurt. 
MICHAEL Ow, damn it!
PICKETT Relax, just taking some blood.
MICHAEL Taking some blood for what? Who are you people? Where's my son?
PICKETT That's it; all done. See you in the funny pages. 
MS. KLUGH Hello, Michael.
MICHAEL Where's my son?
MS. KLUGH My name is Ms. Klugh. I was hoping you might help me answer some questions. About Walt.
MICHAEL Where is he?
MS. KLUGH Is he your biological son?
MICHAEL What?
MS. KLUGH Are you his father?
MICHAEL Yes, I'm his...
MS. KLUGH How old was he when he started speaking?
MICHAEL I, he...
MS. KLUGH Did he have any illnesses growing up? Headaches? Fainting spells?
MICHAEL What? No! I don't -- I wasn't there. He was half way around the world. Why are you asking me all these questions?
MS. KLUGH Did Walt ever appear in a place he wasn't supposed to be? You say he was half way around the world -- did you see him?
MICHAEL I want my son! You bring him to me right now! I want to see my boy!
MS. KLUGH For someone who wants his son back so badly, you don't seem to know much about him, Michael.
MICHAEL Hey, you're not coming.
SAYID Welcome back, Michael.
MICHAEL Look, I know Sawyer told you, alright. But, it's not going to work. You're not coming.
SAYID And why is it that I'm not coming?
MICHAEL Because you're going after the guy that escaped. And I'm going after my son.
SAYID Are you implying I'd let a desire for revenge compromise Walt's safety?
MICHAEL I'm implying that I decide who stays and who goes; and you stay. I know you want to help, right? But I've got to do this my way.
SAYID Of course. Good luck, Michael.
CHARLIE Bloody hell.
CHARLIE Are you kidding me? Did someone put you up to this?
JACK You were supposed to come right back. You were out in the jungle all night. What happened?
EKO We were unable to find Henry's trail.
JACK Yeah, I got that. Where's Locke?
EKO I do not know.
JACK We're burying Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.
EKO Thank you. I will mourn them in my own way.
SAWYER Who's going to talk?
JACK What?
SAWYER The funeral. Who's going to talk?
JACK I'm sure Hurley will want to say something about Libby.
SAWYER I never even knew her last name. Ana Lucia.
JACK It's Cortez.
SAWYER Cortez, there you go. I screwed her.
JACK What?
SAWYER That's how she got my gun. Ana, she jumped me. We got caught in a net.
JACK Why are you telling me this, Sawyer?
SAWYER Because you're about the closest thing I've got to a friend, Doc. And because she's gone. Well, at least now we get to kill to somebody.
MICHAEL Jack fill you in on the plan?
KATE What plan?
MICHAEL We're leaving first thing tomorrow -- back across the Island to their camp.
KATE Okay.
MICHAEL What about you, man? You coming with us?
HURLEY Why would I want to go?
MICHAEL Because they killed her!
KATE Michael, come on.
MICHAEL What do you say, Hugo?
HURLEY I'm sorry about Walt, dude. But I'm not coming.
MICHAEL You're sorry...!
KATE Michael.
MS. KLUGH Dinner time.
MICHAEL When are you going to do it?
MS. KLUGH When am I going to do what?
MICHAEL Kill me. I've seen where you live. I know how to get here. You have been asking me asking me questions I don't know the answer to for a week. I don't even think my son is alive.
MS. KLUGH He is alive, Michael. He's standing outside right now.
MICHAEL What, do you think I'm stupid?
MS. KLUGH There's been a development since you came here, Michael. One of our people was captured by yours.
MICHAEL So, go get him back.
MS. KLUGH We can't do that. But you can. And if you do, we'll let you and Walt go free.
MICHAEL I want to see my son.
MS. KLUGH Michael...
MICHAEL I want to see him! If he is out there you bring him in! You bring him in here right now!!
MS. KLUGH Pickett! You have 3 minutes.
MICHAEL Walt.
WALT Dad.
MICHAEL Let him go! Let him go! Get your hands off him, right now!
WALT Dad, don't.
MICHAEL Are you okay?
WALT Yeah.
MICHAEL I just -- did they hurt you?
WALT They make me take tests.
MICHAEL They make you what?!
MS. KLUGH We're not going to talk about that.
WALT How's Vincent?
MICHAEL Vincent, he's great. He's great. He misses you. Hey don't, don't, don't be scared, man. Don't be scared. It's going to be over real soon, okay? I'm going to get you out of here, okay?
WALT They're not who they say they are. They're pretending.
MS. KLUGH Walt! You want me to put you in the room again?
MICHAEL Pretending? Pretending what?
MS. KLUGH That's it. We're done.
MICHAEL No, wait. Hey wait, wait, wait. Come here, Walt. Wait, come here, Walt.
WALT Dad, don't leave me. Help me, please! Don't leave me!
MICHAEL I won't, man. I'm going to take -- I'm going to get you out of here. I promise you, I will get you out of here.
WALT Dad! Dad!
MICHAEL Let him go! Walt wait! Let go of him!
WALT I love you!
MICHAEL Walt, I'm going to get you out of here!
WALT I love you!
MICHAEL Walt, I love you too, Walt!
WALT Let me go! Let me go!
MICHAEL I'm going to get you out of here.
MS. KLUGH After you release our man, I'm going to need you to do something else.
MICHAEL Whatever you want.
MS. KLUGH I'm writing 4 names down -- 4 of your friends. We need you to bring them here. You have to bring only these 4 people, Michael. Just them. If you don't bring all the people on the list, you'll never see Walt again.
MICHAEL Okay, okay.
MS. KLUGH Do you understand, Michael?
MICHAEL Yes. What do I tell them.
MS. KLUGH Doesn't matter. Make up a story. They'll be angry enough to believe whatever you say.
MICHAEL Who's James Ford?
MS. KLUGH You know him as Sawyer. You know the rest of them?
MICHAEL Yeah. I know them. If I do all this -- if I do what you say...
MS. KLUGH You get your son back. You both go free.
MICHAEL Then I want the boat.
JACK When the plane crashed I was on my way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.
SAYID I'm sorry to hear that.
JACK Yeah. It seems like such a long time ago now. I was going to go right from the airport to the cemetery but I had no idea what I was going to say. Here we are again.
SAYID I think Michael has been compromised. Let's keep walking, Jack.
JACK What do you mean "compromised"?
SAYID His actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth.
JACK Why would he lie to us?
SAYID Because I believe a father would do anything for his son. Because I believe Michael may have freed Henry. And because I believe he is leading you into a trap.
JACK You believe a lot, Sayid.
SAYID I also believe that Henry was one of them.
JACK Alright, let's go talk to him.
SAYID No, he must continue to believe he's in control.
JACK Why the hell would we want to do that?
SAYID So we can create an advantage.
JACK How?
SAYID I don't know yet. But we have one more night to figure that out.
JACK Ana Lucia Cortez was -- before we crashed she was a police officer. I don't think it was easy for her being here. But I think she did the best she could. She was a woman of few words, and I'm going to follow her example. Rest in peace, Ana.
HURLEY Libby was -- she was -- she -- Libby was a psychologist, or psychiatrist -- one of those. Either way, she probably helped a lot of people. She helped me. She was my friend. It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not. I'm going with you. Goodbye, Libby.
SUN Boat. Boat!
