dr_jack_shephard C'mon, out of the way! I need room. Steady.
kate_austen Boone, can you hear me? It's okay, we've got you.
hugo_reyes What happened?
kate_austen He fell down a cliff.
hugo_reyes But he was with Locke.
dr_jack_shephard Hold steady.
sunhwa_kwon Jack, his leg.
dr_jack_shephard I know. He's bleeding. Keep him steady, damn it. You've got to press harder than that, Kate.
kate_austen I know. I'm trying.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, slow now. Slow and gentle. Easy. Sun, pair of scissors - second drawer in the cart. Second drawer! Diapers in the first drawer. Sun's going to switch places with you. Sun, I need...
sunhwa_kwon Yes, I understand.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, grab me that first class seat from up there. Also, I need that mesh. We need to create some kind of sterile -- . Hurley, I swear to god, if you faint!
hugo_reyes No -- first class -- mesh - I'm cool. Lord in heaven.
dr_jack_shephard Get to the beach. Ransack Sawyer's stuff. I want his alcohol - rubbing, scotch.
kate_austen Jack, what's going on?
dr_jack_shephard His lung just collapsed. Okay. Okay, okay, good Boone. Good, Boone, that's good. Good job. Alright, a little bit of tube in that and you're going to be just fine. What are you still doing here? The alcohol, Kate! You want him to live -- get to the beach, now!
marc_silverman Alright, damn it, just get the stupid clip-on, huh?
dr_jack_shephard You know why they call it a tie? Because you've got to tie it.
marc_silverman You know why they call it a clip-on? Because you clip it -- on.
dr_jack_shephard You nervous, Silverman?
marc_silverman What the hell do I have to be nervous about?
dr_jack_shephard It's a big responsibility.
marc_silverman I can handle responsibility.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe. But I know that you don't like to get up in front of crowds.
marc_silverman I'll be fine. After about 8 beers, I'll be fine.
dr_jack_shephard She'll bust you, man.
marc_silverman I'll brush my teeth.
dr_jack_shephard She'll bust you. You can still back out, Marc.
marc_silverman Nah, it's just a stupid speech. I'll make you proud.
tux_shop_owner SHOP OWNER Okay, groom's turn.
marc_silverman You can still back out, Jack.
boone_carlyle Oh, it hurts.
dr_jack_shephard It's a closed fracture but I think I can set it.
sunhwa_kwon His chest, the wound. Can you -- sew him?
dr_jack_shephard He's lost a lot of blood. I wonder how far Locke had to carry him.
boone_carlyle I'm going to die.
dr_jack_shephard Boone, listen to me. Listen! You are not going to die. I'm going to fix this, okay? I am going to save you.
michael_dawson You've got to flip it or it'll burn, Walt.
james_ford Hey, mamacita. You want some fish?
claire_littleton No, thanks. I'm not really hungry. How long do you think 'til it's ready?
michael_dawson Maybe a week, maybe less. You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah, I'm fine. Alright, I'll see you guys later.
james_ford She likes me.
michael_dawson Hey, Jin! Jin! Want some fish? Hey, take a break. Eat some fish.
james_ford The man's got what I call an overzealous work ethic.
michael_dawson Try obsession. He wants off this Island bad, man.
james_ford Can't say I blame poor Kato. His lady speaks English all this time and he didn't have a clue? I'm surprised he didn't try to swim out of here. Hell, I would've.
kate_austen Sawyer, I need all your alcohol. Now!
james_ford How'd it happen?
kate_austen Locke said that he fell off a cliff while they were out hunting boar.
james_ford Boar they never seem to get.
kate_austen Is that it?
james_ford Afraid so. You need anything else? I could come with you.
kate_austen Too many cooks already, but thanks.
boone_carlyle I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard He needs blood.
sunhwa_kwon What?
dr_jack_shephard Blood. A transfusion.
sunhwa_kwon How will you do that?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know. I'll figure it out. After I set the leg.
sunhwa_kwon Let me.
dr_jack_shephard That's okay.
sunhwa_kwon Let me. Get some air.
charlie_pace How is he?
dr_jack_shephard Don't know yet.
charlie_pace What happened out there? Where's Locke? Do you think that...
dr_jack_shephard I don't know!
charlie_pace What, he just took off?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, Charlie. He just took off.
charlie_pace Where's Shannon?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
charlie_pace Well, she's his sister. You don't think...
dr_jack_shephard I don't know where she is!
marc_silverman And here she is, the future Mrs. Jack Shepard.
sarah_shephard Thank you. Wow, can I get another microphone? I think this one's been drinking. A little over two years ago, I blew a tire out -- flipped over the center divider into oncoming traffic, and was hit head-on by an SUV. My back was broken. They all said it was irreparable. And then there was Jack. And he promised he would fix me, because that's the kind of guy he is. Because you are the most committed man I have ever known -- because you fixed me, I will dance at our wedding. To Jack, my hero, Jack.
sunhwa_kwon Give him this -- for the pain.
dr_jack_shephard I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here.
sunhwa_kwon It is not a remedy.
dr_jack_shephard Will you hold his shoulders? Here we go.
kate_austen Claire? What are you doing out here?
claire_littleton Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.
kate_austen Oh god, you're having a baby.
kate_austen Claire, we need to get you back to camp.
claire_littleton I'm fine. I just need to -- I just need to catch my breath.
kate_austen It's not okay. You're having your baby.
claire_littleton No, I'm not, okay. It's just gas pains, it's fine.
kate_austen You're having contractions, Claire!
claire_littleton No! I'm bloody not. Can you just leave me alone?
kate_austen C'mon, I've got to get you to Jack. Please try to stand. Please.
claire_littleton Look, I can't.
kate_austen Help! Somebody help!
jinsoo_kwon 오. 이런.
kate_austen Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay, you understand? We need Jack.
jinsoo_kwon Jack. Doctor.
kate_austen Yes. Get the doctor, please come here.
claire_littleton Don't leave me.
kate_austen Oh, no, no, honey. I won't. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise. Jack, hurry.
dr_jack_shephard Ask him again.
sunhwa_kwon He's in shock.
dr_jack_shephard That's why you need to ask him again.
sunhwa_kwon Boone, can you hear me? What is your blood type? Boone, please listen. What is your blood type?
dr_jack_shephard Damn it.
sunhwa_kwon Maybe a smaller piece?
dr_jack_shephard Veins are like a wet noodle -- first you have to find one, then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it. I've got bamboo. None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type, not to mention that his injuries-
boone_carlyle A-negative.
dr_jack_shephard Boone, what'd you say?
boone_carlyle Shannon, the plane.
dr_jack_shephard Did you hear A-negative? Get Charlie -- ask everyone you can find, everyone, what their blood type is. A negative, okay? And find his sister. Find Shannon.
shannon_rutherford Where are we going?
sayid_jarrah This way.
shannon_rutherford Oh, okay. Are you lost?
sayid_jarrah No, absolutely not. Those trees look really familiar. It's this way -- I think.
shannon_rutherford Did you just say I think?
sayid_jarrah Surprise.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it.
charlie_pace I found an A.
dr_jack_shephard Positive or negative?
charlie_pace She doesn't know. I also found two B positives and one AB negative. At least, he thinks so.
dr_jack_shephard Did you find any O negative?
charlie_pace Sun said A negative.
dr_jack_shephard Where is she?
charlie_pace We split up. I thought she'd be back here.
dr_jack_shephard You only asked 4 people?
charlie_pace I asked the whole sodding camp -- no one knows their blood type. I don't know my bloody blood type.
dr_jack_shephard Did you find Shannon?
sunhwa_kwon No. I was getting you this. A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle.
dr_jack_shephard It's perfect.
charlie_pace Not to rain on your proverbial parade but I thought you said we needed someone who was A negative.
dr_jack_shephard Or O negative.
charlie_pace Right, which judging by your tantrum, no one is.
dr_jack_shephard Someone is.
charlie_pace You? Why'd you make-
dr_jack_shephard O negative is universal donor. It's in the ballpark, it's not a match. My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock -- stop his heart.
charlie_pace You mean he'll die.
dr_jack_shephard He's not going to die.
sarah_shephard Those girls are checking you out.
dr_jack_shephard You're in your PJs.
sarah_shephard Indeed I am.
dr_jack_shephard Are they cute?
sarah_shephard Who?
dr_jack_shephard The girls that are checking me out.
sarah_shephard Mmm, one of them is kind of cute. The other one's just trashy. Heart and Soul?
dr_jack_shephard You got it.
sarah_shephard I'm taking the easy part.
dr_jack_shephard Of course.
sarah_shephard You know you really don't have to do this if you don't want to.
dr_jack_shephard How do you know I haven't?
sarah_shephard Because you haven't. Oh, sorry. It was a silly idea. I just -- I read too many bridal magazines. I think it rotted my brain.
dr_jack_shephard Sarah, I want to. I'm going to. I just have to figure out the right way to say it.
sarah_shephard Just vows.
dr_jack_shephard Just vows?
sarah_shephard Hey, he's going to come.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I know.
sarah_shephard So, you stay down here as long as you need to. And when you're ready I'll be upstairs. I cannot wait to marry you Jack Shepard.
jinsoo_kwon Jack, Jack, doctor, Jack!
hugo_reyes Jack.
jinsoo_kwon 그... 그... 해변가 근처 정글에 있는 그 임신한 여자... 지금 애 낳으려고 해요. Claire.
charlie_pace Claire? What about Claire?
jinsoo_kwon 지금 케이트하고 같이 있는데, 빨리 오래요.
sunhwa_kwon He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor. Just off the beach.
charlie_pace Claire's having the baby? Where, where?
jinsoo_kwon 잭이 필요하대요.
sunhwa_kwon 클레어는 괜찮아요?
jinsoo_kwon 그런 것 같은데, 많이 아픈가봐.
sunhwa_kwon He says he thinks she's okay, but she's in pain.
dr_jack_shephard Does he know how fast the contractions are coming?
sunhwa_kwon 진통은 얼마마다 와요?
jinsoo_kwon 어... 아마... 2분만에... 한번씩?
sunhwa_kwon Every 2 minutes.
dr_jack_shephard Is she nauseous? Can she stand? Is there any bleeding? Did her water break?
sunhwa_kwon 구토 증상은요? 움직일 수 있나요? 하혈은요? 양수가 터졌나요?
jinsoo_kwon 양수가 터진지는 모르겠는데, 움직이지는 못할거야.
sunhwa_kwon No, none of that, but she can't move.
charlie_pace We should go. What do we need -- towels, bandages, hot water? How do we take hot water?
dr_jack_shephard I'm sure you'll figure all that out, alright. You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire.
sunhwa_kwon 당신은 찰리랑 함께 클레어한테 다시 가세요.
charlie_pace Uh, I know. That, that dilating thing -- how do I look out for that?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, listen to me. Okay, Charlie, look at me. Tell Kate to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart, you got that? Now, she's going to need to make sure that Claire pushes, but not too hard, not too fast -- just until the head is clear. And then, as hard as she can. When the baby is out make sure she clears it's nose and it's mouth.
charlie_pace Yeah, but, you'll be there by then, right?
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm not going anywhere. I need to stay here. Now, you tell Kate she's going to have to deliver this baby.
claire_littleton They've stopped.
kate_austen That happens, I think.
claire_littleton No, no, no, they're not coming anymore. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.
kate_austen No. Claire.
claire_littleton No, no, no. I'm okay, really.
kate_austen Claire, I don't think that you should be doing...
claire_littleton What is that?
kate_austen I think your water just broke.
claire_littleton No, no, no.
kate_austen Yeah, no, no, I think you, okay...
claire_littleton No, I can't have the baby now.
kate_austen Just hold on...
claire_littleton I can't have the baby now!
kate_austen Just hold on. Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming.
boone_carlyle I screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
boone_carlyle My leg, it hurts.
dr_jack_shephard Don't try moving. Can you breathe okay?
boone_carlyle It fell on me.
dr_jack_shephard What fell?
boone_carlyle A plane. It was a plane.
dr_jack_shephard Boone. Boone, Locke said you fell from a cliff.
boone_carlyle No -- it was. It fell -- the plane. It's because of the hatch. We found a hatch.
dr_jack_shephard Boone, Boone, stay with me, man. Hey, stay with me.
boone_carlyle Locke said, John said, John said not to tell. About the hatch.
dr_jack_shephard What did Locke do? What hatch? What...
boone_carlyle Oh, my leg hurts.
dr_jack_shephard Boone? Boone, hey.
boone_carlyle Shannon, Shannon, Shannon...
shannon_rutherford I need to tell you something.
sayid_jarrah Alright.
shannon_rutherford My brother, Boone. He's not really my brother. He's my step-brother. Our parents got married when we were, like, 8 and 10. He's kind of in love with me.
sayid_jarrah In love with you? And how do you feel towards him?
shannon_rutherford I'll always feel something for him. But am I in love with him in that way? No. Not at all. We're here for god knows how long, and so is Boone.
sayid_jarrah Maybe we should go back?
shannon_rutherford I don't want to go back.
sayid_jarrah Are you sure?
shannon_rutherford Yes. I just need to take it a little slow. Are you okay with that?
sayid_jarrah I had no expectations.
shannon_rutherford Right.
sayid_jarrah Hopes, not expectations.
claire_littleton Oh, god, that hurts.
charlie_pace Hello? Hey, Kate. Claire, is she okay?
kate_austen Where's Jack?
charlie_pace Couldn't come.
kate_austen What do you mean he couldn't come?
charlie_pace He's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now.
kate_austen Okay, okay. We'll just pick her up and bring her to him.
charlie_pace No, Kate.
kate_austen No, we have to take her to him before it's too late.
charlie_pace Look, Jack said you have to deliver the baby.
kate_austen What?
charlie_pace Now, he talked me through it...
kate_austen No.
charlie_pace It's relatively simple.
kate_austen I can't do this.
charlie_pace Yes, you can. I have water. I have towels.
kate_austen You're not listening to me. I can't deliver this baby.
charlie_pace Well, somebody bloody has to.
jinsoo_kwon 오래 걸리지 않을거에요. 안정을 취해봐요.
claire_littleton You know I was out there for over a week -- days I can't remember. I mean, what if, what if they did something to the baby? I'm not ready for this. I'm not -- I'm so scared. I'm scared.
kate_austen I'm, I'm scared, too. But we're going to get through this together, okay?
dr_jack_shephard C'mon, Boone.
sunhwa_kwon It's not working.
dr_jack_shephard The blood's not the problem. It's the leg. All the blood's pooling there -- compartment syndrome. He didn't get this injury from a fall. Something crushed his leg.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?
sunhwa_kwon You've given him enough.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley.
hugo_reyes Whoa, dude. You alright, man? You're looking kind of goth.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Michael?
hugo_reyes The beach, I think.
dr_jack_shephard I need you to go get him for me, okay?
hugo_reyes What for?
dr_jack_shephard Just get him.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Hey, kiddo.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD How's the water?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, it's fantastic.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Screaming kid next to me in first class. How does that happen, huh? What you got there?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, Sarah wants us to write our own vows.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD 'My hearts skips beats at the sound of your voice. My skin warms to the touch of your fingers. Where you go, I will go,' etc. etc. This is very nice.
dr_jack_shephard Those aren't my vows. Those are hers. I stole them out of the room. Can't write mine.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Yeah, well, you're a doctor, not a writer.
dr_jack_shephard Right.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Right. Sarah is a beautiful girl.
dr_jack_shephard Hell, yeah, she is.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Do you love her?
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Then why are you sitting out here?
dr_jack_shephard What if I can't be the husband, or the father, that I want to be? What if I asked her because I saved her life? Should I marry her, dad?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Commitment is what makes you tick, Jack. The problem is you're just not good at letting go.
michael_dawson You're saying Locke lied?
dr_jack_shephard He didn't fall. His leg was pinned under something -- something heavy.
michael_dawson Okay, Jack, wait. The cargo container? We've got to do this? What about the axe?
dr_jack_shephard We can't use the axe.
sunhwa_kwon What are you doing?
dr_jack_shephard The right leg is filling with blood. If I don't stop it I won't be able to save him.
sunhwa_kwon You don't mean that-
dr_jack_shephard The leg is dead.
dr_jack_shephard There's no other choice.
kate_austen Claire, I think this is about the time you're supposed to start pushing, okay? So, push.
kate_austen And, don't hold your breath, honey. You won't be able to push if you -- Claire? Claire, what are you doing? Oh, no, no, no, Claire, you need to push, right now. Don't do this, Claire, okay? You can't stop this -- this is happening. Your baby is coming and I need your help.
claire_littleton It's not going to want me.
kate_austen What?
claire_littleton It knows I don't want it -- that I was going to give it away. Babies know that stuff.
kate_austen Do you want this baby now? Hmm? Do you want it to be healthy and safe? Okay, then the baby knows that, too. You are not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours, but I need you to push, okay? Okay? Alright. 1, 2, 3, push. Good. Good, push!
charlie_pace Yeah, right. Okay.
sunhwa_kwon Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Let's go.
sunhwa_kwon Jack.
dr_jack_shephard On 3...
sunhwa_kwon Jack.
dr_jack_shephard 1, 2, 3...
sunhwa_kwon Why are you doing this? He's bleeding inside. You're not helping him! You can't save him, Jack. You just can't!
dr_jack_shephard Don't tell me what I can't do! Okay, 1, 2, 3, go.
dr_jack_shephard You don't need to see this.
michael_dawson If you need me, shout.
sarah_shephard In sickness and in health, in good times and bad, I risk it all because I love you.
minister Thank you, Sarah. Jack has also prepared his vows. Jack, if you would, please. Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I didn't write any vows. I've been trying to for a month, but I couldn't. So I started to wonder why that was. And as time went on it only got worse -- because I'm, because I'm not good at letting go. Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail. But I know one thing. I would've never been able to write anything as beautiful as what you just said. And last night, Sarah, when you were talking about the accident -- you got it all wrong. I didn't fix you. You fixed me. I love you, Sarah, and I always will.
boone_carlyle Wait. Wait.
dr_jack_shephard I have to, if I don't...
boone_carlyle I'm all messed up inside. You know it.
dr_jack_shephard This is our best chance.
boone_carlyle There's no chance. Really. I mean, look where we are.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not going to let you give up.
boone_carlyle I know you made a promise. I'm letting you off the hook. Let me go, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry.
boone_carlyle Don't be.
kate_austen Breathe, c'mon breathe, breathe, okay, okay. Ready? I think it's close, c'mon. Go, go, go. That's really good. C'mon, I think it's close. Okay, good, good, good. I can see it. I can see the top of its head. I can see it. I can see it, okay. You're almost there. You're so close, you're so close. Ready, ready? C'mon, one more. Push, push, push, push, push! Oh, you have a little boy. Your baby boy.
claire_littleton I have a son. I have a son.
boone_carlyle Tell Shannon -- tell Shannon -- tell her...
dr_jack_shephard It's a beautiful, healthy baby.
kate_austen Want to talk about it?
dr_jack_shephard Talk about what?
kate_austen Boone died, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard He didn't die. He was murdered.
kate_austen What? Jack, where are you going?
dr_jack_shephard To find John Locke.
