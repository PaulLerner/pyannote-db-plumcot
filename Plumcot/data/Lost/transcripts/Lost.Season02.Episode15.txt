claire_littleton Hey, hey it's okay, sweetie. Shhh. Hey, sweetie, it's alright. John, John, wake up.
john_locke What? Claire, what?
claire_littleton He's burning up, and he's got a rash, and -- and I need to find Jack.
john_locke He's, uh, he's on shift at the hatch.
claire_littleton Okay.
john_locke No, no, Claire, wait. Claire, wait.
claire_littleton I can't, John.
john_locke No, no, no, you're not walking through the jungle in the middle of the night. I'll go get Jack. I'll send him right back here.
claire_littleton Okay.
john_locke Don't worry.
john_locke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard What's going on?
john_locke Baby's got a fever.
dr_jack_shephard A fever?
john_locke Claire was coming here.
john_locke He asleep?
dr_jack_shephard Not a sound all night. I'll get back here as soon as I can.
claire_littleton Shhh. Hey, hey, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay. Mommy's just going to cool you down, okay. Okay? Shhh, it's okay. Jack.
claire_littleton What are you doing here? You stay away from us.
danielle_rousseau He's infected, isn't he?
claire_littleton What?
danielle_rousseau Your child, he's sick.
claire_littleton Please get away. You get away from us!!
danielle_rousseau You don't remember, do you?
kate_austen Hey, get back! Get away from her! What do you think you're doing here? What are you doing here?! Just get out of our camp.
kate_austen What happened? What did she say?
claire_littleton She said there's something wrong with him.
claire_littleton It's just not like him. He always sleeps through the night. And this rash... I mean, there's something wrong.
dr_jack_shephard Babies get sick, Claire.
claire_littleton Okay, well, the fever and cough?
dr_jack_shephard It's perfectly normal.
claire_littleton He hasn't been eating at all.
dr_jack_shephard Claire, he's okay. It's probably roseola. It's a -- a typical virus that's common in children his age, and the rash is a sign of it.
claire_littleton Okay, what's if it's not? What if he caught something really bad -- like some kind of infection?
dr_jack_shephard Infection? Where did you get that idea?
kate_austen Rousseau was here.
dr_jack_shephard What did she say to you?
claire_littleton She said she knew he was sick, okay? That he's infected.
dr_jack_shephard Claire, there is no infection. We've been on this island for 2 months and no one's gotten sick. Rousseau's crazy. We're going to let the fever just run its course. It's going to be fine, okay, trust me. I'm going to get back to the hatch. I'll come back in a couple of hours and check on him again, okay?
claire_littleton Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Okay?
claire_littleton Yeah.
kate_austen Hey, I'm sure that if there was something wrong Jack would know.
kate_austen Are you sure about this? We don't really know her.
claire_littleton I think she can help me.
libby_smith Hey.
hugo_reyes Hey, guys.
claire_littleton So, you're a shrink, right?
libby_smith I'm a clinical psychologist, but "shrink" works, too.
claire_littleton Can you help people remember things?
libby_smith I guess it depends on what you need to remember.
claire_littleton So, it was our second week on the island, I was out in the jungle and I thought I was having the baby. Charlie was with me, and there was this man, Ethan. We thought he was one of us from the plane but he wasn't. So, he took me. He took both of us. And, I don't remember. I don't remember anything.
kate_austen When Jack and I found Charlie he was hanging from a tree -- by his neck.
claire_littleton I have no idea what happened and now I'm seeing these flashes of things and -- you know, I have amnesia. There's 2 weeks missing from my life.
libby_smith Claire, I don't think you have amnesia. You know, sometimes when something terrible happens to us there's a little switch in your head that flicks on to protect us from having to deal with it. Maybe your memories aren't gone. Maybe you're just blocking them.
claire_littleton Then I need you to unblock them because my baby's sick and they did something to him.
dr_jack_shephard Do you have to go to the bathroom?
ben_linus No.
dr_jack_shephard Well, just let us know when you do.
ben_linus Yeah, I'll look forward to that.
john_locke I thought you might like something to read.
ben_linus Dostoevsky. You don't have any Stephen King?
john_locke The library's a little outdated.
ben_linus Right. Well, thanks.
dr_jack_shephard What's with the book?
john_locke Just something to pass the time. Did you know that Hemingway was jealous of Dostoevsky?
dr_jack_shephard No, John, I, I didn't know that.
john_locke He wanted to be the world's greatest writer, but convinced himself that he could never get out from under Dostoevsky's shadow. Kind of sad, really. What are we doing, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard What are we doing?
john_locke We can't hide him down here forever. Changing shifts around is going to get people asking questions. I just want to know what the long term plan is.
dr_jack_shephard Well, John, let me ask you this we don't have a long term plan for the button but we keep pushing it, don't we? Look, until we know who he is -- whether or not he's telling the truth -- we have to keep doing what we're doing. If you've got a better idea let's hear it.
ben_linus Why don't you let me go?
libby_smith We're away from all the noises of the camp. Just breathe. Let your whole body relax, good. Listen to the waves. Good, in and out slowly. Good. Keep your eyes closed. Very relaxed, Claire. Just keep breathing. Now, I want you to visualize yourself when you were pregnant. Keep listening to my voice. Think about what you see.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 When was your last check-up, Claire?
claire_littleton I haven't been in a while. I've been busy, you know. I'm going to Los Angeles.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 Really?
claire_littleton Yeah.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 Traveling in your third trimester -- that's not usually recommended.
claire_littleton Well, there's a family there. I'm, uh, giving the baby up for adoption.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 Oh, of course, I understand. The sedative I gave you was very mild. I know these exams can be very stressful.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 I'm going to give you a shot now, Claire. A little medicine for your baby. Don't worry. You're just going to feel a little pinch.
libby_smith It's okay, you're alright. It's okay. It's okay.
claire_littleton It was Ethan. I saw Ethan. I saw him. It was Ethan.
libby_smith Claire, Claire, it's okay.
claire_littleton No, it's not!
libby_smith You're alright.
claire_littleton No, I'm not alright! It was Ethan!
kate_austen What happened?
libby_smith I don't know.
kate_austen What did you do?!
libby_smith Nothing, she just...
claire_littleton Do it again. Do it again!!
libby_smith No, Claire. You were screaming...
claire_littleton I remembered, okay. I saw Ethan. He was there and he was giving me an exam.
libby_smith Claire, what you saw could be combining experiences of what happened before the crash to the night you were having dreams here on the island.
claire_littleton No, I know this was real. I was drugged. He did something to me.
kate_austen Claire, you need to calm down, alright. It's not good for Aaron.
claire_littleton You know what -- Aaron is sick, okay. I need to find that place. That room -- it's real. It's real. And, hey, there's medicine there for the baby. I need to find it. I need to find it. Kate, please help me find it.
mr_eko Hello?
ben_linus What's the...
mr_eko Hello? Hello?
john_locke Howdy.
mr_eko Hello, John. You are alone?
john_locke Not anymore.
ben_linus How many of you are...
dr_jack_shephard Shut -- up.
mr_eko I was hoping to borrow a saw.
john_locke Absolutely, right this way.
kate_austen I need a gun. And you don't get to ask why.
james_ford Well, Thelma, seeing as I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.
kate_austen No, you don't.
james_ford Yes, I do -- watch. Why?
kate_austen Just give me a gun, Sawyer.
james_ford Check it out -- I found a new pair of glasses damn near my prescription. Do you like 'em?
kate_austen Alright, I'm going into the jungle to track down Rousseau.
james_ford The French chick? What for?
kate_austen Claire thinks she knows where there might be some medicine. The baby's sick.
james_ford Well, hell, I got medicines.
kate_austen She thinks he's really sick -- as in quarantine sick.
james_ford What do you think?
kate_austen I think she's a little too worried, but she's going after Rousseau with or without me.
james_ford No boys allowed, huh? Alright, what do you want -- 9 millimeter or rifle?
sunhwa_kwon I don't think this is a good idea. Maybe you should listen to Jack.
claire_littleton What if Jack's wrong, okay? Jack said the fever would break and it hasn't. He's getting worse.
sunhwa_kwon Just because it hasn't broken yet...
claire_littleton Well, how long am I supposed to wait, Sun?
sunhwa_kwon A mother should not leave her child.
claire_littleton I'm sorry, are you a mother?
sunhwa_kwon No, I'm not. -- Claire, are you sure you want to do this?
claire_littleton What did you say?
sunhwa_kwon Are you sure you want to do this?
claire_littleton Do you have to put that in my tummy? It really, really hurts.
dr_ethan_rom I know. I wish there was another way. But the baby needs it, Claire. Okay?
claire_littleton Okay.
dr_ethan_rom There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
claire_littleton No.
dr_ethan_rom And now, because you've been such a good girl, I think it's time for a surprise.
dr_ethan_rom Claire, this way. Here we go. Over here.
claire_littleton What is this place?
dr_ethan_rom It's for your baby, Claire.
claire_littleton Uh, it's amazing. What happened to Charlie?
dr_ethan_rom Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far enough away from camp, I let him go back.
claire_littleton Oh. So, where did it all come from?
dr_ethan_rom Well, I'd love to explain everything to you, Claire, but I'm afraid it would be a little overwhelming right now.
dr_ethan_rom Go ahead, turn it on.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 Ethan.
dr_ethan_rom Wait here, I'll be right back.
claire_littleton Okay.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 What the hell happened? You were supposed to make the list and then bring her in. Was I unclear?
dr_ethan_rom It's not my fault. They knew I wasn't on the plane. They had a manifest.
MR.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 FRIENDLY What am I supposed to tell him? You know what he's going to do when he finds out. Damn it, Ethan.
sunhwa_kwon Claire? Claire, are you alright?
claire_littleton I, um...
kate_austen Ready to go?
claire_littleton Aaron, sweetheart, shhhh. Mommy's got to go now, sweetheart. Don't cry. Don't cry. I'll be back really soon and I'm going to make you feel all better, okay. I promise. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon Okay.
kate_austen You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah.
claire_littleton You're sure this is her trail?
kate_austen We started at the exact spot where we chased her off the beach.
claire_littleton So, what do you know about Rousseau?
kate_austen Not much.
claire_littleton You spent all that time with her when you went out to the Black Rock. You must have talked about something.
kate_austen Just about her ship crashing here -- her and her research team getting stranded.
claire_littleton What happened to them?
kate_austen They died.
claire_littleton How?
kate_austen Uhm, tracks are gone -- trail ends here.
claire_littleton Kate, how did they die?
kate_austen She killed them.
claire_littleton What? Why, why would...
danielle_rousseau Because they were infected. You believe me now, don't you?
claire_littleton I want you to take me back there.
danielle_rousseau Back?
claire_littleton To where I scratched you.
kate_austen Claire.
claire_littleton No, okay, she knows I remember! Hey, I remember a lot of it now. I remember the room, the medicine, a teenage girl. Okay, so don't lie to me and make out you don't know what I'm talking about. My baby is sick and you're going to take me back there to get what he needs. Right now!
danielle_rousseau It's not far from here.
mr_eko Jack, may I have a word with you?
dr_jack_shephard Sure.
mr_eko Who is he?
dr_jack_shephard What?
mr_eko The man that you are keeping in the hatch.
dr_jack_shephard Did Locke tell you?
mr_eko Locke did not tell me anything. Who is he? I wish to speak to him.
dr_jack_shephard Speak to him about what?
mr_eko I wish to speak to him alone. Can you arrange this?
dr_jack_shephard Why should I do that?
mr_eko Because you wish to keep this a secret.
claire_littleton Why are we stopping here?
danielle_rousseau This is where you scratched me.
claire_littleton But there's nothing here.
danielle_rousseau Where do we go next?
claire_littleton Why are you asking me that? You need to tell me where to go.
danielle_rousseau Where is this room?!
claire_littleton How can you be saying that? Okay, you grabbed me, that's why I scratched you -- because you were taking me back to them!
danielle_rousseau Is that what you think? You said you remembered! That's why I brought you here! You lied!
kate_austen Hey, get your hands off of her!
danielle_rousseau Go ahead, please. Do it.
kate_austen Claire! Claire!
dr_ethan_rom How's it coming?
claire_littleton One down, one to go.
dr_ethan_rom Now all we need is a little foot to put it on, huh? Tell you what, what do you say we sneak out of here and take a walk?
claire_littleton Okay.
dr_ethan_rom Whoa . I'm sorry this is the first time I've managed to get you out. My friends are afraid you'll run away. Whoa! Whoa. Don't tell on me, okay?
claire_littleton Okay.
dr_ethan_rom Whoa, easy now. Alright, easy.
dr_ethan_rom Okay, here, this will help.
claire_littleton Thanks Ew.
dr_ethan_rom What?
claire_littleton That's really sour.
dr_ethan_rom Is it? I hadn't noticed.
claire_littleton Bah. -- Oh, hey, it's kicking!
dr_ethan_rom May I?
claire_littleton Yeah.
dr_ethan_rom Claire, can I tell you a secret?
claire_littleton Yeah.
dr_ethan_rom I'm going to miss you. I wish -- I wish you didn't have to go.
claire_littleton Maybe I don't have to go?
dr_ethan_rom We've been through this, Claire. There's not enough vaccine for you and the baby.
claire_littleton Well, I'm not, I'm not sick.
dr_ethan_rom Thank God. And once you've delivered you can go back to your friends and hopefully you'll stay that way.
claire_littleton What if I want to see the baby?
dr_ethan_rom Hey, nobody's going to take him from you unless that's what you want. You have a choice. We're good people, Claire. We're a good family. But if you're going to trust us with your child I want you to be sure. Okay?
claire_littleton Sure.
kate_austen There you are. Where are you going?
claire_littleton I know this is it.
kate_austen Claire!
danielle_rousseau Leave her alone.
kate_austen Excuse me?!
danielle_rousseau Let her look.
kate_austen Look for what? Claire! Claire!
kate_austen Flashlights. The lights, I'm going to see if I can turn the power on. You okay?
claire_littleton This way.
danielle_rousseau What is this place?
claire_littleton It's where they were going to keep him.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 GIRL Wake up.

YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 GIRL Shhhh.
claire_littleton What are you talking about?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 GIRL You're going to die. They're going to cut him out of you! I can get you back to your camp, but we have to leave. Now!

YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 GIRL Shhhh.
claire_littleton Get Ethan, I want to talk to Ethan. Ethan wouldn't hurt me. Ethan wouldn't...
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode15 GIRL You'll thank me for this one day.
claire_littleton It's here. The medicine's here.
claire_littleton Help me. Help! Kate, come here, I need some help! Help me open this.
kate_austen What is it?
claire_littleton It's in here. The vaccine's in here.
kate_austen Okay, 1-2-3.
claire_littleton It was in here. The vaccine was in here! Okay, where is it? Where is it? Where it is? The vaccine was in here! Where is it?! You were bringing me back here -- where is it?! You know where it is, don't you?! Tell me! Tell me where it is! Tell me!
claire_littleton Ethan. Ethan. Ethan? Ethan, I'm sure. Ethan? Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan! I'm sure. I want you to take the baby. Ethan?
claire_littleton Who are -- who are you?
dr_ethan_rom Claire!
claire_littleton Yeah! I'm here!!
dr_ethan_rom I can hear you, where are you?!
danielle_rousseau Quiet.
claire_littleton I'm here, Ethan!
danielle_rousseau Be quiet.
claire_littleton I have to -- I have to give him to them.
dr_ethan_rom Claire!
claire_littleton I have to give him to them so he'll be safe, okay. Help! I'm here! Ethan!!
claire_littleton You weren't trying to take me back, were you? You were trying to save me.
danielle_rousseau I carried you on my back to your camp. I left you where they would find you.
claire_littleton I'm sorry. Where are you going?
danielle_rousseau You're not the only one who didn't find what they were looking for.
danielle_rousseau This is as far as I go.
claire_littleton Your baby -- was it a girl?
danielle_rousseau Yes.
claire_littleton What was her name?
danielle_rousseau Alex -- Alexandra.
claire_littleton I remember a girl -- a girl with blue eyes. She helped me. She saved me, just like you did. She wasn't like the others. She was -- good.
danielle_rousseau I'm sorry that you didn't find what you were looking for. And I hope you're baby's not infected. But if it is, I hope you know what must be done.
john_locke Back for more tools?
dr_jack_shephard He knows, John.
john_locke Well, there you go.
dr_jack_shephard Just be careful what you say to him. He's smart and curious. Just give us a shout when you're done.
john_locke If the alarm goes off, don't tell him what it's for.
mr_eko What is it for?
mr_eko Hello. I am Mr. Eko.
ben_linus Henry Gale.
mr_eko Do you mind if I sit, Henry?
ben_linus Okay.
mr_eko How long have you been in here?
ben_linus 2 days.
mr_eko Are they treating you well?
ben_linus Treating me well? I'm a prisoner. And I don't know why, or for what, or...
mr_eko You are a prisoner because they are being careful. They are being careful because they believe you are lying.
ben_linus Why would I lie? They think I'm one of these others -- other what?
mr_eko Please, stop talking, Henry. The first night I spent on this island I was dragged into the jungle by 2 men. They never spoke a word to me, nor I to them. I killed these men -- smashed in their head with a stone, felt their blood on my arms. I need you to know how sorry I am for this. I need you to know that I am back on the righteous path now. And that I regret my actions. I ask you for your forgiveness.
ben_linus Why are you telling me this?
mr_eko Because I needed to tell someone.
dr_jack_shephard He looks good -- fever's broken, the rash is even starting to fade.
claire_littleton Thank you so much.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't do anything. I'll check back in a couple hours, okay?
claire_littleton Look, Mommy made this for you when you were still inside her tummy. You know, I wanted them to take you. But now I know -- I know that we're supposed to be together, you and me. We're supposed to take care of each other, okay. -- You're mine and I love you. I love you so much.
ben_linus No cheeseburgers, huh?
john_locke No cheeseburgers. Bon appetit.
ben_linus Is that true -- what you said about Hemingway?
john_locke You have good ears.
ben_linus You have thin doors.
john_locke You read Hemingway?
ben_linus Sure, guy ran with the bulls, fought in the Spanish Civil War, stuff I can wrap my brain around. This, I can't get through 5 pages of .
john_locke Well, Dostoevsky had his virtues, too. He was a genius, for one. Bullfighting isn't everything.
ben_linus So, which one are you?
john_locke I'm sorry?
ben_linus Are you the genius, or are you the guy who always feels like he's living in the shadow of a genius?
john_locke I was -- I was never very much into literary analysis.
ben_linus I just don't understand why you let the doctor call the shots.
john_locke No one calls the shots. Jack and I make decisions together.
ben_linus Right, okay. -- My mistake.
