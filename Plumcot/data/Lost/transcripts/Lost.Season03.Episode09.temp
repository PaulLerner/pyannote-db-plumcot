SAWYER Show me the way to go home/I'm tired and I want to go to bed/I had a little drink about an hour ago/And it went straight to my head.
KATE Stop.
SAWYER What, you want a turn steering?
KATE We have to go back.
SAWYER What the hell are you talking about?
KATE Turn the boat around, Sawyer. I mean it.
SAWYER Have you lost your mind? We just got away.
KATE Just do it.
SAWYER You give me one good reason to turn around!
KATE Because we can't leave Jack behind!
SAWYER Yes we can, Freckles, because that's what he asked us to do. You think about it -- if we go back there -- what do you think Captain Bunny Killer's going to do if he catches us?
KARL Kill you. God loves you as he loves Jacob.
SAWYER Okay, thanks for the input. Sorry, kiddo, Jack's on his own.
TOM Time to get up. We're moving you.
JACK Moving me where?
TOM Some place else, Jack.
JACK Why? So this is it, huh?
TOM It?
JACK You just helped me save his life. If you're going to kill me, at least show me the respect of not calling it "moving."
TOM Now, why would we kill you?
JACK Because you're done with me.
TOM What kind of people do you think we are, Jack?
JACK Oh, I don't know, Tom -- the kind of people that would take a pregnant woman -- that would hang Charlie from a tree -- would drag our people out of the jungle -- would kidnap children. That's the kind of people I think you are.
TOM You see this glass house you're living in, Jack? How about I get you some stones? Let's do this the easy way -- what do you say?
JULIET Hey.
THAI BOY Doctor Jack! Hey, Doctor Jack! Doctor Jack, want soda? Doctor Jack.
THAI BOY 
JACK You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right?
THAI BOY Doctor Jack.
JACK You're welcome.
JACK Thank you. Thank you very much.
ACHARA You're not from around here are you?
JACK No, no I'm not. I'm Jack.
ACHARA Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.
JACK Achara. Achara.
JACK Juliet grilled these for me. Who's that woman?
TOM That'd be the sheriff.
JACK You have a sheriff?
TOM Not literally, Jack.
JACK Why are you moving Juliet into my room?
TOM Because she's in trouble, Jack. Now don't try anything stupid. Stay put in this cage, okay?
JACK You say that like you're not watching me from the camera right there.
TOM Oh, right. Ben told me you got into the surveillance room. Let me ask you something. You risk your neck to cut them loose, and they run away and don't ever look back...
JACK Thanks for the sandwich.
SAWYER Never thought I'd be glad to get back to this rock again.
KATE What are you doing?
SAWYER What does it look like? I'm heading into shore.
KATE Why? If we just keep going we can circle round. Sooner or later we'll get to camp. We can tell Locke and Sayid what happened --
SAWYER Oh, we will, huh? You got a map you ain't showing me, Magellan? We've got no food, no water -- and I can't steer in the dark.
KATE Then I'll steer.
SAWYER No, you'll come ashore; we'll make camp. You want to contribute -- you can build a campfire while I carry the kid. Glad we agree.
SAWYER Sure you ain't hungry?
KATE No, James, I ain't hungry.
KARL You shouldn't fight.
SAWYER When the hell did you wake up?
KARL You shouldn't fight because you're lucky to be alive.
SAWYER Golly, I think he's got a point.
KATE That island we were on -- is that where your people live?
KARL Just where we work.
KATE Work on what?
KARL Projects.
SAWYER Well, sure, like the steal-the-kid-off-the-raft project. That was a humdinger.
KATE So, you don't actually live on that island?
KARL Nope.
KATE Do you live here on this island?
KARL Yes, ma'am.
KATE And what did you do with the people that you took - the kids?
KARL We give them a better life.
KATE Better than what?
KARL Better than yours. There's not going to be any moon tonight. It'll be dark. Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard at night and think up names for the constellations. You can't see it yet, but right there will be Ursa Theodorus - the Teddy Bear.
SAWYER You have backyards?
KARL Yeah.
SAWYER Well, ain't that quaint.
JACK I thought you were locked up.
JULIET They let me out to examine Ben. His vitals are low and he has a fever. I took this about 10 minutes ago. It's of his stitches. They're infected aren't they?
JACK Yes.
JULIET Will you come look at them?
JACK No.
JULIET Jack.
JACK No.
JULIET I'm not asking you for them, or him. I'm asking you as a personal favor to me.
JACK You want me to help him again?
JULIET Yes.
JACK Are you sure about that, Juliet?
JULIET Yes, I'm sure.
JACK And this is because he said that he would let you go home.
JULIET No. No. It's because I'm in trouble.
JACK Trouble for --
JULIET I just killed someone. It's why they put me in your room.
JACK Who?
JULIET It's complicated.
JACK Well, then, let me simplify it for you. I'm not going to help him. And I'm not going to help you.
CHET Okay, special Thai dish for you. You try. Very brave. Very brave. 
ACHARA My brother likes you.
JACK Well, I'm a very likable guy.
ACHARA So, Jack, tell me something.
JACK Shoot.
ACHARA Why is it you don't know how to fly a kite?
JACK Just never learned, I guess.
ACHARA That's very sad.
JACK Well, my dad worked a lot and wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway. I mean, we never really --
ACHARA Jack?
JACK Yeah.
ACHARA I have no interest in your father.
JACK Well, that's a relief because I'm pretty tired of talking about him.
ACHARA Some things are personal. So, you're in Phuket to find yourself.
JACK Why would you say that?
ACHARA You are an American.
THAI MAN 
ACHARA 
THAI MAN 
ACHARA 
ACHARA I have a gift.
JACK Must be one hell of a gift.
ISABEL  Oh, I was just reading your tattoos. The 5 and the stars are very cute. But the Chinese I find a bit ironic.
JACK You find what ironic?
ISABEL What it says. You do know what it says?
JACK Yeah, I know what it says.
ISABEL Are you sure? Chinese is a very complicated language. It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation.
JACK I know what it says.
ISABEL Alright, then. Jack, my name is Isabel. If you'll come with me, I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions.
ISABEL Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.
ISABEL Please, have a seat, Jack. As you may have gathered, we don't live on this little island. In fact, most of us don't really like even coming here. There's been an incident that I'm investigating and I need to ask you some questions. So, I was hoping you might help me clear up a few of the inconsistencies. Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom. But you said that in the midst of a surgical procedure Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.
TOM Yeah, that's right.
ISABEL That true, Jack? Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben? The question's simple. Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?
JACK No. No, I was lying. I would have done anything to get my friends out. And turning you people against each other was my best chance of creating chaos.
ISABEL Why are you lying for her, Jack?
JACK I'd like to go back to my cage now.
JACK Who's there?
ACHARA Who do you think?
JACK What time is it?
ACHARA It's late.
JACK Mmm, salty.
ACHARA I went for a swim in the ocean.
JACK Washing the day off of you, huh?
ACHARA Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack?
JACK No. I mean, it might be nice -- after a month of you coming and going whenever you want -- to find out something about you.
ACHARA There are things that happen here that you could never understand.
JACK Like your gift?
ACHARA Yes, like my gift. Are you having fun with me, Jack?
JACK Oh, yeah.
ACHARA Then stop ask questions. Let's have fun.
JACK What?!!!
CINDY Hey, Jack.
JACK Do I -- do I know you? 815, you were the stewardess.
CINDY Cindy.
JACK What are you doing here -- with them? I thought you were taken -- you were -- you were captured.
CINDY They're not, um -- it's not that simple.
JACK What are they doing here, right now? What are you doing here?!!
CINDY We're here to watch, Jack.
JACK Watch what?
CINDY What is it, sweetheart?
CINDY She wants to know how Ana Lucia's doing.
JACK Are you serious?
CINDY What?
JACK If you've got something to watch, Cindy, go watch it!! Go!!
KATE Sawyer. Sawyer, wake up. He's gone. Karl's gone.
SAWYER Where? Hold up.
SAWYER I got it.
KATE No, let me talk to him.
SAWYER I got it -- boys only.
KARL Ow!! What the hell was that for?!
SAWYER So you'd cowboy up. Crying in the jungle -- I thought you people were supposed to be tough.
KARL I am tough.
SAWYER Sure you are, Bobby. Bobby, the Brady Bunch?
KARL What the hell's the Brady Bunch?
SAWYER Okay, anyway look, Karl -- I've been with a lot of girls -- some of them worth the trouble, some not. Every now and again there's one -- one you name dumb stars with. So this girl, Sally Slingshot --
KARL Alex.
SAWYER Yeah. Do you love her?
KARL More than anything.
SAWYER Then go back to wherever the hell your yards are and get her back.
KARL If I get caught -- they'll kill me this time.
SAWYER Well, at least it'll be worth it.
ALEX I want to ask you something. They're not watching anymore so you can tell me the truth.
JACK Okay.
ALEX Ben -- why'd you save his life? All this time -- after all he did to you and your people you should hate him. But you still fixed him up, even after your friends got away. Why?
JACK You're his daughter.
ALEX Answer the question.
JACK I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine. Where's Juliet?
ALEX She's with the rest of them. They're going to read her verdict.
JACK Her verdict?
ALEX And we all know what it's going to be. We're pretty strict about killing one of our own. Eye for an eye.
JACK Who did she kill?
ALEX The man who was going to murder your friends. No wonder you're so worried about her. If it wasn't for you she never would have done it. That was 3 questions. Your turn, Jack.
JACK I saved your father because I said I would. Hey, hey! Is he still in charge?
ALEX What?
JACK Ben, your father, is he still in charge? Will that woman, Isabel, do what he says?
ALEX Yeah.
JACK Get me out of this cage.
JACK I wouldn't do that!
BEN The cavalry has arrived, at last.
JACK I'd be more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon.
BEN We had an excellent surgeon, Jack. His name was Ethan.
JACK You've got a very serious infection, Ben. That infected tissue needs to be reincised, debrided; and you need to be closely monitored from here on out. There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications. You might not walk again.
BEN Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.
JACK Well, then it's too bad you're stuck with me.
BEN Am I?
JACK You need a doctor, Ben -- someone to stay with you -- bring you back to good health.
BEN And, here we go again. I've already given you a ticket off this island, Jack. What's it going to cost me this time?
JACK Right now, your people are in a room deciding whether or not to execute Juliet. You're going to stop it.
BEN Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack. It doesn't matter what she's done. No matter what you think -- she's one of us.
JACK Do we have a deal or not?
BEN Does Isabel have a walkie?
ALEX They're already in the meeting.
BEN Then get me something to write on.
ACHARA You followed me.
JACK What is all this?
ACHARA This is where I work. And you shouldn't be here.
JACK This is, uh, a tattoo parlor. That was your big secret? The envelopes? Your gift?
ACHARA I am not a tattoo artist. I am able to see who people are. My work is not decoration; it is definition. And this, this is my gift.
JACK So you see who people are?
ACHARA Yes, and I mark them.
JACK So tell me who I am.
ACHARA No.
JACK Why not?
ACHARA You are an outsider.
JACK So you can sleep with me?
ACHARA I'm not allowed.
JACK Do you see who I am, Achara?
ACHARA Yes.
JACK Who am I?
ACHARA You are a leader, a great man. But this, this makes you lonely, and frightened, and angry.
JACK Now, put it on me. Put it on me.
ACHARA No. This, this is against my people.
ACHARA There will be consequences, Jack.
JACK There always are.
ALEX No, you shouldn't be here. Just stand back. Don't say anything.
TOM Alex. Jack! What the hell did you bring him here for?!!
ISABEL Let him go, Tom. What's going on, Alex?
ALEX This is from Ben.
ISABEL Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence. Execution is off the table. He says the rules don't apply. He has, however, ordered her to be marked.
JACK Where you going?!
JACK Hey, I know you. I'm Achara's friend from -- Chet, from the restaurant. Let go of me, man.
CHET You will get off our beach!! You will leave this country!! Do you understand me?!
JULIET I heard you only liked them grilled.
JACK I miss the toothpicks, too. Let me see.
JULIET Jack.
JACK They mark you? Let me see it?
JACK Break a branch off that aloe plant over there...
JULIET It's okay, Jack.
JACK Please, please do it. Turn around.
JULIET Why did you help me?
JACK He told you he was going to let you go home. He told me the same thing. We're going to make sure he keeps his word.
JULIET And how are we going to do that?
JACK Together.
JULIET They'll be coming for you in a few minutes. All of them. Your friends know where we are so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live.
JACK Go where?
JULIET Well, Ben calls it home.
KATE Where's Karl?
SAWYER I let him go.
KATE You what?!
SAWYER I let him go.
KATE He could have led us back to where they live.
SAWYER What, you think I cut him loose because I'm so damn sensitive? The kid's a target! Ben ain't never going to stop looking for him so as long--
KATE All Ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible.
SAWYER Let's get back to camp. Well, are you coming, or not?
KATE Should I walk beside you, or ten paces behind you? You've gotten so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore.
SAWYER Don't take it out on me because you feel guilty.
KATE I don't feel guilty.
SAWYER The hell you don't.
KATE We had to leave Jack behind. I didn't have a choice.
SAWYER I'm not talking about leaving Jack behind. I'm talking about you and me. I know you did it because you thought I was a dead man. So don't beat yourself up because the Doc's left behind.
KATE I'm not beating myself up.
SAWYER Of course you're not. So, now that we got that out of the way, let's go.
ISABEL "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us." Your tattoos -- that's what they say.
JACK That's what they say. It's not what they mean.
