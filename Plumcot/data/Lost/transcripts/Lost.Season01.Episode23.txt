michael_dawson What are you doing?
walt_lloyd Watching TV.
michael_dawson Oh, man, do you see what time it is? Go back to sleep, Walt.
walt_lloyd I always watch this show.
michael_dawson Okay, then, can you at least turn it down a little.
michael_dawson I said turn it down, Walt.
walt_lloyd Brian lets me watch it as loud as I want.
michael_dawson I'm not Brian.
walt_lloyd Let's go, Vincent.
michael_dawson Hey, where do you think you're going? Hey, Walt.
walt_lloyd Get away from me! Leave me alone!
michael_dawson Don't even - don't you think about it.
walt_lloyd I said get away from me!
michael_dawson Don't you walk away from me.
michael_dawson Look, I don't think so. Come on.
walt_lloyd Get off of me!
michael_dawson I don't like this either, but you're getting on that plane.
walt_lloyd No, I'm not!
steve_jenkins What's going on?
michael_dawson It's okay, I'm his father.
walt_lloyd No, you're not. You're not my father! You're not my father!
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad, wake up!
michael_dawson What? What?
walt_lloyd Somebody's here.
michael_dawson Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop, slow, slow down. Stay right there. Who is that?
james_ford She's got to be the French chick.
sayid_jarrah Calm down everyone. It's alright.
sayid_jarrah Danielle? Danielle? What are you doing here?
danielle_rousseau The Others are coming.
danielle_rousseau Our ship went aground on this Island 16 years ago. There were 6 of us -- my team, 6. At that time I was already 7 months pregnant. I delivered the infant myself. The baby and I were together for only 1 week when I saw black smoke -- a pillar of black smoke 5 kilometers inland. That night they came, they came and took her -- Alex. They took my baby. And now, they're coming again. They're coming for all of you.
dr_jack_shephard Who's coming?
danielle_rousseau The Others. You have only 3 choices run, hide, or die.
dr_jack_shephard This is a woman who blew up her own shelter. And now she's talking about seeing black smoke and hearing whispers. I mean, she's not playing with a full deck.
john_locke That doesn't mean that what she's saying isn't true.
dr_jack_shephard Well, if you want to focus on the "what if,", be my guest, but I've got to stick with what's tangible. And right now, that's the launching of the raft.
dr_jack_shephard How's it going?
michael_dawson I wanted to get off today, but, realistically, man, after we get the rudder done, we've still got to lay the rails to get it down to the water.
jinsoo_kwon Good.
dr_jack_shephard Wouldn't it save time if we were laying the rails while you were finishing the rudder?
michael_dawson Manpower shortage.
dr_jack_shephard What do you need to lay the rails and then move the boat?
michael_dawson To get it all done today? Pretty much everybody.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, give me 20 minutes.
dr_jack_shephard Grab as many palm tree logs as you can find, the longer the better. Take them over to the raft area and Michael will know what to do with them.
marshal_edward_mars Okay.
michael_dawson You need to get them in there tight. You need leverage to get them on the rails. Good, that's good. Okay, that's good man. Just get it under there, okay? Okay. You alright?
john_locke Yep.
michael_dawson So, listen, on my count - I'll do 1-2-3—lift and then push, okay? Got it? Okay, c'mon. Once we get it down to the water line, we'll drop it and load it up. Alright. Ready. 1-2-3! Lift!
michael_dawson Push! Push, c'mon guys, push, push! Use the levers, use the levers! Good, good. 1-2-3, lift!
michael_dawson I can't believe this Can't believe it.
james_ford What are you looking at me for?! It's not my fault!
michael_dawson You missed a lever!
james_ford Because you couldn't keep the raft going straight!
michael_dawson I couldn't keep the boat going straight? Everybody's attention-
walt_lloyd Dad! Look.
dr_jack_shephard How many of them are there?
danielle_rousseau I told you all I know.
sayid_jarrah There has to be more you tell us. How did you know?
danielle_rousseau You have a bigger problem. I can vanish into the jungle, but I'm just one person. You have 40 people. Where will you hide them?
hugo_reyes Dude. Whoa.
danielle_rousseau What is this?
dr_jack_shephard We were hoping you could tell us.
danielle_rousseau I have never seen anything like it.
hugo_reyes Uh, question -- how do we know we can all, like, fit in there?
john_locke No handle on the outside, means there must be another way in. Another entrance means space.
sayid_jarrah This is a mistake. We don't know anything about these Others. We're reacting with no information, no intelligence. This hatch might even be theirs. Black smoke on the horizon doesn't mean they're-
danielle_rousseau It means they're coming!
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, we got that.
john_locke You booby-trapped your shelter with explosives. You have any more?
danielle_rousseau Dynamite, at the Black Rock, in the dark territory.
hugo_reyes Well, that's 3 reasons to go right there.
danielle_rousseau If we're to make it back by sunset we have to leave within the hour.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon. Why were you yelling? -- The girl, at the check-in counter? You were yelling at her.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry, uh, do I know you?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm on your flight. LA? So your dad died, huh?
dr_jack_shephard I thought you didn't hear what I was yelling about.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I was being polite.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. My dad died.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA How?
dr_jack_shephard A heart attack.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Not a drinker, huh?
dr_jack_shephard No, no, not really.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No ring because you're single or because you don't like wearing one?
dr_jack_shephard You asking me if I'm married?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Are you married?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, not any more. Can we get another tequila and tonic, please?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I didn't think you were listening.
dr_jack_shephard So, what's your name?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Ana Lucia.
dr_jack_shephard So, tell me, Ana Lucia, why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I hate flying. And they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane where the wheels come down right under your damn feet. So where are you sitting?
dr_jack_shephard 23B.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA 42F. Wanna trade? Hey, yeah. I'm in Sydney. Hold on. Sorry...
dr_jack_shephard Jack.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Jack, I've got to talk. We'll have the next drink on the plane, okay?
dr_jack_shephard 42F.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA 42F, right. And Jack, the worst part's over.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I know you're all scared. And I know everybody has a lot of questions. All I can tell you right now is that we do have a plan. We've got to go into the jungle to get some supplies. We'll be back in a few hours. In the meantime, do everything you can to help Michael get that raft on the water. And after that, go to the caves. We'll be back as soon as we can. I promise.
dr_leslie_arzt Hey, nice speech. Plan's a little flawed, but, hey, nobody's perfect.
dr_jack_shephard What plan?
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah, your plan. You're going to go into the jungle and get some dynamite and blow open a hatch and then you're going to hide everyone inside. You want to keep a secret, don't tell the fat guy.
dr_jack_shephard What do you want, Arzt?
dr_leslie_arzt God knows how long that dynamite has been out there. And from what I can tell, Madam Nutso doesn't seem too concerned with how to handle it. So, unless you want to blow up, I'm coming with you.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. Grab some water bottles. We're leaving in half an hour.
michael_dawson We can salvage the cable but we need new bamboo for the mast.
jinsoo_kwon 이거, 어떻게 다시 얹어 놓지?
michael_dawson We need to fix the rudder before we even start to think about that.
jinsoo_kwon 올리다가 방향키가 부러지면 어떡해?
james_ford Need some help?
michael_dawson Let's just get this done first.
james_ford Hey, this wasn't my fault. So put me to work.
michael_dawson No offense, we just work faster this way, okay.
jinsoo_kwon 다 끝나셨어요? 일 좀 할까요?
michael_dawson Alright, alright. What do you think I'm doing over here?
detective_calderwood You remember me? 3 nights ago? You were hauled in here thrashing and fighting. As you were being escorted by you kicked my desk. And you broke my mug.
james_ford Nice kids.
detective_calderwood Sadly for you, breaking my mug was not the most significant mistake you made that evening.
james_ford C'mon, Doctor, I got into a bar fight. Isn't that a badge of honor in this country?
detective_calderwood Do you know who you head-butted in that bar? You head-butted the Honorable Warren Truss, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. One of the most important pe-
james_ford He head-butted me.
detective_calderwood We have witnesses he did no such thing.
james_ford Of course.
detective_calderwood You think this is funny, James? James Ford, assault, wire fraud, identity theft, bank fraud, telemarketing fraud...
james_ford This going some place?
detective_calderwood You're a blight, a stain, a scavenger. You're a conman who prays on the weak and the needy. Tell me something, James, how do you live with yourself?
james_ford I do just fine.
detective_calderwood Do you? You're not even worth what it would cost us to incarcerate you. Which is why you're being deported. Your plane leaves this afternoon. And, James, you're banned from ever setting foot in Australia again.
james_ford Don't you worry, I ain't ever coming back here.
detective_calderwood Best not, mate.
dr_jack_shephard A lumberjack.
james_ford Excuse me?
dr_jack_shephard I never asked you what you did back in the real world, so, I'm taking a wild guess -- lumberjack.
james_ford Something I can help you with, Doc, because I've got work to do.
dr_jack_shephard I've got something for you. You're the only one on the raft who knows how to use one.
james_ford What do I need a gun for?
dr_jack_shephard Just in case.
james_ford You think we're going to run out of food or water? Am I supposed to put the kid out of his misery?
dr_jack_shephard Just in case.
james_ford What are you doing with the rest of them?
dr_jack_shephard I'm giving them to Sayid.
james_ford Going into the jungle after the boom sticks, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford By the time you get back, we'll be in the water. Guess this is pretty much goodbye, then.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I guess it is. Good luck, Sawyer.
james_ford Jack. -- About a week before we all got on the plane, I got to talking to this man in a bar in Sydney. He was American, too. A doctor. I've been on some benders in my time, but this guy -- he was going for an all time record. So, it turns out this guy has a son. His son's a doctor, too. They had some kind of big time falling out. The guy knew it was his fault, even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing. See, kids are like dogs, you knock them around enough they'll think they did something to deserve it. Anyway, there's a pay phone in this bar. And this guy, Christian, tells me he wishes he had the stones to pick up the phone, call his kid, tell him he's sorry, that he's a better doctor than he'll ever be -- he's proud, and he loves him. I had to take off, but -- something tells me he never got around to making that call. Small world, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford Good luck, Jack.
australian_official OFFICIAL You going to be armed?
marshal_edward_mars Yes, sir, ankle holster.
australian_official OFFICIAL You have to stow this in the crew luggage compartment in the front.
marshal_edward_mars No problemo.
australian_official OFFICIAL Why do you need 5 guns?
marshal_edward_mars Gee, you want to tell him, Kate? Why do I need 5 guns? She's shy.
australian_official OFFICIAL What's this, then?
marshal_edward_mars That's a good story, you want to tell it, huh, Kate? This belonged to her childhood sweetheart who she got killed a couple of years ago when she was on the run. Poor guy -- a wife, a 2 year old kid. What was his name? Hmm? Well, somewhere along the way during the 3 years that I was chasing her, she starts calling me, at my house, and whining on about her mitigating circumstances. But what she's really doing is taunting me. So, I tell her that I've got whats-his-name's little toy airplane in a safe deposit box in New Mexico. So, she somehow figures out which bank, which safe deposit box. She seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank, and then she puts a bullet in her new friend because she's done using him. But she leaves all the money. She just takes the plane because that's the one thing in the whole world that Kate does care about. She has no attachments, and I think she's telling herself she needs it to atone for killing her boyfriend, whats-his-name. God, Kate, c'mon, what was his name?
kate_austen Tom, it's Tom, you son-of-a-bitch!
marshal_edward_mars And that is why I need 5 guns.
kate_austen So, you're heading out?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen I was thinking that I might go with you -- for old time's sake? I want to help.
dr_jack_shephard You won't be here for the raft launching.
kate_austen Yeah, well, I'm -- I'm not very good at goodbyes.
dr_jack_shephard Grab your stuff.
charlie_pace Thanks, man, I'll keep it safe. Hey, Locke, do you have a message? It's going on the raft. You know "Dear mom, Everything's fine. I'm on the Island, unless, of course, the black smoke people turn up. Love, your name here." For when they get rescued—they can contact your family.
john_locke Message in a bottle. That's sweet.
charlie_pace You ready?
hugo_reyes Here you go.
charlie_pace Okay.
hugo_reyes Don't look at it.
charlie_pace You got it.
hugo_reyes Dude! Do not look at it.
charlie_pace Arzt, do you want paper?
dr_leslie_arzt I gave at the office.
charlie_pace Okay.
michael_dawson Careful.
hugo_reyes Good luck, dude. Keep dry, kiddo.
walt_lloyd I will.
michael_dawson Hey, good luck.
dr_jack_shephard Same to you.
michael_dawson See you soon.
dr_jack_shephard Yes, you will. Hey, guy, look after your dad, okay.
walt_lloyd I will.
dr_jack_shephard Alright. Jin. Good luck.
jinsoo_kwon 조심해요.
kate_austen Hey, have -- have you seen Sawyer?
charlie_pace No.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, let's go.
charlie_pace Take care, okay.
john_locke Where'd you get the scratches?
danielle_rousseau A bush.
john_locke Mean bush.
danielle_rousseau We've got to keep moving.
hugo_reyes Let me ask you something, Arnzt.
dr_leslie_arzt Arzt.
hugo_reyes Arnzt.
dr_leslie_arzt No, not Arnzt, Arzt. A-R-Z-T, Arzt.
hugo_reyes Sorry, man, the name's hard to pronounce.
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah, well, I know a bunch of 9th graders who pronounce it just fine.
hugo_reyes How about I just call you by your first name?
dr_leslie_arzt How about you don't?
hugo_reyes Why not? I remember it from the plane's manifest. I think Leslie's a bitchin' name.
dr_leslie_arzt Arnzt is fine.
danielle_rousseau Le Territoire Fonce.
dr_jack_shephard The Dark Territory.
danielle_rousseau The Black Rock is not far. This is where it all began -- where my team got infected, where Montand lost his arm. We must move quickly.
dr_leslie_arzt You know what? I'm going back.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, I thought you wanted to help.
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah, I wanted to help and that was before Montand lost his fricking arm.
dr_jack_shephard Well, what about the dynamite?
dr_leslie_arzt Just be very careful with it.
michael_dawson No, no, no! This one goes there! That one goes there!
jinsoo_kwon Okay, okay.
james_ford Hey, Chief! Cut and measured to length -- perfect mast.
michael_dawson Thanks.
james_ford Well, alright. Now, are we going to get off this rock or stand around talking about it?
kate_austen Did you hear that?
dr_leslie_arzt Run! Run! Run!
dr_leslie_arzt Run!
hugo_reyes What are you...
john_locke Just be still.
danielle_rousseau Here, in here.
hugo_reyes Dude, we've got to book.
john_locke Wait. It's headed the other way.
danielle_rousseau We're safe now.
kate_austen What was that thing?
danielle_rousseau It's a security system.
dr_jack_shephard Security system? What does that mean?
danielle_rousseau Its purpose is that of any security systems -- to protect something.
kate_austen Protect what?
danielle_rousseau The Island.
hugo_reyes Uh, where's Arnzt?
dr_leslie_arzt It's Arzt, you idiot.
hugo_reyes Dude, I thought you were dead.
dr_leslie_arzt Can we just, please, go get the dynamite, please?
walt_lloyd Why are you folding the clothes?
shannon_rutherford Because I'm anal. Is there something you want?
walt_lloyd I think you should take Vincent.
shannon_rutherford Are you serious?
walt_lloyd He'll take care of you.
shannon_rutherford What makes you think I need a dog to take care of me?
walt_lloyd Vincent took care of me when my mom died -- and nobody would talk to me. They pretended like nothing happened. So I had to talk to Vincent. He's a good listener. You could talk to him about Boone if you want.
shannon_rutherford Alright, but only until you get us rescued, okay.
airport_cop ANNOUNCEMENT Flight 338 to Fiji will be delayed. Please check the board for flight details.
sayid_jarrah Excuse me, would you mind watching my bag for a moment? I'll be right back.
shannon_rutherford Sure, whatever.
sayid_jarrah Thank you.
boone_carlyle I couldn't get us into first class.
shannon_rutherford Why not?
boone_carlyle Um, maybe you shouldn't have yelled at the gate agent.
shannon_rutherford What? You're on his side, now?
boone_carlyle One day you're going to appreciate everything I do for you.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, I can't wait for that day.
shannon_rutherford You can try again with the gate agent.
boone_carlyle Would you let it go?
shannon_rutherford Excuse me for not being pathetic enough to not want to sit next to some crying baby for the next 15 hours.
boone_carlyle Oh god, you can be a bitch.
shannon_rutherford Oh, you want to play? I will get you thrown off this flight.
boone_carlyle Yeah, how are you going to do that?
shannon_rutherford I can do whatever I want. I could tell them...
boone_carlyle Tell them what? Who's going to believe you? You're not even capable of...
shannon_rutherford You have no idea what I'm capable of.
shannon_rutherford Excuse me, sir?
airport_cop COP Yes, ma'am.
shannon_rutherford Hi, um, some Arab guy just left his bags in the chairs downstairs and then just walked away.
airport_cop COP Can you describe him, please?
shannon_rutherford Um, Arab? He went towards the shops. How's that?
sayid_jarrah I salvaged a few things for you from the Beechcraft. This is the plane's radar emitter. It needs to be mounted on the mast or the top of the cabin.
james_ford I'll do it.
sayid_jarrah Michael, to conserve power, turn it on only once every hour or so. It will show you any ships within the horizon line, approximately 25 miles. The same with the radio transmitter. This was in the plane's toolbox. There's only one flare. Choose wisely when you use it.
john_locke Why are we stopping?
danielle_rousseau Because we're here. This is the Black Rock.
jinsoo_kwon 왜 이렇게 오래 걸렸어? 배고파 죽겠는데.
sunhwa_kwon 사람들이 너무 많아서. 먹을게 별로 없어서 그냥 간단한 걸로 사왔어요. Here.

jinsoo_kwon 정말 미안하다...
sunhwa_kwon 저도요. 당신이 꼭 갈 필요는 없잖아요.
jinsoo_kwon 아직도 모르겠어? 난 지금 벌을 받고 있는 중이야. 나 때문에 얼마나 고생했는지 잘 알고 있어. 당신 같은 여자가 왜 이 고생을 해야돼?
sunhwa_kwon 여보...

sunhwa_kwon 그럼 당신은... 당신은 누가 지켜줄 거에요?

michael_dawson Go, go, go!
walt_lloyd Bye Vincent, bye Vincent!
walt_lloyd Stay, Vincent! Go back, Vincent! Vincent, go back, go back!
michael_dawson What'd I say?
walt_lloyd We did it!
