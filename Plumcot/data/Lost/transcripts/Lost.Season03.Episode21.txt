charlie_pace Anyone want to venture a guess as to what Jack's going to be showing us out here in the middle of nowhere?
hugo_reyes I dunno. Stuff. Probably secret stuff.
charlie_pace Why does everything have to be such a secret? How about some openness for a change?
hugo_reyes We kept the parachute lady secret.
charlie_pace Ah, that's different.
claire_littleton Different how?
charlie_pace Well, because we weren't out there playing football with them—
charlie_pace What?
desmond_hume Nothing.
charlie_pace Wait. You had one of your flashes again, didn't you?
desmond_hume No, Charlie. I didn't.
dr_jack_shephard We're here.
dr_jack_shephard A couple of nights ago, Juliet came to me and she told me everything that Ben had sent her here to find out which of our women were pregnant...
kate_austen So what, you guys were doing tests on us?
dr_juliet_burke No, but that's what he wanted me to do. I've been leaving tapes at the medical station. You all heard what he said; they're coming tomorrow. Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
sayid_jarrah While I appreciate your honesty, Jack, it doesn't explain why you brought us out here.
dr_jack_shephard DANIELLE!
dr_jack_shephard Show 'em.
dr_jack_shephard When Juliet told me they were coming, the first thing I thought was, "Where the hell are we gonna hide this time?" But hiding's pointless. They're just gonna keep coming back. So I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days she's been bringing dynamite back from the Black Rock. For the very first time we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it, and they have no idea that we're gonna be waiting for 'em. So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's gonna be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.
charlie_pace Oh, bloody hell!! Why are we even doing this?!
liam_pace Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
charlie_pace Headlining? We're playing Clitheroe — the arse-end of nowhere.
liam_pace A gig's a gig. We're building our fan base.
charlie_pace Will our fan base pay for a new sodding tire?
liam_pace Only if we show up. So let's just get on with it, shall we?
charlie_pace You know what, Liam? You get on with it. I quit.
liam_pace You giving up?
charlie_pace There's nothing to give up on! We're broke. The album's not selling. We're a bloody joke—
DRIVER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode21 Hey, shut it! Listen!
charlie_pace That's us. We're on the radio.
liam_pace That we are.
charlie_pace We're on the bloody radio!
liam_pace I told you, baby brother, we're gonna be bloody rock stars!
naomi_dorrit Can I ask you something?
charlie_pace Yeah?
naomi_dorrit Who are you people about to go to war with?
charlie_pace Now that's a long story. Wanna ask me something else?
naomi_dorrit You having a laugh?
charlie_pace No, of course not. I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.
naomi_dorrit You're from Manchester then?!
charlie_pace I am. My band got its start at the Night and Day bar on Oldham Street.
naomi_dorrit What band?
charlie_pace Oh, we're called Drive Shaft.
naomi_dorrit Yeah, yeah, I know you.
charlie_pace We had our moment in the sun—
naomi_dorrit No, not that, the crash. You're the dead rock star. They made a big deal out of you when they found the plane — huge memorial service, new album.
charlie_pace There's a new album?
naomi_dorrit Yeah. God, it was everywhere... a greatest hits thing.
naomi_dorrit Hey, look on the bright side. You're not really dead, right?
charlie_pace Yeah, right.
danielle_rousseau We need more wire so we can trigger these from a safe distance.
dr_jack_shephard I can get some people to start stripping the plane wreckage.
danielle_rousseau Good. I should be able to finish rigging these tents in the next 24 hours. We'll be ready by tomorrow night.
sayid_jarrah We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
dr_jack_shephard Not now.
sayid_jarrah If you're angry I doubted you, I'll be happy to make a sincere apology later, but now we have a means of—
dr_jack_shephard Look I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid—
sayid_jarrah And I am trying to get us off this Island, Jack!
sayid_jarrah I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency. If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can go there, switch off your message, and call for help.
danielle_rousseau That signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it. What makes you think that you'll have better luck?
sayid_jarrah But Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore. I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they will hear us—
dr_juliet_burke No, they won't.
sayid_jarrah And why is that?
dr_juliet_burke We're jamming it.
dr_jack_shephard What?
dr_juliet_burke Ben is using one of the DHARMA stations to block all of the signals off of the Island except for ours.
sayid_jarrah What station?
dr_juliet_burke They call it the Looking Glass.
sayid_jarrah The Looking Glass.
dr_juliet_burke Yes, but it's underwater. I have no idea where it is.
sayid_jarrah I believe I do.
claire_littleton Look, I know Jack thinks it's best, but, you know, what if they're coming for him again?
charlie_pace Claire, listen to me. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to protect Aaron. I promise. Everything is going to be fine.
desmond_hume Er, sorry. Er, Charlie. Can you give me a hand with something?
charlie_pace Yeah, Desmond. Course.
charlie_pace So, you ready to tell me what you saw this morning?
desmond_hume Aye.
charlie_pace Right. So how's it happen this time?
charlie_pace Come on, Des. You can tell me. I can take it.
desmond_hume What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter. A helicopter that lifts off — leaves this Island.
charlie_pace Are you sure?
desmond_hume Aye.
charlie_pace A rescue helicopter on this beach?
charlie_pace This Island — that's what you saw?
charlie_pace We're getting bloody rescued! I thought you were gonna tell me I was gonna die again!
desmond_hume You are, Charlie.
charlie_pace Wait, what?
desmond_hume If you don't, none of it will happen. There won't be any rescue. I'm sorry, brother, but this time — this time you have to die.
simon_pace PACE Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on, Charlie! Jump in. I'm gonna catch you boy!
charlie_pace No. You're just going to back away.
simon_pace PACE Don't be daft. Jump in.
charlie_pace No.
simon_pace PACE I promise, Charlie, I'm gonna catch ya.
liam_pace No he won't.
simon_pace PACE Zip it, you! Don't listen to your brother. Just jump on in. There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. I'll catch ya, I promise.
charlie_pace I did it!
simon_pace PACE You've got it.
charlie_pace Seen it!
simon_pace PACE You're swimming, Charlie, you're swimming!
desmond_hume What are you writing?
charlie_pace Nothing. All right, tell me.
desmond_hume You sure you wanna know? I mean it might be easier if you jus—
charlie_pace Yeah. I want to know.
desmond_hume You're inside a hatch. It's, er... a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch... light goes off... and then you drown.
charlie_pace When?
desmond_hume I don't know.
charlie_pace You sure you saw Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter?
desmond_hume Aye.
charlie_pace So, before I drown, I just have to flip a switch.
desmond_hume That's right.
charlie_pace Where is it, then?
sayid_jarrah Now this is the Looking Glass. Its an underwater DHARMA station. Please, can you tell me anything you might know about this place?
dr_juliet_burke I've never been down there. I don't know anyone who has.
dr_jack_shephard Why not?
dr_juliet_burke There was some accident. Ben told us that the station was completely flooded.
dr_jack_shephard Well, if it's flooded then how does it still work?
sayid_jarrah How it still works is irrelevant. The question is, how do we get it to stop working, so we can use the satellite phone. The diagram shows that the Looking Glass is connected to the Island by a cable. I feel sure that this is the very same cable down the beach which runs into the ocean. So if we follow the cable, it should lead us to the station.
dr_jack_shephard So how are we gonna get in?
sayid_jarrah We swim in. There's a moon pool. A room with an open floor at the base of the station, big enough for a submarine to dock. Even if the station's flooded, I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it.
dr_jack_shephard What about swimming back out?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission just to flip a switch.
sayid_jarrah But someone has to do it or we'll never leave this Island.
charlie_pace I'll do it. Swim down, turn off that bloody switch, swim back up. Piece of cake.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, you don't even know what we're talking about.
charlie_pace I was junior swim champion in Northern England. I can hold my breath for four minutes. I know exactly what you're talking about, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard No. And there's no reason to do this now. We're going to focus on the Others, and then we'll deal with this.
sayid_jarrah Wait a minute. We have the chance to signal for a rescue.
dr_jack_shephard Look, for 90 days I've been asked to make decisions for this entire camp. There you go. I just made one.
bernard_nadler Rose, that's a sailor's hitch. It's not gonna hold. You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
rose_nadler Oh, so now you're knot expert.
bernard_nadler Well, trust me, it's, uh...
bernard_nadler How did you do that?
rose_nadler Watch and learn, dear. Watch and learn.
jinsoo_kwon 나한테는 언제 말해 줄 거야? 자기야, 제발. 테이프 들을 때 줄리엣이 우리 이름을 거론하던데. 모두 다 당신을 보고 있었어. 혹시 임신때문에 그런 거 아니야?
sunhwa_kwon 나 우리 애기 봤어요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐?
sunhwa_kwon 줄리엣이 검사실에 데려갔는데, 그랬는데...
jinsoo_kwon 그래, 괜찮대?
sunhwa_kwon 응, 아주 건강하대요.
hugo_reyes Hey!!! Look, there!!! Look!!
james_ford Get off him, dammit, it's OK.
sayid_jarrah What?! He's one of them!
james_ford I know, I know, it's OK. He was in the cage next to me. I know this guy. What the hell are you doing here, Karl?
karl_martin They're coming. My people.
james_ford Sorry you came all this way for nothing, but we already know.
karl_martin Then why are you still here?
james_ford Because when your people show up here tomorrow night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
karl_martin Tomorrow? No. No, they're coming tonight. They're coming right now!!!
alex_rousseau Hey! When'd you get back?
ben_linus Just now.
alex_rousseau Where's Locke?
ben_linus Here's your gun back.
richard_alpert Ben, what's going on?
ben_linus Where's Ryan?
richard_alpert He's at his tent, are you...
ben_linus It's time to get them.
richard_alpert But you said tomorrow.
ben_linus Jacob wants it to happen now.
richard_alpert Look, what happened out there--did John see...
ben_linus John had an accident. Ryan!
ryan_pryce Yes sir.
ben_linus If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp?
ryan_pryce Well, if I take my ten best, we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.
ben_linus Then you'd better get going.
richard_alpert No, no, Ben, wait, moving at this schedule, Juliet may not be ready. What if she hasn't had time to...
ben_linus Then we'll take all their women. And we'll sort out the ones we need later.
ryan_pryce And the men?
ben_linus If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em.
ryan_pryce All right.
alex_rousseau Karl. It's me.
karl_martin I thought you were bringing rabbit.
alex_rousseau You have to go. Now.
karl_martin What? Did he find out I was out here?
alex_rousseau No. But he's sending Pryce to their beach camp right now, you have to warn them.
karl_martin Warn them?
alex_rousseau You have to go, now!
karl_martin I thought they were going to just take the pregnant women.
alex_rousseau If you take the outrigger, you'll get there a few hours before them.
karl_martin Whoa, wait, Alex...
alex_rousseau He's gonna kill them, Karl! Austen and Ford saved your life. You owe them. You better take this.
karl_martin If I get caught, your father's gonna kill me this time.
alex_rousseau Is he my father?
alex_rousseau Now go.
dr_jack_shephard Is that everything?
karl_martin Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard You trust him?
karl_martin You don't trust me? What about her!
karl_martin She's a spy. She's supposed to mark the tents of the pregnant women with white rocks so they can take them.
dr_juliet_burke They know, Karl, but thanks.
hugo_reyes So what are we going to do?
sunhwa_kwon We have to leave now. Hide.
bernard_nadler Where? It's their Island; if they wanna kill us, they'll find us.
dr_jack_shephard The sun's gonna go down in a few hours. Do we have enough wire yet?
danielle_rousseau Not even close.
dr_jack_shephard We've gotta figure out a different way of setting the dynamite off.
sayid_jarrah We could shoot.
dr_jack_shephard We don't have enough guns. He said that ten of them are coming, armed.
sayid_jarrah Not the Others, the tents. We can camouflage the dynamite next to the tents. Target it from our positions at the tree line.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet marked three tents, that means we need three guns.
hugo_reyes Whoa!
karl_martin Here. You can have mine too.
danielle_rousseau I'll be your third.
dr_jack_shephard We'll take your gun, but you're not staying here. You're gonna lead everyone to the radio tower. Everyone.
claire_littleton Radio tower?!
dr_jack_shephard Now, if this doesn't work, we can't risk losing the chance of getting in contact with Naomi's boat, so everything has to happen at the same time. Charlie? You still up for a swim?
charlie_pace Yeah, I believe I am.
desmond_hume I'll go with him.
dr_jack_shephard OK. We better get to it.
liam_pace Ho ho ho. It's here, baby brother. Christmas is here. Oi, are these the birds from row two? Well done, mate. Well, as you have spent another year as the only drug-free rock star in the world, I'm gonna share a little known fact with you. Father Christmas lives just down the street from here.
charlie_pace Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
liam_pace Indeed he does. And in case you haven't noticed, baby brother, Finland is the bloody North Pole. Therefore, a very special gift for you this year.
charlie_pace Liam, no. Mum gave you that. You're the first born. It was her father's and his father before that...
liam_pace And it's a family heirloom, and that's why we named the band after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know. But Charlie--let's be honest--we both know I'm a sodding mess. But you, you're different. You're gonna get married, have a family, a baby. I'll be lucky if I hit thirty.
charlie_pace Don't say that, Li.
liam_pace The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie. So please, take it. Mum would have wanted it this way. Pass it on to your little one someday. I need to know it's safe.
charlie_pace I'll hold on to it. But I won't take it. Hey, fits. Look at that.
liam_pace Happy Christmas, baby brother.
charlie_pace You need some help?
claire_littleton Why didn't you tell me you were going to do this?
charlie_pace I didn't want you to worry.
claire_littleton Well, it's dangerous, isn't it? Swimming into some underwater station.
charlie_pace It's what needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, Claire. Now you've gotta promise me something. While I'm gone, don't worry about me.
claire_littleton 'K.
charlie_pace I'll take him.
claire_littleton Thanks.
charlie_pace Hey! All right turnip head, now you take care of your Mum while I'm away, OK? I love you.
charlie_pace See you soon.
claire_littleton Be careful Charlie, 'K?
charlie_pace Yeah.
charlie_pace Sorry, guys. Thanks, man.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode21 Hey, help me! Help! Help! Help!
charlie_pace OI!!!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode21 Help!
charlie_pace Oi! Get the hell away from her.
charlie_pace What are you doing? Leave her alone!
charlie_pace You OK, Miss?
noor_abed_jaseem Yes, I think so, yes.
charlie_pace Here you go. Pardon me while I have a heart attack. The last time I was in a fight I was eight years old. And I lost.
noor_abed_jaseem Well, that makes you even more of a hero, doesn't it?
charlie_pace I just did what anyone would do.
noor_abed_jaseem Three people walked by the alley.
charlie_pace What?
noor_abed_jaseem They saw me, but they just kept on going. You are a hero, sir. And don't let anyone ever tell you differently.
charlie_pace What's that?
desmond_hume It's a weight belt. Should bring you down quicker than swimming. Well, every second counts.
charlie_pace So I just take it off when I hit bottom, swim up through the moon pool, into the station, swim into whichever room has the yellow blinking switch, flip it. Nothing to it.
desmond_hume So how long can you really hold your breath for?
charlie_pace Does it matter?
bernard_nadler You want me to hit another one?
sayid_jarrah No, you've made your point.
rose_nadler Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting in Montgomery County.
bernard_nadler I know what I'm doing.
rose_nadler No, you don't. Pheasants don't shoot back.
bernard_nadler Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose. I just have to shoot a tent. And I'll be right behind ya.
rose_nadler Then I'm staying, too.
dr_jack_shephard No, you're not, Rose.
dr_jack_shephard Everyone's gathering down at the south end of the beach. No one's staying behind but the shooters.
rose_nadler Says who? You wanna give me your word that nothing's going to happen to my husband, then I go.
dr_jack_shephard I'll give you my word that if we don't kill everyone that shows up here in about an hour, it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.
rose_nadler I like you better since you got back, Jack. You're almost an optimist. Come on. If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes, let's get ya into something dark.
dr_jack_shephard You better get going. Rousseau says it's about a day's walk up to the radio tower.
sayid_jarrah I'm not taking them to the tower. You are.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
sayid_jarrah You're not staying behind.
dr_jack_shephard This was my idea.
sayid_jarrah And I'm perfectly capable of executing it.
dr_jack_shephard I owe them!
sayid_jarrah What are you more concerned about, killing the Others, or getting our people off this Island? This afternoon you said you were our leader. It's time for you to act like one. Lead them to the radio tower, Jack. And then take us all home.
hugo_reyes Dudes, wait! I heard. I heard what you're doing. I wanna come with. Everyone — they're all going to the radio tower ... and I'm sick of trekking and, you know, explosions. I think I can help you guys out. I'm a really good paddler.
charlie_pace You can't go, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Why not?
charlie_pace Because... you're too big! You won't fit in the boat.
hugo_reyes That's uncool, man.
charlie_pace Wait, wait, wait!
hugo_reyes Dude, it's fine. I don't even wanna go on your stupid boat.
charlie_pace Catch up with you later. Just remember I love you, man.
hugo_reyes Yeah, whatever, love you too.
dr_jack_shephard You got water in there? Good, good. How about you, lot of water? Good.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen So here we go again, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Here we go again.
dr_juliet_burke The tents are all marked. We're set.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid find the third shooter?
hugo_reyes Ready, Claire? Need a hand with the little guy?
claire_littleton Er, no, thanks. I'm OK. How's my little sweetheart? We're just going to go for a little walk, so hold onto Mum, OK?
desmond_hume This is it. Ready?
charlie_pace Hiya. Do you want a blanket?
claire_littleton Oh, thanks. I got one.
charlie_pace Well, you're warming for two, take mine.
claire_littleton Thank you.
charlie_pace So, first plane crash?
claire_littleton What gave it away?
charlie_pace Ah, you can always spot the newbies. We're gonna be OK, you know.
claire_littleton Are we?
charlie_pace We're alive, we're on a beautiful Island. We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it, the helicopters will come and take us all home.
claire_littleton You really think they'll find us?
charlie_pace Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?
claire_littleton Thanks.
charlie_pace I'm Charlie.
claire_littleton I'm Claire. Nice to meet you, Charlie.
charlie_pace It's nice to meet you.
desmond_hume We're here.
charlie_pace I want you to give this to Claire for me.
desmond_hume What is it?
charlie_pace It's the five best moments of my... sorry excuse for a life. My greatest hits. You know, memories. They're all I've got.
desmond_hume You don't have to do this Charlie.
charlie_pace What?
desmond_hume I'll go.
charlie_pace No, you--your flashes.
desmond_hume Maybe I keep seeing you die because I'm supposed to take your place.
charlie_pace What about your girl, Penny?
desmond_hume What about your girl? Besides, I might be luckier than you. Keep your memories to yourself. I'll take it from here.
charlie_pace I don't know what to say.
desmond_hume Well, you could tell me where the, er, weigh belt is.
charlie_pace Right there behind you.
charlie_pace You and I both know... you're not supposed to take my place, brother.
charlie_pace I'm alive. AH! I'm alive!!!!
