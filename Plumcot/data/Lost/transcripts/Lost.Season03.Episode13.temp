GOVERNMENT WORKER Name?
LOCKE John Locke.
GOVERNMENT WORKER Marital status, Mr. Locke?
LOCKE Uh, single.
GOVERNMENT WORKER Girlfriend?
LOCKE No.
GOVERNMENT WORKER Are your parents living?
LOCKE I, I was raised in foster care. I never really knew my parents.
GOVERNMENT WORKER Have you ever considered seeking out your biological parents?
LOCKE Ah, I, ah.. I don't see how that's relevant.
GOVERNMENT WORKER It's relevant, Mr. Locke, because if the government's going to continue paying your disability insurance, I have to figure out whether or not your condition has improved. So. How's your appetite?
LOCKE Fine.
GOVERNMENT WORKER I see you've stopped submitting your therapy bills for reimbursement.
LOCKE That's 'cause I stopped going. Waste of time.
GOVERNMENT WORKER It's just a temporary suspension, Mr. Locke. As soon as you resume your sessions, you can reapply.
LOCKE You think I'm temporarily disabled?
GOVERNMENT WORKER Depression can be temporary, yes. And since you see fit to stop going to therapy, I guess you're all better.
LOCKE Guess I am.
GOVERNMENT WORKER Next!
TOM Over here!
KATE What is he doing...?!
LOCKE Shhh!
TOM Good hands!
JULIET Jack!
KATE She's the one who helped me and Sawyer escape.
JACK What's up?
JULIET Okay, I think it's going to be tomorrow.
KATE Hey, what?
SAYID Danielle.
KATE John, Rousseau's gone.
JACK Can you feel anything?
BEN So how do you feel? 
LOCKE This is going to be more complicated than we thought.
SAYID So what exactly are you saying? We simply start shooting people and hope for the best?
KATE We came here to rescue Jack, and that's what we're going to do.
SAYID But obviously the circumstances have changed. He may not want to be rescued.
KATE That is not him! That's not Jack. They must have done something to him. When they captured us, they drugged us.
SAYID He didn't appear to be drugged, Kate.
KATE They kidnapped him! Held him prisoner! He wouldn't just forget that!
SAYID I agree. But until we know why, we're putting our lives at risk.
KATE I'm not leaving him, Sayid.
SAYID You may not have a choice.
LOCKE It's Jack. The first time I saw him he was risking his life pulling people out of burning airplane wreckage. If he's shaking hands with the Others, I'm sure he has a good reason. We just have to go down there and find out what it is.
SAYID What do you suggest?
LOCKE We wait till it's dark, we approach Jack when he's alone... and if he wants out, we get him out.
AUTUMN Here's what we know, Crystal The Bolivian gold deposits were stolen last night around 2 a.m.
CRYSTAL Um, that means...?
AUTUMN The Cobra!
CRYSTAL He's back! Ah, get down!
AUTUMN I've been shot!
CRYSTAL I can't find him!
AUTUMN There! Behind winged victory! I think he's armed!
CRYSTAL I can get him!
PETER Hello. John Locke?
LOCKE I'm sorry. No solicitors. I have a sign.
PETER Uh, I'm not... I'm not trying to sell you any... Listen, my name's Peter Talbot. I, uh, I just need a couple of minutes to talk to you.
LOCKE Talk about what?
PETER My mother, actually. I think she might be in some trouble.
LOCKE You've got the wrong John Locke. 
PETER How many kidneys do you have?
PETER She met him two months ago. Love at first sight, is what she said. Guy was charming, sweet, funny. His name's Adam Seward. He's a retired computer entrepreneur from Ontario.
PETER Anyway, Adam had something... special. My mom just went ga-ga for him right out of the gate. After two months of knowing him, she agrees to marry the guy. And something about him, it... Something in my gut told me that he was after something, so I... I had to check him out.
LOCKE Well, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with me.
PETER Well, what this has to do with you, Mr. Locke, is that you donated one of your kidneys to Adam Seward. Only his name was different back then. He used to be Anthony Cooper.
PETER All I could find were his medical records. And I saw that he was the recipient of a kidney transplant from... you... so I figured, hey, someone gave the guy his kidney; how bad could he be? Right?
LOCKE Well, it, it was an anonymous donation. I never met him.
PETER Are you sure?
LOCKE Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
LOCKE Sayid, you guard the front. I'll go around and cover the back. You head in through the side door.
KATE I'm going in alone?
LOCKE It's better if you're the first one he sees.
KATE All right.
KATE Hi.
JACK What are you doing here?
KATE I came to get you.
JACK Get out of here! Right now. Go. 
KATE Jack...
JACK Kate! They're watching me!
JACK Get out of here!
KATE I'm not leaving you!
JACK Yes you are!
OTHER Get down! Get down!
PRYCE Get her down! Get her down!
JACK Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!
PRYCE Step back, Doc. Step. Back.
PRYCE Hold him still!
KATE Jack! Jack?! Jack!
PRYCE Who else is with you?
KATE Jack...
JACK Just answer the question, Kate.
PRYCE OK, one more time. Who else is with you?
KATE Nobody. Nobody else; it was just us. 
BEN Alex?
BEN John!
LOCKE Shhh. Keep your voice down.
BEN All right. It's all right, John. You don't have to point the gun at me. I can tell you where Jack is.
LOCKE I'm not looking for Jack. I'm looking for the submarine.
LOCKE The submarine. Where is it?
BEN I'm not sure what you mean, John. What submarine?
LOCKE The one you use to travel to and from the island. The one your man Mikhail told me about, right before I killed him.
ALEX Dad? Who are you talking to?
BEN Alex, don't come in here!
ALEX What do you--?! What--?! Ah! Dad--?!
LOCKE Tell her to be quiet!
BEN Alex, please!
TOM Ben? You awake?
TOM I'm coming in!
BEN What is it?
TOM It's Austen and Jarrah. They're here. Somehow they found us.
BEN Where are they now?
TOM We captured them. We're holding them over at my place. Want me to help you get out there?
BEN No. Separate them. I want to know how they found us.
TOM What about Juliet and Shephard? Tomorrow, in the morn—
BEN Let me worry about that. Just go.
TOM Got it.
BEN Richard? Wait a minute.
TOM I'll wait outside.
BEN I want you to bring me the man from Tallahassee.
ALPERT What do you need him for?
BEN Just do it. Now.
ALPERT OK.
LOCKE The man from Tallahassee? What is that? Some kind of code?
BEN No, John, unfortunately we don't have a code for "There's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head." Although we obviously should.
LOCKE Sayid — he had a pack with him. I want her to retrieve it.
BEN ...OK. But you should know, John, my daughter currently hates me. So I'm not sure holding me hostage is your best option—
ALEX Dad! I'll get your bag.
 are looking at flowers for their upcoming wedding.]
MRS. TALBOT I'm looking for something really stunning, something that will grab everyone's attention on the table. Honey? What do you think of this one?
COOPER That looks good. What do you think?
MRS. TALBOT I like it. Maybe just a little larger.
COOPER Yeah. Larger would be good. Um, I'll go over there and take a look.
COOPER Hello, John.
LOCKE Going to be a big to-do, or just the two of you and a preacher? I guess you couldn't invite me, huh? That would make for... awkward introductions.
COOPER How did you even know that I was going to--?
LOCKE I know... because her son came to me and asked why I gave you a kidney. He's on to you. But he doesn't have any proof, so he came to me, hoping I would vouch for you.
COOPER What did you say to him?
LOCKE You're conning her, aren't you? You're going to marry her for her money, right?
COOPER What is it you want, John?
LOCKE I want you to end it. I want you to call off the wedding.
COOPER Why are you doing this?
LOCKE Because. Because it's not fair! You make people think that you're their family. And then you leave their life in ruins. And I'm not going to let you do it again! You're going to call off your engagement and go... or I'm going to tell her the truth. I want to hear you say it! You say you're going to leave!
COOPER OK, John. You got it. 
BEN Would you mind helping me get into my chair? No tricks, I promise. I just want some dignity. You of all people should understand what it means to want some dignity.
BEN Thank you. So tell me, John. How do you expect to pilot our submarine? I mean, it's a complicated piece of machinery. You don't just press "submerge".
LOCKE I'll figure something out. For all you know I was a commander in the navy.
LOCKE Put your arm around my neck. I'll lift under your knees.
BEN What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikhail that means you were in the communications station. Which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning to pilot the submarine anywhere, are you? You're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke.
LOCKE You don't know me at all.
BEN I know you were born in California. I know you were raised in foster care. I know you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin, pushing papers at a company that manufactured industrial boxes. I know you spent the four years prior to your arrival on this island in a wheelchair. And I know how you ended up in it. Tell me, John. Did it hurt?
LOCKE I felt my back break. What do you think?
TOM I didn't think I'd see you again so soon, Kate.
TOM Be careful in here.
JACK Thanks.
JACK They hurt you?
KATE No. They hurt you?
JACK No.
KATE What is all this?
JACK This is where they live.
KATE And the people they took? The kids?
JACK They're all safe.
KATE Safe? So you're with them now.
JACK I'm not "with" anyone, Kate.
KATE What did they do to you?
JACK Nothing.
KATE Then why are you acting like this?
JACK There's no w- You- There's no way that I could-
KATE I came here to help you! So why don't you just tell me why you're...
JACK I told you not to come back here for me!
KATE I didn't think you meant it.
KATE What did they do to you, Jack?
JACK I made a deal with them. They're going to let me go.
KATE Where?
JACK Home.
KATE When?
JACK First thing in the morning. I can bring back help. It's our best chance--
KATE You trust these people? They are liars! Why would you believe a word that...
JACK I trust them because you told me to, Kate. When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.
KATE Jack... What did they tell you?
JULIET Jack, we need to go.
JACK I'll be right there.
JACK I asked that you not come back here for me and I wish... I wish that you hadn't.
JACK But I will come back here for you.
DETECTIVE MASON John Locke?
LOCKE Yeah...?
DETECTIVE MASON Detective Mason. That's Detective Reed. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
LOCKE No, of course not.
DETECTIVE MASON Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?
LOCKE No, I don't think so.
DETECTIVE MASON Thin, brown hair, 20s?
DETECTIVE MASON If it will be helpful, we believe he was here in your apartment two days ago.
LOCKE Oh! Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, he was a solicitor. I, I, uh, I, I sent him away.
DETECTIVE MASON Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 million dollars. So I'm curious, what exactly was he selling you door-to-door?
LOCKE Well, I... Look, I told you I don't know him, so...
DETECTIVE MASON Then why was your name and address on a piece of paper in his pocket, Mr. Locke?
LOCKE Why were y... would you be looking through his pockets?
DETECTIVE MASON Because Peter Talbot's dead.
BEN It wasn't easy, you know. Being in that hatch with you all that time. Knowing you had no business walking around. Knowing I couldn't even ask you about it without telling you who I really was.
LOCKE So ask me now. Now that I know who you really are.
BEN Was it immediate? It started the moment you got here?
LOCKE Yeah.
BEN And you were just walking? The feeling returned right after the crash? That day?
LOCKE That's what immediate means, Ben. You're wondering why it hasn't happened for you. You're not recovering as fast as you'd like. How long has it been since Jack fixed you? A week? Now that I think about it, how'd you get sick in the first place?
BEN Are you afraid it'll go away, John? Is that why you want to destroy the submarine? Because you know if you ever leave this island you'll be back in the chair?
LOCKE You got anything to eat?
PRYCE Hey. Go on home, kid. You know you're not supposed to be here.
ALEX My father sent me to get his pack.
PRYCE ... Why?
ALEX I don't know, Ryan, but he told me to get it.
PRYCE All right. Here you go.
SAYID You're Alex, aren't you?
PRYCE Hey! Can it.
ALEX How do you know my name?
SAYID Because you look like your mother.
ALEX My mother is dead.
SAYID I'm sure that's what they told you.
PRYCE Get going, Alex.
PRYCE Keep your mouth shut.
LOCKE Where do you get electricity?
BEN We have two giant hamsters running in a massive wheel at our secret underground lair...
LOCKE Yeah, that's funny.
BEN There's leftovers in the refrigerator. Help yourself.
BEN I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.
LOCKE Mmm. I never really appreciated chicken until right now.
BEN I know you think you need to do this, John, but if you blow up my submarine, I have a big problem with my people.
LOCKE Is that supposed to be an incentive not to blow it up?
BEN I was born on this island. Not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.
LOCKE So you're lying to them?
BEN No! They're here because they want to be here! Some of them are just not ready to make a full... commitment yet. But you, John ... You've already made that commitment.
BEN And now you have a choice. Because if you stop and if you think, I can show you things. Things I know you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand. Picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you, John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island, there's a very large box ... and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box, there it would be. What would you say about that, John?
LOCKE I'd say I hope that box is big enough to imagine yourself up a new submarine. 
BEN Why are you so angry, John?
LOCKE Because you're cheating! You and your people. Communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you... you come and go as you please... you use electricity and running water and guns... You're a hypocrite! A pharisee. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place really was... you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator!
BEN You've been here 80 days, John. I've been here my entire life! So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?
LOCKE Because you're in the wheelchair, and I'm not.
BEN Did you have any problems?
LOCKE OK, here's how this is going to work. She's going to take me to the sub. Once we're there, I'll let her go.
BEN John, she's done enough. Let me take you.
LOCKE I don't want you to slow me down. Come on. Let's go.
BEN John, before you go you should know—! Jack and I made a deal. In less than an hour he's leaving this island on that submarine, and it's a one-way ticket. The anomaly wiped out our communications. We have no way of contacting the outside world. Which means when that sub leaves, it can never come back. So whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go, the end result is the same. No one will find this island.
LOCKE Let's go. Come on.
ALEX You know he's manipulating you, right?
LOCKE How's that?
ALEX That's what my father does. He manipulates people. He makes you think it's your idea, but it's his.
LOCKE I'll have to keep that in mind.
ALEX The submarine is down there. At the end of the dock.
LOCKE I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.
JACK Look, I know you don't owe me anything, but I need to ask you for one last favor.
BEN You don't knock?
JACK I need you to let my friends go. After I'm gone.
BEN And if I said no, would that stop you from leaving?
JACK Of course it would.
BEN Your friends are only here to rescue you, but you seem to be doing a good job of rescuing yourself, so... I suppose there's no reason to keep them here.
JACK Do I have your word on that?
BEN You have my word.
BEN I'll let them go, just as soon as you've left the island.
BEN Well, I guess this is it.
JULIET Thank you, Ben, for keeping your promise.
PRYCE Hey! Hold it right there. Get your hands up! Get down! I said get down!
JACK What are you doing here, John?
LOCKE I'm sorry, Jack.
JACK Sorry for what?
LOCKE What did you do?
COOPER John!
LOCKE Tell me. Tell me you didn't do it!
COOPER What are you talking about?
LOCKE Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!
COOPER What? You think I had something to do with Peter's death?!
LOCKE I tell you to end things with his mother, and the next thing you know, he's dead!
COOPER John, now calm down, please. Think about what you're saying. Why would I kill Peter?
LOCKE He was on to you!
COOPER John, I've been doing this for a long time. I'm not sweating some rich kid.
LOCKE Then why are you still here?!
COOPER What do you mean?
LOCKE I tell you to leave, you tell me you're going to leave town! Why are you still here?!
COOPER Now listen, John. I'll be honest with you. I didn't end it. I was looking for an angle. I wanted to make some money before I skipped out. But then all this happened.
COOPER Peter died and everything just went straight into the tank. She's devastated. She's called off the wedding. There's no profit in it, John. I'm a con man, not a murderer. 
LOCKE She called off the wedding?
COOPER She said she couldn't deal with it. She needs to be alone.
LOCKE So if I were to call her, right now, that's what she would tell me?
COOPER Phone's right over there, John.
LOCKE What's her number—
DETECTIVE MASON Mr. Locke, we know this isn't what you want to hear, but your father's gone. We know he fled to Mexico shortly after your... encounter, then... he disappeared. I'm sorry, but he could be anywhere in the world right now.
KINCAID All right detectives, that's enough. Mr. Locke has work to do today.
DETECTIVE MASON We'll let you know if anything develops.
KINCAID John, John, John. We have got ourselves quite a day ahead of us, my friend. It's a fine time to get you up out of that bed.
LOCKE No. I don't want to.
KINCAID I don't remember asking.
KINCAID Now. Most people struggle with this at first, but don't worry, you'll get used to it.
LOCKE Uh, no, no, please, I, I, I can't do this—
KINCAID John. You fell eight stories and survived, OK? I don't want to hear about what you can't do. Now let's go. It's going to be all right.
LOCKE No, I don't, no, I don't think...
KINCAID It's going to be fine, John. Come on.
LOCKE I don't think I... think I can...
KINCAID You're fine. Ah... there you go. There you go, buddy. See? Wasn't that bad, was it? I'll be right back, buddy.
BEN Well, John, you've really gone and done it now.
LOCKE You don't have to pretend to be disappointed anymore. We both know you wanted it to happen. That's why you left the C-4 in Sayid's bag because you wanted me to make it happen.
BEN Uncuff him please, Richard.
ALPERT You going to do anything stupid?
LOCKE No, sir.
BEN Do you remember earlier, John, when you called me a cheater? When you said I didn't deserve to live on this island? Well get this There I was, shaking hands with Jack, and thinking I'd give almost anything to come up with a way to stop him from leaving... because to let him go would be a sign of weakness, of failure, of defeat. People would see that. They would know it. And that, John, would be the end of me. But to kill him... that would be cheating. Because my people also heard me make a promise, and to break my word... that would be the end of me too. And then you came striding out of the jungle, John, to make my dream come true.
LOCKE You're not going to start talking about the magic box again, are you?
BEN No, John. I'm going to show you what came out of it.
BEN When I asked you earlier if it hurt when you suffered your injury, I think you misunderstood me. Seems fairly obvious that when a person's back smashes into a hard surface after being thrown from a building, that that's going to sting a little. But I really wasn't asking about the physical pain.
LOCKE What, do you want to know if it hurt my feelings?
BEN No, John. I wanted to know what it felt like when your own father tried to kill you.
BEN He's the reason you destroyed the submarine, isn't he? You're afraid. You're afraid of him, and this is the one place he can never find you. This is the one place he can never get to.
LOCKE What do you want from me?
BEN I don't know how it happened, but you seem to have some communion with this island, John, and that makes you very, very important. You have no idea what you're talking about, of course, but in time you'll have a better understanding of things. So what do I want? I want to help you, John.
LOCKE Why?
BEN Because I'm in a wheelchair and you're not. Are you ready to see?
LOCKE Dad?
