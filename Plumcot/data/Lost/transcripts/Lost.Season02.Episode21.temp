ANA What are you building?
EKO Hello, Ana.
ANA Well, hello yourself. So, are you going to tell me? What is it?
EKO I am building a church.
ANA Now, why the hell would you want to do that?
EKO Because I was told to.
ANA Told to by who?
EKO I was just told. I think it was in a dream.
ANA A dream like this one?
ANA You need to help John.
EKO Yemi?
YEMI Hello, brother.
EKO Forgive me. I should have listened to you. You were right. I didn't want to do it.
YEMI The work being done in this place is important, Eko. It is more important than anything. And it is in danger. You must help John. He has lost his way. You must make him take you to the question mark.
YEMI John will not want to show you, so you must make him. Eko, there are many distractions, brother , but you must move past them. What is done is done. Do you understand?
EKO Yes, Yemi.
YEMI And, Eko, bring the axe.
CHARLIE What's the matter? You alright, mate?
EKO I need to find John.
JACK What were you thinking, John?
KATE Jack, leave him alone.
SAWYER No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
JACK Shut it, Sawyer. If Ana hadn't lifted your gun we wouldn't...
SAWYER Well, ain't that swell, Gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the Artist Formally Known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
JACK How about you go back to the beach?
KATE Hey, enough -- both of you.
JACK Michael, hey.
MICHAEL He shot me.
JACK Who?
MICHAEL He's gone. He ran out.
JACK Go, I got him.
MICHAEL I was sleeping and I heard gunshots. I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy. He had a gun and...
JACK Okay, come on, we've got to get you up.
EKO Let me help you.
KATE She's dead.
JACK Okay, we've got to get her up. We've got to get her to the back room, okay.
EKO Grant us this mercy, oh Lord. We beseech Thee. Amen.
JACK She's in shock. Alright, we've got to keep pressure on this.
KATE Can you do anything? Jack?
JACK I heard you. Keep pressure on her, okay. 
MICHAEL How is she?
JACK I'm doing what I can. How long ago?
MICHAEL What?
JACK When did this happen? How long ago did he leave?
MICHAEL I don't know. 20 minutes, maybe a half hour.
JACK We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
SAWYER Man's got a head-start, a gun, and he ain't afraid to...
JACK He shot 3 of our people! One of them is dead, one of them...
SAWYER Who's going to take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
EKO I will go. John, you have tracking experience, yes?
LOCKE Yeah.
EKO We will find his trail together.
JACK You find anything -- anything -- you come right back here and we figure out what we're going to do next, together.
EKO Let's go, John.
EKO How long has it been since your last confession?
CALDWELL Oh, good question. Too many years for me to even remember.
EKO What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for? What sins have you committed?
CALDWELL Let's see. Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
EKO Just once, or many times?
CALDWELL How many is many?
EKO To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
CALDWELL Oh, I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
EKO Do you have it?
CALDWELL What'd you do, Padre? Skim from the collection plate? You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles. I could get you on with them.
EKO Doing what?
CALDWELL You know, stuff.
MONSIGNOR Good morning, Father Tunde.
EKO Good morning, Monsignor. This is Mr. Caldwell. He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
MONSIGNOR I'm sorry Father, but I've got some bad news. You're going to have to postpone your trip. It appears we have a miracle.
JOYCE My daughter, she -- she drowned.
EKO I'm very sorry for your loss.
JOYCE Oh, no, you don't understand. She came back to life. We were out in the back blocks and Charlotte must have slipped; and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer. She was dead and the next day she woke up. Don't you understand? It's a miracle -- a confirmation of faith. Everyone needs to know about it. People need...
EKO Where is your daughter?
JOYCE At home with my husband.
EKO What does he think?
JOYCE The world needs to know about this. We need to tell the Vatican. We need to tell the world-
MONSIGNOR I'm sorry; we can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin. The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told. Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
EKO Mrs. Malkin, will you excuse us for a moment, please.
JOYCE Of course.
EKO Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
MONSIGNOR Why not?
EKO Because I do not believe what this woman says.
MONSIGNOR Why do you think I chose you?
LOCKE Are you seeing something I'm not? Hey! I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the Hatch. What the hell are you following?
EKO Where is the question mark?
LOCKE The what?
EKO The question mark, John. Where is it?
LOCKE You know what, you keep chasing after your own shadow; I'm going back.
EKO I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
LOCKE No, I don't have to show you anything.
EKO Then I am sorry.
LOCKE You hit me. Why did you...?
EKO Because you were being difficult.
LOCKE Are you insane?
EKO No.
LOCKE Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
EKO Ana wants me to help you, John.
LOCKE Help me do what?
EKO Find the question mark.
LOCKE You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?
EKO No, but you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
LOCKE Here, you want to find your damn question mark? Here, this is it right here. Here take it. Take it because it's nothing. It's a memory. It's 10 seconds of nothing.
EKO This is your hatch, yes?
LOCKE It's not my hatch.
EKO If the Swan is where we came from then we go that way.
LOCKE We shouldn't even be out here. Ana Lucia would still be alive if I just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
EKO Now, she wants us to go here, John, together. She said this in my dream.
LOCKE Of course, a dream.
EKO Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
MCVAY So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
EKO That depends upon what I put in my report. Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
MCVAY Well, I got a call around 1am -- Ambrose brought this girl in, dead. She'd been in the water 2 hours.
EKO Have you had much experience in this type of death?
MCVAY Yeah, of course. I'm, I'm an undertaker. Well, I mean, it's my day job. I mean, I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner. I mean, I did go to medical school.
EKO And when did you find out that she was -- not dead?
MCVAY During the autopsy.
EKO During the autopsy?
MCVAY It's alright; I didn't expect you to believe me.
MCVAY I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
MCVAY This is a Caucasian female. She's 161 cm, 51.3 kilos. Body prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McDervish.
VALERIE Ian, stop it.
MCVAY Commencing with the post. This is a clear case of drowning. I'll begin with a thoracic...
MCVAY Take it. No, please, I don't ever want to listen to that tape again.
LOCKE You lost already?
EKO Your map is inexact.
LOCKE No kidding.
EKO These landmarks -- is this a river?
LOCKE No, it's a wavy line. I didn't draw it, I just transcribed it. I told you, I don't even know if it is a map.
EKO Let's assume it is.
LOCKE What's the axe for?
EKO I don't know yet.
EKO You are the one that found this plane, yes?
LOCKE Yeah. It was up there.
EKO And what made it fall?
LOCKE Boone. Boone made it fall. Then he died. A sacrifice that the Island demanded.
EKO Excuse me?
LOCKE Nothing. So, what's next?
EKO We make camp. Get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
JACK Where the hell are they?
KATE Just calm down. Finding his trail in the dark is not going to be easy. They'll be back.
MICHAEL She say anything? Libby?
JACK She's still unconscious. The bleeding stopped.
KATE That's good, right?
JACK No, it's not good.
MICHAEL And there's nothing you can...
JACK I can make her comfortable. But I don't have what I need.
SAWYER Why are you looking at me? I gave you all the damn meds 2 days ago...
JACK The heroin, Sawyer.
SAWYER Give me 20 minutes.
JACK Kate's going to go with you.
SAWYER It doesn't take 2 people to...
JACK Kate is going with you.
KATE What are you talking about? Why would he need me to go with him?
SAWYER Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns. So, I can either show you where it's at, or let poor Libby suffer. That pretty much it, Doc?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
SAWYER Let's go, Freckles.
KATE I'm curious about something.
SAWYER Yeah, what's that?
KATE How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
SAWYER I don't know, she must've lifted it off me.
KATE She pick-pocketed your gun? How'd she do that?
SAWYER Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, now would she? After you.
KATE I thought you were taking me to your stash.
SAWYER Do you have to make everything so damned difficult? Just go in.
KATE You kept the guns here, all this time, right under you?
SAWYER Fooled you, didn't I?
HURLEY Hey guys, you seen Libby around?
YEMI Eko.
EKO Yemi.
YEMI You'll wake John. Come, follow me.
EKO Yemi.
EKO Yemi! Yemi.
YEMI Wake up, John.
EKO Are you alright, John?
LOCKE Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
EKO You had a dream. Was there a man? A priest? The man that you saw was my brother.
LOCKE Your brother?
EKO This is why we needed to come together. This is how we are going to be led, and how we will know where to go next.
LOCKE But I don't know where to go.
EKO Did he tell you anything?
LOCKE No, he, he...
EKO Nothing? Anything?
LOCKE It wasn't even me. It was you. It didn't -- he wanted me to follow him.
EKO Follow him where? Wait here.
LOCKE Eko, it was just a dream. It's not safe. Eko!
JOYCE Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time. You'll have to come back later.
EKO Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter. Yesterday in the church you said that...
JOYCE I know what I said. It's just that right this minute is not a very good time.
MALKIN Get back in the house, Joyce. Get her inside.
JOYCE Richard, please.
MALKIN Inside, now!
MALKIN I know why you're here, friend. But you can save yourself the trouble. What happened here was not a miracle.
EKO The doctor that treated your daughter seems to feel differently.
MALKIN Treated her? He tried to cut her open. He's just trying to cover up his own negligence. He tell you the whole story -- how she supposedly drowned? She fell into a mountain river, her body shut down; she went into hypothermia which made her appear dead.
EKO And why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
MALKIN Because she's a zealot. All of this -- everything she's doing -- is to spite me.
EKO Why would she spite you?
MALKIN Because she knows I'm a fraud. Because I make my living as a psychic. You see, that's what I do. I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it. Everyday I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one. But there are none to be had. Not in this world, anyway.
EKO I will report back to my Monsignor that there was no miracle here. Your daughter is alive. This is all that matters.
LOCKE Eko, be careful!
LOCKE Eko! Eko!
EKO I'm fine.
LOCKE Eko, what's up there?! You see anything?!
EKO I don't see nothing.
EKO It's salty.
LOCKE What?
EKO The earth. It's been salted so that nothing can grow.
LOCKE Why would anyone wanna salt -- there's nothing here.
EKO I believe they made a circle -- a target -- so that this place can be seen from up above.
LOCKE They? What place?
EKO The place that this plane fell upon, John.
EKO John! Will you help me with this?
EKO Wait.
LOCKE Eko, may I?
EKO Please, be my guest.
HURLEY We were going to have our first date.
MICHAEL Date?
HURLEY Yeah, a picnic on the beach. I'm glad you're okay, man.
EKO John.
WICKMAN Hello, I'm Dr. Mark Wickman, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or the Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded -- not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole. As Karen DeGroot herself has written, "Careful observation in the only key to true and complete awareness." Your tour of duty will last 3 weeks and during this time you and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress. Your duty is to observe team members at another station on the Island. These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance, or that they are the subjects of an experiment. Working in 8 hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we provided. What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask? What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfill their tasks? You, as the observer, don't need to know. All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance. Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded. Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up containers provided. Then, simply place the container in the pneumatic tube, and presto, it will be transported directly to us. At the end of your 8 hour shift, proceed to the Pala ferry which will take you back to the barracks prepare for your next shift . On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste and good luck.
EKO Would you like to watch that again?
LOCKE No. No, I've seen enough.
LOCKE What are you doing?
EKO I'm taking this back with us.
LOCKE Why?
EKO Because they may be important.
LOCKE Important? I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
EKO Yes, John. And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
LOCKE What work?
EKO Pushing the button.
LOCKE That's not work. That's a joke -- rats in a maze with no cheese.
EKO It is work, John. We are being tested.
LOCKE Tested?
EKO The reason to do it -- push the button -- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
LOCKE Oh -- well, then what is the reason, Mr. Eko?
EKO We do it because we believe we are meant to. Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
LOCKE I was never meant to do anything! Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button! You think it's important? You think it's necessary? It's nothing. It's nothing. It's meaningless. And who are you to tell me that it's not?
AGENT That's flight 815, leaving from gate 23.
EKO Thank you.
EKO What are you doing here?
CHARLOTTE I had to see you.
EKO Look, your father said I shouldn't...
CHARLOTTE I know. He doesn't want me talking to you. And I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
EKO A message?
CHARLOTTE He says you were a good priest.
EKO Who says that?
CHARLOTTE Yemi.
EKO Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
CHARLOTTE I saw him when I was -- between places. He said that you would come and see me. He said that even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
EKO Who put you up to this? Did your father tell you to do this?
CHARLOTTE He wants you to know that he will see you soon. He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, that he has faith in you.
EKO Why are you doing this to me? What do you want from me? Why are you doing this to me?!
LIBBY Is everything alright?
CHARLOTTE He has faith in you. One day you'll believe me. 
 Announcer Oceanic Flight 815 is now boarding...
EKO This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi. Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God. And because I betrayed him he was shot and died. He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria half a world from here. Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island. And somehow, here, I found my brother again. I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria. In the same plane that lies above us now -- that has concealed this place. And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine, just as it was on the day I first took another man's life. So let me ask you -- how can you say this is meaningless? I believe the work being done in the Hatch is more important than anything. If you will not continue to push the button, John, I will.
HURLEY Can, can I talk to her?
JACK Sure. 
HURLEY Hey, it's Hurley. Hugo. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. Libby?
LIBBY Michael.
JACK Michael. He's okay. He made it, Libby. It's okay. It's alright.
