SAYID A little light headed.
SAYID Jack, what happened to me?
JACK You died.
KATE How is that even possible? I mean one minute he's gone and now he's fine?
SAWYER Of course he's fine.
KATE What's that mean?
SAWYER He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids. He definitely deserves another go around.
HURLEY All right.
KATE What are you lookin' at?
SAWYER How many guards with guns do you think are outside this place?
KATE What?!
SAWYER I was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?
KATE What are you thinking?
SAWYER Thinkin' about running, Kate.
MARSHAL She's got hands in handcuffs but she's probably got them covered, okay?
MARSHAL Hey!
MAN Hey! Watch it!

KATE No you can't! Get out of the car!
JACK Easy.
SAYID Who are these people? What do they want?
HURLEY It's the Others, dude. They caught us again. I dunno, I think they are trying to protect us.
MILES Uh, as you can see, Hugo here has assumed the leadership position so that's pretty great.
SAYID What?
JACK The wound it's almost completely closed.
SAYID Thank you Jack.
JACK For what?
SAYID For saving my life.
TEMPLE LEADER Nani wa tomoare isogunda

TEMPLE LEADER Kono otoko wo damarasero 
LENNON  Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.

TEMPLE LEADER Tsurete ike 
TEMPLE LEADER Yamero! 
LENNON Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!
LENNON Please, you don't have to do this. We won't hurt your friend.
SAWYER He ain't my friend. Do what you want with him and anybody else. But me, I'm walking out of here.
KATE James.
SAWYER I'm gone! You understand?
TEMPLE LEADER Please. You have to stay.
SAWYER No, I don't.
SAWYER Don't come after me.
TEMPLE LEADER Jarrah wa hikiuketa Nani wo shitemo kamawan Ford wo tsuremodose.
JACK Hey! Hey! Where are they taking Sayid.
ALDO Hey! Calm down! Everybody calm down.
LENNON Where'd Ford go?
JACK What?
LENNON Ford, your friend who just ran outta here. Where did he go?
JACK I don't know.
LENNON Do you expect me to believe that?
JACK He told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?
KATE I can bring him back.
LENNON You know where he went?
KATE No, but I can track him. Let me go. I will bring him back and I can make him stay.
JACK Kate, you sure you want to go out there alone with these people?
JIN I'll go with her.
LENNON It's very important that he get back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
KATE I can be very convincing when I wanna be.
KATE Where's your tire hammer?
REPAIRMAN You've got a problem.
KATE So do you. Where's your tire hammer?
REPAIRMAN Tire hammer will just cut off your wrist. The problem is you need a punch press and you're not gonna be able to use one of them and keep that gun pointed at me.
KATE You volunteering?
REPAIRMAN I got a steady hand but I kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
KATE I'll give you two hundred dollars.
REPAIRMAN Now hold still.
KATE Thanks.
REPAIRMAN So why the bracelets?
KATE I'm wanted for murder.
REPAIRMAN Murder?
KATE You don't happen to have somewhere I can change, do you?
REPAIRMAN Bathroom's over there. Make it quick.
KATE Thank you.
ALDO Better not slow us down.
KATE Better not slow me down.
JACK I'd go with you but..
KATE ...but you thought he would kill you?
KATE I'll take care of James. You take care of Sayid.
JACK Deal.
KATE Good bye.
JACK Be careful.
SAYID What is it you want? Please, whatever you are thinking of doing What is that?
SAYID Just tell me what you want.
SAYID Why? Why are you doing this?
SAYID I don't have any secrets. Ask, AHHH!
SAYID Ahhhhh! Ahhh! 
SAYID Ugh! Ugh!! Ugh!
TEMPLE LEADER Yoshi,korede juubun da Shiken ni tootta to ie 
LENNON We're sorry we had to put you through that. It was a test. We had to be sure.
SAYID Test to be sure of what?
LENNON Don't worry. You passed.
LENNON I just lied to him, didn't I?
TEMPLE LEADER Yes.
KATE Where were you going?
CLAIRE What?
KATE Before I got in the cab, where were you going?
CLAIRE Why, so you can hijack them too?
CLAIRE I was waiting for a bus.
KATE I came to bring you your stuff.
KATE Relax, I didn't take your money.
CLAIRE Well, uh, gee, thanks.
KATE So where were you going?
CLAIRE Don't worry about it.
KATE Fine.
CLAIRE Langdon street. Brentwood.
KATE You got family there?
CLAIRE Uh, no. It's the couple who's adopting my baby. They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but I guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.
KATE Brentwood's not far. Get in.
CLAIRE Seriously?
KATE Do you want a ride or not?
KATE So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?
ALDO We're protecting you.
KATE From what?
ALDO You've been on this island for a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a ticka ticka sound, looks pissed off?
KATE Yes.
ALDO From that.
JIN Do you know anything about another plane coming in? An Ajira flight.
ALDO I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?
JUSTIN I think he means the one that landed...
ALDO Justin! Shut up.
KATE No, no, no, that's a decoy trail. He went this way.
ALDO And you're basing this on what?
KATE Experience.
JUSTIN Aldo.
ALDO What?
JUSTIN I think she's right.
ALDO Of course she is.
ALDO After you, princess. So what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back? I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out. If he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.
JUSTIN Watch it!
KATE Thank you.
JIN Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.
JUSTIN The French woman? She's been dead for years. This, this couldn't be one ...
ALDO Justin! Shut up!
KATE What was he gonna say?
ALDO You don't even remember me, do you? You don't recognize me? Well maybe this will jog you memory. Three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break, and you did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle. That would be me.
JIN What are you doing?
KATE Escaping.
[Back at the Temple chamber with the spring. Two men are dragging Sayid. Hurley rushes to Sayid and they give him Sayid.
HURLEY Sayid! You okay, man? Jack! He's back!
JACK Sayid, what happened?
SAYID They tortured me.
JACK Why?
SAYID Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.
JACK Step aside.
LENNON Hey, Shephard.
LENNON We were hoping you'd come on your own.
JACK What the hell did you do to Sayid?
LENNON We, we didn't do anything to him. Your, your friend is sick.
JACK Sick with what?
TEMPLE LEADER Kare wa kegasarete shimatta ]
LENNON He's yeah, I, not really there's not really a literal translation. The closest thing would be infected.
JACK Infected? He's not even running a fever.
JACK Did I say something funny?
LENNON I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.
[The Temple Leader smiles and wraps a capsule in a piece of paper.
TEMPLE LEADER Korewo Jarrah ni nomasete moraou
LENNON He says you have to give your friend this pill.
JACK Are you serious?
JACK Why don't you give it to him?
LENNON Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly, and he won't take it willingly from us.
JACK Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it before you tortured him.
LENNON We didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.
JACK To see if he was infected.
LENNON Yes.
JACK I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid unless I know what's in it.
TEMPLE LEADER Tell me, Shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?
JACK He was, um, he was helping me.
TEMPLE LEADER So it was your fault?
JACK Yes.
TEMPLE LEADER And there have been others who were hurt or died, helping you?
JACK Yes.
TEMPLE LEADER Well, this is your chance to redeem yourself.
TEMPLE LEADER It's medicine and your friend needs it.
JACK What happens if I don't give it to him?
TEMPLE LEADER The infection will spread.
MILES So, nothing? There wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?
SAYID I remember being shot.
HURLEY You're not a zombie, right?
SAYID No. I am not a zombie.
MILES Hey.
JACK Mind giving me and Sayid a minute?
HURLEY Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they lead me to having to do something I don't quite understand.
JACK I'm right there with you.
MILES Its fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.
SAYID So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?
JACK They said they were trying to diagnose you.
SAYID Right. They told me it was some sort of test which they said I passed. Clearly, I didn't.
SAYID What's that?
JACK They want you to take it. It's medicine, according to them.
SAYID What about according to you?
JACK I don't know. And you know, before when you when you thanked me for saving your life, I, I didn't have anything to do with it Sayid. I didn't fix you. They did.
SAYID I don't care who fixed me. I only care about who I trust. So, if you want me to take that pill, Jack, I'll do it.
JIN Wait. Where are you going?
KATE Catching up with Sawyer.
JIN So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.
KATE No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?
JIN Where did your plane land, Kate?
KATE What?
JIN The Ajira plane that you, Jack and Hurley came in on. Where did it land?
KATE I don't know.
JIN Sun was on that plane too and I have to find her.
KATE You think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?
JIN Who do you care about Kate?
KATE Good luck, Jin.
JIN Once you catch up with Sawyer, then what?
KATE I guess we'll figure that out together.
CLAIRE So, uh, what happened to your handcuffs?
KATE I cut them off.
CLAIRE It's a beautiful neighborhood. I bet they're a really nice couple.
CLAIRE What?
KATE I didn't say anything.
CLAIRE What, you, you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?
KATE Why would I think that?
CLAIRE Good, 'cause they didn't.
KATE This is it.
CLAIRE Um, will you come in with me?
KATE Are you kidding me?
CLAIRE Please, I just I really don't want to go up there on my own.
CLAIRE Uh, hi, um, Mrs. Baskum? I, I'm, I'm Claire Little ton.
MRS. BASKUM Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Um, my husband he left me. And, believe me, I wanted a baby so much, but I can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, I know I should've called you.
CLAIRE So uh, wh-what, y-y-you just changed your mind?
MRS. BASKUM Um, look, my, my life is just, a little bit complicated right now.
KATE She came all the way from Australia and you don't call?
CLAIRE Oh my God.
KATE Are you okay?
CLAIRE Aah! It's coming!
SAWYER Who's there? Better come out now or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.
SAWYER What the hell are you doin' here?
KATE I was worried about you.
NURSE What's happening here?
CLAIRE I-I think I'm having contractions.
NURSE When did they start?
CLAIRE Um, about three minutes ago.
NURSE Try to relax. We're gonna take you to the M.C.U to get it looked at.
NURSE Are you with her?
KATE Yeah.
NURSE Okay, follow me.
CLAIRE What are you doing? What, what's going on?
NURSE 2 Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
CLAIRE I need to know what's going on? Is something wrong?
KATE Excuse me. Excuse me.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Yes.
KATE Are you a doctor?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.
KATE Can I please get your help in here?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Miss Littleton? Claire, how are you feeling?
CLAIRE Uncomfortable. What, wh-what's happening.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED What's happening is that Mother Nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?
CLAIRE I-I'm sorry. What?!
DOCTOR GOODSPEED You're at thirty six weeks, three centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced, which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.
CLAIRE If I want? So what, you mean, you mean you can stop it then?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.
CLAIRE Drugs? I mean. W-will that hurt the baby?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED No. They're perfectly safe. I just don't want to stick you with needles if I don't have to. So it's up to you.
CLAIRE I'm, I'm not ready.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Okay. Let's get her started on the Nifedipine drip.
CLAIRE Wh, what, what is it?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Margaret, let's do an ultrasound. I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there. Ah, it, it could just mean the baby's out of position.
CLAIRE Wh-wh-what are you, what are you saying?! W-what, what's happening to my baby?! Is my baby okay? Is Aaron okay?
DOCTOR GOODSPEED See? There he is. Everything is just fine. Your boy just likes to move around.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED 140 B.P.M, perfectly normal. I have a feeling that Aaron is gonna be a handful.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED Now let's see if we can slow this down.
DOCTOR GOODSPEED You did great, mommy. Thanks.
KATE A couple days ago, you asked me why I came back to the island. I need to find Claire. I thought maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me, and then maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron, then maybe all of this wouldn't be for nothing.
KATE I'm sorry. I never should have followed you.
SAWYER Which time?
KATE That was your house, right? With Juliet.
SAWYER Yep.
KATE I'm sorry.
SAWYER You already said that.
KATE No for Juliet. If I hadn't come after you on the sub, then you two would've left and she would've never died.
SAWYER It's not your fault she's dead. It's mine. She was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place. And I convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island 'cause I didn't want to be alone. You understand that, right?
SAWYER But, uh, but I think some of us are meant to be alone.
SAWYER I was gonna ask her to marry me.
SAWYER You can probably make it back to the Temple by nightfall.
JACK What's that?
TEMPLE LEADER It's a baseball.
JACK You speak pretty good English for someone who needs a translator.
TEMPLE LEADER We both know that I don't need a translator.
JACK Then why do you have one?
TEMPLE LEADER Because I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.
JACK Who are you?
DOGEN My name is Dogen.
JACK Are you from here, the island?
DOGEN I was brought here like everyone else.
JACK What do you mean, "Brought here."?
DOGEN You know exactly what I mean.
DOGEN You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?
JACK No.
DOGEN Why not?
JACK Because I don't know what's in it.
DOGEN It will eliminate--
JACK --the infection, yeah. I got that. But what's in it?
DOGEN I cannot explain.
JACK Try.
DOGEN There isn't any time. He'll die if you don't...
JACK He already died. What is in it?
DOGEN You just have to trust me.
JACK I don't trust myself. How am I supposed to trust you? Let's see where trust gets us.
JACK Now, are you gonna tell me what's in it?
DOGEN Poison.
CLAIRE Come in.
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN. Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?
CLAIRE Um, yeah.
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN I'm Detective Rasmussen.
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN Is Ms. Hart here?
CLAIRE Uh, I'm sorry. Who?
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN Joan Hart. She signed in with you.
CLAIRE Oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver. I needed help and she brought me up here. She left after they treated me, though.
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN She, uh, give you any indication where she was headed?
CLAIRE Why? Is there something wrong?
DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN No. It's nothing for you to worry about. Come on. Let's go.
PA VOICE EKG Tech 3-1-5. EKG Tech 3-1-5.
KATE Thanks.
CLAIRE Sure. Thank you. Why, why are they after you? What, what did you do?
KATE Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?
CLAIRE Yeah. Yeah, I would.
KATE Well, I should go.
CLAIRE Oh, wait. Um, here, take my credit card.
KATE No.
CLAIRE There's not much of a limit on it but it's something.
KATE You don't have to do this.
CLAIRE You didn't have to do what you did either.
KATE Aaron's a great name.
CLAIRE I don't know why I said it. It's like, I don't know. I knew it or something.
KATE I think you should keep him.
CLAIRE Well, um, good luck.
KATE Yeah, you too.
CLAIRE Thanks.
LENNON He swallowed it?
DOGEN Yes.
JACK What's this?
DOGEN Tea.
JACK Why would you people want to kill Sayid?
DOGEN We believe he has been mesarete itandarou.
LENNON Closest translation is "claimed."
JACK Claimed by what?
DOGEN There is a darkness growing in him and once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was, will be gone.
JACK No uh. How can you be sure of that?
DOGEN Because it happened to your sister.
ALDO Get up!
ALDO That's for my head.
ALDO Now, where's that bitch?
JIN I don't know. You don't understand. I'm going back to the Temple.
ALDO Yeah, right.
JUSTIN It looks like he's alone. Maybe we should take him back.
ALDO Or maybe we didn't find him alive.
JUSTIN Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.
ALDO He may be one of them.
ALDO Hey! Hey!
JIN Aah! Ugh!
ALDO Where you goin'?
JUSTIN Ughh!
JIN Claire?
