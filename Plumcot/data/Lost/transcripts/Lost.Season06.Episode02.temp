DOGEN Juubun chui shiro!
LENNON Send the warning!
DOGEN Mina ni konokoto wo tsutaerunda, yoshi tenka!
LENNON Light it!
HURLEY Guess we're not getting outta here huh?
LENNON This isn't to keep you in, it's to keep him out.
HURLEY Him? Who?
BEN What are you?
LOCKE Wh.. I'm not a what Ben, I'm a who.
BEN You're the monster.
LOCKE Let's not resort to name calling.
BEN You used me... you couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.
LOCKE I didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.
BEN I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.
LOCKE I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you, choked the life outta him Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the Island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave. The only one, who realized how pitiful the life he'd left behind actually was.
BEN What do you want?
LOCKE Well that's the great irony here Ben because, I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home.
HURLEY Goodbye dude, If you ever wanna talk, I'm around.
HURLEY What?
MILES Nothing.
KATE Hey.
SAWYER Where are we?
KATE We're in a temple.
SAWYER We got caught by the others again?
KATE Yeah, only, this time they're protecting us, I think.
SAWYER Course they are.
KATE You alright?
SAWYER Ah...
KATE I'm so sorry.
KATE You know what you said back at the hatch, he's just tryin'a help us.
SAWYER I ain't gonna kill Jack, he deserves to suffer on this rock just like the rest of us.
JACK Yeah... I know...I ... do you think I knew this was gonna happen? I scheduled it so soon because I wanna get it over with. I don't know mom, he's not here so I can't tell you what to tell them other than we can't have the service without him. Yeah - I will call you if I hear anything.
LOCKE What did you lose?
JACK Excuse me?
LOCKE Well, they lost one of my bags, what about you?
JACK You wouldn't believe me if I told ya.
LOCKE Hah, try me.
JACK They lost my father.
LOCKE I'm sorry?
JACK He died in Australia a couple days ago, and um, I flew down to get him.
LOCKE My condolences.
LOCKE Yo.
JACK Coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he's somewhere in transit which is their way of saying, they have no idea where the hell he is.
LOCKE Well, how could they know.
JACK They're the one's that checked him in, I mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.
LOCKE No I'm not talking about the coffin, I mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.
LOCKE Either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. Thanks.
JACK Some kinda salesman?
LOCKE Yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.
JACK Hope you find your knives.
LOCKE Yeah, thanks.
JACK Mind if I ask what happened to ya? I'm sorry, I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon, I didn't mean to...
LOCKE Oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.
JACK Nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call. - It's on the house.
LOCKE Well thanks - Jack Shephard, I'm John - John Locke.
JACK It's nice to meet ya John.
LOCKE Nice to meet you too.
LOCKE Thanks.
JACK You're welcome.
LAPIDUS What the hell is that?
RICHARD Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
LAPIDUS I'm seein' it - But I'm still not believin' it.
LOCKE Hello Richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.
RICHARD ... you?
LOCKE Me.
LOCKE I am very disappointed ... in all of you.
LENNON You Shephard?
JACK Yeah.
LENNON We need to speak to you privately.
JACK If you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.
LENNON I don't think you're understanding me here, I'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or I'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.
JACK Is that right.
HURLEY Jack!
LENNON Oh my god.
JACK Wha...
SAYID What happened?
