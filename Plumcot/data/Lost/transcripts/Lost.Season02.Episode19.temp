ROSE Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.
BERNARD So this isn't bothering you at all?
ROSE What's "this"?
BERNARD Well, this this...
ROSE Why would a bag of potato chips bother me?
BERNARD Aren't you remotely curious as to where all this came from? You're acting like we just got back from the supermarket.
ROSE Well, I guess I was raised never to question my blessings.
BERNARD I was raised to question piles of food with weird labels that just fall out of the sky, Rose.
ROSE Well, honey just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to raise your voice.
BERNARD Bad day? I had 7 weeks of bad days on the other side of the island just trying to stay alive so I could get back to you. Here -- my God, Rose -- they've built a kitchen on the beach. They've given up.
ROSE Given up? On what?
BERNARD On getting rescued.
JACK Hey, you going to get that?
JACK When's the last time you went in to see him?
ANA A couple of hours ago. He was sleeping.
JACK Did he eat?
ANA No. It's 2 days now. No food. No water. Nothing to say.
JACK I don't know about you but I'm tired of waiting.
JACK I hear you've lost your appetite. Okay, don't talk. I was never that good at bedside manner anyway. I'm going to change that dressing on your shoulder. If you try anything, we've got a problem. So, Henry -- Henry. I was thinking about something you were saying before we found out who you are. This is going to sting. Yeah, you were saying that if you were one of them that you'd lead us into a trap, capture our people, force a trade -- us for you. Pretty good idea, Henry. And, since you are one of them, I thought now might be a good time to use it. I'm going out to the line we're not supposed to cross and telling them that we've got you. And if they want you back, it's going to cost them. And when we get Walt back you might just have been worth all the trouble.
JACK Did you say something?
GALE They'll never give you Walt.
BERNARD Don't gun it. You're digging yourself in. Just tap the gas lightly.
ROSE With all due respect, I have been driving in snow my whole life. You mind stepping back?
BERNARD Well, you have to rock it out. You're not going to be able...
ROSE I'm calling AAA.
BERNARD Why, so they can send a tow truck? Trust me, I can do this.
BERNARD Okay, ease on the gas. That's it. You're doing great. Almost. Go, go, go.
ROSE Are you okay?!
BERNARD Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine.
ROSE You know, I would have gotten it out eventually.
BERNARD Oh, sure. July's right around the corner.
ROSE Well, thanks for helping me.
BERNARD Sure.
ROSE By the way, I'm Rose.
BERNARD Oh, uh, Bernard.
ROSE Okay.
BERNARD Oh, okay, yeah.
BERNARD Drive safe now, okay.
ROSE Yeah, you too. Uh, um, Bernard!
BERNARD Yeah?
ROSE Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
BERNARD Coffee would be nice. Yeah, okay.
ROSE I had to beat back half the group to get these. I saved them for you.
HURLEY No way. I'm on a new diet. Nothing but fish and water; and fish and water.
BERNARD Hurley, what are you doing, right now?
HURLEY Talking to your wife.
BERNARD Good. Can you get Libby and meet me at the edge of the tree line in 5 minutes? Oh, and if you can get Jin and Sun, Jenkins and that Frogurt guy -- the guy who used to make frozen yogurt.
HURLEY Neil?
BERNARD Yeah, and Craig -- anybody else you can get.
ROSE Bernard? What are you up to?
BERNARD I got an idea. Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome come here.
ANA I'm not so sure trading people's their thing.
JACK Well, talking to him is getting us nowhere, so -- I think we can get something for him.
ANA You want me to come with you?
JACK You need to stay here.
ANA You need it more than I do. Do yourself a favor, man. Don't go out there alone.
JACK Alright.
SAWYER Ah, that's how it's done. Aw, well look at you. That's like 4 in the last half hour. Let me call the Guinness Book.
KATE You want help or not? Because I've got better things to do with my time.
SAWYER Oh happy day, here comes Dr. Giggles.
JACK Hey.
SAWYER Hey, yourself.
JACK I'm going back out into the jungle to talk to our friend with the beard -- see if we can make a trade.
SAWYER Ah, the old prisoner exchange. And you're inviting me along because you want a gun, huh?
JACK I'm not inviting you; I'm inviting Kate. And I've already got a gun, but thanks for offering.
SAWYER How the hell did you get a gun?
JACK Does it matter?
KATE I'll get my things.
BERNARD Okay, 2 months we've been on this island -- 2 months. And already we have a water trough, and we've got a food pantry. And people are taking showers in your hatch. Have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island? It's like none of you want to go home again.
CLAIRE How can you say that? Of course we want to go home.
BERNARD Well, then why aren't we doing anything about it?
HURLEY Dude, we, like, built a raft. But it got blown up.
BERNARD Okay, so what are we doing now? That pallet of food had a parachute which means a plane dropped it here which means there are other planes that fly over the island. So, we are going to build a sign -- a massive sign along the beach. So that way if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there -- we want to make damn sure that they know we're here -- that they know about us.
ROSE Maybe we should speak to Jack about this first.
BERNARD Well, do we have to run everything by Jack? I mean, he's not the president. He's a doctor.
ROSE You're a dentist.
BERNARD Could I speak to you for just a second? Come here. Honey, it is just a sign. I don't see what the harm is.
ROSE The harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites coming out of nowhere to save the day.
BERNARD I'm just trying to do something. I want to get back to our life.
ROSE Well, the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope.
BERNARD Excuse me; I have a sign to build. Alright, I want to get this going right away. We've waited long enough.
.
ROSE It's just amazing, isn't it?
BERNARD Oh, sure, it's beautiful.
ROSE You're not impressed, huh?
BERNARD Yeah.
ROSE So, what does God have to do to get your attention?
ROSE Bernard, what are you doing?
BERNARD Rose, I've been a bachelor for 56 years, and then I met you. And we just fell into this rhythm like we had known each other forever. I always dreamed of finding somebody like you, but I'd given up hope that I ever would.
ROSE Bernard...
BERNARD I know, I know. It's crazy. We just met 5 months ago. But 5 months is long enough because I knew after 5 minutes. Rose, I love you. Will you marry me?
ROSE Bernard, I'm dying. I'm sick, and I'm dying.
BERNARD Would you excuse us for a minute, please? 
ROSE I've been in remission for the last couple of years. But now it's back and this time it's not going away. My doctor says I have about a year -- maybe a little longer.
BERNARD You haven't answered my question.
ROSE Are you sure?
BERNARD Oh, I'm sure.
ROSE Yes. Yes.
BERNARD Boy, you bunk with a guy for 48 days -- now he doesn't call or write.
EKO Hello, Bernard.
BERNARD What have you boys got going up here?
EKO Just working.
BERNARD Listen, I've got a whole team of folks throwing together a big sign down along the beach. Hopefully, it'll get spotted by a plane or a satellite. We could sure use all the bodies we could get to help put it together.
EKO Sorry, I'm busy.
BERNARD Charlie?
CHARLIE Ah, regrets, Bernard, I've only got 2 hands, you know. Good luck, though.
BERNARD Well, could I at least grab some of these logs? We could use them...
EKO We're using them.
BERNARD For what, exactly?
CHARLIE A church.
BERNARD A church?
EKO Yes.
BERNARD Everybody on this island is building something. I'm trying to get us saved.
EKO People are saved in different ways, Bernard.
BERNARD I think I liked you better when you just hit people with your stick. 
CHARLIE I like you just the way you are.
LOCKE I need to talk to him.
ANA The gun's with Jack. The door stays closed. But if you want to talk to him -- talk to him.
LOCKE Henry, can you hear me? It's John, Henry. Henry, did you enter the numbers? Did you push the button, or not? Henry, I need to know. I want you to answer me. Answer me! Answer me, Henry!
BERNARD What happened to everybody? Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt? Okay, alright, moving on. We're going to put this sign across this entire beach which means the letters have to be really big -- about 40 feet. These black rocks will get maximum contrast with the sand.
HURLEY Dude, we're, like, going to need a lot more rocks.
BERNARD Yes, Hurley, we're going to need a lot more rocks. There's a lava field about a half mile inland that's loaded with them. We're going to haul them out in 2 man teams. So, you guys double up, and I am going to start sketching out the letters in the sand. Let's do this.
HURLEY Hey, um, I can sketch the letters.
BERNARD Everybody's got a job, Hurley. I do my job, you do yours.
JIN 결국 힘든 일은 우리가 다 하는 거지?
BERNARD What? What'd he say?
HURLEY I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry the rocks a half mile thing.
BERNARD Okay, this is going to take time. But if this is the thing that gets us off this place, isn't that worth it? Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. No, you don't know. Alright, let's get started. Come on.
ROSE We're lost.
BERNARD You saying we're lost doesn't make us lost, sweetheart. I know exactly where we are.
ROSE Me too. Driving around in circles in the middle of the Outback. That's why I wanted to be on a beach for our honeymoon.
ROSE Thank goodness, civilization. Bernard, let's get directions.
BERNARD Oh, I don't need directions. I told you, honey, we're not lost.
ROSE Bernard, what's going on?
BERNARD I brought you out here because I want you to see this man. His name is Isaac of Uluru. He's helped hundreds of people. Now, I know how it looks, but believe me he's completely legit.
ROSE Bernard, you brought me to a faith healer?
BERNARD He's the real deal, Rose. When I started telling people about your situation I got 3 separate calls recommending him.
ROSE My situation? This is why you wanted to come to Australia? To bring me to some kind of a kook?
BERNARD No, he's not. Rose, I made a 10,000 dollar donation just to get you in to see him. Normally...
ROSE I didn't ask for this! This is -- Bernard, I have made my peace with what is happening to me.
BERNARD Well, I haven't. I can't just do nothing, Rose. That's not me. That's not who I am. I have to try. Will you try, Rose? For me.
BERNARD If you have time to fix your hut you have time to move some rocks. Come on, we could really use your help.
SAWYER What, you got union trouble down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?
BERNARD Come on, Sawyer, I need your help. What do you say?
SAWYER I say Pasadena.
BERNARD Well, I hope you're happy.
ROSE About what?
BERNARD This morning I had 15 people willing to work on the sign, now I'm down to 4.
ROSE How is that my fault?
BERNARD At the very least I expected your support. You had to go and attack me.
ROSE Have you ever stopped to think maybe the reason people are quitting is because you've got yourself a management problem?
BERNARD What is the matter with you, Rose? I am just trying to do something.
ROSE That's right. You're always trying to do. Why can't you just let things be?
BERNARD If I didn't always have to do something you wouldn't be here.
KATE I'm flattered.
JACK Yeah, why is that?
KATE Because you chose me to go with you instead of Sawyer.
JACK I asked Sayid first but he turned me down. And I only asked you because they don't want you. They grabbed you -- had you at gunpoint. They could have kept you but they didn't. Then again, they didn't really want me, either.
KATE Damaged goods, both of us.
KATE What's that?
JACK Kate?
KATE It's a doll. 
JACK Wait, wait, no. No don't.
KATE Sorry.
JACK You okay?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Oh good, so you can hear me? This isn't one of theirs.
KATE No, it's not sophisticated enough. It must be one of Rousseau's traps, so hopefully she's not far from here.
JACK It could be a week before she shows up.
KATE What are you doing?
JACK I'm trying to get the gun. I can't get my arm around.
KATE Alright. Sorry. I don't want to shoot you. Okay.
JACK You got it?
KATE Okay, ready? Got it, got it, got it.
JACK Oh, alright. Okay, now give me the gun.
KATE Why, what for?
JACK I'm going to try to shoot the rope. Oh, hey, hey, hey.
KATE I'm a better shot than you are.
JACK Oh, really?
KATE Yeah, I told you. I grew up hunting with my dad. Damn!
JACK Well, at least they know where we are. Okay, now give me the gun.
KATE Are you going to waste another bullet?
JACK We'll still have 13 more to shoot each other with. Come on.
KATE Fine. You have a better angle than mine anyway.
JACK Oh, that's going to be your excuse when I make the shot?
KATE When you make the shot.
KATE Nice shot.
BERNARD No, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong. I told you 3 rows -- 3 so they can see it from the air.
JIN 시키는 대로 하고 있잖아요!
BERNARD 3 rows! How hard is that?!
JIN 누굴 바보로 아나? 나도 쓰리 정도는 알아요!
BERNARD Do I just have to do everything myself?!
JIN 직접 하실래요? 해보시지! 
BERNARD No, no, no. No, Jin. No, wait. Please, I just want to get my wife home. Rose. I want to get Rose home.
JIN Sorry. 
ROSE You're in my spot.
LOCKE I can move.
ROSE Can you?
LOCKE Oh, that's funny.
ROSE I guess your sense of humor got trapped under that blast door with your leg.
LOCKE I saw your husband walking through the jungle hauling rocks.
ROSE He's building a big sign in the sand so the satellites will see it. That man doesn't know the difference between an errand and a fool's errand.
LOCKE Well, Rose, most of us don't.
ROSE So, what are you doing down here, John? Can't remember the last time I saw you out of that hatch.
LOCKE I'm done with the hatch.
ROSE Oh, now you're just frustrated. You'll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time.
LOCKE And yet, Jack said it would be at least 4 weeks.
ROSE But, honey, you and I both know it's not going to take that long.
AUSSIE WOMAN Right this way, Rose. Please, make yourself comfortable. Isaac will be right with you.
ISAAC You must be Rose. Why don't you have a seat.
ROSE So, um, how does this work? I sit here and you chant, pray, or what?
ISAAC There are certain places with great energy -- spots on the Earth like the one we're above now. Perhaps this energy is geological -- magnetic. Or perhaps it's something else. And when possible I harness this energy and give it to others. May I?
ROSE What? What, what is it?
ISAAC I'm sorry. I can't do anything for you, Rose.
ROSE I didn't expect you to. 
ISAAC It's not that you can't be healed. Like I said, there's different energies. This is not the right place for you.
ROSE Where is the right place?
ISAAC I wish I knew. I'll return your husband's donation.
ROSE Don't. I'm going to tell him you fixed me. I'm going to tell him you fixed me.
JACK What did you mean back there?
KATE What?
JACK In the net -- you said they were sophisticated, the Others.
KATE Uh, last week when the baby got sick, Claire and I went into the jungle and, uh, found another hatch.
JACK What?
KATE It's a medical station. There's nothing you can use; it was all cleared out, but I found some lockers. They had clothes inside -- all worn and dirty. And they were on hangers like costumes, you know. And there was a make-up kit, and a fake beard.
JACK When were you going to tell me this?
KATE When you decided to let me back in the club. What, you can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for like a week and say nothing, but then when I...
JACK We're here.
KATE Are you sure?
JACK That's where they took a shot at Sawyer. Right over there was where they pushed you out of the jungle with the bag on your head. And right there is where I laid my guns down. Hey, hey I'm back! You say you're watching us -- you hear me? We've got your man! If you want him back you're going to have to come out here! Come on out!
KATE Jack!
JACK I know you're out there! I know you can hear me!
KATE Jack, they're not here.
JACK I'll be right here 'til you talk to me! I'll be right here!
ROSE I brought you some supper.
BERNARD Thanks, you can just set it down there.
ROSE Where is everybody? I owe you an apology.
BERNARD You don't have anything to be sorry for. It's my own damn fault I'm out here by myself.
ROSE That's not why I'm apologizing. I lied to you. Back in Australia, Isaac -- he didn't heal me. He didn't do anything.
BERNARD Of course he did.
ROSE Bernard, he didn't heal me. But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.
ROSE When you're sick and you have got something inside you that doesn't belong there you can feel it.
ROSE And after the crash I couldn't feel it anymore. At first I thought it was just shock.
 But it wasn't. It's this place.
BERNARD But you said Isaac fixed you.
ROSE I told you that so that you wouldn't spend what time we had left trying to do something.
BERNARD Rose, you could just be in remission. How do you know it wasn't Isaac who healed you?
ROSE Bernard.
BERNARD How do you know that he didn't heal you?
ROSE I know. I know.
LOCKE These yours?
ROSE Thank you.
LOCKE You're welcome.
ROSE Trust me. I know.
BERNARD You don't want to be rescued, do you? You think if you leave it'll come back. And if you can't leave, neither can I. We won't ever leave Rose.
BERNARD I would offer to take down the sign, but we didn't get very far.
ANA Hey.
LOCKE Hi.
ANA I pressed your button.
LOCKE It's not my button.
ANA Where did you go?
LOCKE I just needed to stretch my legs.
KATE How long are you going to wait, Jack?
JACK Until I get my voice back. Then I'm going to yell some more.
KATE Maybe they can't hear you.
JACK They can hear me.
KATE I'm sorry I kissed you.
JACK I'm not.
KATE Michael.
