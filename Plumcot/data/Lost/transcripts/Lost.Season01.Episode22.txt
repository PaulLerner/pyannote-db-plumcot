kate_austen Hi. I'm expecting a letter -- hold for guest arrival.
sanjay Sure, what's your name?
kate_austen Joan Hart.
sanjay Oh, Joan Hart.
charlie_pace Platinum.
kate_austen Platinum?
charlie_pace As in platinum record -- as in a million units sold. Now, Drive Shaft's albums must have spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster. When I come back, alive, it's going to be insane.
kate_austen So you think the raft's going to work?
charlie_pace Yeah, of course it will work, look at that thing. It's not a raft. They built a sodding boat. And when they get picked up, the helicopters will come, making us ridiculously and eternally famous. What's the matter, don't you want to be famous?
kate_austen What do you think is going on over there?
dr_leslie_arzt Sure, you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch. I was just assuming you didn't want to die.
michael_dawson So, when is the next time we can launch?
dr_leslie_arzt 3, maybe 4, months.
james_ford C'mon, even a weather man on TV don't know what's going to happen. Why are we listening to Arzt?
dr_leslie_arzt Because I'm a doctor, and you're a hillbilly.
james_ford You're a damn high school science teacher.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Sawyer, just let the man talk.
dr_leslie_arzt It's been raining every afternoon. That means that we are on the cusp on monsoon season. Monsoon season is bad. Now, the trade winds are blowing north right now -- shipping lanes are north -- so north is exactly where you want to be.
michael_dawson What does that mean?
dr_leslie_arzt It means that when monsoon season hits the trade winds are going to shift to the south. The raft goes with the wind. Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that is south of us?
dr_jack_shephard Antarctica.
dr_leslie_arzt That's right, Jack, Antarctica.
michael_dawson So, when do we have to leave?
dr_leslie_arzt Yesterday.
kate_austen So obviously you believe him?
michael_dawson Arzt? I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances.
kate_austen You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?
michael_dawson The man said not a day to waste.
kate_austen Supplies all set? You've got food, fresh water?
michael_dawson Kate, no offense, but I've got work to do. Why the sudden interest?
kate_austen Because I'm going with you.
michael_dawson Look, the raft's full -- we need 4, we got 4.
kate_austen Including Sawyer?
michael_dawson Including him. We needed the stuff he had so he bought his way on.
kate_austen To the first raft, which burned.
michael_dawson You know, I'm not going to get into semantics with you. I told the guy...
kate_austen He doesn't even know how to sail.
michael_dawson And you do?
kate_austen I spent 2 summers crewing J boats. I know my way around a sailboat.
michael_dawson Yeah, maybe so, but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.
kate_austen You're bringing Walt, too? I'm just saying it's dangerous.
michael_dawson I decide what's best for my boy. And right now, what's best for him is to get the hell off this Island. The raft's full.
HOSPITAL#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 ANNOUNCEMENT Hospital chaplain to the neural ICU. Hospital chaplain please report to the neural ICU.
kate_austen I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.
nurse Right, she just came up from ICU. She's in room 208. It's around the corner to your right.
kate_austen Thanks.
nurse You're welcome.
kate_austen Hey, Tom.
dr_tom_brennan Oh, Katie. What are you doing here?
kate_austen Diane's dying of cancer. I thought I owed it to her to come see her.
dr_tom_brennan I heard. I'm sorry.
kate_austen Yeah, me too.
dr_tom_brennan So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
kate_austen I need your help.
sunhwa_kwon 당신도 갈 거에요? 여보, 제발 나랑 얘기 좀 해요.
jinsoo_kwon 나도 갈 거야.
dr_jack_shephard How much further?
sayid_jarrah We're almost there.
dr_jack_shephard You want to tell me where we're going, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah It's better that you see it for yourself.
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm not so sure that it is. Tell me why you brought me out here or I'm going to turn around.
john_locke He brought you out here because I asked him to. I asked him not to tell you. I wanted you to have an open mind.
dr_jack_shephard Open mind about what?
dr_jack_shephard My god, what is this thing?
john_locke Exactly. I guess it's time we talked about this.
james_ford Yo, chief, dumb question here -- we're sailing out in the ocean, right?
michael_dawson Do you mind?
james_ford Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.
michael_dawson Yeah?
james_ford We can't catch fish?
michael_dawson Do you know anything about surviving at sea -- sailing, navigating, steering a raft?
james_ford Do you?
michael_dawson It doesn't matter what I know, I built it. Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft.
james_ford You're going to vote me off, Mickey? And who the hell's going to take my place?
james_ford What the hell do you think you're doing?
kate_austen I'm sorry?
james_ford Don't give me the awe-golly eyes. Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.
kate_austen I was just asking some questions. He must have misunderstood me.
james_ford I know what you're doing.
kate_austen Yeah?
james_ford Yeah, just like I know why you wanted that Halliburton case so bad -- the one that belonged to that U.S. Marshal who was flying with us. You were his prisoner.
kate_austen Let go of me.
james_ford The only chance of running is getting on that raft, ain't it? We get picked up by a ship and they come back to rescue the rest of you all -- there's going to be a nice big asterisk next to your name. Don't worry puddin', your secret's safe with me. But just so you know -- no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft.
kate_austen Hey Sawyer. I want your spot, I'll get your spot.
michael_dawson Hey, give me that water, man.
walt_lloyd Yo, dad.
michael_dawson Thanks.
walt_lloyd So what were you and Sawyer arguing about?
michael_dawson I told him something he didn't want to hear.
walt_lloyd Why does he want to get on the raft so much?
michael_dawson Because he knows it's going to work.
walt_lloyd When we get rescued we're going to come back for everybody else, right?
michael_dawson Yeah, sure, of course. The thing is -- this Island, uh, is, uh -- finding it again might be hard.
walt_lloyd Can't we fly around and look for it?
michael_dawson Absolutely, but there's no guarantees. That's why you and me-
walt_lloyd Dad?
michael_dawson Oh . That's why you and...
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad!
michael_dawson Get Jack.
walt_lloyd Help! I need help. It's my dad.
kate_austen What's the matter?
walt_lloyd His stomach is really bad.
kate_austen Take him back to Michael. I'll go get Jack.
sunhwa_kwon Okay. Let's go.
walt_lloyd This way.
kate_austen Jack! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard How long have you known about this?
john_locke 3 weeks, give or take.
dr_jack_shephard 3 weeks. You've been out here for 3 weeks digging this thing up and you never told me about it?
john_locke All due respect, Jack, but since when do I report to you?
dr_jack_shephard All due respect, John, but you lied.
john_locke How long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know? You used your best discretion. I used mine.
dr_jack_shephard So how do we open it?
sayid_jarrah What? You want to open it?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
sayid_jarrah We should bury it! I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity. Anything could be inside!
dr_jack_shephard Best case scenario there's supplies -- worst case, we use it as a shelter.
sayid_jarrah Actually, Jack, I can think of much worse cases than that. You notice anything about this hatch? There's no handle. Could the reason for that be more obvious?! Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.
kate_austen Jack! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, over here!
kate_austen It's Michael, something's wrong.
dr_jack_shephard What'd you eat today?
michael_dawson Uh, fruit, fish.
dr_jack_shephard You drinking enough water?
michael_dawson 2 or 3 bottles.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you getting that water from?
michael_dawson You know, the caves, like everybody else.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, listen, Michael, just take it easy, okay? You stay in the shade and try not to move too much, okay.
michael_dawson No. We have to launch that raft tomorrow. We have to.
dr_jack_shephard I know, I know. I need you to lay back.
kate_austen Lay down. Just lay down, okay.
dr_tom_brennan Hello? Hey, Adam, hey, listen can you carve out some time for me on the MRI? Yeah, it's a favor for a friend of a friend. Um, no, that would work out great, okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam. His name's Conner.
kate_austen How old is he?
dr_tom_brennan 22 months next week.
kate_austen He's beautiful.
dr_tom_brennan Yeah, well, it's Rachel, it's not me.
kate_austen Where is she?
dr_tom_brennan She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks. They get back on Sunday. I got Diane in for an MRI. Now, they'll bring her downstairs to radiology. The appointment's not til 5am, so, we've got about 3 hours to kill.
kate_austen Tom...
dr_tom_brennan You're welcome.
kate_austen You think it's still there?
dr_tom_brennan What?
kate_austen You know what.
dr_tom_brennan It's the middle of the night, Katie.
kate_austen We might not get another chance.
john_locke What do you think it is? Heatstroke?
dr_jack_shephard No, he would have felt that coming on.
john_locke Bad fruit maybe? Raw fish?
dr_jack_shephard Michael and Jin are on the same diet.
john_locke Well, Jin's fine.
dr_jack_shephard Jin's fine. What was making him sick was metabolized fast. It hit him quick and it hit him hard.
john_locke So you think it was the water.
dr_jack_shephard No, I don't think it was the water. I think it was something in the water.
dr_jack_shephard Feeling any better?
michael_dawson The cramps are quieting down -- as long as I don't move, or, -- or breathe.
michael_dawson You and Locke kiss and make up? Good.
dr_jack_shephard No, Michael.
michael_dawson What?
dr_jack_shephard Drink from that one.
michael_dawson Somebody did this to me?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know. I'm not sure of anything yet.
michael_dawson Sawyer.
hugo_reyes I'm on bamboo duty, but yeah, sometimes I help refill the water.
john_locke Michael and Jin getting along?
hugo_reyes Well, they fight like a married couple building a raft together...
john_locke You told him?
dr_jack_shephard Think Sawyer might have done it.
hugo_reyes Oh, because of Kate?
dr_jack_shephard Kate?
hugo_reyes Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft. So Sawyer went off on Michael because, you know, he gets to decide who goes. Hey, you don't think Kate did it, do you?
john_locke Why would Kate poison Michael?
hugo_reyes Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.
hugo_reyes He doesn't know? Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn't even know about the polar bear.
john_locke What did she do?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
john_locke And you didn't think the others should know about this, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Discretion, John.
claire_littleton Okay, can you stop moving or I'm going to cut your ear off.
charlie_pace Ah, this is good. I'm writing again. I'm really feeling it, as well. So, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get rescued?
claire_littleton You know, I don't really know.
charlie_pace You can hang out with me in L.A. -- you and turnip-head. You know, until you figure things out.
claire_littleton Thanks.
charlie_pace Smashing. Okay, check this out. This is track 2. It's called... Sorry. It's called "Monster Eats the Pilot".
kate_austen How's Michael?
dr_jack_shephard He's going to be fine.
kate_austen Somebody going to be taking his place on the raft?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
kate_austen Because, you know, Dr. Arzt said if they leave tomorrow...
dr_jack_shephard Did you poison Michael, Kate?
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard He's not sick, someone did this.
kate_austen Do you really think I'm capable of that?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know what you're capable of.
kate_austen You brought beer?
dr_tom_brennan No self-respecting man in Iowa goes anywhere without beer.
dr_tom_brennan It's not fair, you know -- you coming back. Here. Home.
kate_austen Yeah, I know.
dr_tom_brennan Wow.
kate_austen Wow. Oh.
dr_tom_brennan Oh my god. My plane. I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there.
kate_austen That was your idea. Kate and Tom, 1989.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM Is it on? I don't think it's on.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE It's on.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM Okay, this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan and this is our dedication for our time capsule, here on August 15th, 1989. Hey, give me that back.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE Why are you putting this stupid plane in there?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM Because it's cool, Katie. I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE Ooh, that is cool, just like this time capsule.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in like 20 years.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE How do you know we'll be together?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM Because we'll be married and you'll be a mom and we'll have 9 kids.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE I don't think so. As soon as I get my license we should just get in a car and drive. You know, run away.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM You always want to run away, Katie.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE Yeah, and you know why.
dr_tom_brennan Funny how things turn out, huh?
kate_austen Yeah.
kate_austen Sorry.
dr_tom_brennan We'd better get to the hospital.
kate_austen Yeah.
walt_lloyd What happened?
john_locke I had a little accident.
walt_lloyd Does it hurt?
john_locke Yep. Something you want to tell me, Walt?
walt_lloyd I didn't do it.
john_locke Didn't do what?
walt_lloyd I heard Jack. He thinks somebody got my dad sick. And I didn't do it.
john_locke You think because I know you burned the first raft that I'd think you made your dad sick? We're friends, Walt. I didn't tell on you before and I'm not going to tell on you now. And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad.
john_locke What's the matter?
walt_lloyd Don't open it.
john_locke What'd you say?
walt_lloyd Don't open it, Mr. Locke. Don't open that thing.
john_locke What? What thing?
walt_lloyd Just don't open it.
james_ford Thought you might need that, boss. Wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before take-off.
michael_dawson What? You feeling guilty?
james_ford What?
michael_dawson You're off the raft.
james_ford Come again?
michael_dawson You're off the raft!
james_ford We had a deal.
michael_dawson Yeah, well, the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me.
james_ford I did what now?
michael_dawson I'm done with you.
james_ford You ain't done with me by a damn sight. You said you needed 4!
michael_dawson I've got 4! You've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies, keeping it for yourself, using it to buy favors. You're a liar and a criminal, and I'm not letting you near my boy!
james_ford Oh, I'm a criminal, huh?! I poisoned you because I'm a criminal!
james_ford Get your hands off me, boy. Hey, sweet-cheeks! I had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock. Time to set things straight.
kate_austen Let go of me.
james_ford Tell him who the criminal is!
charlie_pace Hey, leave her alone, man!
james_ford Tell him!
kate_austen Give that back.
michael_dawson Leave her alone!
james_ford Leave her alone?
kate_austen Give that back.
james_ford Mmm-hmmm. Look. Look at this.
kate_austen Sawyer, please.
james_ford You all remember Joanna, don't you? Huh? The woman who drowned? Now what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID? Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft? So she could get herself rescued, run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn Island? She might even poison the captain himself.
kate_austen Shut up!
james_ford She don't care about nothin' or nobody but herself.
dr_tom_brennan This is good here. Thank you.
dr_tom_brennan My office is right back there. I'll wait for you.
kate_austen Hi, mom. Can you hear me? Mom?
kate_austen Mom? It's me, Katie.
diane_janssen Katherine?
kate_austen It's me, Katherine. I'm so sorry for everything that I have put you through.
diane_janssen Help. Help.
kate_austen It's okay, mom. It's just me.
diane_janssen Help. Help.
kate_austen It's okay.
diane_janssen Help. Help me. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me, somebody.
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 GUARD What's going on?
kate_austen I'm her daughter. She's just confused. I was going to get a doctor.
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22 GUARD Hang on. We've got a situation-
dr_tom_brennan What happened?
kate_austen I need your car keys.
dr_tom_brennan Kate, Katie?
kate_austen Get out.
dr_tom_brennan I am not letting you do this. Katie, if you cooperate they go easy...
kate_austen He's calling for backup! I've got to go! Get out!
dr_tom_brennan You can have a real life.
kate_austen Tom, please.
dr_tom_brennan No.
kate_austen Now. Get out.
dr_tom_brennan No!
kate_austen Tom? Tom! Oh god, Tom. No, no, no, Tom. Please wake up.
james_ford You want to tell us why you need to run so bad? You want to tell us the truth?
kate_austen Yes. I was on the plane -- with the Marshal. Yes, I was wanted and caught and being transported back. No matter what I say about what happened -- about what I supposedly did -- I'm going to jail. But I didn't poison you.
michael_dawson Here.
dr_jack_shephard He looks determined.
sunhwa_kwon Yes, he is.
dr_jack_shephard You don't want him to go, do you?
sunhwa_kwon No.
dr_jack_shephard Is that why you tried to make him sick? Michael and Jin working together all the time -- pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up...
sunhwa_kwon I didn't want him to die out there. I just didn't know what to do. I only used enough to make him -- I wasn't trying to hurt him. Are you going to tell the others?
dr_jack_shephard I don't see any reason why they need to know. But Sun, he's going. If I were you, I'd -- I'd say goodbye.
james_ford I'm back on the raft.
kate_austen I'm glad to hear it.
james_ford Michael's going to cowboy up. We set sail tomorrow.
kate_austen Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?
james_ford Nah, sorry don't suit me. You cornered me, Freckles. I did what I had to.
kate_austen I cornered you?
james_ford You said if you wanted my spot you were going to take it. I guess I believed you. Well, that's that. I've got some packing to do.
kate_austen Why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
james_ford 'Cuz there ain't anything on this Island worth staying for.
kate_austen Be safe, Sawyer.
james_ford Yeah.
walt_lloyd Dad.
michael_dawson Hey, buddy.
walt_lloyd Feeling better?
michael_dawson Yeah, yep. I'm going to be alright. Hey, don't worry. I'm going to be on my feet soon. We'll be sailing home before you can even-
walt_lloyd I'm the one that burned the raft. I didn't want to leave and I thought I could stop you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, dad.
michael_dawson Hey, it's okay, man. We can stay here. You and me. We don't have to go.
walt_lloyd Yes we do.
sunhwa_kwon Hello.
kate_austen Hey.
sunhwa_kwon Jack knows. I didn't tell him it was your idea.
kate_austen Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon Why should you be punished? You were only trying to help me. He said he wouldn't tell the others.
kate_austen Yeah, Jack's good at keeping secrets.
sunhwa_kwon When I was a little girl I believed that once I found the man I loved I would be happy, forever.
kate_austen Yeah, me too.
