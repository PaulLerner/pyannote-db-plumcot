CHANG In a world of conflict and strife, there is but one fact we all can agree upon... everybody loves Hugo.
CHANG Born to humble surroundings, Hugo Reyes has always been a beacon of light for all who cross his path.
CHANG Hugo's lifelong love affair with chicken led him to acquire and then expand the Mr. Cluck's chain into a worldwide phenomenon.
CHANG The exponential growth of Hugo's success was startling. But financial success wasn't the end. It was the beginning. Hugo and giving became synonymous.
CHANG Parks, playgrounds, hospitals, the Mr. Cluck's House for Children... the philanthropy was unparalleled.
CHANG Which brings us to this evening and the opening of the Hugo Reyes Palentology Wing at the Golden State Natural History Museum. A lasting beacon of culture that bears the name of one of our city's greatest benefactors.
CHANG Ladies and gentlemen, our man of the year... Hugo Reyes!
HURLEY Pretty cool trophy, huh?
CARMEN Mmm hmm, Hugo...
HURLEY Oh, you know we got the Human Fund next Saturday night... can you make it?
CARMEN Another trophy... everybody loves Hugo... you know who doesn't? Women.
HURLEY Ma!
CARMEN You need a woman in your life. Especially one who has not nursed you.
HURLEY That's disgusting. And I'm too busy to meet someone...
CARMEN You're not too busy. You're too scared!
HURLEY I'm not scared!
CARMEN Good, because you have a date tomorrow.
HURLEY I do?
CARMEN Grandpa Tito's neighbor's daughter. Rosalita. She agreed to lunch with you.
HURLEY What's she like?
CARMEN Willing to meet you.
HURLEY Ma--
CARMEN You're going! She's gonna love you! And if she doesn't... we will find someone who does!
HURLEY A lot of crazy stuff's been happening... I kind of wish I could talk to you about it in person. A lot of people come to talk to me after they've... you know... gone. It would be nice if you did too.
ILANA Hugo!
ILANA You ready to go? Once I'm back, we're leaving.
HURLEY Where are you going?
ILANA The Black Rock. If we're going to destroy that plane, we'll need dynamite.
HURLEY You sure that's the right move?
ILANA No. But it's the only move we have.
HURLEY Well... you're the expert.
ILANA Whose grave is this?
HURLEY Her name was Libby. She was in the tail section of the plane. We were gonna have our first date. It was gonna be, like... a picnic. But then she was murdered.
ILANA I'm sorry.
HURLEY Yeah, me too...
MICHAEL Hey!
HURLEY What are you doing here?
MICHAEL I'm here to stop you from getting everyone killed.
MICHAEL You gonna say something?
HURLEY Why should I trust you? You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.
MICHAEL That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you going across that island to blow up that plane. People are gonna die. A lot of people, and it's gonna be your fault.
HURLEY What?
MICHAEL Because people are listening to you now, Hurley.
JACK Hurley!
JACK Who are you talking to?
HURLEY Um... no one.
JACK Come on. We're leaving.
WAITER Can I get you some more homemade tortilla chips?
HURLEY Sure. Whatever...
HURLEY Uh... can you leave those? I'm meeting someone. She's running late.
WAITER Right. Chips are on the way.
LIBBY Hugo?
HURLEY Uh... hi. Nice to meet you.
HURLEY Wow! Uh... I wasn't expecting someone like you.
LIBBY Uh... I'm sorry?
HURLEY You know, someone so... pretty. Please, have a seat.
HURLEY You don't look like a Rosalita...
LIBBY Oh, uh... my name isn't Rosalita. It's Libby.
HURLEY So... you're not my blind date?
LIBBY No, I... I just saw you from across the room.
HURLEY Well... how did you know my name?
LIBBY Well, if I tell you, you're gonna think I'm crazy.
HURLEY No I won't.
LIBBY Hugo, do you believe that two people can be connected? Like soulmates?
HURLEY I guess...
LIBBY You don't remember me, do you?
HURLEY Should I?
DR. BROOKS What are you doing, Elizabeth? Are you bothering this man?
LIBBY No! No, he... he's an old friend.
HURLEY Actually, we just... wait, what? What's going on?
DR. BROOKS I apologize for the intrusion.
DR. BROOKS Come on.
LIBBY No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just--
HURLEY Doctor?
DR. BROOKS I'm sorry, she just wandered off.
HURLEY Wandered off from where?
LIBBY Everything that I said, Hugo... I meant it.
DR. BROOKS Forgive us.
ILANA Alright, let's go. We have to make it to the outriggers and across the channel to Hydra Island before nightfall.
RICHARD Do you have the dynamite?
ILANA Four sticks. Enough to destroy the cockpit and all the instruments. That plane'll never fly.
HURLEY Um... I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable.
ILANA You have to trust me. I've been training my whole life for this.
HURLEY To blow stuff up?
ILANA To protect you!
HURLEY Yeah, but how's blowing up the plane protecting us?
ILANA With that plane gone, that thing won't be able to leave the island.
HURLEY Yeah... well neither will we. And then we'll be stuck here with it and it will be angry at us.
ILANA Jacob said Richard will know what to do. And Richard said to blow up the plane, correct?
RICHARD Yes.
HURLEY Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me. I mean... what if Richard's wrong?
ILANA Hugo, I'm looking out for your best interests! All of you! Nothing is more important than this! That thing is evil! And God help us if it ever leaves this island! Because if it--
MAN ...about six feet off the ground.
SAWYER That gonna be a spear?
LOCKE I'm not sure what it's gonna be yet, James. When the time is right, it'll tell me.
SAWYER You talk to wood now?
KATE Sawyer...
SAWYER What?
LOCKE Something I can do for you two?
SAWYER Is there something you can do? How about anything? Those bastards on the other island grabbed Jin and we're just sittin' here twiddlin' our damn thumbs, doin' nothin' about it!
LOCKE There's a difference between doing nothing and waiting.
KATE So what are we waiting for?
LOCKE You were only able to come back to this island because you all did it together. If we're gonna get on that plane and leave, it has to happen the same way. We're waiting for your friends to get here, Kate. Hugo... Sun... Jack. That's the only way we're ever getting off this... Godforsaken rock.
KATE Well, I don't see that happening.
LOCKE Well, let's just hope you're wrong.
SAWYER Where have you been?
SAYID Can I speak to you in private?
LOCKE Absolutely.
LOCKE Everything go alright?
SAYID Yes.
LOCKE Did Widmore see you?
SAYID No, but his people did.
LOCKE And you let them live?
SAYID I didn't see the point of killing them when I had what I came for.
LOCKE So you found what they were hiding in the submarine?
SAYID I most certainly did.
BEN Now what?
RICHARD We get more dynamite. Or else she died for nothing.
JACK Maybe she died to show us to stay the hell away from dynamite.
RICHARD Well Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.
JACK Richard, I promised Sun that I'd get her off this island.
RICHARD Well Jack, I... I wish you hadn't done that. If it makes you feel any better, you can blame it on me.
HURLEY I think Richard's right. It's the only choice we've got. Trust me, Jack.
JACK Okay.
RICHARD Good. Let's get moving.
CASHIER 38! Number 38!
CASHIER Mr. Reyes! What an honor!
HURLEY Give me a bucket. Family size.
CASHIER Of course. Right away, sir.
WOMAN 41! Number 41!
HURLEY What?
DESMOND I'm sorry. Have I seen you before?
HURLEY I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial. You want a Cluckateer key chain?
DESMOND No, it's not that. Were you on Oceanic flight 815? About a week ago... from Sydney.
HURLEY Uh... yeah.
DESMOND So was I.
HURLEY Wow, what a coincidence...
DESMOND Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order?
HURLEY Be my guest...
DESMOND Ooh... that is a lot of chicken!
HURLEY I eat when I'm depressed!
DESMOND Ah! So what's her name?
HURLEY I met a girl on a blind date the other night.
DESMOND And you didn't... it didn't go how you hoped?
HURLEY Mmm, she's totally awesome... except for one thing. She's crazy!
DESMOND Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother...
HURLEY No, this one actually lives in the loony bin. I mean, I saw the van. She's full on nuts. I mean, she started sane... but then, she told me that we already knew each other. And that, I'd remember!
DESMOND Tell me something...did you believe her when she said she knew you?
HURLEY Yeah. Kinda...
DESMOND Now, I say go with your gut. You know, maybe you should... you should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from before you give up on her.
CASHIER 42! Order 42!
DESMOND Ah! That's me, brother. Well, uh... it was nice bumpin' into ya.
LOCKE Hello.
DESMOND Hello.
LOCKE I'm sorry Sayid tied you up but he was afraid you would run before we had a chance to talk.
DESMOND I don't blame him. Although, as I explained to him before he left... I have nowhere to run to, brother.
LOCKE Well, if that's not the best argument against captivity that I've ever heard, I don't know what is.
LOCKE Would you mind if I asked you a couple of questions, Desmond?
DESMOND Not at all.
LOCKE Why did Charles Widmore bring you back to the island?
DESMOND Considering I was kidnapped, you'd have to ask him.
SAYID They had him under armed guard.
DESMOND He threw me into a wood shack and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism.
LOCKE If you don't mind my asking, Desmond... how could you be sure what it was that he blasted you with?
DESMOND Experience.
LOCKE Do you know who I am?
DESMOND Of course. You're John Locke.
LOCKE Head back to camp. I'll be back soon.
SAYID Where are you going?
LOCKE Desmond and I need to take a walk.
LOCKE There's something I'd like to show you.
BEN Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
JACK What's that?
BEN Ilana. There she was - handpicked by Jacob, trained to come and protect you candidates, no sooner does she tell you who you are, then she blows up. The Island was done with her. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us.
RICHARD All right everyone, this might take a few minutes. I don't want anyone but me handling that dynamite, so I'm gonna go it alone. Where's Hugo?
JACK I thought he was up front with you
HURLEY Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go!
RICHARD Why the hell did you do that?!
HURLEY I'm protecting us.
RICHARD What the hell were you thinking?!
JACK Calm down.
RICHARD Now what-what are we supposed to do now?
JACK That's it. That's enough.
RICHARD We're dead. We're all dead.
MILES A warning might have been nice there, Hugo.
HURLEY I did say "Run."
MILES Why'd you do that?
HURLEY Michael told me to.
MILES Who?
HURLEY Michael. He's one of the people who come back and yell at me after they die. He told me I had to stop everyone from blowing up the plane. So...no dynamite, no more blowing up.
MILES That happen a lot? Dead people yelling at you?
HURLEY It happens enough.
MILES And you just listen to whatever they say?
HURLEY Dead people are more reliable than alive people.
DR. BROOKS How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?
HURLEY Want to ask you about that girl the other day. Libby? I was wondering if maybe I could see her.
DR. BROOKS I don't think that's a good idea. She's not well.
HURLEY Clearly, she's well enough for, like, a fajita field trip.
DR. BROOKS Well, that's my mistake. I misjudged her condition.
HURLEY Her condition?
DR. BROOKS She has issues with reality.
HURLEY What do you mean?
DR. BROOKS I just think it probably wouldn't be a good idea for you to see her right now. It'll only confuse her.
HURLEY You said "probably", which means you might make an exception.
DR. BROOKS Well, perhaps for family.
HURLEY Or a generous donor?
DR. BROOKS I'm sorry.
HURLEY The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in. What do you think 100K might buy?
LIBBY You remembered?
HURLEY No. I'm sorry.
LIBBY Then why are you here?
HURLEY Where is it you think you know me from?
LIBBY Um, I'm not sure. I...I know it won't make sense.
HURLEY Try me.
LIBBY A few days ago, I was watching TV, and one of your commercials came on. And the moment that I saw you, it was like I was hit over the hand. All these memories came washing back...of my life...only...it was...another life.
HURLEY What kind of memories?
LIBBY There was a plane crash...and uh...I was on an island.
HURLEY And I was there?
LIBBY Think so. We...knew each other. We...liked each other. And then when I got here, it was almost like I'd been here before. And for some reason, Hugo, I have a memory of you being here, too.
HURLEY Um... This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital.
LIBBY Yeah, I know. But I can't get you out of my brain. That's why the other night when I saw you, I had to talk to you, because if you remembered me...
HURLEY I wish I could, Libby. But...I can't. I'm sorry.
LIBBY It's okay. It's okay. I'm crazy.
HURLEY Yeah, probably, but...we all got something, right? I mean, it takes a lot of guts to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them from some bizarro alternate universe. I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl.
LIBBY You're doing fine.
HURLEY Hey, can you ever like, like...get outta here? On day pass or...
LIBBY Yeah, I'm here voluntarily.
HURLEY Well...would you like to do something?
LIBBY You mean...a date?
HURLEY Uh...yeah.
LIBBY I'd love that.
LOCKE Remind me, Desmond - how long were you down in that hatch, pushing that button?
DESMOND Three years.
LOCKE And here you are, back for more. If I didn't know better, I'd say this island has it in for you.
DESMOND Do you know better?
LOCKE Excuse me?
DESMOND Well, there's nothing special about me, brother. This island has it in for all of us.
LOCKE Yes, it does.
DESMOND What?
DESMOND Who's that?
LOCKE Just ignore him.
DESMOND Do you know that boy?
LOCKE I said ignore him!
JACK Where you going?
RICHARD Ben, back at the DHARMA barracks - there's still grenades there? Explosives?
BEN Yes, I think so.
RICHARD Then that's where we're going.
JACK Maybe we should talk about this a minute.
RICHARD Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know what we need to do, if you know how we stop that thing from leaving the Island without blowing that plane up, then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.
HURLEY I know what we need to do.
RICHARD Really? What's that?
HURLEY We have to go talk to Locke.
BEN Are you trying to get us killed?
HURLEY It's not my idea. It's his. Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.
RICHARD Jacob's here right now?
HURLEY Yeah.
RICHARD Ask him what the island is.
HURLEY What?
RICHARD A while back, Jacob told me what the Island was, and if he's really standing here right next to me, then just ask him.
HURLEY I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard. You either come with me or you can keep trying to blow stuff up. Your call, dude.
RICHARD He's lying. Jacob isn't telling us what to do. Because Jacob never tells us what to do. I'm going to make this simple. If that thing leaves the island, that's it. I-it's over.
MILES What's over?
RICHARD Everything. I'm destroying that plane and I can use all the help I can get. Who's coming with me?
BEN I am.
MILES I saw that thing in action, man. It doesn't want to talk. Sorry.
RICHARD Anyone else?
JACK Sorry, Richard. If Jacob says we go talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke. I'm going with Hugo.
HURLEY Really?
RICHARD Don't get in our way.
JACK All right, Hurley. Let's go talk to Locke.
LAPIDUS Probably.
HURLEY So what do you think we should...say to Locke when we get there? I mean, how do you break the ice with a smoke monster?
JACK I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me he's going to do most of the talking.
HURLEY Or he could just kill us all.
JACK Yeah. He could.
HURLEY I didn't see Jacob back there. I just said it because I wanted everyone to listen to me.
JACK I know.
HURLEY Then why'd you come with me?
JACK Ever since Juliet died - ever since I got her killed - all I've wanted was to fix it. But I can't. I can't ever fix it. You've no idea how hard it is for me to sit back and listen to other people tell me what I should do...but I think maybe that's the point...maybe I'm supposed to let go.
HURLEY Unless you letting go gets us killed. Going to see Locke was my idea, not Jacob's.
JACK Hurley, you asked me to trust you. This is me trusting you.
HURLEY It's a good thing you do, dude, because I have no idea where I'm going.
HURLEY Wait. It's cool, I think I know what these things are.
LAPIDUS Oh yeah? What the hell are they?
HURLEY Wait here.
HURLEY Hey, you around? Michael?
HURLEY You're stuck on the Island aren't you?
MICHAEL 'Cause of what I did.
HURLEY And...there're others out here like you, aren't there? That's what the whispers are?
MICHAEL Yeah. We're the ones who can't move on.
HURLEY Do you know where Locke is?
MICHAEL There.
HURLEY Thanks. Is...is there anything I can do to...help you?
MICHAEL Don't get yourself killed.
HURLEY Okay.
MICHAEL And Hurley, if you ever do see Libby again, tell her I'm very sorry.
HURLEY I'll be sure and do that, dude.
HURLEY I got like, six different kinds of cheeses. I don't even know what they are, but the lady at the store said they were good, so...figured you'd like cheese because...everybody likes cheese.
HURLEY Something wrong?
LIBBY No, not wrong, just...off.
HURLEY Have you been here before?
LIBBY No. It's just being here with you...feels so familiar. It's like a date we never had. Wow I sound completely insane, don't I?
HURLEY No...not completely.
LIBBY Why do you even want to be with me?
HURLEY Why do you want to be with me?
LIBBY What?
HURLEY C'mon. Look at me.
LIBBY I wanna be with you because I like you.
HURLEY Yeah but, you like me because...well...you're...delusional.
LIBBY What? What's wrong?
HURLEY Whoa, dude.
LIBBY What?
HURLEY I...I think I'm remembering stuff.
LIBBY You are? You mean I'm not crazy?
HURLEY No, I don't think you are.
LOCKE We're here.
DESMOND What is it?
LOCKE It's a well.
LOCKE Let me guess. You're wondering how deep it is?
DESMOND You read my mind.
LOCKE You have any idea how old this well is, Desmond?
DESMOND Very old?
LOCKE That's exactly right, very old. So old in fact, that the people who dug this well did it completely by hand. God knows how long it took 'em.
DESMOND That seems like a lot of work just to get some water.
LOCKE Oh, they weren't looking for water. They were looking for answers. A long time ago places like the one we're standing at right now made compass needles spin. And the people holding the compasses needed to know why, so they dug.
DESMOND Did they find what they were looking for?
LOCKE No, they didn't. The reason I wanted you to see this, Desmond, is because Charles Widmore is not interested in answers, he's only interested in power. And he brought you back to the Island so that you could help him find what he's looking for. After all, this isn't the only well.
DESMOND And that's the reason you wanted me to see this?
LOCKE Why aren't you afraid?
DESMOND Excuse me?
LOCKE You're out here, middle of the jungle, with me, not a person on earth even knows you're here. Why aren't you afraid?
DESMOND What is the point in being afraid?
DESMOND Aah!
SAYID How's our friend?
LOCKE You don't have to worry about him any more.
SAWYER Where you been?
LOCKE I went for a walk, James.
SAWYER Well, now that you've stretched your legs, maybe you can--
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
HURLEY Ummm...hey.
LOCKE Hello, Hugo.
HURLEY I don't know who you are, dude, or what you want, but we have to talk to you.
LOCKE We?
HURLEY There are other people with me. The thing is...you got weapons and we got weapons, and I don't want anyone to get hurt...or killed. So, we're not gonna do anything. I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either.
LOCKE You have my word.
HURLEY Okay guys, come on out.
LOCKE Hello, Jack.
BEN Hello there. You wating for someone in particular?
DESMOND Excuse me?
BEN Well, I noticed you've been parked here a while watching the kids, and well, it is a school. Do you have a child who goes here?
DESMOND No. No. I was um, uh, I just moved to the neighborhood, and um, and, uh, I'm looking for a school for my son.
BEN What's your son's name?
DESMOND Charlie.
BEN Well, as a teacher here I can vouch for it completely. It's a wonderful school.
DESMOND That's great to hear, thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you.
BEN Have a good day.
BEN Call 911, do it now! Mr. Locke? Oh, my God. Don't, don't move. We're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Can you hear me?
