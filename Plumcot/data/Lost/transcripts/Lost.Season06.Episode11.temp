ZOE Mr. Hume, my name is Zoe. I know you're disoriented, you've been unconscious for the last three days. But you're off the I.V. sedation now, and I've just given you a shot to help you wake up.
DESMOND Are you a nurse?
ZOE You're not in the hospital anymore Mr. Hume, we had to move you.
DESMOND What, move me? Move me where? Where's my wife?
ZOE No, wait Mr.-Mr.-No, you shouldn't, you shouldn't--
DESMOND I want to see Penny.
WIDMORE I'm afraid that's not going to be possible, Desmond.
DESMOND You.
WIDMORE Easy, Easy. I'll take it from here.
WIDMORE Desmond--
DESMOND What happened to me? Where am I?
WIDMORE You were shot. By Benjamin Linus. Do you remember that?
DESMOND Yes, I remember. Look I want to talk to Penny. Penny!
WIDMORE She's not here. But I assure you both she and your son are perfectly safe. I'm really sorry for taking you away from them but...I didn't have a chance to explain. And...if I had, you never would've come with me.
DESMOND Come with you? Come with you where?
WIDMORE I brought you back to the Island. I can't imagine how you must be feeling. But if you'll give me a chance to explain--
WIDMORE Damn it! Don't hurt him.
DESMOND You take me back! You take me back right now, you hear?!
WIDMORE I can't take you back. The Island isn't done with you yet.
JIN What is Desmond doing here?
WIDMORE It would be easier for me to show you, than to tell you, Mr. Kwon. Take him with you to the generator room. I'll be along with Hume so we can start the test.
ZOE Charles, th-that test isn't scheduled until tomorrow.
WIDMORE I know when it's scheduled. Get them ready now.
ZOE Come on, no time for sightseeing.
ZOE They're bringing Hume down now.
SEAMUS What?
ZOE You heard me, we are go right now. What's your timeframe?
SEAMUS We're not even close to being ready! This generator probably hasn't run in twenty years. How am I supposed--
ZOE Widmore doesn't want to wait.
JIN What are you doing here?
ZOE We're running a little test.
JIN What kind of test?
SEAMUS Alright let's see where we are. Can we get a functioning E.M. field going, people?
UNKNOWN VOICE Sure thing.
SEAMUS Then try a power test. Generator to full, please.
UNKNOWN VOICE Okay.
SEAMUS Here we go. On my count... three...two...one...and power on.
SEAMUS Great. We've probably got a faulty contact somewhere, find it! Simmons, go down and check the circuits on the solenoids.
SIMMONS Yes sir.
SEAMUS And guess what, Angstrom, you're going in there next.
UNKNOWN TECHNICIAN Found it! It was a bad breaker on the genny. Bringing it back online now.
ZOE No!
ZOE No!
SEAMUS Turn it off, turn it off!
ZOE Oh my god.
WIDMORE Zoe. Are we ready?
MAN Got it.
WIDMORE Stop.
WIDMORE You can take him now. Thank you. Put him inside.
DESMOND Hey. What the hell are you doing?
WIDMORE I know how this looks, Desmond. But if everything I've been told about you is true, you'll be perfectly fine.
WIDMORE'S MAN You don't have any metal on you do you? Keys? Change?
WIDMORE Course he doesn't, you idiot. I hate to resort to forcing this upon you, Desmond. But once it's over I'm going to ask you to make a sacrifice. And I hope for all our sakes you'll help me.
DESMOND Sacrifice? What the bloody Hell do you know about sacrifice?
WIDMORE My son died here for the sake of this island. Your wife - my own daughter - hates me. And I've never even met my grandson. But if you won't help me, Desmond, all of it will be for nothing. Penny, your son, and everyone else, will be gone forever.
DESMOND Aah! Uhh! Aah!
WIDMORE All right, turn it on.
JIN No! If you want me to help you with whatever you're doing here, you need to explain to me--
WIDMORE That man is the only person I'm aware of, in the world, who has survived a catastrophic electromagnetic event, I need to know that he can do it again, or we all die. Turn it on!
WIDMORE Do we have full power?
SEAMUS Yeah, but...
DESMOND Let me out!
DESMOND Let me out you bastards! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
HURLEY It's carousel four.
DESMOND Sorry?
HURLEY You were on the Sydney flight, right?
DESMOND Yeah.
HURLEY Our bags on carousel four, I double checked it with the dude at the counter.
DESMOND Thank you.
DESMOND Hang on, I got it, I got it.
CLAIRE Thank you so much.
DESMOND Pleasure. You got any more bags?
CLAIRE No uhhh, that's it, thank God.
DESMOND Boy or a girl?
CLAIRE Ummm.
DESMOND Oh I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to pry.
CLAIRE Oh no it's fine, I just ummm, I don't know what it is.
DESMOND All right. Well you're braver than I, you know. I'm not a big fan of surprises. Oh excuse me, that's mine.
DESMOND So, have you got someone meeting you?
CLAIRE Uhh yeah, uh maybe they got the flights messed up or something.
DESMOND Because I've got a car picking me up. You now, If you need a ride I'd be more than happy to give you a lift.
CLAIRE Oh no, no, that's ummm, that's really sweet of you but I'm good, there's cabs, so...
DESMOND All right, well, it was nice meeting you.
CLAIRE Yeah nice to meet you too.
DESMOND A boy.
CLAIRE What?
DESMOND Bet it's a boy.
DESMOND Looks like I'm with you.
GEORGE Mr. Hume, hello. Let me grab that for you.
DESMOND Thank you.
GEORGE My name is George.
DESMOND Hi, George.
GEORGE So, I'll take you back to your hotel?
DESMOND The office.
GEORGE Office. Wonderful. This way please. So uh, you flew in from Sydney huh?
DESMOND Yeah, that's right.
GEORGE And what, what were you doing uh down under?
DESMOND I was closing a deal for the boss.
GEORGE Oh good for you, congratulations. Hey listen, if you need anything at all while you're in town, I know everyone. You need a reservation? You just pick a restaurant.
DESMOND The room service at the hotel's excellent, thank you.
GEORGE You uhh, you looking uh for some company? I noticed that you weren't wearing a wedding band. And there are a lot of lovely ladies offering their uh companionship.
DESMOND I'm not looking for any companionship. I'm here to work.
GEORGE Guess that's why you're the boss's right-hand man, and I am the driver. Okay. Got it.
RECEPTIONIST Good morning Mr. Hume, how was your flight?
DESMOND Lovely, thank you.
RECEPTIONIST He said to send you right in.
DESMOND Thank you.
DESMOND Charles.
WIDMORE Hello, Desmond. Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.
DESMOND Thank you.
WIDMORE I don't give a bloody damn what he did, or how much it's going to cost. Just get him arraigned and get him out of there.
WIDMORE Sorry Desmond. Looks like our celebration of the Australian deal is going to have to be cut short. You are aware that my son is a musician?
DESMOND Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.
WIDMORE Yeah he is, quite. Anyway, my wife is putting together one of her charity events and uh, the boy had the crazy idea to combine classical music with modern rock. You heard of a band called Drive Shaft?
DESMOND No, can't say I have.
WIDMORE Their bass guitarist overdosed and uh, got himself arrested. And now, if I don't get this junkie to my wife's event she will, simply put, destroy me.
DESMOND So you want me to babysit him?
WIDMORE I know it's beneath you, but I need someone I can trust to do the job right.
DESMOND Say no more Charles, it's done.
WIDMORE Huh.
WIDMORE You really do have the life, son. No family, no commitments, ahh to be free of attachments.
DESMOND I'm a blessed man, Sir.
WIDMORE No, it is I who am blessed, to have you in my employ. A drink, to celebrate your indispensibility.
DESMOND That's your sixty-year-old Scotch, Charles.
WIDMORE Nothing's too good for you.
DESMOND Sl√†inte.
LAWYER Mr. Hume?
DESMOND That's right.
LAWYER Bail's all been taken care of. Remember he's not allowed to leave the state.
DESMOND Good. Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume. Charles Widmore sent me.
DESMOND Hey! Where you going?
LAWYER He's all yours.
DESMOND Hey!
DRIVER What's wrong with you?! Idiot!
DESMOND I'll have whatever he's having. One drink, then we go.
CHARLIE So what's your job then, to babysit me? What are you? Mr. Widmore's chief lackey? Henchman?
DESMOND No title. Plenty of perks though.
CHARLIE Hmmm, such as?
DESMOND I get to meet charming people.
CHARLIE Well, cheers then. Tell me perky, are you happy?
DESMOND Quite.
CHARLIE No you're not.
DESMOND Well, I've got a great job, lots of money, get to travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?
CHARLIE Have you ever been in love?
DESMOND Thousands of times.
CHARLIE That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about spectacular, consciousness-altering love. Do you know what that looks like?
DESMOND I wasn't aware that love looked like anything.
CHARLIE I've seen it, mate. On the plane back from Sydney.
DESMOND Is that so? Well we were on the same flight, so...maybe I saw it too.
CHARLIE Trust me, you didn't.
DESMOND Oh? Enlighten me.
CHARLIE There was this woman, two rows in front of me, in handcuffs, sitting with a cop. He looked at me, knew I was holding. If I didn't take action I'd be caught. So I got up, went to the lav, proceeded to eliminate the evidence by swallowing my stash. And at that exact moment we hit turbulence. I choked. The entire bag of heroin is stuck in my throat. It's, uh, it's over. Everything starts to go dark, I'm slipping into the abyss, and then I see...her.
DESMOND Her?
CHARLIE A woman. Blonde, rapturously beautiful, and I know her. We're together. It's like we've always been, and always will be. This feeling, this love, and just as I'm about to be engulfed by...(snaps fingers) I open my eyes, and this sodding idiot is standing there asking me if I'm okay. But I saw it, just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.
DESMOND Well that's just...poetry, brother. You know you should, you should write a song about that.
CHARLIE Yeah yeah yeah yeah, I know what you're saying - poor suicidal rock star. But I've seen something real, I've seen the truth.
DESMOND No, that's not the truth. You want to know the real truth, Pace? Right now you have a choice - you can keep on drinking, or you can come with me. Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here, it will very likely result in the extermination of your musical career.
CHARLIE And if I go with you?
DESMOND In twenty minutes, you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel, right on the harbor front, and Charles Widmore - one of the most powerful men in this town, will owe you a favor.
CHARLIE Doesn't really seem like a choice.
DESMOND There's always a choice, brother.
CHARLIE That's my band, Drive Shaft, our first single. The beginning of everything great. You like it?
DESMOND Sure, for what it is.
CHARLIE I feel sorry for you, mate. You think you're happy. You think you've got it all--this, your life. But, you don't.
DESMOND Why, because none of it's real?
CHARLIE All right, Mr. Hume. How about I offer you a choice?
DESMOND What's that?
CHARLIE I can either show you what I'm talking about, or you can get out of the car. 
DESMOND Why in God's name would I want to get out of the car?
DESMOND Aah! Uhh!
DESMOND Charlie! Charlie! Come on!
DESMOND Come on! Come on! Damn it!
DOCTOR You sustained a pretty bad bump in your accident. Any nausea?
DESMOND Nope.
DOCTOR Double vision?
DESMOND No. Listen, I need to find the man I was brought in here with.
DOCTOR How about hallucinations?
DESMOND What do you mean?
DOCTOR Hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there.
DESMOND Um, I'm not sure.
DOCTOR Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive. I'm going to send you downstairs for an M.R.I.
DESMOND No, I don't have time for this. I need to find the man I came in here with.
DOCTOR I'm afraid you're not finding anyone until we know what's going on inside your brain.
TECHNICIAN Are you wearing any metal? Carrying keys or change? Any metal inside your body--pacemakers, pins, bullets, steel plate inside of your head?
DESMOND No. Nothing.
TECHNICIAN I see you didn't list an emergency contact, no friends or family?
DESMOND Um, just put down my employer, Charles Widmore.
TECHNICIAN This machine is super loud. You're gonna want these. And you need the button.
DESMOND The button?
TECHNICIAN The panic button. You need to stop, press it. Try not to 'cause we'll have to start all over again from the beginning. I'll be in that booth over there. You'll be able to hear me. Thirty minutes, okay?
TEHCNICIAN Okay, here we go.
 Desmond.
DESMOND Hey! Let me out of here.
DESMOND Hey! Hey!
TECHNICIAN What happened, man? Are you all right?
DESMOND I need to find the man I came in here with. I need to find the man I came in here with.
DESMOND His name is Charlie Pace. He came in an hour ago. He just give me his room number.
NURSE If you're not a relative, that's confidential information.
DESMOND Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him!
NURSE Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
DESMOND Hey. Excuse me. Um, were you on the same Oceanic flight um, from Sydney.
JACK Yeah, yeah, you were sitting next to me. Desmond, right?
DESMOND Yeah, that's right. Listen. I wonder if you can help me, brother. I need to find someone. He was on our plane. He's somewhere in the hospital.
JACK Hold on. He was on our plane and now he's here in the hospital?
CHARLIE None of this matters. None of this matters.
WOMAN No! Sir! Please, stop!
JACK Take it easy.
DESMOND Why are you running?
CHARLIE Cause no one here can help me. Now let me go.
DESMOND Why'd you try and to kill me?
CHARLIE I didn't try and kill you. I was trying to show you something.
DESMOND Want to show me something? Show me your hand.
CHARLIE What?
DESMOND Your hands. Show me your bloody hands now.
CHARLIE You saw something, didn't you? In the water. What was it?
CHARLIE What are you looking for, mate?
DESMOND Who's Penny?
CHARLIE I don't know. Ah. You felt it, didn't you?
DESMOND I didn't feel anything.
CHARLIE Then, why are you accosting a man in a dressing gown?
DESMOND All right. Come on. We're leaving.
CHARLIE Whoa! You think I'm going to play a rock concert after this? This doesn't matter. None of this matters. All that matters is that we felt it. You wanna try and stop me, good luck.
DESMOND Hey, where you going?
CHARLIE If I were you I'd stop worrying about me and start looking for Penny.
WIDMORE What do you mean he's gone?
DESMOND Look he escaped. He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart and then ran out of the hospital.
WIDMORE And you let him go?
DESMOND He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles. I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.
WIDMORE And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond. But when I give you a job to do, I expect you to do it.
DESMOND With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert.
WIDMORE I tell you what, Desmond, if you can't deliver Pace, why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore, it's only a bloody concert.
GEORGE Mr. Hume. So you‚Äôve never met the boss' wife, huh?
DESMOND No.
GEORGE Good luck.
ELOISE Please, tell me, how is it that someone in your line of work is not aware that the butter knife is placed handle to the right, blade facing left? Just so.
WAITER Okay.
ELOISE For God's sake.
DESMOND Mrs. Widmore?
ELOISE Yes!
DESMOND My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.
ELOISE Of course, Mr. Hume. Charles has told me so much about you. It's a travesty we haven't met before... Well, it's about time.
DESMOND Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.
ELOISE Oh, please. It's Eloise.
DESMOND Eloise.
ELOISE So uhh, what crisis forced Charles to send his best fix-it man into the bowels of charity balls?
DESMOND Well, Eloise, uh, I'm deeply sorry but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft won't be able to perform alongside your son. And, uh, I take full responsibility--
ELOISE Don't worry about it.
DESMOND Excuse me?
ELOISE Oh, my son will understand. I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars, certain unpredictability comes with the territory.
DESMOND Yeah. You're not angry?
ELOISE Oh, not at all dear. What happened, happened. Thank you so much, Mr. Hume, for coming and telling me in person. A pleasure meeting you.
DESMOND And you.
ELOISE Uh, center that flower arrangement, please.
DESMOND Have a good evening.
ELOISE Thank you!
MAN Leifer, Stefanie, plus two. Markey, Mary, plus one. Milton, Penny solo. Pepper, Nicholas, plus one.
DESMOND Excuse me. I'm sorry, um, did you just say Penny?
MAN And who are you?
DESMOND Um, I work for Mr. Widmore, may I see the list?
ELOISE You absolutely may not. That list is confidential.
DESMOND Begging your pardon, I'm entrusted with confidential items every day.
ELOISE Are you questioning me?
DESMOND No, I just want to look at one name on that list. And, if for some reason, that's a problem...
ELOISE Come with me.
ELOISE Out! Everyone, now!
DESMOND Look, I'm, I'm sorry, if I've overstepped my bounds.
ELOISE Stop talking, Hume. I've heard what you've had to say, now you listen to me. I want you to stop.
DESMOND Stop? Stop what?
ELOISE Someone has clearly affected the way you see things. This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation. So, whatever you're doing, whatever it is you think you're looking for...You need to stop looking for it.
DESMOND Do you, do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?
ELOISE I don't know why you're looking for anything? You have the perfect life. On top of it, you‚Äôve managed to attain the thing you wanted more than anything--my husband's approval.
DESMOND How do you know what I want?
ELOISE Because I bloody do.
DESMOND I need to see that list...or you need to tell me why I can't.
ELOISE You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.
DESMOND Ready? Ready, for what?
GEORGE That bad, huh?
DESMOND Is there any alcohol in this car?
GEORGE Oh, yeah. Whatever you need. So, uh, where to, Mr. Hume?
DESMOND Just drive, George.
DANIEL Mr. Hume?
DESMOND Yes?
DANIEL My name is Daniel, Daniel Widmore. We need to talk.
DESMOND Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...
DANIEL Dan, please. Call me, Dan. Mr. Widmore is my father.
DESMOND Dan, if this is about Charlie Pace not being able to perform with you, I'm, I'm very sorry.
DANIEL Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?
DESMOND Excuse me?
DANIEL First time I saw her was walking through this museum, few weeks ago. She, she works here. She was on her lunch break. She was eating a chocolate bar. She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair. And, as soon as I saw her, right, right in that moment, it was like, it was like I already loved her. And that's when things got weird. That same night after I saw that woman, I woke up and I wrote this.
DESMOND So what is it?
DANIEL I'm a musician. I have no idea. So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech. He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics. He said these equations are so advanced that only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life could have come up with them.
DESMOND So what do they mean?
DANIEL Okay. Imagine, imagine something terrible is about to happen. Something catastrophic, and the only way to stop it from happening is by releasing a huge amount of energy. Like setting off a nuclear bomb.
DESMOND You wanna set off a nuclear bomb.
DANIEL Just listen, what if, this, all this, what if this wasn't suppose to be our life? What if we had some other life and for some reason, we changed things? I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume. I think I already did.
DESMOND Listen, mate, um. I don't know what any of this has to do with me, so...
DANIEL Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny? It happened to you, too, didn't it? You felt it.
DESMOND I don't know...I don't know what I felt.
DANIEL Yes, you do. You felt love.
DESMOND That's impossible, because I don't know anything about this woman, I don't know...I don't know where she is. I don't even know if she exists. She's...she's an idea.
DANIEL No, Mr. Hume. She's my half-sister. And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.
PENNY Hi.
DESMOND Excuse me.
PENNY Yeah.
DESMOND Are you Penny?
PENNY Uh, yes.
DESMOND Hello, I‚Äôm Desmond.
PENNY Uh, Hi.
MAN Checking in now.
SEAMUS He's okay!
WIDMORE Indeed he is! How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?
DESMOND Fine. How long was I unconscious for?
WIDMORE Oh, no more than a few seconds.
DESMOND Will you help me up, please.
WIDMORE I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond. But, as I told you, your talent is vital to our mission. So, if you just let me explain...
DESMOND It's all right. I understand.
WIDMORE What?
DESMOND I said, I understand.
DESMOND You told me you brought me here to the island to do something very important.
WIDMORE Yeah.
DESMOND When do we start?
ZOE What happened to you?
DESMOND What do you mean?
ZOE What I mean is, twenty minutes ago you were beating the crap out of Widmore with an I.V. stand and, and now you‚Äôre Mr. Cooperative.
DESMOND A lot can happen in twenty minutes.
ZOE Sure can. That thing fried your brain.
DESMOND Did it?
ZOE Whatever, doesn‚Äôt change that we're gonna...
SAYID Run.
SAYID Desmond, I don't have time to explain, but these people are extremely dangerous. We need to go now.
DESMOND Aye, of course. Lead the way.
PENNY Hello? You okay?
DESMOND What happened?
PENNY Well, I shook your hand and then you fainted. I must have quite an effect on you.
DESMOND Aye, aye you must have.
PENNY Have we met before?
DESMOND I-I think we'd have remembered it, if we had.
PENNY Yeah. Well, as long as you're sure you're all right.
DESMOND Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, listen, um, would you like to go for a coffee?
PENNY What, now? I'm a sweaty mess.
DESMOND I just fainted in front of you. I'd say we're even.
PENNY There's a coffee shop on the corner of Sweetzer and Melrose. I'll meet you there in an hour.
DESMOND Absolutely.
PENNY Okay.
DESMOND Okay.
GEORGE So, did you find what you were looking for?
DESMOND Yes, George, I did. Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer, please.
GEORGE You got it. And if there is anything else I can do for you, Mr. Hume, you just name it.
DESMOND Actually, there is one thing, George. Can you get me the manifest for my flight from Sydney, Oceanic 815, just the names of the passengers?
GEORGE Sure I can. Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?
DESMOND I just need to show them something...
