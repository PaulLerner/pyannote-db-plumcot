MICHAEL What are you doing?
WALT Watching TV.
MICHAEL Oh, man, do you see what time it is? Go back to sleep, Walt.
WALT I always watch this show.
MICHAEL Okay, then, can you at least turn it down a little.
MICHAEL I said turn it down, Walt.
WALT Brian lets me watch it as loud as I want.
MICHAEL I'm not Brian.
WALT Let's go, Vincent.
MICHAEL Hey, where do you think you're going? Hey, Walt.
WALT Get away from me! Leave me alone!
MICHAEL Don't even - don't you think about it.
WALT I said get away from me!
MICHAEL Don't you walk away from me.
MICHAEL Look, I don't think so. Come on.
WALT Get off of me!
MICHAEL I don't like this either, but you're getting on that plane.
WALT No, I'm not!
STEVE What's going on?
MICHAEL It's okay, I'm his father.
WALT No, you're not. You're not my father! You're not my father!
WALT Dad! Dad, wake up!
MICHAEL What? What?
WALT Somebody's here.
MICHAEL Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop, slow, slow down. Stay right there. Who is that?
SAWYER She's got to be the French chick.
SAYID Calm down everyone. It's alright.
SAYID Danielle? Danielle? What are you doing here?
DANIELLE The Others are coming.
DANIELLE Our ship went aground on this Island 16 years ago. There were 6 of us -- my team, 6. At that time I was already 7 months pregnant. I delivered the infant myself. The baby and I were together for only 1 week when I saw black smoke -- a pillar of black smoke 5 kilometers inland. That night they came, they came and took her -- Alex. They took my baby. And now, they're coming again. They're coming for all of you.
JACK Who's coming?
DANIELLE The Others. You have only 3 choices run, hide, or die.
JACK This is a woman who blew up her own shelter. And now she's talking about seeing black smoke and hearing whispers. I mean, she's not playing with a full deck.
LOCKE That doesn't mean that what she's saying isn't true.
JACK Well, if you want to focus on the "what if,", be my guest, but I've got to stick with what's tangible. And right now, that's the launching of the raft.
JACK How's it going?
MICHAEL I wanted to get off today, but, realistically, man, after we get the rudder done, we've still got to lay the rails to get it down to the water.
JIN Good.
JACK Wouldn't it save time if we were laying the rails while you were finishing the rudder?
MICHAEL Manpower shortage.
JACK What do you need to lay the rails and then move the boat?
MICHAEL To get it all done today? Pretty much everybody.
JACK Alright, give me 20 minutes.
JACK Grab as many palm tree logs as you can find, the longer the better. Take them over to the raft area and Michael will know what to do with them.
REDSHIRT Okay.
MICHAEL You need to get them in there tight. You need leverage to get them on the rails. Good, that's good. Okay, that's good man. Just get it under there, okay? Okay. You alright?
LOCKE Yep.
MICHAEL So, listen, on my count - I'll do 1-2-3—lift and then push, okay? Got it? Okay, c'mon. Once we get it down to the water line, we'll drop it and load it up. Alright. Ready. 1-2-3! Lift!
MICHAEL Push! Push, c'mon guys, push, push! Use the levers, use the levers! Good, good. 1-2-3, lift!
MICHAEL I can't believe this Can't believe it.
SAWYER What are you looking at me for?! It's not my fault!
MICHAEL You missed a lever!
SAWYER Because you couldn't keep the raft going straight!
MICHAEL I couldn't keep the boat going straight? Everybody's attention-
WALT Dad! Look.
JACK How many of them are there?
DANIELLE I told you all I know.
SAYID There has to be more you tell us. How did you know?
DANIELLE You have a bigger problem. I can vanish into the jungle, but I'm just one person. You have 40 people. Where will you hide them?
HURLEY Dude. Whoa.
DANIELLE What is this?
JACK We were hoping you could tell us.
DANIELLE I have never seen anything like it.
HURLEY Uh, question -- how do we know we can all, like, fit in there?
LOCKE No handle on the outside, means there must be another way in. Another entrance means space.
SAYID This is a mistake. We don't know anything about these Others. We're reacting with no information, no intelligence. This hatch might even be theirs. Black smoke on the horizon doesn't mean they're-
DANIELLE It means they're coming!
JACK Yeah, we got that.
LOCKE You booby-trapped your shelter with explosives. You have any more?
DANIELLE Dynamite, at the Black Rock, in the dark territory.
HURLEY Well, that's 3 reasons to go right there.
DANIELLE If we're to make it back by sunset we have to leave within the hour.
ANA LUCIA Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon. Why were you yelling? -- The girl, at the check-in counter? You were yelling at her.
JACK I'm sorry, uh, do I know you?
ANA LUCIA I'm on your flight. LA? So your dad died, huh?
JACK I thought you didn't hear what I was yelling about.
ANA LUCIA I was being polite.
JACK Yeah. My dad died.
ANA LUCIA How?
JACK A heart attack.
ANA LUCIA Not a drinker, huh?
JACK No, no, not really.
ANA LUCIA No ring because you're single or because you don't like wearing one?
JACK You asking me if I'm married?
ANA LUCIA Are you married?
JACK No. No, not any more. Can we get another tequila and tonic, please?
ANA LUCIA I didn't think you were listening.
JACK So, what's your name?
ANA LUCIA Ana Lucia.
JACK So, tell me, Ana Lucia, why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon?
ANA LUCIA I hate flying. And they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane where the wheels come down right under your damn feet. So where are you sitting?
JACK 23B.
ANA LUCIA 42F. Wanna trade? Hey, yeah. I'm in Sydney. Hold on. Sorry...
JACK Jack.
ANA LUCIA Jack, I've got to talk. We'll have the next drink on the plane, okay?
JACK 42F.
ANA LUCIA 42F, right. And Jack, the worst part's over.
JACK Look, I know you're all scared. And I know everybody has a lot of questions. All I can tell you right now is that we do have a plan. We've got to go into the jungle to get some supplies. We'll be back in a few hours. In the meantime, do everything you can to help Michael get that raft on the water. And after that, go to the caves. We'll be back as soon as we can. I promise.
ARZT Hey, nice speech. Plan's a little flawed, but, hey, nobody's perfect.
JACK What plan?
ARZT Yeah, your plan. You're going to go into the jungle and get some dynamite and blow open a hatch and then you're going to hide everyone inside. You want to keep a secret, don't tell the fat guy.
JACK What do you want, Arzt?
ARZT God knows how long that dynamite has been out there. And from what I can tell, Madam Nutso doesn't seem too concerned with how to handle it. So, unless you want to blow up, I'm coming with you.
JACK Okay. Grab some water bottles. We're leaving in half an hour.
MICHAEL We can salvage the cable but we need new bamboo for the mast.
JIN 이거, 어떻게 다시 얹어 놓지?
MICHAEL We need to fix the rudder before we even start to think about that.
JIN 올리다가 방향키가 부러지면 어떡해?
SAWYER Need some help?
MICHAEL Let's just get this done first.
SAWYER Hey, this wasn't my fault. So put me to work.
MICHAEL No offense, we just work faster this way, okay.
JIN 다 끝나셨어요? 일 좀 할까요?
MICHAEL Alright, alright. What do you think I'm doing over here?
CALDERWOOD You remember me? 3 nights ago? You were hauled in here thrashing and fighting. As you were being escorted by you kicked my desk. And you broke my mug. 
SAWYER Nice kids.
CALDERWOOD Sadly for you, breaking my mug was not the most significant mistake you made that evening.
SAWYER C'mon, Doctor, I got into a bar fight. Isn't that a badge of honor in this country?
CALDERWOOD Do you know who you head-butted in that bar? You head-butted the Honorable Warren Truss, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. One of the most important pe-
SAWYER He head-butted me.
CALDERWOOD We have witnesses he did no such thing.
SAWYER Of course.
CALDERWOOD You think this is funny, James? James Ford, assault, wire fraud, identity theft, bank fraud, telemarketing fraud...
SAWYER This going some place?
CALDERWOOD You're a blight, a stain, a scavenger. You're a conman who prays on the weak and the needy. Tell me something, James, how do you live with yourself?
SAWYER I do just fine.
CALDERWOOD Do you? You're not even worth what it would cost us to incarcerate you. Which is why you're being deported. Your plane leaves this afternoon. And, James, you're banned from ever setting foot in Australia again.
SAWYER Don't you worry, I ain't ever coming back here.
CALDERWOOD Best not, mate.
JACK A lumberjack.
SAWYER Excuse me?
JACK I never asked you what you did back in the real world, so, I'm taking a wild guess -- lumberjack.
SAWYER Something I can help you with, Doc, because I've got work to do.
JACK I've got something for you. You're the only one on the raft who knows how to use one.
SAWYER What do I need a gun for?
JACK Just in case.
SAWYER You think we're going to run out of food or water? Am I supposed to put the kid out of his misery?
JACK Just in case.
SAWYER What are you doing with the rest of them?
JACK I'm giving them to Sayid.
SAWYER Going into the jungle after the boom sticks, huh?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER By the time you get back, we'll be in the water. Guess this is pretty much goodbye, then.
JACK Yeah, I guess it is. Good luck, Sawyer.
SAWYER Jack. -- About a week before we all got on the plane, I got to talking to this man in a bar in Sydney. He was American, too. A doctor. I've been on some benders in my time, but this guy -- he was going for an all time record. So, it turns out this guy has a son. His son's a doctor, too. They had some kind of big time falling out. The guy knew it was his fault, even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing. See, kids are like dogs, you knock them around enough they'll think they did something to deserve it. Anyway, there's a pay phone in this bar. And this guy, Christian, tells me he wishes he had the stones to pick up the phone, call his kid, tell him he's sorry, that he's a better doctor than he'll ever be -- he's proud, and he loves him. I had to take off, but -- something tells me he never got around to making that call. Small world, huh?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER Good luck, Jack.
AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL You going to be armed?
MARSHAL Yes, sir, ankle holster.
AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL You have to stow this in the crew luggage compartment in the front.
MARSHAL No problemo.
AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL Why do you need 5 guns?
MARSHAL Gee, you want to tell him, Kate? Why do I need 5 guns? She's shy.
AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL What's this, then?
MARSHAL That's a good story, you want to tell it, huh, Kate? This belonged to her childhood sweetheart who she got killed a couple of years ago when she was on the run. Poor guy -- a wife, a 2 year old kid. What was his name? Hmm? Well, somewhere along the way during the 3 years that I was chasing her, she starts calling me, at my house, and whining on about her mitigating circumstances. But what she's really doing is taunting me. So, I tell her that I've got whats-his-name's little toy airplane in a safe deposit box in New Mexico. So, she somehow figures out which bank, which safe deposit box. She seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank, and then she puts a bullet in her new friend because she's done using him. But she leaves all the money. She just takes the plane because that's the one thing in the whole world that Kate does care about. She has no attachments, and I think she's telling herself she needs it to atone for killing her boyfriend, whats-his-name. God, Kate, c'mon, what was his name?
KATE Tom, it's Tom, you son-of-a-bitch!
MARSHAL And that is why I need 5 guns.
KATE So, you're heading out?
JACK Yeah.
KATE I was thinking that I might go with you -- for old time's sake? I want to help.
JACK You won't be here for the raft launching.
KATE Yeah, well, I'm -- I'm not very good at goodbyes.
JACK Grab your stuff.
CHARLIE Thanks, man, I'll keep it safe. Hey, Locke, do you have a message? It's going on the raft. You know "Dear mom, Everything's fine. I'm on the Island, unless, of course, the black smoke people turn up. Love, your name here." For when they get rescued—they can contact your family.
LOCKE Message in a bottle. That's sweet. 
CHARLIE You ready?
HURLEY Here you go.
CHARLIE Okay.
HURLEY Don't look at it.
CHARLIE You got it. 
HURLEY Dude! Do not look at it.
CHARLIE Arzt, do you want paper?
ARZT I gave at the office.
CHARLIE Okay.
MICHAEL Careful.
HURLEY Good luck, dude. Keep dry, kiddo.
WALT I will.
MICHAEL Hey, good luck.
JACK Same to you.
MICHAEL See you soon.
JACK Yes, you will. Hey, guy, look after your dad, okay.
WALT I will.
JACK Alright. Jin. Good luck.
JIN 조심해요.
KATE Hey, have -- have you seen Sawyer?
CHARLIE No.
JACK Alright, let's go.
CHARLIE Take care, okay.
LOCKE Where'd you get the scratches?
DANIELLE A bush.
LOCKE Mean bush.
DANIELLE We've got to keep moving.
HURLEY Let me ask you something, Arnzt.
ARZT Arzt.
HURLEY Arnzt.
ARZT No, not Arnzt, Arzt. A-R-Z-T, Arzt.
HURLEY Sorry, man, the name's hard to pronounce.
ARZT Yeah, well, I know a bunch of 9th graders who pronounce it just fine.
HURLEY How about I just call you by your first name?
ARZT How about you don't?
HURLEY Why not? I remember it from the plane's manifest. I think Leslie's a bitchin' name.
ARZT Arnzt is fine.
DANIELLE Le Territoire Fonce.
JACK The Dark Territory.
DANIELLE The Black Rock is not far. This is where it all began -- where my team got infected, where Montand lost his arm. We must move quickly.
ARZT You know what? I'm going back.
JACK Hey, I thought you wanted to help.
ARZT Yeah, I wanted to help and that was before Montand lost his fricking arm.
JACK Well, what about the dynamite?
ARZT Just be very careful with it.
MICHAEL No, no, no! This one goes there! That one goes there!
JIN Okay, okay.
SAWYER Hey, Chief! Cut and measured to length -- perfect mast.
MICHAEL Thanks.
SAWYER Well, alright. Now, are we going to get off this rock or stand around talking about it?
KATE Did you hear that?
ARZT Run! Run! Run!
ARZT Run!
HURLEY What are you...
LOCKE Just be still.
DANIELLE Here, in here.
HURLEY Dude, we've got to book.
LOCKE Wait. It's headed the other way.
DANIELLE We're safe now.
KATE What was that thing?
DANIELLE It's a security system.
JACK Security system? What does that mean?
DANIELLE Its purpose is that of any security systems -- to protect something.
KATE Protect what?
DANIELLE The Island.
HURLEY Uh, where's Arnzt?
ARZT It's Arzt, you idiot.
HURLEY Dude, I thought you were dead.
ARZT Can we just, please, go get the dynamite, please?
WALT Why are you folding the clothes?
SHANNON Because I'm anal. Is there something you want?
WALT I think you should take Vincent.
SHANNON Are you serious?
WALT He'll take care of you.
SHANNON What makes you think I need a dog to take care of me?
WALT Vincent took care of me when my mom died -- and nobody would talk to me. They pretended like nothing happened. So I had to talk to Vincent. He's a good listener. You could talk to him about Boone if you want.
SHANNON Alright, but only until you get us rescued, okay.
AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT Flight 338 to Fiji will be delayed. Please check the board for flight details.
SAYID Excuse me, would you mind watching my bag for a moment? I'll be right back.
SHANNON Sure, whatever.
SAYID Thank you.
BOONE I couldn't get us into first class.
SHANNON Why not?
BOONE Um, maybe you shouldn't have yelled at the gate agent.
SHANNON What? You're on his side, now?
BOONE One day you're going to appreciate everything I do for you.
SHANNON Yeah, I can't wait for that day.
SHANNON You can try again with the gate agent.
BOONE Would you let it go?
SHANNON Excuse me for not being pathetic enough to not want to sit next to some crying baby for the next 15 hours.
BOONE Oh god, you can be a bitch.
SHANNON Oh, you want to play? I will get you thrown off this flight.
BOONE Yeah, how are you going to do that?
SHANNON I can do whatever I want. I could tell them...
BOONE Tell them what? Who's going to believe you? You're not even capable of...
SHANNON You have no idea what I'm capable of.
SHANNON Excuse me, sir?
AIRPORT COP Yes, ma'am.
SHANNON Hi, um, some Arab guy just left his bags in the chairs downstairs and then just walked away.
AIRPORT COP Can you describe him, please?
SHANNON Um, Arab? He went towards the shops. How's that?
SAYID I salvaged a few things for you from the Beechcraft. This is the plane's radar emitter. It needs to be mounted on the mast or the top of the cabin.
SAWYER I'll do it.
SAYID Michael, to conserve power, turn it on only once every hour or so. It will show you any ships within the horizon line, approximately 25 miles. The same with the radio transmitter. This was in the plane's toolbox. There's only one flare. Choose wisely when you use it.
LOCKE Why are we stopping?
DANIELLE Because we're here. This is the Black Rock.
JIN 왜 이렇게 오래 걸렸어? 배고파 죽겠는데. 
SUN 사람들이 너무 많아서. 먹을게 별로 없어서 그냥 간단한 걸로 사왔어요.  Here.
GINA If you ever catch me doing anything like that for you, shoot me.
JEFF Don't knock it. Their divorce rate's 20 times lower than ours.
SUN 여기요. 
JIN 아, 뜨거워!
SUN 어머, 어떡해! 어떡해, 미안해요. 뜨겁죠?
JIN 됐어, 됐어. 화장실... 
SUN 저기 있네요.
GINA My god, it's "Memoirs of a Geisha" come to life.
JEFF Hey, volume.
GINA Relax, they don't speak English.
SUN 진수씨. 이거요. 
JIN Star... star board.
SUN Starboard. 간단한 영어를 발음대로 적었어요. 당신한테 도움이 될 것 같아서 한번 만들어 봤어요. 
JIN 정말 미안하다... 
SUN 저도요. 당신이 꼭 갈 필요는 없잖아요. 
JIN 아직도 모르겠어? 난 지금 벌을 받고 있는 중이야. 나 때문에 얼마나 고생했는지 잘 알고 있어. 당신 같은 여자가 왜 이 고생을 해야돼? 
SUN 여보... 
JIN 아니, 내가 가야만 당신을 구할 수 있어. 잭이 지켜 줄 거야. 잭이랑 같이 있어. 
SUN 그럼 당신은... 당신은 누가 지켜줄 거에요? 
SUN 사랑해. 사랑해. 
JIN 정말 미안해. 
SUN 괜찮아요. 
MICHAEL Go, go, go!
WALT Bye Vincent, bye Vincent!
WALT Stay, Vincent! Go back, Vincent! Vincent, go back, go back!
MICHAEL What'd I say?
WALT We did it!
