martin_keamy Lapidus! You ready?
frank_lapidus I'll be up.
martin_keamy Don't be late, Frank.
frank_lapidus Regina?
regina Frank! I didn't hear you.
frank_lapidus Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you. Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub... you know your book's upside down.
frank_lapidus Just trying to help...
frank_lapidus Thought I'd check in on you guys and bring you some food. How are you feeling, by the way?
desmond_hume Yeah, much better, thanks.
sayid_jarrah Why are we being held captive? We had nothing to do with Minkowski's death.
frank_lapidus This has nothing to do with Minkowski. The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided to bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.
sayid_jarrah We didn't bust out. The door was left open! We assumed that was you.
frank_lapidus Why the hell would I do that?
sayid_jarrah Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?
frank_lapidus No luck. Something must have happened to the phone.
sayid_jarrah Lima beans?
frank_lapidus Sorry, we had a little problem in the kitchen. Just stay put, alright?
sayid_jarrah I still want to talk to the captain.
frank_lapidus No, you don't.
frank_lapidus Regina?
jinsoo_kwon 왜 그래? 괜찮아?
sunhwa_kwon 사이드하고 데스몬드가 떠난지 3일이나 지났는데 왜 아직 돌아오지 않는 걸까요?
jinsoo_kwon 아마 배를 타고 오느라 시간이 좀 걸리나봐.
jinsoo_kwon 자, 그 얘기 그만하고 더 중요한 게 하나 있어.
sunhwa_kwon 뭔데?
jinsoo_kwon Let's talk about baby names.
sunhwa_kwon Good. You're getting better... But no, Jin. 지금부터 아기 이름을 지으면 못 나가요.
jinsoo_kwon 웬 미신?
sunhwa_kwon 이 녀석한테 나쁜 일이 생기면 안 되지.
jinsoo_kwon 당신 말뜻은 우리 공주님.
sunhwa_kwon 어, 그러니까 당신은 딸일 것이다?
jinsoo_kwon 지연. 지연이라고 지을래.
sunhwa_kwon 아기 이름은 그만 얘기해요.
jinsoo_kwon 왜 지연이 마음에 안 들어?
sunhwa_kwon 아니, 이름은 예뻐요. 우리 이렇게 해요. 우선 이 섬에서 벗어난 다음에 그때 가서 아기 이름을 지어요.
jinsoo_kwon Deal!

sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨! 진수 씨!
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨, 케이트하고 잭이 돌아왔어요.
jinsoo_kwon What happened?
kate_austen You mean before or after the redhead knocked me out?
sunhwa_kwon She hit you?
kate_austen When I ran into them on my way back from Locke's camp.
sunhwa_kwon Why would she do that?
kate_austen I guess she didn't wanna have to explain why she was on her way to a poison gas factory. Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.
sunhwa_kwon Why would Juliet lie about that?
kate_austen Force of habit?
sunhwa_kwon Why were they going there?
kate_austen To turn it off, to deactivate the gas. I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.
sunhwa_kwon Do you think they're really going to rescue us?
kate_austen In all the time they've been here they've talked about a lot of things, and none involved rescuing us.
sayid_jarrah Good morning.
desmond_hume Good morning.
sayid_jarrah I hope they resolve their kitchen issues.
desmond_hume Sayid! What's that?
sayid_jarrah It's a note. Three days ago, when I was in Locke's camp, Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.
sunhwa_kwon Hello. My name is Sun.
dr_daniel_faraday Hi, Sun, hi... I'm Daniel. Something I can help you with?
sunhwa_kwon I'm two months pregnant.
dr_daniel_faraday Oh, you're... Wow, that's... Congratulations!
sunhwa_kwon So are you here to rescue us?
sunhwa_kwon It's a simple question. Are you or are you not going to rescue us?
dr_daniel_faraday The thing is... um, it's not really my call, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon And whose call is it?
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
jinsoo_kwon Uh, can you pass, uh, the cereal?
dr_jack_shephard Pretty good English, Jin.
jinsoo_kwon Thank you. I... understand better than I, uh, speak.
dr_jack_shephard Has Sun been teaching you, or are you just picking it up?
jinsoo_kwon Uh, Sun teach me... Uh, Sawyer, too. Sun, is... better.
dr_jack_shephard I bet.
dr_jack_shephard Hey Sun. How are you feeling?
sunhwa_kwon I'm good, thank you... The morning sickness has stopped, which has been nice.
dr_jack_shephard That's good... Well, if you need anything, just let me know, okay?
jinsoo_kwon Would you like some breakfast?
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨, 지금부터 이유는 묻지 말고 내가 시키는 대로만 해야 해요.
jinsoo_kwon 왜, 뭔데?
sunhwa_kwon 이틀 동안 우리 먹을 식량을 챙겨서 20분 후에 우리 텐트에서 봐요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐 때문에 그러는데? 무슨 일이 생겼어?
sunhwa_kwon 로크한테 가봐야겠어요.
dr_juliet_burke What are you doing?
sunhwa_kwon I needed another bottle of those vitamins you gave me, the... the pre-natals?
dr_juliet_burke You could've just asked.
sunhwa_kwon You're right. I should have.
dr_juliet_burke What happened to the last ones I gave you?
sunhwa_kwon Sorry?
dr_juliet_burke The last bottle I gave you. There should be 20 left... are you planning a trip?
sunhwa_kwon Please, just give me the vitamins.
dr_juliet_burke Where are you going, Sun?
sunhwa_kwon We're going to Locke's camp.
dr_juliet_burke What? Why?
sunhwa_kwon Because I don't trust these people.
dr_juliet_burke Whether you trust them or not, you can't go there. Locke doesn't want to leave the island, and I've told you... Sun, pregnant women... they don't survive here.
sunhwa_kwon Yes, you did tell me that.
dr_juliet_burke You don't believe me... Look, I know that I have been less than truthful about certain things since coming here, but I promise you, Sun... I promise you, I'm not lying about this. After everything you've confided in me, I should at least have your trust.
sunhwa_kwon Claire's baby is fine. I feel fine. All I have are your stories that I'm going to get sick. I'm going to do what's best for me and for my baby, because, no... I don't trust you.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 1 곧 괜찮으실 겁니다.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 2 맞지?
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 1 맞아, 오세아닉 6.

NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 1 귀금속 빼셔야 합니다. 혈압이 높아서 몸이 많이 부었어요.
sunhwa_kwon 안돼요, 내 반지는 안돼요!
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 1 별일 없으니 안심하세요.

sunhwa_kwon 박 선생님은요? 저 왜 이러는 거예요?

kate_austen Once you hit the stream, you want to head northwest, pretty much in a straight line for about a day and a half.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
kate_austen I'm gonna have to tell Jack. But I'll give you guys a nice, long headstart.
sunhwa_kwon I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.
kate_austen No, he wouldn't.
kate_austen You'd better get going. Be safe okay?
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke She's not going anywhere. Sun, this is a bad idea.
sunhwa_kwon What concern is it of yours?
dr_juliet_burke Do you understand your wife's medical condition right now? Translate for me.
sunhwa_kwon No.
dr_juliet_burke Your wife is very sick. If she doesn't get off this island in three weeks, she will die.
sunhwa_kwon 신경쓰지 말아요, 어서 가요.
dr_juliet_burke If you let her go, your wife is in danger. Jin... Danger.
jinsoo_kwon Wherever Sun go, I go.
dr_juliet_burke Sun! Please.
dr_juliet_burke Jin. Your wife had an affair.
jinsoo_kwon What?
dr_juliet_burke Sun was with another man. She thought the baby was his.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨...
sunhwa_kwon 진수씨, 진수씨... 나랑 얘기 좀 해요. 내가 다 설명할게. 그건 오래 전 일이었어요. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 다신 이러는 거 이해해. 입이 열 개라도 나 할말이 없어. 그래도 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요.
sunhwa_kwon 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요. 진수 씨...
bernard_nadler Hey! You going fishing?
bernard_nadler Uh, you mind if I... tag along?
bernard_nadler Oh... Oh, I am sorry. I—I didn't mean to interrupt.
jinsoo_kwon No. Come.
bernard_nadler You're sure?
jinsoo_kwon Yes... come.
bernard_nadler You realize we're the only two married guys on the island?
bernard_nadler Married?
jinsoo_kwon Married.
bernard_nadler Yeah, well, no, not to each other. No. You got it. It's not easy, is it? Oh, I mean, it's—it's wonderful, but... let's face it, every decision that you make takes twice as long. 'Cause you always gotta talk them into it. Rose... has cancer. She's sick. Dying. Well, at least, she 'was' dying. She says she's better now. She says it's this place... the island. But when the camp split up, I was sure that she'd want to go with Locke. Why would she want to leave the island, and risk getting sick again?
jinsoo_kwon Then why do you stay with Jack?
bernard_nadler Because it was the right thing to do. Locke... he's a murderer. See, it's all about karma, Jin. Do you know karma?
bernard_nadler You make bad choices, bad things happen to you. But you make good choices, and then good—
bernard_nadler Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You got one! Yeah. Here, pull it in.
bernard_nadler Wow, look at that! You see? Now, that's karma. We must be the good guys, huh?
desmond_hume How long's that gonna go on for, eh? Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?
sayid_jarrah That sound is not mechanical.
desmond_hume What, you think somebody's doing that? Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?
sayid_jarrah That's exactly what I think.
ray Gentlemen, thanks for your patience. The captain would like to see you now.
sayid_jarrah Where's the helicopter?
ray Lapidus is running an errand.
sayid_jarrah What kind of errand?
ray I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.
sayid_jarrah Did he go to the island?
ray You know anywhere else he could land?
sayid_jarrah What's he going to do there?
ray I said I'm just a doctor.
sayid_jarrah What did Lapidus say?
ray He didn't say anything to me.
sayid_jarrah What is he doing there?!
desmond_hume Hey! Hey!
desmond_hume That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!
desmond_hume Don't just stand there! What's the matter with you people?!
sayid_jarrah What's wrong with you? Get the rope!
desmond_hume Why aren't you doing anything?!
desmond_hume Bring a rope!
sayid_jarrah Get a rope!
desmond_hume and SAYID Get a rope!
captain_gault Stop!
desmond_hume She just jumped!
captain_gault It's over! She's gone! Everybody get back to your posts. That was an order.
captain_gault I'm Captain Gault. I suppose you two have a few questions.
captain_gault So what can I do for you?
sayid_jarrah What?
captain_gault You boys said you wanted to speak with me.
sayid_jarrah Let's just start with why a woman jumped over the side of your ship, and you did nothing to stop it.
captain_gault I didn't jump in, or order my crew to jump in, because I didn't want to lose any more people.
desmond_hume What exactly is going on here?
captain_gault Some of my crew has been dealing with... what might best be described as a heightened case of cabin fever. I think it's got something to do with the close proximity of the island.
sayid_jarrah Why don't you turn around, then?
captain_gault I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board, and he's done one hell of a job on my engines. I've got my crew working around the clock to repair them.
sayid_jarrah And then you'll take our people home?
captain_gault Then we move to safer waters... those are my orders.
sayid_jarrah And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?
captain_gault Sure, I will. Charles Widmore.
desmond_hume This is Charles Widmore's boat?
captain_gault That's right. You know him.
captain_gault Do either of you know what this is?
sayid_jarrah It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.
captain_gault That's exactly what it is. Now here's the funny thing. This black box comes from Oceanic Flight 815. A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean. It took a considerable amount of Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it. It was found with the wreckage of the plane, along with all 324 dead passengers. That's not the complete story, as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah, given the fact that you're standing here, breathing... the wreckage was obviously staged. Now, can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude? Faking the recovery of a plane crash? Putting 324 families through a grieving process based on a lie? But what's even more disturbing... where exactly does one come across 324 dead bodies? And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume, is just one of the many reasons we want Benjamin Linus.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry. I had to stop you any way I could.
sunhwa_kwon It wasn't your place to stop us.
dr_juliet_burke I know you don't trust me, but you need to get off this island. We all do.
sunhwa_kwon You want to leave?
dr_juliet_burke More than anything. I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not, but it's something. I need to go home. So do you. Sun... in about three weeks, you'll be in an almost constant state of nausea. A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath that won't go away. A week after that, you will lose consciousness and slip into a coma. And then, Sun, you will die. And when your heart stops beating... so will the baby's. And that, Sun, is why it is my business, because you are my patient. If you go... you will die. And your baby will never be born.
dr_bae BAE 선화 씨! 제왕절개를 해야할 것 같습니다.
sunhwa_kwon 안돼요, 그건 안돼요.
dr_bae BAE 잘 모르는 것 같으신데, 저희가 놓아드린 진통제 때문에 자연분만은 아주 힘들 거 같습니다.
sunhwa_kwon 안돼요, 남편이, 내 남편이 올 때까지 안돼...
dr_bae BAE 바로 수술하셔야 합니다.
sunhwa_kwon 내 남편 어디 있어요?
dr_bae BAE 아직 안 오셨습니다. 더 이상 기다릴 수가 없어요.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨! 진수 씨!
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 1 선생님, 아이가 보이기 시작했어요!
dr_bae BAE 자, 선화 씨. 이제부터 힘을 주셔야 합니다. 거의 다 왔습니다. 조금만 더 미세요! 미세요! 할 수 있습니다! 네, 조금만 더 미세요!
dr_bae BAE 잘 하셨습니다.
dr_bae BAE 축하드립니다. 따님을 출산하셨습니다.
ray So what do you think of the captain?
sayid_jarrah He was surprisingly forthcoming.
ray Yeah, he tells it like it is. Just don't piss him off. You know what I mean? I think you'll like your room. It's on a quiet part of the ship.
desmond_hume This... ship isn't moving.
ray Well, if you say so.
ray That shouldn't still be there... Damn it!
ray Hey, Johnson. Is that you? Johnson!
JOHNSON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 Yeah.
ray Mop this up.
JOHNSON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 Sorry, I gotta go up on deck.
ray No, you're gonna mop this up!
ray Kevin, this is, uh...
sayid_jarrah Sayid.
desmond_hume Desmond.
JOHNSON#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 Kevin Johnson.
sayid_jarrah Nice to meet you Kevin.
jinsoo_kwon I made... dinner.
sunhwa_kwon 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어요. 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요.
jinsoo_kwon 상관 없어.
sunhwa_kwon 당신도 내 말을...
jinsoo_kwon 당신이 왜 그랬는지 난 알고 있어. 그리고 내가 어떤 남자였는지도... 잘 알아. 이 섬에 오기 전에... 내가 당신에게 냉정하게 대하고 당신보다는 일을 선택한 나였어. 하여튼... 이 모든 것들이 다 나 때문이야. 그거 잘 알아. 그래서... 내가 당신을... 용서해.
jinsoo_kwon 자, 로크한테 당신하고 같이 갈거야.
sunhwa_kwon 더 이상 그 곳에 가고 싶지 않아요.
jinsoo_kwon 왜?
sunhwa_kwon 줄리엣 말이 맞았어요. 무슨 일이 있어도 우린 이 섬에 떠나가야 해요. 저 사람들은 헬리콥터도 있고 배도 있어요. 우리도 방법을 찾아봐요.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 일이 있어도 당신과 우리 아이를 지켜줄 거야. 맹세할께.
sunhwa_kwon 고마워요.
jinsoo_kwon 나한테 한 가지만... 솔직히 말해줄래?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐든지.
jinsoo_kwon Is... the baby... mine?
sunhwa_kwon 네, 진수씨. 하늘에 맹세코 당신 아이 맞아요. 정말이예요. 자기 너무 사랑해요.
sunhwa_kwon 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어.
jinsoo_kwon 나도 사랑해. 나 당신과 절대 헤어지지 않을 거야.
jinsoo_kwon 안녕하십니까. 백 자동차사의 회장님이 보내서 온 권진수라고 합니다.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 IN SUIT 예?
jinsoo_kwon 대사님이 오늘 손주를 보셨다고 하셔서 선물을 전해드리러 왔습니다.

NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 어, 벌써 가세요?
jinsoo_kwon 제 아이도 아닌데, 뭐.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode07 언젠가는 좋은 날이 오겠죠.
jinsoo_kwon 시간이 충분히 있어요. 이제 결혼한 지 두달 밖에 안 됐거든요.
sunhwa_kwon I can't believe you came all this way.
hugo_reyes Are you kidding? Is anyone else coming?
sunhwa_kwon No.
hugo_reyes Good. So... where is she?
hugo_reyes She's awesome.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
sunhwa_kwon Would you like to hold her?
hugo_reyes I don't know, I... kinda have two left hands.
sunhwa_kwon I trust you.
hugo_reyes Wow... she looks just like Jin.
sunhwa_kwon Yes. She does.
hugo_reyes So... I guess we should, like, go see him.
sunhwa_kwon Of course.
sunhwa_kwon 여보... 여보 말이 맞았어요. 딸이예요. 나 정말 견디기 힘들었어요. 의사 선생님 말로는... 나 계속 당신만 찾았대. 당신이 옆에 있었으면 참 좋았을텐데... 진수 씨, 우리 딸 예쁘죠? 아기 이름은... 당신이 원하는 대로 지연이라고 지었어요. 자기 너무 보고 싶어. 너무 보고 싶어.
