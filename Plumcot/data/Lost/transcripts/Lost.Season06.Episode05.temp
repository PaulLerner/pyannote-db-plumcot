JACK Hey mom.
MRS SHEPARD Have they found him yet?
JACK No, I... I called a couple of hours ago, and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.
MRS SHEPARD How do you lose a body?
JACK I don't know mom, but there's nothing we can do except for wait for more information.
MRS SHEPARD I don't want to wait Jack, how am I supposed to get anything done. I can't even find his will. Papers everywhere!
JACK Look mom, I'll come over in a couple of hours an we'll find it together, okay?
MRS SHEPARD Okay.
JACK Good. Now, mom, when did I have my appendix taken out?
MRS SHEPARD You were seven, or eight, maybe. You collapsed at school. Your father wanted to do the procedure himself, but they wouldn't let him. You don't remember that?
JACK Yeah, I... I guess I do.
JACK Oh, dammit. Mom, I gotta go.
MRS SHEPARD Well don't forget to call--
JACK Hey. Sorry I'm late. Thought I had enough time to go home and change after work.
DAVID Don't worry about it.
JACK Sorry David, okay.
DAVID Okay, Dad.
DOGEN I was afraid you'd left.
JACK Is leaving an option?
DOGEN Everything is an option. But I would have to stop you.
JACK Well...I appreciate your honesty.
DOGEN Your friends - Ford and Austen and Kwon - they are not coming back, are they?
JACK No, probably not.
DOGEN I appreciate your honesty. 
HURLEY Tie again, Dude.
MILES Shocker. That's it for me.
HURLEY Hungry?
MILES Are you?
HURLEY I could eat.
HURLEY Hey man, you know if there's like a kitchen in this place?
MAN It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.
HURLEY Dude, what are you doing here ?
JACOB I'm here because I need you.
HURLEY For what?
JACOB You should probably get a pen, you're going to have to write a few things down.
HURLEY What kind of things?
JACOB Someone's coming to the island. I need you to help them find it.
JACK Hooked up the cable in here, so you can watch the Red Sox if you want.
DAVID Thanks.
JACK You reading this?
DAVID Yeah.
JACK I used to read this to you when you were little. You always wanted to hear about Kitty and Snowdrop, they were Alice's...
JACK Hey. Hey! David. 
JACK What are you listening to?
DAVID You haven't heard of them.
JACK I'm just trying to have a conversation with you David.
DAVID Why? We see each other like once a month. Can't we just... get through it.
JACK Yeah mom?
MARGO Where are you? I thought you were coming over?
JACK I'm sorry. I'm heading out right now. I'll be right there. 
JACK I have to go over to your grandmother's house, you wanna come?
DAVID No thanks.
JACK All right well, I'll be back in about an hour, then we'll eat, OK?
DAVID Great.
SAYID Jack.
JACK Sayid.
SAYID Why are they all staring at me? 
JACK Just ignore them.
SAYID Look, you told me these people think I have an infection, that they wanted to give me some mysterious pill that you instructed me not to take. And then you disappeared. What are you hiding from me?
JACK The pill was poison. They wanted me to kill you. Whatever it is they think happened to you Sayid, they say it happened to someone else too.
SAYID Who?
JIN Claire!
CLAIRE I'm gonna get you out of there.
JIN How long have you been out here?
CLAIRE Since you all left. How long ago was that?
JIN Three years.
CLAIRE I can get you somewhere safe. Come on - think you can walk?
JIN I don't know.
DOGEN What are you doing?
HURLEY Nothing. I'm just you know...looking...because I'm a fan of ...temples and like history...Indiana Jones stuff.
DOGEN You shouldn't be here. Go back to the courtyard.
JACOB Tell him you can do what you want. Tell him you're a candidate.
HURLEY I'm a candidate and I can do what I want.
DOGEN Who told you that? 
HURLEY Doesn't matter. Why don't you go back to the courtyard ?
DOGEN Ore ga omae wo mamoraneba narannowa,un ga yokattana Denakereba sonokubi wo haneteta 
HURLEY What'd he say?
JACOB You don't want to know. What are you doing here Hugo?
HURLEY Going through the secret passageway like you told me.
JACOB I told you to bring Jack with you.
HURLEY You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's like impossible. I can just go myself.
JACOB You have to bring him with you Hugo.
HURLEY OK it's bad enough you already made me write down way too much stuff, and I just lied to a Samurai. Look, if you've any idea of how to get Jack to go on your little adventure, I'm listening dude.
HURLEY Be cool man. Act natural.
JACK What?
HURLEY Dude, keep your voice down. I'm gonna get up and go. Wait ten seconds and then follow me.
JACK Follow you where?
HURLEY I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.
JACK You found a secret tunnel?
HURLEY Well, Jacob told me about it. Said you and me have to go.
JACK I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.
HURLEY I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you "You have what it takes."
JACK What'd you just say?
HURLEY He said you have what it takes, he said you'd know what that meant.
JACK Where is he?
HURLEY What?
JACK Jacob. Where is he?
HURLEY He's kind of dead. Turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi. But...if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude.
JACK Well then let's go see Jacob.
JIN Claire?
CLAIRE Get in there!
CLAIRE So, look what I found! One of the men who tried to kill you! He was just pretending to be dead but he wasn't. Now we get to talk to him!
JUSTIN You wanna talk to me about what?
CLAIRE About where you're hiding my son.
CLAIRE We'd better get that cleaned up. If there's one thing that'll kill you around here it's infection.
CLAIRE I'll be right back, don't move, okay? 
JIN Claire?
JIN Have you been out here all this time...by yourself?
CLAIRE Oh, no, no, I'm not by myself.
JUSTIN Look, we've gotta get out of here now.
JIN It's okay. I know her.
JUSTIN No. I know her. Do you have any idea what she's gonna do to us...if we don't get outta here now?! She's gonna kill us both!
JACK Which way?
HURLEY It's this way.
JACK Whoa! Hey, it's me!
KATE Jack! I almost shot you!
JACK I noticed! What are you doing out here? Where...where's Jin and Sawyer?
KATE Jin went back to the Temple, and... Sawyer's on his own.
HURLEY Hey, Kate. There's a secret door to get back into the Temple on the north wall by the big tree...
KATE Yeah, I'm not going back to the Temple. I'm going to find Claire.
JACK Kate...
KATE I'm going back to the beach camp. She might still be there, Jack.
JACK Kate, she's not at the beach... The people at the Temple said that something happened to her.
KATE Do they know where she is?
JACK I don't know, they didn't say.
KATE I have to...I have to find her.
JACK Kate...wait...wait! Come with us and then we'll all go back to the Temple together.
HURLEY Dude! Jacob said just you and me...she's kinda not invited.
JACK Well, I'm inviting her.
KATE Jack, it's okay. Just go. It's alright. I hope you find what you're looking for. .
MARGO We're never going to find it.
JACK Take it easy, Mom. It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.
MARGO It's like a needle in a damned haystack. Why your father wouldn't just give his will to his lawyer is beyond me.
JACK Well, why would he make it easy on us now?
MARGO You want a drink? 
JACK Uh...no, no, no thanks.
MARGO Good for you.
MARGO How's David holding up?
JACK What?
MARGO He was really upset at the funeral.
JACK He was?
MARGO He didn't tell you?
JACK No...no, he didn't. Communication is not one of his strong suits.
MARGO Well, it runs in the family. When you were David's age your father was lucky if he could get more than one word out of you at a time.
JACK That's because I was terrified of him, Mom.
MARGO How do you know David isn't terrified of you?
JACK Why would he be?
MARGO I don't know, Jack. Maybe you should ask him.
MARGO Found it. Last will and testament.
MARGO Jack?
JACK Yeah?
MARGO Did your father ever mention a Claire Littleton?
JUSTIN Psst! Hey! Untie me before she comes back in!
JIN Why would I do that?
JUSTIN Are you not listening to me? She's gonna kill us both! Loosen my ropes, and when she comes back in, I'll snap her neck.
CLAIRE So, I'm...really sorry you got stuck in my trap. Gonna get you all cleaned up, now, okay?
CLAIRE It's alright, you're doing good. Well. at least you don't have to stitch yourself up. . I had to do that once. They shot me right here .
JIN You've been living here since we left? 
CLAIRE Not always here. I had to, um, move around quite a lot. To hide from them.
CLAIRE Lucky I'm still alive.
JIN What are you going to do with him?
CLAIRE He's gonna tell me where they've got my baby. Where they...where they've got Aaron.
JUSTIN We don't have your kid!
CLAIRE You're lying, okay, I know you have him.
JUSTIN You're crazy! We never took your...
CLAIRE Shut up.
JIN Claire, how do you know they took him? How can you be so sure?
CLAIRE How can I be so sure? Well, first my father told me, and then my friend told me, so I'm pretty damn sure.
JIN Your friend? Who's your friend?
CLAIRE My friend. You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?
JIN Yes, yes, of course.
CLAIRE Good. I'm glad. All done. Good as new.
CLAIRE Okay. So. Now it's your turn.
HURLEY Sorry, dude.
JACK For what?
HURLEY You know, what happened back there. Wrecking your game with Kate.
JACK Don't worry about it. There's nothing left to wreck.
HURLEY Yeah? What happened to you guys? I thought you were gonna get married and have like a dozen kids.
JACK Guess I wasn't cut out for it.
HURLEY Really? I think you'd make a great dad.
JACK I'd make a terrible dad.
HURLEY What is that?
JACK Asthma inhaler.
HURLEY Dude, it's Shannon's.
JACK We're at the caves.
HURLEY The caves we used to live in?
HURLEY I totally forgot these were in here, man.
HURLEY Wait a sec. What if we time-travelled again? To, like, dinosaur times? And then we died and then we got buried here? What if these skeletons are us?
HURLEY What's that?
JACK Did I tell you how I found this place?
HURLEY You were looking for water, right?
JACK No. I was chasing the ghost of my dead father. He led me here. That was his coffin. Before I smashed it to pieces.
HURLEY Why'd you do that?
JACK Because he wasn't in it.
JACK David? I got us pizza!
JACK Hey, dinner's...
DAVID This is David. Leave a message. 
JACK David, i-it's me again. Listen...uh....if I did something to upset you I am really, really sorry. I'm gonna drive over to your mother's house, I know that she's out of town, so if you are there, just...just don't go anywhere, okay? What...whatever I did, I'm sorry.
JACK David?
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE "Ahhh yes this message is for David Shepard. Hi David this is Dr. Summerland from the Williams Conservatory, just calling to confirm you slot next Friday the 24th at 7 pm. We look forward to seeing you, and good luck." 
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE Hey David, it's dad. I'm uh..., I'm in Sydney, Australia. Something...something happened...and I... I just needed to hear your voice. Ummm...I guess I'll try again later. I love you.
HURLEY This is cool, dude. Very old school.
JACK What?
HURLEY You know, you and me trekking through the jungle, on our way to do something that we don't quite understand. Good times. You mind if I ask you something?
JACK Sure.
HURLEY Why'd you come back, you know, to the island?
JACK Why'd you come back?
HURLEY Back in L.A., Jacob hopped into the back of my cab, and told me I was supposed to, so I came.
HURLEY What? If you have a good reason for coming back, let's hear it man.
JACK I came back here because I was broken. And I was stupid enough to think this place could fix me.
HURLEY Dude, I'm sorry.
JACK How much further we got, Hurley?
HURLEY It's not far. It's not far at all.
HURLEY It's right there. It's a lighthouse.
JACK I don't understand. How is it that we've never seen it before?
HURLEY Guess we weren't lookin for it.
CLAIRE Tell me where my son is.
JUSTIN I don't know where your son is.
CLAIRE Stop covering for them. They're not going to help you anymore. All you gotta do is just tell me the truth.
JUSTIN I am telling you the truth. We don't have your kid. We never had your kid.
CLAIRE Stop lying to me! Your people took me to the temple and tortured me.
JUSTIN No, we captured you because you were out here in the jungle picking our people off.
JIN Claire wait! Hold on.
CLAIRE Hold on? Jin, they stuck me with needles. They branded me. And if I hadn't been able to escape from the temple, they would have killed me.
JUSTIN No, you're not remembering things right.
CLAIRE Look shut up, okay? You've got one more chance. One more chance - just tell me where my son is.
JUSTIN I don't know where your damn kid is.
JIN Kate! Kate took him! Kate took Aaron. She took him with her when she left the island.
CLAIRE What do you mean she took him?
JIN He's been with her, with Kate, for the past three years. Aaron is three.
JUSTIN He's telling you the truth. We had nothing to do with this. So if you just untie me, I'll leave, and I promise I will never tell anyone I ever even saw you. Just untie me.
HURLEY Pretty cool, huh?
JACK Jacob's in here?
HURLEY I guess so. First we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on. 
JACK Does it say anything on your arm about the door being jammed?
HURLEY No.
JACK After you. 
UNKNOWN BOY Is that your son?
JACK Yes.
UNKNOWN BOY He's really good.
DOGEN Itsumo doori yareba daijoubu da Yoshi itte koi! 
DOGEN They are too young to have this kind of pressure, aren't they?
JACK Yes. Yes they are.
DOGEN It's hard to watch and be unable to help. Your son has a gift. How long has he been playing?
JACK I... I don't know.
HURLEY Whoa! Dude this is cool. Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff. I guess they used the mirror because electricity hadn't been invented yet.
JACK Where's Jacob?
HURLEY Ahh he's not here yet. Lets get started. Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.
JACK Stop!
JACK Did you see that?
HURLEY Did I see what?
JACK The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.
HURLEY It's just ocean dude.
JACK These are our names. Turn it to 23 degrees.
HURLEY I...I don't think Jacob wants
HURLEY What. What is that?
JACK It's my house. It's the house I grew up in.
HURLEY Oh. That's weird.
JACK Haven't lived in that house since I was a kid. He's been watching. The whole time. All of us. He's been watching us. Hurley, where's Jacob?
HURLEY I don't know.
JACK You said that he'd be here.
HURLEY Well I was just...kind of...assuming.
JACK Hurley, I wanna know why he was watching me. I wanna know. So you're going to ask him right now.
HURLEY It doesn't work like that, I told you. He just kind of shows up whenever he feels like it.
JACK Why was he watching?
HURLEY I don't know.
JACK Why is my name written down on this thing?
HURLEY He didn't tell me.
JACK What does he want from me?
HURLEY Aren't we supposed--
JACK What does he want from me?!
HURLEY I don't know, Jack!
JACK You were great in there.
DAVID You...saw me? I missed a couple of notes.
JACK Sounded perfect from where I was standing. David you scared the hell outta me.
DAVID You were at grandmas. I thought I could get back to your place before I got home.
JACK I didn't know you were still playing.
DAVID I made mom promise not to tell you.
JACK Why?
DAVID It was always such a big deal to you. You used to sit and watch me practice. You were so...into it. I didn't tell you I was coming here because...I didn't want you to see me fail.
JACK You know when I was your age, my father didn't want to see me fail either. He used to say to me that...he said that I didn't have what it takes. I spent my whole life carrying that around with me. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I will always love you, no matter what you do. In my eyes you can never fail. I just wanna be a part of your life.
DAVID Okay.
JACK I've got some pizza back at the house. You hungry?
DAVID Sure.
JACK Good. Let's go home.
JACOB How'd it go?
HURLEY Where were you, man?
JACOB Doesn't matter, he wouldn't have been able to see me anyway.
HURLEY Yeah, well if you'd told me that and I'd like, explained everything, then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces. Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way.
JACOB You've got ink on your forehead.
HURLEY I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say? Jack broke your lighthouse, dude. Mission un-accomplished. Whoever you said we need to help get to the island is totally screwed.
JACOB Well I'm sure they'll find some other way.
HURLEY So...everything you wanted me to do didn't get done, and you don't even care?
HURLEY Wait a minute. Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror? Why?
JACOB It was the only way for him to understand how important he is.
HURLEY That was your plan? I think it backfired, man.
JACOB Jack is here because he has to do something. He can't be told what that is. He's got to find it himself. Sometimes you can just...hop in the back of someone's cab and tell them what they're supposed to do. Other times...you have to let them look out at the ocean for a while.
HURLEY Well next time how about you tell me everything up front. I'm not big on secret plans OK.
JACOB I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo. I had to get you and Jack as far away from that Temple as I possibly could.
HURLEY What? Why?
JACOB Because someone's coming there. Someone bad.
HURLEY Dude, we gotta warn them!
JACOB You can't warn them Hugo. I'm sorry, it's too late.
CLAIRE Look, if I didn't kill him, he would've killed me. Glad you didn't untie him.
JIN Claire, please, whatever you're thinking.
CLAIRE Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?
JIN I was lying.
CLAIRE Why?
JIN Because I wanted to save his life. But you were right. The others have your baby. Aaron is at the temple, I know because I saw him there. But you'll need me to get to him.
CLAIRE How do we get in?
JIN There's a secret way. No-one will see us.
CLAIRE Thank you Jin, thank you. And I'm so glad to know you were lying because...if what you said was the truth, if Kate was raising Aaron...I'd kill her.
LOCKE Am I interrupting?
JIN John?
CLAIRE That's not John. This is my friend.
