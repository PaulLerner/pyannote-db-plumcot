MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 He's coding!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Gunshot wound. He's crashing!
er_doctor Bay 7. Now!
penelope_widmore Is he gonna be okay?
er_doctor You're gonna have to wait here, ma'am.
penelope_widmore Where are you--where are you taking him? What's happening?
er_doctor Please, ma'am, wait here. We'll let you know as soon as we know anything.
penelope_widmore Well, what's happening? Is he gonna be okay?
er_doctor We're going to do everything we can. Please just wait.
young_charlie HUME Daddy!
penelope_widmore He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay.
eloise_hawking How old is your son?
penelope_widmore He's 2.
eloise_hawking He has his father's hair.
penelope_widmore I'm sorry. Do I know you?
eloise_hawking Uh, no, but your husband does. I'm Eloise Hawking, and I believe it's my son's fault that Desmond has been shot.
penelope_widmore Your son is Benjamin Linus?
eloise_hawking Good lord, no. My son is Daniel Faraday.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, can I get a hand with this?
miles_straume Yeah, yeah.
miles_straume Dan.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
dr_pierre_chang All right, ladies and gentlemen, you know why you're here. I wish you could all get a good night's sleep, but, uh...
miles_straume What the hell are you doing back here, Dan? Once you left for Ann Arbor, I figured you'd gotten rich, invented the DVD or something.
dr_pierre_chang The shuttle will pick you up at the motor pool...
dr_daniel_faraday This is what I'm doing back here. When did they get here?
miles_straume A few days ago. It's weird, huh? LaFleur managed to--
dr_daniel_faraday We don't have time. I need you to take me to Jack's right now, okay?
dr_daniel_faraday Jack. How did you get back here?
dr_jack_shephard Faraday? What the--
dr_daniel_faraday How did you do it?
dr_jack_shephard Whoa.
dr_daniel_faraday How did you get back to the Island?
dr_jack_shephard Where have you been?
dr_daniel_faraday I was--I was just at DHARMA headquarters in Ann Arbor. I was doing some research. What's more important right now... how did you get back here to 1977?
dr_jack_shephard What's going on?
miles_straume Don't look at me. I just carried his luggage.
dr_daniel_faraday Jack, how?
dr_jack_shephard Uh... we were on a plane, and then--
dr_daniel_faraday Who told you to get on a plane?
dr_jack_shephard As a matter of fact, Dan, it was your mother.
dr_daniel_faraday And how did she convince you, Jack? Did she tell you it was your destiny?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. That's exactly what she said.
dr_daniel_faraday Well, I got some bad news for you, Jack. You don't belong here at all. She was wrong.
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 What's wrong, mom? Didn't you like it?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 I loved it. It was beautiful, Daniel.
eloise_hawking Daniel... do you know what destiny means?
dr_daniel_faraday No.
eloise_hawking Destiny means that, if one has a special gift, then it must be nurtured.
eloise_hawking How many beats has that metronome counted since you started playing?
dr_daniel_faraday 864.
eloise_hawking Your gift, Daniel, is your mind--a mind that is meant for science, mathematics. And it's my... job to keep you on your path. So... unfortunately, there's no more time...
eloise_hawking ...for distractions.
dr_daniel_faraday But I want to keep playing the piano. I can do both. I can make time.
eloise_hawking If only you could.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, I need you to bring me to the Orchid. Can you drive me right now? Please?
miles_straume Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess.
dr_daniel_faraday Thanks. Come on. Let's go.
dr_jack_shephard Faraday! Wait up!
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, come on. Jack, we'll be right back.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, what did you mean, you mother was wrong? Daniel!
dr_daniel_faraday I just--I just have an errand to run. Be right back!
james_ford Yeah?
dr_jack_shephard Faraday's back.
james_ford What do you mean Faraday's back? Why?
dr_jack_shephard I have no idea. He came in on the sub, and he woke me up. He--he started talking nonsense, and then he took off for the Orchid.
james_ford I'd love to trade theories about this, but I'm a little busy right now.
dr_jack_shephard What are you busy with at 600 in the morning?
dr_juliet_burke James, tell him.
james_ford Get in here.
james_ford Phil--one of my security guys--got himself a videotape of me and Kate taking the kid out to the Hostiles.
dr_jack_shephard And where's the tape?
james_ford With Phil.
dr_jack_shephard And where is Phil?
james_ford Phil, Jack. Jack... Phil.
miles_straume Are we... waiting for something?
dr_daniel_faraday Right on time.
dr_daniel_faraday I'll be back in ten minutes.
TONY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 So what do you want me to do?
dr_pierre_chang You're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen... then God help us all.
SEALS#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Hey! You need a hard hat down here.
dr_pierre_chang Watch yourself!
dr_daniel_faraday Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
TONY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
dr_daniel_faraday Dr. Chang? Dr. Chang? Do you have a second, sir?
dr_pierre_chang I suppose.
dr_daniel_faraday I just came in on the sub with the Swan team. We actually met three years ago, I'm Daniel Faraday.
dr_pierre_chang Yes. Yes. Uh, you arrived with LaFleur. I remember.
dr_daniel_faraday Right.
dr_pierre_chang What can I do for you?
dr_daniel_faraday I need you to order the evacuation of every man, woman and child on this Island.
dr_pierre_chang And why would I do that?
dr_daniel_faraday A man is on a stretcher as a consequence of the electromagnetic activity that your drilling unleashed down here.
dr_pierre_chang Which is now contained.
dr_daniel_faraday It's contained down here. But in about six hours, the same thing is gonna happen at the site for the Swan station, only the energy there is about 30,000 times more powerful, sir. And the accident... it's gonna be catastrophic.
dr_pierre_chang That is utterly absurd. What could possibly qualify you to make that kind of prediction? Hmm?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm from the future.
dr_daniel_faraday Dr. Chang, wait! Will you wait one second, please? Wait one--one second.
dr_pierre_chang Yes, yes, you're from the future. You heard me talking about time travel. Now you've had your fun. Good for you.
dr_daniel_faraday No, no. Please, Dr. Chang. Just look at my journal, please. Look at these equations. Some of them won't be discovered for another 20 years. Dr. Chang--
miles_straume Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, Dan! Leave the man alone. Sorry, Dr. Chang. I think he had too many drugs on the sub--
dr_daniel_faraday Dr. Chang... Miles is your son.
dr_pierre_chang Excuse me?
dr_daniel_faraday Think about it. A Chinese man named Miles--the same name as your baby--shows up with me from the future. You--you really think this is all coincidence?
dr_pierre_chang Is this true?
miles_straume No.
dr_pierre_chang Please... stay away from me.
dr_daniel_faraday Dr. Chang...
dr_daniel_faraday Dr. Chang! If you--
miles_straume Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm just making sure that your father does what he's supposed to do.
miles_straume And what's that?
dr_daniel_faraday You'll see.
dr_daniel_faraday Hi, Mom. I want you to meet Theresa.
theresa_spencer Dan's told me so much about--
eloise_hawking Pleased to meet you. Well done, Daniel. Ah...
theresa_spencer You must be so proud of him.
eloise_hawking Daniel, I thought we could celebrate your accomplishment with lunch. There's a nice restaurant nearby. I reserved us a table.
dr_daniel_faraday We would love to.
eloise_hawking Actually, I was hoping it would be just the two of us. You do understand, don't you? It's just that I don't get to see my son very often.
dr_daniel_faraday Mother...
theresa_spencer I understand. It's okay, Dan. Really.
eloise_hawking Is there something bothering you, Daniel?
dr_daniel_faraday You were so rude to Theresa.
eloise_hawking was I?
dr_daniel_faraday Theresa is my girlfriend.
eloise_hawking She is your research assistant. You should be focusing your energies on your work.
dr_daniel_faraday On my work.
eloise_hawking Yes. That is what is important.
dr_daniel_faraday Yes. You've made it abundantly clear. Why would I waste my gift on a woman--
eloise_hawking I'm sorry to tell you, Daniel, but you're not going to have time for relationships. The women in your life will only be terribly hurt.
dr_daniel_faraday What does that mean?
eloise_hawking It means that your work will always comes first, that's all.
dr_daniel_faraday Only because that's what you always push me to do. You pushed and you pushed and you pushed. And when will it be enough, Mother? When? I'm the youngest doctor to ever graduate from Oxford. I just got a new 1.5 million pound research grant. What else do I have to do?
eloise_hawking A grant? That's wonderful! From whom?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know. Um... some industrialist. Widmore, I think. Charles Widmore.
eloise_hawking I don't want to fight with you, Daniel. That's not why I came.
dr_daniel_faraday Why did you come?
eloise_hawking To congratulate you. Good luck, Daniel. And I do hope you know that I mean that.
james_ford All right, people. Party's over. I know y'all just showed up. The rest of us have been here for the past three years. This is our home. The last thing I wanna do is leave. But we ain't got no choice.
hugo_reyes Well, that dude in the closet--I thought he worked for you. Can't you convince him that it was all, like, a misunderstanding?
james_ford I punched the man in the damn face, Hugo. What am I supposed to say--"My fist slipped"?
kate_austen How much time do we have before someone realizes he's gone?
james_ford Not enough.
dr_juliet_burke So where do we go?
james_ford We only got two options. We can either commandeer the sub, get the hell off this Island before anyone knows we're gone, or we can head back in the jungle, start from square one.
jinsoo_kwon I'm not getting on that sub if there's a chance that my wife is still on this Island.
hugo_reyes Yeah, me neither. After all we did to get back here? And now we're just gonna run off again? It'd be kinda wishy-washy.
james_ford Right. That's two votes for square one. Anybody else wanna--
james_ford Hold your horses. Be right there.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, James.
james_ford Welcome to the meeting, Twitchy. Good to see you again. Pound cake's in the kitchen. Help yourself to the punch. Is he still crazy?
miles_straume It's on a whole new level, man.
james_ford Great.
dr_daniel_faraday Jack, I'm sorry I was rude before, but what I came to do is of critical importance to everyone in this room. Does anyone know where I can find the Hostiles?
dr_juliet_burke Why do you need to know that, Daniel?
dr_daniel_faraday Because one of them is my mother. And she is the only person on this island who can get us back to where we belong.
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 This haunting footage comes to us from the Christiane I, a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean.
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 How do you want your eggs, Dan?
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 For more than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the Sunda Trench off Bali...
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 So what happened? They found that missing plane?
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 ...in search of the long-missing Oceanic Flight 815.
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Dan?
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Late last night, the Christiane deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs...
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Dan...? Dan, why are you so upset?
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 ...that verified what the national transportation safety board had long feared...
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know.
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 ...that the commercial aircraft...
NEWSCASTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 ...on September 22nd, 2004...
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 You have a visitor, Dan.
CAROLINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Would you like some tea?
charles_widmore That would be lovely. Hello, Daniel.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm sorry, sir. I don't... D--did Caroline tell you I have a condition that affects my memory?
charles_widmore Just... don't be embarrassed. We've never met. My name is Charles Widmore.
dr_daniel_faraday Charles... Charles Widmore from... my research grant? It's very nice to meet you, sir. Please, sit down. Um...
dr_daniel_faraday Mm, a bit of a mess. I meant to thank you before I... before I left Oxford.
charles_widmore You mean, before you were dismissed.
dr_daniel_faraday I tested it... I tested it out on myself first.
charles_widmore It's all right, Daniel.
dr_daniel_faraday I would never hurt Theresa.
charles_widmore Please, it's all right. That's not why I'm here. I came to offer you a new opportunity.
dr_daniel_faraday N--no, I... I'm sorry. I--I can't. I don't think I--I can...
charles_widmore Did I say something to upset you?
dr_daniel_faraday It's this plane crash. I don't know why it's bothering me so much. it's just so sad. They're dead.
charles_widmore Daniel, what if I told you... they're not dead? What if I told you the plane was a fake? An elaborate... expensive fake.
dr_daniel_faraday How would you know that?
charles_widmore Because I put it there.
dr_daniel_faraday Well... why would you tell me that?
charles_widmore Because come tomorrow, you won't remember I did. Daniel, the real Oceanic Flight 815 crashed on an island--a special island with unique scientific properties. I want to send you to the Island. It will further your research, show you things you'd never dream of. But more importantly, it will heal you, Daniel--your mind, your memory.
dr_daniel_faraday H--heal me? W--why are you doing all this for me?
charles_widmore Because you're a man of tremendous gifts, and it would be a shame to see them go to waste.
dr_daniel_faraday You sound like my mother.
charles_widmore That's because we're old friends.
james_ford Your mother is an Other?
dr_daniel_faraday You met her, actually, when the Island was skipping, back in 1954. They were calling her "Ellie".
hugo_reyes You guys were in 1954? Like... Fonzie times?
dr_juliet_burke You still haven't told us why you need to find her.
dr_daniel_faraday I just need to talk to her.
james_ford I thought you said we were supposed to lay low. "Whatever happened, happened"?
dr_daniel_faraday Just tell me where they are, and I'll go--
james_ford I'm not telling you anything, and you ain't going anywhere unless you wanna share with us what the hell it is you're doing.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, he said he can get us back to where we belonged. Whether we go on the sub or we head back into the jungle... we don't belong here.
james_ford Well, I belonged here just fine till you came back, Doc.
dr_jack_shephard You know where the Hostiles are.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard You and Sawyer took Ben out to them. Can you get us back out there?
james_ford Whoa, hold on a second. Don't say a word, Kate.
dr_jack_shephard She can say what she wants to say. Kate... You made me promise to never ask what happened to Aaron, or why you came back here. But I know that reason isn't... it isn't here. It's not now.
james_ford Whatever her reason is, helping H.G. Wells here talk to his mommy ain't got nothing to do with it. Come with us, Freckles.
dr_juliet_burke The code for the fence is 1-4-1-7-1-7. You should take Daniel. It's over here for us anyway.
kate_austen Okay. Let's go.
dr_daniel_faraday Great. Great. Thank you. Hey, Miles, can you drive us?
james_ford When you realize you've made a huge mistake... we'll be back at the beach, right where we started.
james_ford All right, the rest of us--pack anything you can carry, meet back here in 20 minutes.
james_ford Time to go.
kate_austen These people are not gonna be happy to see us. It might be a good idea to bring some guns. There's a gun safe in the motor pool, but it's locked.
dr_jack_shephard Good thing I'm a janitor then.
kate_austen Hey, Dan?
dr_daniel_faraday I'll meet you at the motor pool. I need just a minute. Okay?
young_charlotte I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner.
dr_daniel_faraday It's okay, sweetheart. I won't tell.
young_charlotte My name's Charlotte. What's yours?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm Daniel. I'm new here. Listen. Do you know Dr. Chang?
young_charlotte Uh-huh.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah? Hopefully really soon, Dr. Chang is gonna ask a bunch of people to get on the submarine and leave the Island. When he does, you and your mommy... you're gonna have to leave. In case what I do doesn't work, you cannot be here. You have to leave. I tried to avoid telling you this. I didn't think I could change things. But maybe I can.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, how long will it take us to get up there?
kate_austen Uh, it depends. We can take the road until we hit the pylons, but then once we're in their territory, we gotta go on foot.
dr_daniel_faraday Okay. Uh, do you have something for a beginner?
dr_jack_shephard Let's go.
kate_austen That's ready to go.
stuart_radzinsky What's going on here? Aren't you one of the physicists off the sub?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, that's right. Uh, we were just making sure that--
stuart_radzinsky You're supposed to be out at the Swan site.
dr_daniel_faraday Right. Uh, there was--there was an accident at the Orchid station. Dr. Chang asked us to help.
stuart_radzinsky He's got a gun.
stuart_radzinsky I just left Dr. Chang. He's at home with his wife and baby. You're lying. Now drop the guns and get down on the ground!
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. Listen to me. Listen. You really do not understand what's happening here. You have no idea. We have no time. We have to leave. All right? So we're just gonna leave. Okay? Nobody's--no...
dr_daniel_faraday Aah!
stuart_radzinsky Aah!
kate_austen Are you okay?
kate_austen I think we can make it to the Jeep.
dr_jack_shephard All right. I'll cover you. Dan? You go, too, all right? Go, go, go!
stuart_radzinsky Sound the alarm!
eloise_hawking Hello, Daniel.
dr_daniel_faraday Mother.
dr_daniel_faraday When did you get here?
eloise_hawking Oh, I just arrived. I would have called you, but...
dr_daniel_faraday I would have forgotten anyway.
eloise_hawking I hear you have been offered a job.
dr_daniel_faraday How do you know that?
eloise_hawking Well, it's my business to know. I came here, Daniel, to tell you that it is very important that you say yes to Mr. Widmore... that you accept this opportunity.
dr_daniel_faraday I can't. He needs someone who can do really, really complex space-time calibrations and calculate bearings, and I just... I don't know how to do that anymore.
eloise_hawking Daniel...
dr_daniel_faraday Mm.
eloise_hawking This place he mentioned to you, this island--did he tell you that it could make you better? What if it's true? Why, then you could go on with your work. Just think of all you could accomplish.
dr_daniel_faraday You really want me to... to go?
eloise_hawking Yes.
dr_daniel_faraday Will... will it make you proud of me?
eloise_hawking Yes, Daniel. It will.
dr_daniel_faraday Then I'll do it.
dr_jack_shephard You remember the code?
kate_austen Yeah, I got it.
dr_jack_shephard All right, I'm gonna take a look at that.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, good. It's just a graze.
dr_daniel_faraday Whew.
dr_jack_shephard This is gonna sting.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah.
dr_daniel_faraday Ah.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, you're gonna be fine.
dr_daniel_faraday I guess I'm lucky.
dr_jack_shephard What's luck have to do with it? I thought you said "Whatever happened, happened"?
dr_daniel_faraday You gotta understand, Jack, this is our present. When we met, did I have a scar on my neck? No. 'Cause I hadn't been shot yet. We can't be so naive as to think nothing can happen to us. Any one of us can die, Jack.
kate_austen Okay. It's off.
dr_daniel_faraday Thanks.
dr_daniel_faraday Which way?
kate_austen Just a couple miles in.
kate_austen Do you think he knows what he's doing?
dr_jack_shephard I sure hope so. There's no turning back now.
james_ford You called it the minute those Yahoos got here. I shoulda listened to you. You can say, "I told you so."
dr_juliet_burke Maybe after we get to the beach.
james_ford Hey. You still got my back?
dr_juliet_burke You still got mine?
hugo_reyes That's not good, right?
jinsoo_kwon
stuart_radzinsky LaFleur! Where have you been?
james_ford Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, Stu. What the hell's going on?
stuart_radzinsky I just got shot by a physicist, and the new recruits are helping him. We've been infiltrated.
james_ford That's ridiculous. Now just calm down for a minute. We can talk about this.
stuart_radzinsky What was that?
james_ford It sounded like it was from outside.
stuart_radzinsky Get down on the ground now.
stuart_radzinsky I said now!
kate_austen Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard You need a gun to go talk to your mother, Dan?
dr_daniel_faraday You don't know my mother, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard You ready to tell me why she was wrong? Why we don't belong here?
dr_daniel_faraday In about four hours, the DHARMA folks at the swan work site--they're gonna--gonna drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy. The result of the release of this energy would be catastrophic. So in order to contain it, they're gonna have to cement the entire area in, like Chernobyl. And this containment--the place they built over it--I believe you called it "the Hatch." The Swan hatch? Because of this one accident, these people are gonna spend the next 20 years keeping that energy at bay... by pressing a button... a button that your friend Desmond will one day fail to push, and that will cause your plane--Oceanic 815--to crash on this Island. And because your plane crashed, a freighter will be sent to this Island--a freighter I was on and Charlotte was on and so forth. This entire chain of events--it's gonna start happening this afternoon. But... we can change that. I studied relativistic physics my entire life. One thing emerged over and over--can't change the past. Can't do it. Whatever happened, happened. All right? But then I finally realized... I had been spending so much time focused on the constants, I forgot about the variables. Do you know what the variables in these equations are, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No.
dr_daniel_faraday Us. We're the variables. People. We think. We reason. We make choices. We have free will. We can change our destiny. I think I can negate that energy under the Swan. I think I can destroy it. If I can, then that hatch will never be built, and your plane... your plane will land, just like it's supposed to, in Los Angeles.
kate_austen And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 Satellite pharmacy...
penelope_widmore Daniel Faraday? Your son is Daniel Faraday?
eloise_hawking Yes.
penelope_widmore That's the man who sent Desmond to Los Angeles to find you.
eloise_hawking That's right. I came, Penelope, to apologize. Your husband has become a casualty in a conflict that's bigger than him, that's bigger than any of us.
penelope_widmore What do you mean? Is Des gonna be okay?
eloise_hawking I don't know. For the first time in a long time, I don't know what's going to happen next.
er_nurse Ms. Hume?
penelope_widmore Yes?
er_nurse Your husband's in the recovery room, and he's asking for you.
penelope_widmore The recovery room? Is he--
er_nurse He's doing fine. Come with me. This nurse will watch your son.
penelope_widmore Hi.
desmond_hume Hi.
penelope_widmore I thought I'd lost you.
desmond_hume I promised you, Penny. I promised you... I'd never leave you again.
charles_widmore Is he all right?
eloise_hawking Yes, Charles. He's fine.
charles_widmore Good.
eloise_hawking Your daughter's in there. Why don't you go in and say hello?
charles_widmore Unfortunately, Eloise, my relationship with Penelope is one of the things I had to sacrifice.
eloise_hawking Sacrifice? Don't you talk to me about sacrifice, Charles. I had to send my son back to the Island, knowing full well that--
charles_widmore He was my son, too, Eloise.
kate_austen This is a mistake. He's talking about erasing everything that's ever happened to us, Jack. It's insane.
dr_jack_shephard We disappeared off a plane in mid-air and ended up in 1977. I'm getting kinda used to insane.
OTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 MAN Well, that should be enough.
OTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode14 WOMAN I think we need more water.
dr_daniel_faraday Wish me luck.
dr_jack_shephard Wait. Hey.
kate_austen No, let him go. Let him go.
dr_daniel_faraday Back up. Step away. It's okay. Nobody move. I only want to speak to Eloise. Where is Eloise? Come on. Where is she?
richard_alpert I'm sorry, but Elo--
richard_alpert She's not here right now. Do we know each other?
dr_daniel_faraday It doesn't matter. I need you to take me to Eloise.
richard_alpert I--I already told you she's not here. Let's just take it easy.
dr_daniel_faraday Where's the bomb, Richard? The hydrogen bomb that I told you people to bury--where is it?
richard_alpert Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk. Okay? Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm gonna give you three seconds. One...
richard_alpert Don't do this.
dr_daniel_faraday Two...
richard_alpert Why did you do that?
eloise_hawking He had a gun on you.
richard_alpert He wasn't gonna shoot me, Eloise.
dr_daniel_faraday Eloise. You knew. You always knew. You knew this was gonna happen. You sent me here anyway.
eloise_hawking Who are you?
dr_daniel_faraday I... I'm your son.
