LOCKE Let me go. Just let me go. I'll be alright.
JACK No!
LOCKE Let me go. I'll be alright.
KATE Hang on. I've got it.
JACK Careful unwrapping it.
KATE Alright.
JACK Now throw it in.
LOCKE No!
KATE It'll blow us up.
JACK Just hurry, I can't hold him!
LOCKE Don't do this, Kate!
JACK Throw it in -- now, Kate!
MICHAEL Hey, your wife -- wife made this for you?
JIN Sun.
MICHAEL She sounded it out, huh -- so you could learn English?
JIN Yes.
MICHAEL Yeah, I wish she had made one for me. So what words are in here? English words -- what can you say?
JIN Ah, starboard, aft, port, sail, eat.
MICHAEL Yeah, right. She did you well. I hope you know how lucky you are, man. Back in business? Alrighty. Oh, hey, it's yours.
JIN You.
MICHAEL What?
JIN You.
MICHAEL Um, thank -- you. Thanks.
SUN I made you some tea.
CLAIRE I'm fine. Thanks.
SUN Aaron is a beautiful name. What does it mean?
CLAIRE I don't know what Aaron means.
SUN They will bring him back.
CLAIRE Don't say that.
SUN They will.
CLAIRE How do you know that?
SUN Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back.
CHARLIE There!
SAYID Charlie, wait.
SAYID Charlie! See, let me see.
CHARLIE It's bleeding.
SAYID We need to put pressure on it.
CHARLIE Okay. Ow.
SAYID There.
CHARLIE Ow. Animal, what is she...
SAYID Keep the pressure on, like this.
CHARLIE Ow! Ow! Ow!
SAYID She's been here for 16 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. It's too deep. It's bleeding too much. You're going to have to go back.
CHARLIE No, I'm not going back! You're going to have to fix it.
SAYID I'm not a doctor.
CHARLIE You're a soldier! What do people do when you get wounded?! I'm not going back without that baby, Sayid.
SAYID Don't move.
CHARLIE Gunpowder?
SAYID Remove the towel and tilt your head back. Remove the towel.
CHARLIE This is because I hit you, isn't it?
SAYID This is not going to be pleasant. You ready?
CHARLIE Yeah.
SAYID 1-2-3.
HURLEY Oh, man.
HURLEY I need my car. 20 minutes? Look, I can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday is tomorrow.
CHARLIE Some of us have a bloody flight to make!
HURLEY Excuse me, coming through. Excuse me.
HURLEY No, no, no!
HURLEY Excuse me, coming through, excuse me, excuse me. Look out, excuse me.
HURLEY Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. Or, today -- I don't know. I don't really get the whole time change thing, but I've got to make that flight.
TICKET AGENT I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You're confirmed for seat 20G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.
HURLEY What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.
TICKET AGENT Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?
HURLEY Fine, whatever. I'll buy the one next to it.
TICKET AGENT Alrighty. Here are two together.
HURLEY Book it.
TICKET AGENT Uh-oh.
HURLEY Uh-oh, what uh-oh?
TICKET AGENT It appears that your flight is already boarding in the Oceanic international terminal. Well, this is the domestic terminal. I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.
HURLEY Excuse me, sorry. Sorry, this is an emergency. I've got to cut through. Excuse me, dude. Dude?
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
HURLEY You've got to let me in. No, you don't understand...
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
HURLEY This is...
SECURITY AGENT Back of the line.
SECURITY AGENT Next.
ARZT Now? You're taking the computer out now?
HURLEY Hey, old guy! I'll give you 500 bucks to borrow your scooter.
OLD SCOOTER MAN I just had a hip replacement. I need this thing.
HURLEY Okay, 1600 bucks.
HURLEY Hey, hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! I've got to get on this flight!
GATE AGENT Sir, the jetway's closed.
HURLEY Please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane.
GATE AGENT Alright, one second. Hunter, this is Jenna, we've got one more... ta. This is your lucky day.
HURLEY 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16...
KATE You say something?
HURLEY Nope.
KATE I thought I heard 23.
HURLEY Does that mean something to you?
KATE What?
HURLEY That number? 23?
KATE The guy who called the Feds on me, back in Australia, did it for a 23,000 dollar reward. Mean something to you?
HURLEY Nah, it's just a number. We better catch up -- can barely see them.
LOCKE We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.
JACK If we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there, John?
LOCKE What was what about?
JACK You asked me to let you go.
LOCKE That's right.
JACK That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go.
LOCKE It wasn't going to hurt me.
JACK No, John, it was going to kill you.
LOCKE I seriously doubt that.
JACK Look, I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John. I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
LOCKE I believe that I was being tested.
JACK Tested?
LOCKE Yeah, tested. I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
JACK Yeah, and what does that make you?
LOCKE Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
JACK Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
LOCKE The Island. The Island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the Island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
JACK Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
LOCKE Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
JACK And where does that path end, John?
LOCKE The path ends at the Hatch. The Hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch.
JACK No, no, we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive.
LOCKE Survival is all relative, Jack.
JACK I don't believe in destiny.
LOCKE Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
MICHAEL I turned it on a little while ago.
SAWYER Sayid said every hour.
MICHAEL Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks. If that battery runs out...
SAWYER The man said every hour.
SAWYER Nothing.
MICHAEL 5 minutes, no more.
SAWYER Aye, aye. You know what I like about you, Mike? You've got the patience of a saint.
MICHAEL Yeah? Why do you say that?
SAWYER I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago.
MICHAEL You would, huh?
SAWYER A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.
MICHAEL Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?
SAWYER My daddy never got a chance to beat me. He shot himself when I was 8.
MICHAEL Is that why you want to die, man?
SAWYER What?
MICHAEL Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out. Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else? The way I see it, there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die.
SAWYER Well, I ain't no hero, Mike.
SAWYER Is that what I think it is?
MICHAEL Something's out there.
GATE AGENT I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers -- well, no one seems to know where it is right now. And unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.
LOCKE There's not another flight until tomorrow.
GATE AGENT Yes, I'm aware of that, sir, but there's nothing I can...
JD Look, I can get Michelle, we can carry him on. Would you mind if we carry you on?
LOCKE No, that'll be fine.
MICHELLE Here we go. Here's your seat.
JD I'll get your bag, sir.
MICHELLE If you need anything just press the call button.
LOCKE Okay. Thank you.
LOCKE Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.
HURLEY Me? Oh, okay. Got it.
JACK Be careful.
HURLEY Can I have the flashlight? Because, uh, the torch with the dynamite thing, not making a whole lot of sense to me.
LOCKE Kate, you run the fuse, Jack and I will rig the charges.
KATE Okay.
CHARLIE What the hell is that?
SAYID There's no footprints, no tracks.
CHARLIE This is it? This is the black smoke? Where are they?
SAYID I don't know.
CHARLIE She's here.
SAYID Danielle!
CHARLIE You come out, right now!
SAYID Calm down.
SAYID Danielle! I can hear you, come out. Please, he needs his mother.
DANIELLE They were not here.
SAYID Danielle, you have to give us the baby.
DANIELLE I just wanted my Alex back. I thought if I gave them the baby...
SAYID It's okay. I know. It's okay.
CHARLIE I've got him. There never were any Others. You started the fires yourself!
DANIELLE No, I heard them whispering.
CHARLIE You're a nut job. You heard nothing!
DANIELLE I heard them say they were coming for the child. The Others said they were coming for the boy.
CHARLIE You're pathetic.
LOCKE Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse.
JACK I'll do it.
KATE This is as far as it goes.
LOCKE It's far enough. I'll light it. You take cover, there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.
JACK Hurley!
HURLEY Wait just a sec.
KATE So, what was that about back there?
JACK What was what about?
KATE Putting the dynamite in your pack.
JACK I made a judgment call.
KATE We drew straws.
JACK Sorry, I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us, Kate.
KATE You had no right to make that choice...
JACK Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me, Kate? That's your call. There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this, if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem. And I have to know that you've got my back.
KATE I've got your back.
LOCKE Are we ready?
HURLEY Wait a sec, wait a sec.
HURLEY No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop, we can't do this! Stop! Wait! Stop we can't do this! Stop! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! We can't do this! We can't do this! Stop! Wait! You've got to stop it!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad! Stop! What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad! The Numbers are bad!
JACK Hurley! Hurley stop!
HURLEY The Numbers are bad!
JACK Hurley! Hurley, you've got to get back!
SAWYER It's closer. It's closer. Give me the damn flare gun.
MICHAEL Hold on a sec.
SAWYER I'm telling you, it's closer. I'm telling you, look.
MICHAEL I know, okay. I've got one flare.
JIN 아무 것도 안 보여.
MICHAEL Okay, I know. You don't see anything. Okay.
SAWYER What the hell are you expecting to see?! In case you haven't noticed, it's dark!
WALT What is it? Is it a ship?
MICHAEL We don't know, little man. We don't know.
JIN Starboard? Port?
MICHAEL Uh, Port. Port.
JIN 반대로 가는데?
MICHAEL Okay, what the hell am I supposed to do about it?
SAWYER Hey, Han, you and Chewie want to slow down a second and talk to me here?! We have to fire the flare.
MICHAEL We don't know what it is. It could be anything -- a piece of floating junk. We don't even know if Sayid's radar works!!
SAWYER Have you ever known that guy to fix something up that don't work?
WALT It's moving away.
SAWYER Floating junk that knows how to steer, huh?
MICHAEL We're moving! It doesn't make-
SAWYER Look, are you going to give me the damn gun, or am I going to have to take it?!
MICHAEL What are you going to do? Shoot me?
WALT It's almost gone. -- C'mon.
MICHAEL Please, god.
WALT It's coming back! It's coming back!
MICHAEL Are we glad to see you!
BEARDED MAN What's going on?! What are you folks doing this far out here?!
MICHAEL We were, we were -- the plane crashed! We were on the Island for a month, man!
BEARDED MAN Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that?
MICHAEL We were on an Island -- oh, flight 815 -- hey, where are we?!
BEARDED MAN Well, it's a good thing we found you.
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah, we survived and there's a whole group of people on the...
BEARDED MAN Well, ain't that something?
MICHAEL Yeah!
BEARDED MAN Only, the thing is, we're going to have to take the boy.
MICHAEL What? What'd you say?
BEARDED MAN The boy, we're going to have to take him.
MICHAEL Hey, what the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
BEARDED MAN Just give us the boy.
MICHAEL I'm not giving you anybody.
BEARDED MAN Well, alright then.
WALT Dad! Dad!
MICHAEL No!
WALT Help me!
MICHAEL Walt!
WALT Help me! Dad! Please!
MICHAEL Waaaaaaaaaaalt! Waaaahahahaaalt! No! Walt!
