ILANA Where's Jarrah?
BEN I'm fine. Thank you.
ILANA Where is he?
BEN Considering that he just killed Dogen, I don't think he's going to be joining us.
SUN Who's Dogen?
MILES The guy in charge at the Temple.
BEN Sayid killed the interpreter too.
ILANA Are you sure?
BEN He was standing over their dead bodies holding a bloody dagger, so yeah, I'm pretty sure.
SUN You said we would be safe at the Temple!
ILANA That's what I was told...
BEN Well, what about the beach?
ILANA What beach?
BEN Where we buried Locke. Where they lived. At least we'll have the water at our backs and it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea?
ILANA No. The beach it is.
SUN That way!
ILANA Move.
BEN It was on this island that everything changed. That everything finally became clear. Elba... is where Napoleon faced his greatest test. Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate. What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power. Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of Emperor... but without any power it was meaningless. He might just as well have been dead.
BEN Alright. Remember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you.
BEN Principal Reynolds, good morning.
REYNOLDS Walk with me.
REYNOLDS Linus, there's been a slight schedule shift. I'm going to need you to supervise detention after school today.
BEN What?
REYNOLDS In fact, all week. Cutbacks, budget crises, events above your pay grade... needless to say, some of us have to pull double duty.
BEN But we have history club today, those kids need me.
REYNOLDS There are five students in history club, Linus. They'll live.
BEN Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?
REYNOLDS Spare me. The club isn't for them, it's for you. It makes you feel needed. Unfortunately, for now, you're needed. In detention. Thanks for your understanding, Linus.
BEN It's Dr. Linus, actually.
ARZT Oh, for the love of... it's ruined! It's ruined! Oh...
BEN What's the problem, Leslie?
ARZT Well, formaldehyde. Formaldehyde's the problem. You know what gets out formaldehyde? Nothing. Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons I wouldn't have to pay for incompetent students with another trip to Marshall's.
BEN Budget cutbacks...
ARZT How hard would it be for Reynolds to spread out a little of the love to the sciences? I mean, I'm dealing with lab equipment in there from the 1950's. Now why is that?
BEN Principal Reynolds is an administrator. He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what the public school system is about.
ARZT Yeah... summers off in exchange for a crap pension. I'm happy to remind him.
BEN No. Taking care of the kids, that's what's important.
ARZT Okay, you just keep dreamin'...
BEN Well, I know you've given up but I refuse to.
JOHN Maybe you should be the principal.
ARZT So says the substitute...
BEN What do you mean I should be the principal?
JOHN Just sounds like you care about this place. And if the man in charge doesn't, then maybe it's time for a change.
BEN I appreciate the sentiment, but who's going to listen to me?
JOHN I'm listenin'.
MILES How about you tell me what that thing back there was?
BEN That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue.
ILANA And Jacob, right? It killed Jacob too.
BEN Yeah, of course, and Jacob--
ILANA Of course.
ILANA You're Miles, right? Miles Straume? You communicate with the dead?
MILES Not technically. I... I can tell you how someone died, pick up their last thoughts before they check out, but... I need to be near their body.
ILANA This is what's left of Jacob's body.
ILANA So tell me, Miles... how did he die?
MILES Linus killed him.
BEN What? That's not true!
ILANA Are you sure?
MILES He was standing over Jacob's body with a bloody dagger, so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.
ILANA Thank you.
ILANA Jacob was the closest thing I ever had to a father.
MILES Uh-oh.
ILANA I'm gonna look for some tools and get to work on some shelter. The rest of you see what food's left. Maybe get a fire going.
MILES Yeah, a fire will fix everything...
BEN Is there anything you'd like me to do?
BEN You know, that psychic is totally unreliable. Miles actually tried to blackmail me once.
LAPIDUS You make friends easy, don't you?
BEN I made you one of the turkey meals, with the cranberry sauce that you like.
ROGER It ain't one of them... lean deals is it?
BEN No, dad... it's organic. I'm trying to keep you healthy.
ROGER Well, it's a little too late for that. How was work?
BEN I have a doctorate in modern European history, and yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention...
ROGER Detention, huh?
BEN And the worst of it is, as I look out at those ingrates that I'm tasked with watching, I can't help thinking that maybe I'm more a loser than any of them.
ROGER This isn't the life I wanted for you, Ben. I wanted so much more.
BEN I know.
ROGER That's why I signed up for that damn Dharma Initiative and took you to the island, and... they were decent people. Smarter than I'll ever be. Imagine how different our lives would have been if we'd stayed.
BEN Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after...
ROGER No, I'm serious, Ben! Who knows what you would have become?
BEN Now, does that feel better?
ROGER Ah, yes. Thank you.
BEN Alex?
ALEX Dr. Linus. Where were you today? We had to cancel history club.
BEN Oh, I'm so sorry, I should've put a note on the door. The club meetings have to be postponed, I'm in detention all week.
ALEX Oh yeah? What did you do?
BEN Principal Reynolds needs me to cover, so...
ALEX AP test this Friday. I was kind of... counting on the tutoring.
BEN Alright, how about this? Tomorrow morning, 7 A.M. in the library. And you bring the coffee.
ALEX Thanks. God, you're the best, Dr. Linus.
BEN My pleasure, Alex.
ALEX Okay.
BEN See you.
SUN Excuse me... how long are we going to stay here?
ILANA I told you. I don't know yet.
SUN I need to find my husband.
ILANA Trust me, if anyone wants to find him, it's me. But I don't know where to look.
SUN Why do you want to find Jin?
ILANA Because your last name is Kwon. So is his. And I don't know whether I'm supposed to protect you, him, or both of you.
SUN Protect us? What are you talking about?
ILANA You're candidates. To replace Jacob.
SUN Replace him? To do what?
ILANA If you're the one selected, I imagine you'll find out.
SUN Wait... you said candidates. How many are there?
ILANA Six. There are only six left.
HURLEY Cheese curds...
JACK Hurley. Come on, wake up.
JACK Come on, let's go. We can make the Temple by nightfall.
HURLEY I'm hungry. Let's eat breakfast first.
JACK No, we can eat on the way.
HURLEY What's the rush? You know, maybe we should... take our time.
JACK Why?
HURLEY Because.
JACK I'm leavin', Hurley. You comin' or not?
HURLEY Uh-uh, dude. It's this way.
JACK No, we came this way.
HURLEY Yeah, but that was a mistake. This is faster. Trust me, it's just around here. It's a short cut.
JACK No, it's not.
RICHARD You're both wrong.
RICHARD The Temple's that way.
JACK Where did you come from?
RICHARD You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
JACK Try me.
RICHARD Not yet. But if you wanna go to the Temple, it's this way.
HURLEY Dude, do you trust that guy?
JACK At least he's not stallin'.
LAPIDUS When you're finished in the library, give me a hand gettin' some more firewood.
BEN Just lookin' for something useful...
BEN God... the things people will bring on a trip...
BEN Oceanic... I remember that plane breakin' in half like it was yesterday.
LAPIDUS You sound nostalgic.
BEN Maybe I am.
LAPIDUS You know, I was supposed to be flyin' it. Oceanic 815.
BEN And why didn't you?
LAPIDUS I overslept.
BEN Come on...
LAPIDUS Can you believe it? Imagine how different my life would be had that alarm gone off.
BEN How different would it have been? The island still got you in the end. Didn't it?
ILANA Walk.
BEN Okay, wait, you don't have to--
ILANA Stop! On the ground! Face down!
BEN What are you doing? Look, if this is about what Miles said--
ILANA Pick it up!
BEN What?
ILANA Pick it up and start digging!
BEN Digging what?
ILANA A grave.
BEN For who?
ILANA You murdered Jacob. It's for you.
BEN Now, you know this. I know you do.
ALEX Expanded Lord Cornwallis' powers as governor general.
BEN Very good. Now, moving on to the Charter Act of 1813. At the time of the Charter, the East India Trading Company's power extended to all of India, except for...
ALEX Uh... I don't know!
BEN It's okay, it's okay. It's just a test.
ALEX Just a test? Ha... it's only my entire life, Dr. Linus.
BEN Alex, I think you're being a bit over-dramatic.
ALEX Am I? My mom works two jobs just to pay our rent. How am I gonna pay for college? Let alone Yale? Assuming I can even get in...
BEN You're one of the brightest students I've ever had. I don't worry about your future at all.
ALEX Really?
BEN Really. Now, what can I do to help? I'll write you a great letter of recommendation, I'll--
ALEX No, I need someone who went there. Unfortunately, the only one I know is that pervert Principal Reynolds.
BEN Excuse me? Pervert?
ALEX Forget I said that. I was just angry.
BEN Alex... has Principal Reynolds... done something to you?
ALEX What? Ew! No... I swear... it's not that.
BEN Then what is it?
ALEX Dr. Linus, if I tell you, will you promise to keep it between us?
BEN Of course, I promise.
ALEX Okay.
ALEX So, I was in the nurse's office a few months ago... I had a stomach ache and I just went in to find a cot and I fell asleep... when I woke up, after school, in the other room Principal Reynolds was there. And the nurse... well, I guess she forgot I was in there. They were... you know... doing it! In the room right next to me! Where they give kids hearing tests! Isn't that totally gross?
BEN Totally.
ALEX Dr. Linus, you're not gonna say something, are you?
BEN No. No, a promise is a promise. Well... shall we return to the high seas?
ALEX Yeah. Sure.
MILES Not exactly tearing it up on the digging front, are you?
BEN I'm not in a big hurry.
MILES Brought you some grub. Hope you like green bean and banana 'cause it's all we got.
BEN I'm not really hungry.
MILES Suit yourself.
BEN Miles... do you remember once you asked me for 3.2 million dollars? Do you still want it?
MILES What are you gonna do? You gonna write me a check on this banana leaf?
BEN I can get off this island. And when I do, I have a vast network of people and resources that will get you that money. All you have to do is cut me loose.
MILES Why would I need your money when there are a couple of jabronies under there named Nikki and Paulo who got buried alive with eight million dollars in diamonds on top of them?
BEN I can't believe you're just gonna stand by and watch this happen. Ilana's gonna murder me for killing Jacob, a man who didn't even care about being killed!
MILES No, he cared.
BEN Excuse me?
MILES Right up until the second the knife went through his heart, he was hoping he was wrong about you. I guess he wasn't.
ILANA Dig!
HURLEY So... you're not time-traveling?
RICHARD No.
HURLEY But... you look the same as you did thirty years ago. How's that possible?
RICHARD It's not easy to explain.
HURLEY Is this, like, a Terminator thing? Are you a cyborg?
RICHARD No, I'm not a cyborg.
HURLEY Vampire?
RICHARD Jacob gave me a gift.
JACK Jacob? What do you know about him?
RICHARD I know he's dead.
HURLEY I thought you said we were going to the Temple, dude.
RICHARD I lied.
JACK Why?
RICHARD Because everyone at the Temple is dead.
JACK What do you mean they're all dead? What happened?
RICHARD I'm not sure what happened. But I just came from there, and... there's no survivors.
JACK What about our friends? Sayid? Kate?
RICHARD I hope they weren't there. Maybe they made it out alive. All I know is, whatever you're looking for at the Temple, it's not there.
JACK You didn't want to go back there. Did you know about this?
HURLEY Jacob kind of, sort of, hinted at it...
RICHARD You spoke to Jacob?
HURLEY Yeah.
RICHARD Well, whatever he said... don't believe him.
JACK Where are you goin'?
RICHARD There's something I need to do.
JACK To do what?
RICHARD Die.
BEN Do you have a minute?
ARZT Yes. I guess. Might as well give them all F's. Tell me, how hard is it to learn the difference between a genus and species? What do you want?
BEN You're pretty good with computers aren't you?
ARZT Something tells me you wouldn't be standing here if you didn't already know that I was.
BEN Could you...hypothetically...access someone's email account without their knowledge?
ARZT I...yeah, it depends on the account.
BEN Say a faculty account. Hypothetically
ARZT Whose?
BEN Nurse Kondraki.
ARZT Kim? Why, you got the hots for her?
BEN No, I'm just...curious about some of her correspondence.
ARZT With whom?
ARZT Okay, that's fine. I didn't come to see you, you came to see me. I don't have time to play twenty questions. Now either you can tell me what it is you're doing, or you can let me finish grading my papers in peace.
BEN All right. I have reason to believe that she might be engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with principal Reynolds.
ARZT You're making a play! You're going after the big job, aren't you?
BEN Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?
ARZT I want a good spot. I want Lamour's spot in the main parking lot, the one next to the maple tree. Not under the maple tree, next to the maple tree. That way I get the shade from the maple tree, but not all that tree crap all over the hood of my car. I want aprons. I want lots of aprons, and I want lab equipment in here that was built in this decade, is that a deal?
BEN Deal.
ARZT You know, you really had me fooled with that sweater vest. Linus you're a real killer!
JACK Been here before?
RICHARD Yes. And in all the time I've spend on this island, today is the first time I've ever come back.
HURLEY Jack? Dude where are you?
JACK I'm in here.
HURLEY Do not open that, there's dynamite in there, it's mega unstable.
RICHARD I know.
HURLEY So did Doctor Arzt. And I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later.
HURLEY Dude it's time to go.
JACK No, not yet.
HURLEY He's opening up a crate of dynamite, and he said he wanted to kill himself.
RICHARD I can't kill myself.
HURLEY What?
RICHARD Even if I wanted to, trust me, I do. I can't kill myself. Which is why I want you to do it for me.
JACK What are you talking about?
RICHARD What I'm talking about Jack is that...Jacob touched me, and when Jacob touches you... well it's considered a gift... except it's not a gift at all. It's a curse.
HURLEY Dude, seriously! Let's go now!
JACK Why do you want to die?
RICHARD I devoted my life, longer than you can possibly imagine, in service of a man who told me that everything was happening for a reason, that he had a plan, plan that I was a part of, when the time was right that he'd share it with me, and now that man's gone so...why do I want to die? Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose. Now if I light this myself it won't work, but you can light it for me Jack. I made the fuse long enough so you'll have time to get out.
HURLEY Jack! Please tell me you're not actually considering this?
JACK If he wants to die, there's nothing we're going to do to stop him.
RICHARD Thank you.
JACK Now, let's talk.
HURLEY Jack! Dude we gotta go, the guy's crazy, and I know crazy!
JACK Hurley go ahead, we'll be all right.
HURLEY Dude you're gonna blow up!
JACK I've got to talk to him Hurley, just go.
HURLEY No, I'm not going without you.
JACK Hurley, I'll be fine.
HURLEY If you change your mind, I'll be like a mile away.
RICHARD You should go with him Jack.
JACK No, Richard, no I shouldn't.
RICHARD You're gonna die.
JACK Actually I don't think either one of us is gonna die.
RICHARD What makes you think that?
JACK I just came from a lighthouse...where my name was etched in wood on a dial...I turned a mirror that somehow reflected the image of the house I grew up in. Jacob's lighthouse. He got Hurley to bring me out there because he wanted me to see what was reflected in that mirror. For some reason he wanted me to know that he had been watching me ever since I was a kid.
RICHARD Why?
JACK I have no idea why. But I'm willing to bet you that if Jacob went to that trouble, that he brought me to this island for a reason, and it's not blow up sitting here with you right now.
RICHARD That's a pretty big risk you're taking Jack.
JACK Yes.
RICHARD What if you're wrong?
JACK I'm not.
JACK Wanna try another stick?
RICHARD All right Jack. You seem to have all the answers. Now what?
JACK We go back to where we started.
LOCKE Hello Ben.
BEN What are you doing here?
LOCKE Visiting. What are you doing?
BEN I'm digging my own grave.
LOCKE Why?
BEN Because you talked me into killing Jacob. You see that woman over there eating a mango? She's his bodyguard and she knows what I did. So now you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me.
LOCKE I don't want you to die Ben. In fact I went back to the statue to get you, but you'd already gone.
BEN Get me? For what?
LOCKE I'm gathering a group to leave this place for good. But once we're gone, someone's going to need to be in charge of the island.
BEN Me?
LOCKE I can't think of a better man for the job.
BEN Well it doesn't seem very likely does it, under the circumstances. How am I going to get away from...
LOCKE Come to the other island, to the Hydra station. That's where we'll be.
BEN She'll come after me.
LOCKE 200 yards inland there's a tree in a clearing with a rifle leaning up against it. If you go now you'll get there first, and you'll have the drop on her. But don't hesitate - she won't. See you soon, Ben.
ILANA Hey!
REYNOLDS Come in. Linus, I don't have time to listen to you complain about detention.
BEN That's not why I'm here, I want you to read something.
REYNOLDS Well if this is some attempt to revive your little club...
BEN Those are thirty emails that cover a three-month period. It's pretty lascivious stuff, which would be fine if it was private, but they seem to describe acts that took place on school property. Acts which, morality aside, I think the school board would frown on, not to mention your wife.
REYNOLDS What do you want?
BEN Your job. You're going to resign. For, I don't know - personal reasons, health - your call. But with your resignation you're going to recommmend the school board hire me as your replacement. And the irony of all this is that they hold you in such esteem that I'll get the job. So, do we have an understanding?
REYNOLDS Linus, may I read you an email? "Dear principal Reynolds, I would appreciate it if you would write a letter of recommendation to Yale on my behalf. It would mean the world to me. Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau." It's a funny thing about recommendations Linus, they work both ways. So, I put the ball back in your court. You can execute your little Machiavellian manoeuvres, go for my job, sit at my desk, but alas there will be an unfortunate side effect. I will torch Miss Rousseau and her future. Is my job, my power, that important to you? So, what'll it be, Dr. Linus?
BEN Drop it! Put the gun down!
ILANA What are you waiting for?
BEN I want to explain.
ILANA Explain what?
BEN I want to explain that I know what you're feeling.
ILANA You have no idea what I'm feeling.
BEN I watched my daughter Alex die in front of me. And it was my fault. I had a chance to save her. But I chose the island over her. All in the name of Jacob. I sacrificed everything for him. And he didn't even care. Yeah I stabbed him, I was... so angry...confused...I was terrified that I was about to lose the only thing that had ever mattered to me - my power. But the thing that really mattered was already gone. I'm sorry that I killed Jacob. I am, and I do not expect you to forgive me because...I can never forgive myself.
ILANA Then what do you want?
BEN Just let me leave.
ILANA Where will you go?
BEN To Locke.
ILANA Why?
BEN Because he's the only one that'll have me.
ILANA I'll have you.
ALEX Dr Linus.
BEN Hello Alex.
ALEX I was just coming by to thank principal Reynolds. He wrote me the most incredible letter of recommendation.
BEN Wow, wonderful.
ALEX Did you have something to do with it? I mean, I thought he might say some nice things but he really went all out.
BEN No, it wasn't me Alex. But I always say you're a a great student, obviously I wasn't the only one who noticed.
ALEX Thanks, D--
REYNOLDS Linus, what the hell are you doing in my office?
BEN Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week, per your request.
REYNOLDS Just put it on the desk.
BEN So will I see you in history club?
ALEX You mean when it's back on?
BEN Oh no, we've got our old slot back. Principal Reynolds found someone to cover for detention. Isn't that right?
REYNOLDS Yes, that's right.
BEN Well then, see you at four.
ALEX Bye.
ARZT Hey, did you do it?
BEN No.
ARZT No? No! Wait...what about my parking space?
BEN You can have mine.
BEN Do you need a hand?
SUN Please help me with the tarp.
CREWMAN AT PERISCOPE Sir, there are people on the beach. Should we stop?
WIDMORE No, proceed as planned.
CREWMAN AT PERISCOPE Yes sir, Mr. Widmore.
