michael_dawson Where is he?
james_ford I don't know.
michael_dawson Where the hell is my son? Walt!
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 How'd you hurt your leg?
michael_dawson Got hit by a car.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Ow.
michael_dawson Yeah.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over.
michael_dawson She's not my ex-wife, man. She's just -- Walt's mother. She, uh, Susan, she just got an new job in Rome -- the boyfriend -- they want to take Walt with them.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Don't worry, I'm going to take very good care of you, Mr. Dawn.
michael_dawson Dawson.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Right, sorry, Dawson. So this boyfriend -- this is this guy Brian Porter?
michael_dawson Yeah, why, what's it say?
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 It seems that Susan wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father so that Mr. Porter can adopt him.
michael_dawson She wants me to sign my son away?
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah. Listen, if you sign this document -- legally, he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street. You'll be giving up your paternal rights -- all of them.
michael_dawson Yeah, so then, can I stop her from going?
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Well, I guess we could file an injunction so she couldn't leave the city, but-
michael_dawson Yeah, that, that. I want to do that.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Right. Um, Mr. Dawson, the fact that you came in through these doors -- that tells me something. It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford. If we go forward with this, it's going to take money. A lot of it, even at my rates. This is David and Goliath, so I've got to ask you -- are you sure you want to do this?
michael_dawson They're not taking my son away.
michael_dawson Walt! Walt! Walt!
james_ford Mike, you should save your energy.
michael_dawson They took my son!
james_ford Yeah, I saw that -- onto a boat which means he's not in shouting distance.
michael_dawson You don't know that.
james_ford Well, I got a pretty good sense. And even if he was, there's nothing you can do.
michael_dawson But if he can hear me, he knows that I'm alive -- that I'm coming for him -- that I'm going to get him back. Right now, all I've got is that maybe my son can hear me. Does that make any sense to you? Walt! Walt!
john_locke Kate.
john_locke Kate.
kate_austen John.
john_locke Easy, easy, easy.
kate_austen Behind you.
desmond_hume Are you him? Are you him?
james_ford Jin! Jin! Jin!
michael_dawson I thought we had to save our energy.
james_ford Yeah, well, Jin's still out there in the water, so if it's okay by you, I'm going to keep shouting for him. Jin!
michael_dawson Feeling guilty.
james_ford What?
michael_dawson You made me fire that flare.
james_ford I made you fire -- what, this is my fault?
michael_dawson They took my son. They found us -- took Walt -- because you made me fire the flare.
james_ford At least Walt is on a boat -- probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa -- while we're on this piece-
michael_dawson Get off my raft.
james_ford What?
james_ford What the hell is that?
michael_dawson I see you managed to hold on to your best friend there . That thing ain't going to work, anyway.
james_ford It'll work.
michael_dawson You were under water.
james_ford What do you know about guns, anyway, Hoss? It'll work. Bullets are dry, powder's dry -- if the powder's dry-
michael_dawson What the hell is that?
james_ford It's a shark. It's only a shark.
michael_dawson It's only a shark? That's supposed to make me feel better? Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around -- your shoulder.
james_ford Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then. Did you suddenly forget what happened? Why I got shot?
michael_dawson What?
james_ford Hey, how about a little gratitude here? I'm mean -- a thank you!
michael_dawson Thank you? For what? For you trying to save your own ass?
james_ford You want me off this raft? You got it.
james_ford I was trying to save your damn kid.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr. Dawson?
michael_dawson Uh, sure, okay.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 When was the last time you actually saw your son?
michael_dawson Um, about a year ago.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 It was 14 months, actually.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Is that a question, Lizzy?
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Why is that Mr. Dawson? Why so long?
michael_dawson Susan took him to Amsterdam -- for work.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 And you didn't have a problem with that?
michael_dawson Excuse me?
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction. It just seems a little inconsistent to me.
michael_dawson Incon -- no. No, no, no, no.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Michael, she's baiting - she's baiting you. Don't give her an answer.
michael_dawson She took him, though. I didn't want her to go.
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Michael, please don't talk.
michael_dawson You said there was nothing I could do.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 And you didn't do anything, did you?
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 He's not going to answer that question.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 That's because there is no answer. You were in an accident recently, no?
michael_dawson Yeah.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 You had several surgeries, spent weeks in a private hospital room, extensive rehabilitation. Who paid for all of that, Mr. Dawson?
michael_dawson I didn't ask you for anything.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Could the record reflect that Mr. Dawson acknowledged that Ms. Lloyd paid his bills?
michael_dawson Susan! Tell them -- Susan, tell them that I didn't ask you for anything.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Please don't address my client directly.
michael_dawson But I didn't.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Do you know what Walt's first words were, Mr. Dawson?
michael_dawson I'm sorry, what?
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 His first words, do you know what they were?
michael_dawson I -- no, I -- I wasn't there.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Do you know what his favorite food is? Do you...
michael_dawson No!
ATTORNEY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Okay, this is unnecessary.
michael_dawson No.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr. Dawson.
michael_dawson I'm his father.
LIZZY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode02 I'm sorry, could you say that louder please -- just for the record.
michael_dawson I'm his father.
michael_dawson Are you crazy? You're going to take a bullet out with your bare hands?
james_ford You got a better idea? Then go to hell.
michael_dawson You're never going to be able to do it by yourself.
james_ford I thought we parted ways, Mike.
michael_dawson We're caught in the same current.
james_ford Still talking.
james_ford You got a Band-aid?
desmond_hume Are you -- are you him?
john_locke Yes. Yes I am.
desmond_hume I can't believe it. You're finally here.
john_locke Well, here I am.
desmond_hume Who's she?
john_locke She's with me.
desmond_hume What did one snowman say to the other snowman?
john_locke I don't know what you're talking about.
desmond_hume Get rid of the knife. You're not him.
john_locke We didn't come here to hurt you.
desmond_hume Yeah, then why did you come?
kate_austen We were in a plane crash.
desmond_hume Were you now? And when was that?
john_locke 44 days ago.
desmond_hume 44 days? Move.
john_locke How long have you been down here?
desmond_hume Shut it. Tie him up. Do it!
john_locke Wait. Wait, wait -- you're tying up the wrong person.
desmond_hume How's that, brother?
john_locke It's pointless to tie me up, I'm not dangerous. But her, she's a fugitive.
desmond_hume So, what does that make you then, brother?
john_locke I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer -- boxes primarily.
desmond_hume All right then, box man, tie her up.
kate_austen Don't you dare touch me.
desmond_hume Hey! You be good girl, right?
kate_austen What do you think you're doing?
john_locke I'm doing what's best for all of us.
desmond_hume Alright, bring her here.
kate_austen Oh, hey, John, wait, hey. Wait!
hugo_reyes You're kidding, right? You're going back?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
hugo_reyes What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?!
dr_jack_shephard I changed my mind.
claire_littleton What do you suppose all that's about?
charlie_pace I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic. What?
claire_littleton You always try to be funny when you don't want to answer a question.
charlie_pace Try to be funny?
claire_littleton What's this?
charlie_pace Oh, I found it in the jungle.
claire_littleton You found it?
charlie_pace Yeah. Be careful. Be careful with it. Here, take Aaron. You've got to be careful with it, you know. It's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.
claire_littleton I didn't realize you were so religious.
charlie_pace I'm not. It's just, you know, it might come in handy. It'd be a nice thing to have around.
james_ford It wasn't the flare. I said it wasn't the flare. Those people that did this -- at first I thought they were fisherman or pirates or something. Then I got a good look at their boat. You know anything about boats, Mike? A boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean -- water's coming over the side with the first little squall -- maybe got a range of 100 miles. Nope, a boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close -- like the Island. French chick said the Others were coming for a kid. I think they came, Mike.
michael_dawson What?
james_ford He's the one they wanted -- why I got a bullet in my shoulder. Hell, Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.
michael_dawson Are you saying this is my fault?
james_ford That's what I'm saying.
michael_dawson They took my son because of you! They were sailing away!
james_ford They found us because they were looking for us, for Walt!
michael_dawson Don't you ever say his name again, ever!
james_ford Oh, what are you gonna do, splash me?
james_ford Look, I know you-
michael_dawson Shut up! Don't even -- you have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.
susan_lloyd Hi.
michael_dawson Where are your lawyers?
susan_lloyd Out. I told them I wanted to talk just you and me. But if you want yours I understand.
michael_dawson No, it's okay.
susan_lloyd I think you're going to win.
michael_dawson Excuse me?
susan_lloyd In court. I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt. I just have to ask you why?
michael_dawson Why what?
susan_lloyd Why are you doing this?
michael_dawson He's my son.
susan_lloyd Since when, Michael? Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me, but in Rome I'll be senior partner at the firm. I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs. You're still on disability, Michael. You can't work. You're about to be evicted from your apartment.
michael_dawson You got your lawyers checking up on me, now?
susan_lloyd Well, of course I did. Just like you had your lawyers checking up on me. Nobody's winning here.
michael_dawson Then stop.
susan_lloyd Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to get healthy. You need to get back on your feet financially so you can get back to pursuing your art. You have rare talent as an artist, Michael. But how are you going to do that -- any of that -- and still be a part of Walt's life?
michael_dawson I do it by doing it. Walt is my responsibility, too.
susan_lloyd Then let him go because it's not about you or me -- it's about him. I don't want to go court, Michael. So please just let him go.
john_locke The pilot said we had lost radio contact, but by then we were already a thousand miles off course. Any search teams would have given up weeks ago.
desmond_hume So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles?
john_locke Yes.
desmond_hume So the world is still out there?
john_locke As far as I know. Could you tell me your name?
desmond_hume My name? My name is Desmond.
john_locke Desmond, I'm John. You should know the gun is really unnecessary.
desmond_hume Yeah, so I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there?
john_locke 43, but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft.
desmond_hume A raft?
john_locke That simulated sunlight -- is that because you never leave? Is there another way out?
desmond_hume How many of your group have gotten sick.
john_locke Sick?
desmond_hume Sick, as in ill, as in dead!
john_locke Is that why it says quarantine on the inside of the hatch...
desmond_hume Answer the question.
john_locke No one has. No one. No one is sick.
desmond_hume Get up. Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man?
john_locke I haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
desmond_hume Do you know how to use it?!
john_locke Yes.
desmond_hume Sit!
desmond_hume Listen carefully, type in exactly what I tell you understand -- exactly, nothing else. 4, 8, 15... Did you hear that?
john_locke What?
desmond_hume What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?!
john_locke 15
desmond_hume Right, 16, 23, 42. Now press execute.
john_locke What's going to happen?
desmond_hume Just push it!
dr_jack_shephard Kate! Locke!
desmond_hume Who the hell is that?
john_locke That would be Jack.
desmond_hume Who is he?
john_locke His, uh, his name is Jack. He's our doctor.
desmond_hume What is he doing here?
john_locke To be honest with you I'm a little surprised to see him.
desmond_hume Your doctor has a gun, brother. Move. Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move.
john_locke I wouldn't do that, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
desmond_hume Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?
john_locke Jack, it's okay.
desmond_hume I said drop it.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?!
john_locke She's fine. Just put down the...
dr_jack_shephard I'm not putting down anything!
desmond_hume Do you want him to die? Put it down.
dr_jack_shephard Is this what you were talking about Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
john_locke Jack, calm down.
desmond_hume Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
dr_jack_shephard You.
michael_dawson What the hell is that? Part of the raft -- one of the pontoons. Stop paddling. Hey stop it. You're putting a strain on the binds; it's going to break us up. Damn it, you're going to...
michael_dawson Hey Sawyer! Climb up.
james_ford I do and we both sink. I'm going for the pontoon.
michael_dawson Don't be an idiot.
james_ford You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze, got it?
michael_dawson Got it.
michael_dawson Sawyer! Sawyer! Sawyer!
james_ford Give me your hand.
susan_lloyd There he is, do you see him? Hi.
michael_dawson Hey.
susan_lloyd Hey, I'm sorry I'm late -- packing's been a disaster and the plane leaves first thing in the morning.
michael_dawson Sure, no problem.
susan_lloyd Uh, you want to say hi, Walt?
michael_dawson Hi, Walt. I'm... hey, uh, this is for you, man. He like bears?
susan_lloyd Yes, sure, he's just really shy.
michael_dawson Hey little man, look, I guess I can't call you that -- I mean, because look how big you are. So, you and I -- well, we're not going to see each other for a while, Walt. But you are going to have a great life. I know your mommy, she's going to take real good care of you. And Brian is going to take good care of you, too. But, you know what? I just want you to know that no matter where you go that I -- that your daddy -- yeah, your daddy -- he loves you very, very much. And I always will. Always, okay.
susan_lloyd I'm sorry -- this...
michael_dawson It's okay. Uh, hey, here -- just, you know -- you know, let him know it's from me -- sometime.
susan_lloyd Okay. Goodbye, Michael.
michael_dawson Yeah, bye.
james_ford You alright, Mike?
michael_dawson It's my fault.
james_ford What?
michael_dawson I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get back my son.
james_ford How about that? The current brought us back. We're home.
james_ford Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Michael! Sawyer! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼!
james_ford Jin!
jinsoo_kwon 여기 있으면 안돼! 이쪽으로 오지 마! 이 쪽으로 오지 마! 돌아가야 돼! 말 좀 들어봐. 여기 있으면 안돼! 지금 오는 거야! 지금 오는 거야! Others. Others. Others.
