david_shephard Morning.
dr_jack_shephard Morning.
david_shephard I made breakfast.
dr_jack_shephard You know, technically, opening a box of cereal is not making breakfast.
david_shephard So, you're coming to the concert tonight, right?
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely... Is your mom coming, too?
david_shephard Yeah... Why?... You're not gonna get all weird, are you?
dr_jack_shephard Why would I get weird?
david_shephard Just don't get weird.
dr_jack_shephard I won't.
claire_littleton Morning.
dr_jack_shephard Morning.
david_shephard Morning... You want some cereal?
claire_littleton Um, sure. Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard How you feeling?
claire_littleton Uh, pretty good. I mean, he kicks like crazy at night, so...
dr_jack_shephard Jack Shephard.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 Hello, Mr. Shephard. Uh, this is Oceanic Airlines calling to inform you that we've, um, we've located your missing cargo.
dr_jack_shephard My father's coffin--you found it?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 Yes, sir. It will be arriving in Los Angeles by the end of the day.
dr_jack_shephard That's, uh, that's great news. Thank you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 Of, course, sir. We at Oceanic are very sorry it's taken so long. Good day, sir.
dr_jack_shephard It's the best I could do, and it's gonna hurt a bit.
dr_jack_shephard The bullet went straight through, but if I don’t do this, it's gonna get infected.
kate_austen
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry.
kate_austen They had a little girl, you know. Her name was Ji Yeon... Jin hadn't even met her yet... Locke did this to them. We have to kill him, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I know.
dr_jack_shephard We should get going, now.
hugo_reyes Go where?
dr_jack_shephard Before Sayid died, he said that Desmond was in a well. If Locke wants Desmond dead, then we're gonna need him.
teenage_boy GIRL Welcome back, Mr. Locke. It's good to see you.
john_locke Thank you. You, too.
ben_linus Hey! Don't you dare! It's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke. Someone call the police right now!
ben_linus I saw what you did. I'm making a citizen's arrest.
desmond_hume Do not get in my way.
ben_linus Don't you--
ben_linus I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!
desmond_hume I'm not here to hurt him, I'm here to help him let go.
ben_linus Who are you?
desmond_hume You wanna know who I am?
miles_straume You sure this is a shortcut, huh?
ben_linus I lived in these houses a long time, Miles. I think I can remember how to get there.
miles_straume Well, I lived in these house 30 years before you did; otherwise known as last week...and I have no idea where the hell we are.
ben_linus Guess it's a good thing, you're following me.
richard_alpert You mind if ask how much explosive you have access to, Ben?
ben_linus More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
richard_alpert Been a long time. You sure it's still there?
ben_linus It's C-4, Richard. I put some thought into hiding it.
miles_straume Let me guess--cookie jar.
ben_linus Don't be ridiculous... It's in my secret room behind the bookcase.
ben_linus What's wrong?
miles_straume It's just--I--you know, I get wonky around dead stuff.
ben_linus Do you have something you wanna share with us, Miles?
miles_straume I-I don't think...
ben_linus What is it?
richard_alpert It's Alex... It's your daughter... After you left, I buried her.
ben_linus Thank you, Richard.
miles_straume What's that? A secreter room?
ben_linus It's where I was told I could summon the monster. That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.
ben_linus Okay. Richard, it's your idea. Are we looking to cripple the plane or blow it to hell?
richard_alpert Blow it to hell.
ben_linus Then we'd better take it all.
richard_alpert Don't move! Show me your hands.
zoe Calm down. It's-it's okay.
ben_linus Who the hell are you?
charles_widmore She's with me.
charles_widmore Hello, Benjamin... May I come in?
ben_linus What are you doing here?
charles_widmore Put the gun down, Benjamin. Go to the dock. Take our equipment from the outrigger and then sink it.
zoe You got it.
ben_linus She's not going anywhere. If you don't answer me, I swear--
charles_widmore If you shoot me then your last chance of survival will be gone. Go. He won't do anything.
charles_widmore What are you doing here, Richard?
richard_alpert We're getting explosives to destroy the plane on the other island.
charles_widmore Why would you want to do that?
ben_linus None of your damned business.
charles_widmore I've had that plane rigged with explosives since I got here. As usual, Benjamin, I'm three steps ahead of you.
ben_linus How did you get back here, Charles?
charles_widmore Jacob invited me.
ben_linus That's a lie. You’ve never even seen Jacob.
charles_widmore I most certainly have. He visited me, not long after your people destroyed my freighter. He convinced me of the error of my ways; and told me everything I needed to know for this exact purpose.
ben_linus What purpose?
zoe Charles?
charles_widmore Yes.
zoe It's Locke. He's coming.
charles_widmore Has he seen you?
zoe No, I don't think so. Our boat is still there. I didn't have time to--
charles_widmore Run! Get back here as fast as you can. If you don't want to die, we need to hide.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.
ben_linus It's Doctor Linus, actually.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 I'll go get you an ice pack.
john_locke Dr. Linus? Are you all right? I heard there was a--an incident in the parking lot.
ben_linus I guess I got into a fight.
john_locke A fight? With who?
ben_linus I saw the man that ran you down, Mr. Locke. He was back. I approached him, and he just attacked me. And then the strangest thing happened. While he was beating me, I think--I think I saw something. What are you doing?
john_locke I'm calling the police.
ben_linus You may not want to do that.
john_locke Well, why wouldn't I want to?
ben_linus The man told me that he wasn't trying to hurt you. He told me that he was trying to get you to let go.
officer L.A.P.D.
ben_linus And for some reason, I believed him.
officer Hello, L.A.P.D.
ben_linus Do you have any idea what he was talking about, Mr. Locke? Does that mean something to you?
officer Hello? L.A.P.D.
desmond_hume Excuse me... Um, I'd like to see a detective, please.
james_ford What's with the getup? Somebody die?
miles_straume The benefit at my dad's museum. The concert I've been telling you about all week? Ring a bell?
james_ford Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about.
miles_straume You can still be my date, if you want to.
james_ford That red-headed chick that hates me gonna be there?
miles_straume Charlotte? Yeah.
james_ford Yeah, pass.
officer Detective Ford, this guy's got something to tell ya.
james_ford Yeah?
desmond_hume Um...there was a hit and run a few days ago at Washington Tustin High School and then this morning, one of the teachers there was--was beaten badly by the--by the same suspect.
james_ford Yeah? And?
desmond_hume I'm the suspect.
james_ford Thanks for saving the taxpayers the trouble of hunting you down.
desmond_hume You're welcome. Good afternoon.
desmond_hume And how are you doing today?
kate_austen Terrific.
dr_jack_shephard Any idea exactly where this well is?
james_ford Sayid said it was close to our camp, about an hour away... If Locke wanted Desmond dead, why didn't he just kill him?
dr_jack_shephard Who knows? Maybe it's one of his rules.
james_ford The bomb on the sub...you said he couldn't kill us.
dr_jack_shephard I've been wrong before.
james_ford I killed them, didn't I?
dr_jack_shephard No. He killed them.
kate_austen You all right?
hugo_reyes Yeah. I'm fine.
kate_austen Okay.
hugo_reyes Ahh!
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACOB Give me the ashes.
hugo_reyes What? Who are you?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACOB Give me the ashes you took from Ilana's things after she died. I know they're in your pocket.
hugo_reyes Why?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACOB Because they're mine.
hugo_reyes What do you want them for?
hugo_reyes Hey!
jacob Hello, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Dude...I've been waiting for you to show up. Where you been?
jacob Doesn't matter. I'm here now.
hugo_reyes Did you see a kid run by here with your ashes?
jacob My ashes are right there in that fire... When it burns out, you'll never see me again.
hugo_reyes Uh, what?
jacob You should get your friends... We're very close to the end, Hugo.
zoe Charles, let's go.
charles_widmore There's no time. Linus has a hidden room, come on... What are you waiting for?
ben_linus I'm not interested in hiding. He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway. I'd rather have it over with.
miles_straume These are both great plans, but I'm gonna go with surviving... If you need us, we'll be running through the jungle.
ben_linus Miles, wait. Give me your walkie-talkies.
charles_widmore Why?
ben_linus Because I asked. Thank you. In case I need you...
charles_widmore He's gonna kill you. You know that.
ben_linus Then I guess this is goodbye.
ben_linus Care to join me outside while I wait for the inevitable?
richard_alpert I-I'm gonna talk to him. I know this man. All he wants is for me to join him, and if I can get him to leave with me, maybe that'll give the rest of you a chance.
miles_straume Good luck with that.
richard_alpert Ugh!
john_locke Just the man I was looking for.
ben_linus Well, you found me.
ben_linus Can I get you a glass of lemonade?
john_locke I need you...to kill some people for me, Ben.
ben_linus And...why would I do that?
john_locke Because once I leave this island, you can have it all to yourself.
ben_linus All right.
john_locke Good... Now whose outrigger is that down at the dock?
ben_linus I believe it's Charles Widmore's.
john_locke And do you know where I might find him?
ben_linus He's hiding in my closet.
alex_rousseau Oh, my God. Hey, Dr. Linus.
ben_linus Hello, Alex.
alex_rousseau Oh, my God. What happened?
ben_linus I found myself confronting someone that had a bit of a temper.
alex_rousseau What? Why would someone want to hurt you? You're, like, the--the nicest guy ever.
ben_linus Guess they had me confused with somebody else.
alex_rousseau Well, you shouldn't be driving. My mom’s waiting for me over there. Let us give you a ride home.
ben_linus Oh, no, I'm not going to be any trouble to you.
alex_rousseau Dr. Linus, please... You've got one hand. You look like Napoleon.
ben_linus Excellent point.
alex_rousseau Hey, Mom! Is it okay if we give Dr. Linus a ride home?
danielle_rousseau Of course. After everything you have done for my daughter, a ride is the least we can do. I'm Danielle.
ben_linus Benjamin Linus.
alex_rousseau Hey, Mom, can Dr. Linus come over for dinner? It's coq au vin night.
ben_linus Oh, that's really not necessary--
danielle_rousseau No, we insist. Even if we have to kidnap you. Here, please.
danielle_rousseau Do you mind getting that plate? Dr. Linus...thank you. It's so nice to be able to cook for someone other than Alex.
ben_linus If you don't mind my asking, where is her father?
danielle_rousseau He died when Alex was 2.
ben_linus Oh.
danielle_rousseau That's probably why she's so attached to you.
ben_linus Excuse me?
danielle_rousseau All the interest you've taken in her. All the help you've given...you're the closest thing to a father she's ever had.
danielle_rousseau Are you... are you all right?
ben_linus I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.
danielle_rousseau Oh, I'll put in less next time.
ben_linus After you... Charles and his lady friend are in here... She's armed. But I'm guessing that's not a problem for you.
john_locke Wait out here... You don't need to see this.
ben_linus I want to see this.
ben_linus Sorry, Charles.
john_locke What a pleasant surprise. How nice to be able to talk without those fences between us. And who might you be?
zoe Zoe. My name is Zoe. I--
charles_widmore Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.
charles_widmore Why would you do that?
john_locke You told her not to talk to me. That made her pointless... Now, Charles, it's clear you're not afraid to die. So, there's only one way to motivate you to tell me what I want to know. Soon, this will all be over. I'll get what I want. And I'll finally leave this island. And when I do, the first thing I'm going to do is kill your daughter...Penny.
charles_widmore You'll kill her whether I talk to you or not.
john_locke No, I won't. I give you my word.
charles_widmore And I'm supposed to take your word?
john_locke You tell me why you came back here and I won't hurt your daughter.
charles_widmore I brought Desmond Hume back here because of his unique resistance to electromagnetism. He was a measure of last resort.
john_locke What do you mean, "last resort"?
charles_widmore I'm not saying any more in front of him.
john_locke Well, then whisper to me. Hmm?
ben_linus He doesn't get to save his daughter.
john_locke Ben...you never cease to amaze me. Fortunately, he had already told me what I needed to know. So, no harm done.
ben_linus Good... Did you say there were some other people to kill?
jacob Hello, Kate... James... Jack.
hugo_reyes He's right there by the fire, he says hello...
dr_jack_shephard I heard him.
hugo_reyes What, you can see him?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I can see him.
hugo_reyes Kate? Sawyer? You, too?
kate_austen So, you're the one who wrote our names on the wall.
jacob I am.
kate_austen Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah--you wrote their names on the wall?
jacob Yes.
kate_austen Is that why they're dead?
jacob I'm very sorry.
kate_austen You're sorry?
hugo_reyes Kate.
kate_austen No, I wanna know why. I wanna know that Sun and Jin and Sayid didn't die for nothing.
jacob Come and sit down and I'll tell you what they died for... I'll tell you why I chose them...and why I chose you. And then I'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting this island, because by the time that fire burns out, one of you is gonna have to start doing it.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 P.A. VOICE Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4. Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4.
john_locke You got a minute?
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke, yes. Yes, come on in.
john_locke Is that your son?
dr_jack_shephard Yes, that's, uh, last Thanksgiving.
john_locke He looks just like you.
dr_jack_shephard Don't tell him that... So, what can I do for you, Mr. Locke?
john_locke Dr. Shephard, you and I were on the same plane from Sydney. You gave me your card, and...the next day I threw it away, no offense.
dr_jack_shephard None taken.
john_locke Anyway...then a few days later I get hit by a car. And of all the doctors in Los Angeles, I ended up with you. Then a-after you save my life, you still want to fix me and I still don't wanna be fixed. Okay. Then...the man who ran me down shows up at my school today, again. He beat up a teacher in the parking lot. But, do you know what he said to him? He said that he wasn't there to hurt me, he was there to help me "let go," which is exactly the same thing that you said to me the last time we saw each other.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. Are--are you saying that I sent this man to run you down?
john_locke No. No. No. No. No. But --but what if all this...maybe this is happening for a reason. Maybe you're supposed to fix me.
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke, I want to fix you, but I think you're mistaking coincidence for fate.
john_locke You can call it whatever you want, but here I am. And I--I think I'm ready to get out of this chair.
jacob I don't really know where to start.
hugo_reyes How about why you brought us to the Island?
jacob I brought all of you here because I made a mistake. A mistake I made a very long time ago, and now, because of that there's a very good chance that every single one of you and everyone you've ever cared about is going to die.
james_ford What mistake?
jacob You call him "The Monster." But I'm responsible for what happened to him. I made him that way. And ever since then he's been trying to kill me. It was only a matter of time before he figured out how, and when he did, someone would have to replace me. And that's why I brought you all here.
james_ford Tell me something, Jacob. Why do I gotta be punished for your mistake? What made you think you could mess with my life? I was doin' just fine til you dragged my ass to this damn rock.
jacob No, you weren't. None of you were. I didn't pluck any of you out of a happy existence. You were all flawed. I chose you because you were like me. You were all alone. You were all looking for something that you couldn't find out there. I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you.
kate_austen Why did you cross my name off of your wall?
jacob Because you became a mother. It's just a line of chalk in a cave. The job is yours if you want it, Kate.
dr_jack_shephard What is the job?
jacob There's a light at the center of the Island. You have to make sure it never goes out. That's how you protect it.
james_ford Your monster friend said there is nothing to protect it from.
jacob Hmm. You have to protect it from him... You must do what I couldn't. What I wasn't able to do.
dr_jack_shephard You want us to kill him? Is that even possible?
jacob I hope so, because he is certainly going to try to kill you.
hugo_reyes So...how you gonna pick?
jacob I'm not going to pick, Hugo. I want you to have the one thing that I was never given--a choice.
kate_austen And if none of us chooses it?
jacob Then this ends very badly.
dr_jack_shephard I'll do it... This is why I’m here. This is... this is what I'm supposed to do.
jacob Is that a question, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No.
jacob Good... Then it's time.
james_ford And I thought that guy had a God complex before.
kate_austen James.
james_ford Yeah, I know.
hugo_reyes I'm just glad it's not me.
jacob Do you remember that bamboo field you woke up in when you first got here?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
jacob Beyond that field, across the ridge, is the heart of the island. That's where the light is... That's where he's trying to go. And that's what you have to protect.
dr_jack_shephard Past the bamboo? There's nothing out there.
jacob Yes, there is, Jack. And now you'll be able to get there... Do you have a cup?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, actually I do.
jacob Nam non accipimus hoc quasi vulgarem potionem, sed ut ille sit quasi unus mecum.
jacob Drink this.
dr_jack_shephard How long am I gonna have to do this job?
jacob As long as you can.
jacob Now, you're like me.
james_ford All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume. Little lady next door is Austen. It's been real nice having y'all...but you're shipping off to county. So best of luck and Vaya con Dios.
kate_austen You could still let me go.
james_ford Why the hell would I do that?
kate_austen Because I told you I was innocent. And you believe me.
james_ford Doesn't matter. Still can't let you go, I'm a cop.
kate_austen You don't seem like a cop to me.
james_ford Nice knowin' ya.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode16 1-F-21 responding.
desmond_hume Think it's time to leave.
kate_austen What?
desmond_hume I said, I think it's time to leave. You ready to get out of here?
kate_austen I'm sorry. Who are you?
sayid_jarrah He's a crazy person who turned himself in.
kate_austen What'd you turn yourself in for?
desmond_hume I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.
sayid_jarrah You see what I mean?
desmond_hume All right. I'm crazy. But do you want to get out of here or not?
kate_austen So, what, are you just gonna tell the driver to stop?
desmond_hume The driver already knows where to stop. But when that happens you're gonna have to give me your trust.
sayid_jarrah Our trust?
desmond_hume That's right? Because after I set you free, I'm gonna ask each of you to do something, and you're gonna have to promise me that you'll do it. So what do you say?
sayid_jarrah Oh, absolutely, I promise.
desmond_hume How about you?
kate_austen Okay, sure.
desmond_hume All right, then.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Who's Hume?
desmond_hume That's me.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where's your friend with my money? Otherwise I'm gonna have to say I shot all of you trying to escape.
desmond_hume Don't worry. He'll be here.
desmond_hume All right here he comes.
hugo_reyes Sorry I'm late, dude.
desmond_hume Don't worry about it.
hugo_reyes Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana Lucia was gonna be here.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Do I know you, tubby?
hugo_reyes Oh, no. We never met. Anyways, here's your money. A hundred twenty-five grand, right?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Yeah, that's right. Nice not knowing you.
hugo_reyes She's not coming with us?
desmond_hume No, she's not ready yet.
hugo_reyes I brought you my Camaro. The keys are under the floor mat. Everything else you need's in the trunk.
desmond_hume All right, good... Um, you know where you're taking them, yeah?
hugo_reyes Absolutely.
desmond_hume All right, well, we should get going. Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.
kate_austen What do you mean, I'm with you?
desmond_hume We... are going to a concert. Let's go.
ben_linus Hey, can I ask you something?
john_locke Shoot.
ben_linus If you can turn yourself into smoke whenever you want, why do you bother walking?
john_locke I like the feel of my feet on the ground. Reminds me that I was human... We're here.
ben_linus Are you thirsty?
john_locke This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.
ben_linus What's the matter?
john_locke I sent Sayid to kill Desmond, and obviously, he didn't.
ben_linus Looks like someone helped him out.
john_locke No, Ben. Someone helped me out.
ben_linus What did Widmore say to you?
john_locke He said Desmond was a fail-safe. Jacob's last resort in case, God forbid, I managed to kill all of his beloved candidates. One final way to make sure that I never leave this place.
ben_linus Then...why are you happy that he's still alive?
john_locke Because I'm gonna find Desmond, and when I do, he's gonna help me do the one thing that I could never do myself. I'm gonna destroy the island.
