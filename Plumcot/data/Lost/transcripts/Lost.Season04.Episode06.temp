HARPER Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. You must be Dr. Burke.
JULIET Juliet.
HARPER Juliet. I'm Harper Stanhope. Please sit. Today is just a meet and greet so that we can get to know each other.
JULIET Please don't take this the wrong way, but I-I really don't think I need therapy.
HARPER How about we call it "talking" instead of therapy?
JULIET Okay.
HARPER Good.
HARPER Let's talk. So you've been here a week. And what's your least favorite part so far?
JULIET I don't like being treated like a celebrity.
HARPER And is that surprising? You're big news right now.
JULIET Yes, I know. I guess I don't like being the center of attention. It makes me feel isolated ... alone. (Chuckles nervously)
HARPER Well, maybe you feel that all eyes are on you, but you're not a celebrity, and soon enough, you'll realize that you're no different than anyone here.
JULIET Oh, I-I know. I-I never meant that I—
HARPER Yes?
TOM Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption. I know you don't like me busting in, but Ben would like to see the doc.
HARPER Uh... She's all yours, Tom. It was nice talking to you, Juliet. Welcome to the Island.
TOM That Harper's a piece of work. But you give her a week, she'll have you cryin' about your daddy. I'm speaking from personal experience here. 
BEN Welcome to your humble abode.
JULIET This is for me? The whole house?
BEN You're here to help us with some very important research, Juliet. We pulled out all the stops. Two bedrooms, two baths. Washer, dryer. Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.
BEN Oh, and I know you love the opera. You have all the classics on CD.
JULIET Ben, this is amazing. Seriously, you shouldn't have gone to all the trouble. I'm only gonna be here for six months.
BEN Right, of course. But... we want you to feel at home.
SUN Need some help?
JULIET I'm fine. I just can't seem to get it steady.
SUN Okay.
JULIET Nice. Thanks.
SUN Why are you going to all this trouble when we're about to leave this island?
JULIET Well, I still need somewhere to sleep tonight, right?
JACK Juliet. Have you seen Charlotte and Faraday? All their stuff's gone.
JULIET No, I haven't seen them. You still have the sat phone, right?
JIN 샬롯하고 패러데이는 정글로 들어가는 걸 봤는데.
SUN He saw them going into the jungle.
JACK Why didn't he say anything?
SUN 왜 아무한테도 얘기 안 했어요?
JIN You said... they are friends.
SUN Aren't they?
JACK All right, we've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's fan out. If you cut their trail, call out to me. I'll come to you.
JULIET Jack?
HARPER Hello, Juliet. Long time no see.
JULIET What are you doing here?
HARPER I came to deliver a message... from Ben. The two people you're looking for — Faraday and Lewis — they're headed to the Tempest. And if they figure out how to deploy that gas... then everyone on this island is going to die.
JULIET Why don't you stop them?
HARPER Because Ben wants you to go.
JULIET How can Ben possibly know where they are when he's a prisoner?
HARPER Ben is exactly where he wants to be.
JULIET How am I supposed to stop them?
HARPER By pointing the gun and pulling the trigger.
JACK Hey!
JACK Who are you?
HARPER I'm an old friend of Juliet's. I just told her where the people you're looking for are headed. Maybe you and your gun can go too.
JULIET You okay?
GOODWIN Uh, I was just looking for some gauze. I-I didn't know anyone was here.
JULIET How'd you manage that?
GOODWIN I, um... I-I work over at the power station. I was pressed up against the transformer.
JULIET Take a seat. Let me take a look at it.
GOODWIN You're Burke, right? The baby doctor.
JULIET What gave me away?
GOODWIN I heard we lost Henrietta this morning. It's okay. It's not your fault.
JULIET Pregnant women are dying on this island. I was brought here to help fix that. So whose fault is it?
GOODWIN Believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnight.
GOODWIN You have anyone to talk to? Any friends here? Maybe Harper.
JULIET Harper hates me. We only talk because we have to. I get the feeling that she is a mean... and spiteful person.
GOODWIN She's my wife.
JULIET She's your wife? I'm sorry. I didn't—
GOODWIN No, don't worry about it. Really, it's okay.
JULIET Okay, you're, uh, you're set.
GOODWIN Much obliged, ma'am.
GOODWIN Hey. I know this place can wear on you, but if you need to talk... I'm around.
JULIET Good to know. Oh, um... if you promise not to tell your wife what I said about her, I won't tell anyone that you lied about how you hurt your arm. I know a chemical burn when I see one.
GOODWIN You got a deal. Uh, by the way... I'm Goodwin.
JULIET Juliet.
JULIET Faraday and Charlotte are heading for the Tempest.
JACK The Tempest?
JULIET It's safer for you if I don't talk about it.
JACK No. Talk about it, please.
JULIET It's an electrical station that powers the Island.
JACK Why would they go there?
JACK Hey. If there's something you need to tell me, now's the time to do it.
JULIET What I need is for you to help me. Will you help me?
JULIET If we move all night, maybe we can still catch them. Thank you.
DAN I think it's that way. But what happens if I... what if I can't do it?
CHARLOTTE Dan. Look at me. I know you can do this. Should we get going?
DAN Yeah.
CHARLOTTE Come on.
DAN Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's—it's okay. It's okay. It's Kate.
DAN So they have Miles?
KATE Yeah, but he's fine. They're treating him fine. I thought you two were with Jack at the beach. What are you guys doing out here?
CHARLOTTE Jack was trying to communicate with Sayid and Desmond on the freighter, but their sat phone ran out of juice. It's totally dead. There's no way we can call the boat.
CHARLOTTE So we volunteered to get the spare batteries out of the packs that we threw out of the chopper.
KATE So... if you threw your pack from the chopper, what's that?
DAN This? Uh... it's... just borrowed this.
KATE Mind if I take a look?
CHARLOTTE Go ahead, Dan. Show her.
KATE Batteries, huh? What's this for—
KATE —uhh!
CHARLOTTE What?
JACK That woman--what was her name?
JULIET Harper.
JACK The two of you friends?
JULIET Not exactly. She was my therapist.
JACK You people had therapists?
JULIET It's very stressful being an Other, Jack.
JACK Seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.
JULIET I'm sure there are things from your past that you'd rather not talk about.
JACK Yeah. You read them all in my file.
JULIET Trust me, Jack. You don't want to see my file.
JULIET The problem occurs somewhere during the second trimester, when the mother's immune system is triggered. The white blood cell count plummets. It's like the... immune system turns on the fetus.
BEN May I?
JULIET Sure.
BEN Any thought yet on a cause?
JULIET Mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women who've conceived on the Island does it happen to—
JULIET —which makes me wonder—
GOODWIN Hey Juliet. Oh, Ben, I didn't know you were here. Ethan's out sick.
GOODWIN I have an extra egg salad on rye. I was just checking to see if Juliet wants it.
JULIET Thanks. No, I already ate. Oh, besides, I have an appointment with your wife in 10 minutes.
GOODWIN Great. Tell her I said hi.
JULIET Oh, will do.
GOODWIN Ben?
BEN No, I'm fine.
HARPER So, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?
JULIET He's great. Uh, very smart... and intense. Challenging. He's been really good to me.
HARPER Of course he has. You look just like her.
JULIET I'm sorry?
HARPER And I see you and my husband have become friendly.
JULIET Yeah. He's great. He's been really helpful.
HARPER When did you start sleeping with him?
JULIET What?
HARPER Look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot. So just tell me. When did it start?
JULIET Okay. I'm not doing this. We're done.
HARPER No. Please respect me enough to spare me the pretense that you are actually offended. I know. I followed you. Watched you.
JULIET I'm sorry.
HARPER It doesn't matter anymore. But what does matter is that you listen to me and that you believe me. And if you continue to have a relationship with Goodwin, there will be consequences. I don't want him to get hurt.
JULIET I would never hurt him.
HARPER Look it, I am not talking about you. I am talking about Ben.
CLAIRE Hi John.
LOCKE Hey Claire. Is there something I can do for you?
CLAIRE I want to know what's going on with Miles.
LOCKE Right now, not a whole lot. I'm... bringing him food and water until he decides to talk.
CLAIRE I'd like to talk to him myself.
LOCKE And why would you want to do that?
CLAIRE John, we have to find out who these people are and where they came from. And why they're not interested in rescuing us.
LOCKE And you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?
CLAIRE No, I... I just think we might be taking the wrong approach. I mean, you killed one, Ben shot one, and now we're holding one prisoner. You know, it's not hard to understand why they might think we're hostile. I might be just a little less intimidating.
LOCKE It's not gonna happen, Claire.
CLAIRE John, I don't—
LOCKE You do remember what Charlie said about these people.
CLAIRE All Charlie said was whose boat it isn't. Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?
BEN Rabbit today?
LOCKE We're running out of chickens.
BEN This didn't have a number on it, did it?
LOCKE What?
LOCKE Eat, change, put your laundry and dishes by the door. I'll be back to collect them in 15 minutes.
BEN So has the revolution begun yet? Or...
LOCKE What are you talking about?
BEN Well, you're the leader now. I know it's a tough position. You have to deal with all those people constantly second-guessing your decisions, and it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it? A question here, a comment there, and then if you're not careful, you find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands. Believe me, your people are gonna be so angry when they realize you still don't have a plan.
LOCKE And I assume you have a plan.
BEN I always have a plan.
LOCKE Does it involve you raising $3.2 million? Phew. That's a lot of money. Wait.
LOCKE Maybe this'll get you started. Put your laundry and dishes by the door.
BEN I can help you, John. We have shared interests... or at least a common enemy.
LOCKE And that would be our friends on the freighter.
BEN Not them. The one they work for. Let me out of here. Give me some semblance of freedom, let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils, and I give you my word I'll tell you everything you want to know about the person who sent the freighter.
LOCKE Yeah, but see, there's the problem. I don't trust your word.
BEN All right, then. I guess I'll have to show you.
GOODWIN I hope this is good. I don't know much about wine. I swiped this off the sub.
GOODWIN There.
JULIET Thanks. Mmm.
GOODWIN I wish we could do this all the time. I hate that we have to be so... private.
JULIET What's the matter with being private?
GOODWIN It's ridiculous. I've been sleeping on the couch for a year. Why am I not just telling her?
JULIET I don't think it's a good idea.
GOODWIN Why not?
JULIET Ben wouldn't like it.
GOODWIN That's what this is about? You're worried about Ben? Why? Because he has a crush on you?
JULIET You know?
GOODWIN Come on. Everyone knows. He follows you around like a puppy.
JULIET And you don't think that's a problem?
GOODWIN Now, a little less than a kilometer from here, he has me working with chemicals, that could kill every man, woman and child on this island if I flip the wrong switch. Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate. The last thing he cares about is you and me.
JULIET I just... get the feeling that he would be upset.
GOODWIN What's Ben gonna do?
BEN Goodwin! You see where the tail landed?
GOODWIN Yeah, probably in the water.
BEN You run, you can make that shore in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em — a passenger. You're in shock. Come up with an adequate story if they ask.
BEN Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go.
JACK Something's wrong. We should've... we should've caught up with 'em by now.
JULIET These people base jumped out of a helicopter, Jack. Let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.
JACK Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Hey. It's all right. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's all right. Come on. Take it easy. Take it easy.
JULIET I'll go get her some water.
JACK Yeah. Thanks.
JACK What happened?
KATE I was going back to the beach, and... I ran into Faraday and that woman... um... Charlotte. I think she hit me.
JACK They disappeared out of camp last night. We've been trying to catch up with them.
KATE Do you know where they were headed?
JACK Some sort of... power station.
KATE Jack. They had gas masks.
JACK Juliet? Juliet?! Juliet! Juliet!
LOCKE All right, no tricks. You're not leading me out into the jungle so you can disappear or shoot me in the back.
BEN No tricks, John. We don't even have to leave the living room.
LOCKE So let's have it.
BEN We have a deal, right?
LOCKE How do I know you're not gonna run off and meet your people first chance you get?
BEN If my people still wanted me, John, they would've stormed this camp long ago. It's behind that picture.
BEN 36-15-28.
LOCKE "Red Sox"?
BEN I taped over the game.
BEN This is Charles Widmore. This is the man whose boat is parked offshore. This is the man that's been trying to find the Island.
LOCKE Who's the man in the blindfold?
BEN One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.
LOCKE How does Widmore know about the Island?
BEN I don't know, but he does.
LOCKE What does he want?
BEN John, three months ago in Gainesville, Florida, the Virgin Mary seemed to appear in a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex. When the word got out, over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves. You've survived an airline crash on this island. One minute, you're in a wheelchair. The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks. If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold, how many people do you think would come here to see you? Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island, and he'll do everything in his power to possess it.
BEN Everything I know about Charles Widmore is in this file. Some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork, some of it's concrete. But this is everything, and now it's all yours. I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this sooner. But it was the only bargaining chip I had left.
LOCKE There's one more thing I need to know. Your man on the boat...I want you to tell me who it is.
BEN Alright. But you might want to sit down.
KATE She came through here. So did they, about half an hour ahead of her.
JACK What happened?
KATE Sorry?
JACK At Locke's — why did you stay?
KATE I stayed because I had to find something out.
JACK Are you gonna tell me, or are we gonna keep walking through the jungle like it doesn't matter?
KATE I stayed to find out if the people on the freighter know who I am... if they knew that I'm a fugitive... that I'm wanted for murder.
JACK Do they?
KATE Yeah, they know... we should keep moving. God knows where Juliet is.
BEN Hi. Come on in. Sorry. I have to get this ham out of the oven, or it'll dry out.
JULIET Please. Don't mind me. How are you feeling, by the way?
BEN Never better.
JULIET It smells delicious.
JULIET Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.
BEN Just you and me. Oh, I guess I should've made that clearer.
JULIET ... No. It's fine. I—I hope you like dinner rolls.
BEN I do indeed.
BEN I want to thank you for how wonderful you've been with Zack and Emma.
JULIET They're really sweet kids. Ben, they've been asking me about their mother in Los Angeles. I'm not really sure what to say.
BEN They'll stop asking in time.
JULIET They're children. Do they really belong here?
BEN They're on the list, Juliet.
BEN Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
JULIET Now that we have everyone on the list from the tail section, what about Goodwin?
JULIET He's been undercover for three weeks.
BEN ... He's making a case for this woman, Ana Lucia. He thinks she'd be a valuable member of our society. But between you and me, I don't see it. He feels very passionately about her, almost inappropriately so.
JULIET After losing Ethan, it's a risk.
BEN Goodwin stays where he's at right now, Juliet. There's no reason for him to hurry back, right? But his assignment will be over soon. I promise you.

BEN What are you reading?
JULIET Shephard's file. Mikhail dropped it off. He's a spinal surgeon, Ben. He has extensive experience in tumor removal.
BEN Hmm. How about that?
JULIET He can help you. I thought you'd be more excited. What's wrong?
BEN I need you to come with me.
BEN After our last raid on the tail-section survivors, they ran off, left the beach. I sent Pickett and Tom to track their location, and they came across this. I'm sorry, Juliet.
JULIET Sorry about what?
JULIET Oh my god, oh my god!
JULIET Oh my god. Oh my god. Goodwin. What happened?
BEN We don't know; there weren't any witnesses. I can only assume they found out he wasn't one of them. Guess I should've listened to you.
JULIET Why are you showing me this? Why did you bring me out here?
BEN What, you mean instead of his wife?
JULIET You knew this would happen. You sent him out here because you knew this would happen. (Cries) You wanted this! You wanted him to die! Why?
BEN "Why"? You're asking me "why"? After everything I did to get you here, after everything I've done to keep you here, how can you possibly not understand... that you're mine!
BEN Take as much time as you need.
JULIET Whoa, Kate, it's all right. They're on our side.
KATE Our side, Juliet? She just knocked me unconscious.
CHARLOTTE Yeah. I'm very sorry about that, but I had no choice. Look, Daniel's inside securing the facility. If you come with me, I will be more than happy to explain exactly how we just saved your life.
KATE All right. Let's go.
JACK I'll take their word for it.
JACK You okay?
JULIET He wanted me to kill them. Ben. He told me to kill both of them.
JACK How can he tell you anything?
JULIET I don't know, but he knew how to get to me, and he knew where they were going and what they were doing. Don't you understand? These people came here to wage war against Ben, and Ben's going to win, Jack. And when he does, you don't want to be anywhere near me.
JACK Why not?
JULIET Because he thinks that I'm his. And he knows how I feel about you.
JACK He knows where to find me.
SAWYER Oh! Beat that. 
SAWYER Son of a bitch! How'd you get so damn good at horseshoes?
HURLEY I don't know. Guess I'm just ... lucky.
SAWYER What the hell are you doing out?
BEN See you guys at dinner.
