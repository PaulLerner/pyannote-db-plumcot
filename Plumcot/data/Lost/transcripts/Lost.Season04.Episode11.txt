emilys_mother Where do you think you're going?
emily_ Out.
emilys_mother With who? Him?
emily_ Yes, and you can't stop me. I'm in love.
emilys_mother He's twice your age, Emily.
emily_ So what, Mom? Are you jealous?
emilys_mother Emily, wait a minute. Emily, listen to me!
emilys_mother Emily! Get back here, young lady, right now!
emily_ You can't stop me! I love him!
emilys_mother Emily! Emily—
emily_ Aah!
er_nurse Honey? Honey, can you hear me? Honey, can you hear me?
er_nurse That's good. Try and stay awake now. Must be internal. Keep it steady. Out of the way. Pulse! She's bleeding. Her heartbeat's dropping fast.
emily_ I'm pregnant.
er_nurse What? What did you say?
emily_ I'm pregnant. I'm five—I'm almost six months.
er_nurse She—she's pregnant.
er_doctor Get the clamps ready.
er_nurse That's it, Emily. Good girl.
er_doctor Baby's crowning.
er_nurse She's crowning.
er_doctor Dilated and ready to go. Here we go. That's it.
er_nurse Okay, sweetheart.
er_nurse All right, there you go.
er_nurse Wrap you up nice and warm. We'll just take you over here now. Margaret, would you put him in for me, please?
emily_ My baby.
er_nurse It's a boy, honey. He's okay for now. He's just real early.
emily_ Can I hold him?
er_nurse I'm really sorry, sweetheart. He's just too little. We have to take him away now.
emily_ But... name—name him John. Please! His name is John!
hugo_reyes Who builds a cabin in the middle of the jungle anyway?
john_locke That's a good question.
hugo_reyes So? How about answering it?
john_locke I don't know.
hugo_reyes And why are we even going there?
john_locke Because hopefully, the man who lives in the cabin can tell us what to do about the people who are trying to kill us.
hugo_reyes We've been walking all day. Are we gonna get there soon?
john_locke How long?
ben_linus I don't know. I've been following him.
john_locke What? What do you mean, you've been following him?
hugo_reyes I'm not even in front.
ben_linus I have no idea where the cabin is. Hugo's the last one who saw it.
hugo_reyes Oh, this is just awesome.
ben_linus What do you think we should do, John?
john_locke We're making camp.
hugo_reyes What? Here in the dark with the monster and... him?
john_locke Well, the rest will do us good.
hugo_reyes Dude, what's gonna happen when those freighter guys come back?
john_locke I don't know... yet.
sayid_jarrah Desmond. The helicopter's here.
martin_keamy All right, get him on the litter. Careful with him! Get him down over there. Be careful. Okay guys, unload it. Come on. Pick it up, pick it up. Let's go.
ray What did this to him?
martin_keamy A black pillar of smoke threw him 50 feet in the air... ripped his guts out.
ray What?
martin_keamy I need you to tell me exactly how many people are on that island, and where every single one of them is.
sayid_jarrah And why would I do that?
captain_gault Keamy! What the hell do you think you're doing, mate?
martin_keamy You gave me up.
captain_gault What?
martin_keamy Linus knew who I was. He knew my name. He knew everything about me.
captain_gault No, I'm not the one who gave you up.
martin_keamy Then who did?
michael_dawson Aah! Oh! Oh!
michael_dawson Ohh!
martin_keamy Do you know who I am?
michael_dawson What?
martin_keamy My name. Do you know my name?
michael_dawson Keamy. Martin Keamy.
martin_keamy Did you give it to him?
michael_dawson Who?
martin_keamy Benjamin Linus—did you give him my name?
michael_dawson Yeah.
captain_gault Wait. Wait! Martin, no!
captain_gault Martin, we need him. He's the only one who can fix the engines.
martin_keamy And what makes you so sure about that?
captain_gault Because he's the one who broke them.
horace_goodspeed Hello there.
john_locke Who are you?
horace_goodspeed I'm Horace. Whew!
john_locke And what are you doing out here?
horace_goodspeed Oh, building a place—a little getaway for me and the missus. No, I mean, sometimes you need a break from the D.I., y'know? The DHARMA Initiative? I'm not making any sense, am I?
john_locke No.
horace_goodspeed That's probably because I've been dead for 12 years.
horace_goodspeed Hello there. You gotta find me, John. You gotta find me. And when you do, you'll find him.
john_locke Who?
horace_goodspeed Jacob.
horace_goodspeed He's been waiting for you a real long time, man.
horace_goodspeed I'm Horace.
horace_goodspeed Godspeed, John.
john_locke Hugo.
hugo_reyes Mallomars.
john_locke Wake up, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Hmm? Huh? What?
john_locke Time to get up. We're gonna get going.
hugo_reyes I thought we didn't know where we're going, dude.
john_locke We do now.
hugo_reyes Hmm.
ben_linus I used to have dreams.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 OVER P.A. Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller, please call the switchboard.
er_nurse Hi, Emily. Mrs. Locke, it's good to see you.
emilys_mother How is he?
er_nurse He's amazing. He's the youngest preemie to ever survive in this hospital. He's had infections, pneumonia, you name it. And every time, he knocked them out. He is a fighter, your little John.
emilys_mother That's wonderful.
er_nurse The other girls say he's a miracle baby, and today, we're gonna take him out of the incubator so you can hold him for the very first time.
emily_ I... I can't do this. I... I'm sorry I can't!
emilys_mother So who do I talk to about adoption?
er_nurse You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke.
emilys_mother Oh. Of course. I'm sorry.
er_nurse Is that the father?
emilys_mother I, uh... I don't know who that is.
hugo_reyes Can I ask you somethin'?
john_locke Sure.
hugo_reyes Why am I here, man?
john_locke You're here because you can see the cabin, and that makes you special.
hugo_reyes Well, I have a theory as to why we're the only ones who can see it.
john_locke I'd love to hear it.
hugo_reyes I think we can see it 'cause we're the craziest. So how'd you figure out where it was, dude?
john_locke I didn't. We're not going to the cabin. We're gonna make a pit stop first.
hugo_reyes Pit stop? Where?
john_locke You ever wonder what happened to the DHARMA Initiative, Hugo? There must have been at least a hundred of 'em living on this island—manning the stations, building those homes, making all that ranch dressing that you like. And then one day, they're all gone. They just disappeared. You want to know where we're going?
john_locke We're going to see them.
hugo_reyes Whoa. What happened to 'em?
john_locke He did.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 Hello!
CHILD#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 That game's stupid.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 He's right in here. Come on in.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 Melissa, stop that! Go on now. Take your brother in the kitchen. There's someone here who wants to see John.
richard_alpert It is coming down like cats and dogs out there.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 This nice gentleman wants to talk to you, John. So I want you on your best behavior. Understand? He's all yours.
richard_alpert You like backgammon? Yeah? You seem to have a pretty good sense of the game. I'm Richard, John. I run a school for kids who are... extremely special, and I have reason to believe that you might be one them. Mind if I show you a couple of really neat things?
richard_alpert Did you draw that, John?
richard_alpert I want you to look at these things... and think about 'em.
richard_alpert Okay, now tell me, John, which of these things belong to you?
john_locke To—to keep?
richard_alpert No, no, John. Which of these things belong to you already?
richard_alpert Are you sure the knife belongs to you, John?
richard_alpert You sure about that?
richard_alpert Well, it doesn't.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 How did he do?
richard_alpert I'm afraid John isn't quite ready for our school. I'm sorry I've wasted your time.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 What did you do?
hugo_reyes What's he doing down there?
hugo_reyes So... This is where you shot Locke and left him for dead, huh?
ben_linus Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where you are now when I pulled the trigger. Should have realized at the time that it was pointless, but... I really wasn't thinking clearly.
hugo_reyes Is that why you killed all these people, too?
ben_linus I didn't kill them.
hugo_reyes Well, if the Others didn't wipe out the DHARMA Initiative—
ben_linus They did wipe them out, Hugo, but it wasn't my decision.
hugo_reyes Then whose was it?
ben_linus Their leader's.
hugo_reyes But I thought you were their leader.
ben_linus Not always.
john_locke The cabin. He was building it.
hugo_reyes Did you find what you were looking for?
john_locke Yes, Hugo. I believe I did.
martin_keamy I need your key.
captain_gault What?
frank_lapidus Captain. Mayhew just died. Doc couldn't do anything for him. The crew's asking a lot of questions about what happened to you guys over there.
martin_keamy You tell the crew that I'm dealing with it, then you can go gas up the chopper, Frank. We're going back.
frank_lapidus Going back? What the hell for?
martin_keamy Gas up the chopper, Frank.
frank_lapidus Okay.
captain_gault Listen, Martin. While you were gone, there was some sort of a sickness.
martin_keamy Mm-hm.
captain_gault The crew—they've been exhibiting some very strange behavior. Regina threw herself overboard, for God's sake. Now I would be derelict in my duty if I didn't point out that this might be exactly what's happening to you.
martin_keamy I appreciate your concern. Give me your key.
captain_gault That's not the protocol—
martin_keamy Thank you.
captain_gault The reason there are two keys is we're only supposed to open the safe together.
martin_keamy You're here, aren't you?
captain_gault What is that?
martin_keamy It's the secondary protocol.
captain_gault What does it say?
martin_keamy Says where Linus is going.
captain_gault How would Mr. Widmore know that?
martin_keamy 'Cause he's a very smart man, and if Linus knows that we're gonna torch the Island, there's only one place that he can go.
captain_gault What do you mean, "torch the Island"? That was not the agreement. I agreed to ferry you here for an extraction mission.
martin_keamy Fix my gun.
desmond_hume The injured man... there was no gunshot. What do you think happened to him?
sayid_jarrah I don't know. But when they get back, they'll be certain it doesn't happen again.
captain_gault Omar! Keamy wants you in the armory.
omar_idris He said I wasn't supposed to let those two out of my sight.
captain_gault I'll watch them. Go.
captain_gault There's a pantry below our galley with enough room for two men. I've left you a supply of food and water. You need to go there.
sayid_jarrah Michael—is he dead?
captain_gault No, but not for lack of bloody trying, which is precisely why you two need to be hiding before Keamy comes back on this deck.
sayid_jarrah Hiding is pointless. Give us your Zodiac raft so we can start ferrying people back here from the beach. The only way to save our lives is to get our people off that Island.
captain_gault Meet me behind the container in ten minutes. The boat will be in the water.
john_locke The cabin's here. We came from over there. Up the coast.
hugo_reyes Here you go. Drink up, dude. Digging through dead bodies takes it out of you.
john_locke It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo. If you head that way, you'll hit the coast, and all you have to do is take it north until you reach our beach.
hugo_reyes Uh, what?
john_locke I forced you to come with us at gunpoint, and I'm sorry, Hugo, but I was led to believe that we needed you to find this place.
hugo_reyes Oh, I get it. Now you got your magic map, you don't—you don't need me anymore.
john_locke I'm offering you a chance to leave. I don't want to put you in harm's way against your will.
hugo_reyes And you think walking through the jungle at night by myself is gonna be any safer?
john_locke I'm not sure it is.
hugo_reyes I think I'll stick with you guys. This way?
john_locke What?
ben_linus He actually thinks staying was his idea. Not bad, John. Not bad at all.
john_locke I'm not you.
ben_linus You're certainly not.
john_locke Somebody, let me out! Please let me out. Please, somebody, let me—
mr_gellert John, you okay?
john_locke I'm fine. I'm fine.
mr_gellert Get to class, ladies. Tardy bell just rang. John, you're bleeding. Come on. Let's go to the nurse's office.
mr_gellert You wanna talk about it?
john_locke No.
mr_gellert I know you're probably upset right now, but I do have some exciting news for you. I got a call from Portland recently. There's a company up there doing some very exciting things in chemistry and new technologies. They're called Mittelos Laboratories. I spoke with a Dr. Alpert. He's very interested in finding young, bright minds to enter into these new fields of science. They want you to go to their camp this summer.
john_locke Science camp?
mr_gellert Yes.
john_locke Don't you understand that things like science camp are the reason why I get stuffed into lockers?
mr_gellert John, this is a great opportunity.
john_locke How do they even know about me?
mr_gellert Well, they must have sent a rep to the science fair—your display at Costa Mesa.
john_locke I'm not a scientist! I like boxing and fishing and cars. I like sports!
mr_gellert I'm gonna tell you something—something I wish someone had told me at your age. You might not want to be that guy in the labs surrounded by test tubes and beakers, but that's who you are, John. You can't be the prom king. You can't be the quarterback. You can't be a superhero.
john_locke Don't tell me what I can't do.
frank_lapidus Why didn't you tell me?
michael_dawson Tell you what?
frank_lapidus That you're a survivor of 815.
michael_dawson Aa 'cause you wouldn't have believed me.
frank_lapidus You didn't think I'd believe you? I tell you that I'm one of the only people in the world that think that that plane on the bottom of the ocean is a hoax, and you didn't think I'd believe you?
michael_dawson I didn't know if I could trust you. Your boss put that plane there.
frank_lapidus Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy, but you got me beat there.
michael_dawson Listen to me. Listen to me. You can't fly that guy back—Keamy.
frank_lapidus You let me worry about Keamy, all right?
michael_dawson You can't fly him back! He is gonna kill everyone on that Island. Everyone. And you don't want that on your conscience, man. Trust me.
frank_lapidus Hey, boss. Just getting him down to the engine room.
captain_gault Stay on a heading of exactly 3-0-5. Faraday says that's the only safe way to and from the boat.
sayid_jarrah What will you tell Keamy if he notices the Zodiac is missing?
captain_gault I'll tell him you stole it. Now go.
sayid_jarrah Desmond.
desmond_hume I can't go with you.
sayid_jarrah Why not?
desmond_hume I've been on that island for three years. I'm never setting foot on it again ... not when Penny's coming for me.
sayid_jarrah I'll be back with the first group as soon as I can.
desmond_hume Stay on that bearing, yeah?
sayid_jarrah I will.
captain_gault You need to go now.
john_locke Should be about 200 yards this way.
ben_linus You sure it's gonna be there, John?
john_locke I'm sorry?
ben_linus The cabin—what if it's moved again?
john_locke It hasn't moved because I was told that this is where it would be.
ben_linus I was told a lot of things too—that I was chosen, that I was special. Ended up with a tumor on my spine and my daughter's blood all over my hands.
john_locke I'm sorry those things happened to you, Ben.
ben_linus Those things had to happen to me. That was my destiny. But you'll understand soon enough that there are consequences to being chosen... because, destiny, John, is a fickle bitch.
hugo_reyes Guys? Cabin.
physical_therapist THERAPIST Okay, okay, okay. Good job, man. Good job, John. Okay, we'll try it some more tomorrow.
physical_therapist THERAPIST He's all yours. Come on up.
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 It's all right. Come on.
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 Don't give up, Mr. Locke.
john_locke Excuse me?
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 I'm just saying, don't give up. Anything's possible.
john_locke You should read my file. My spine was crushed. There's a 98% chance I'll never get any feeling back in my legs. So I don't know why I'm even trying to—
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 As a matter of fact, I did read your file. You survived falling eight stories out of a building. That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.
matthew_abaddon Let me ask you something. Do you believe in miracles?
john_locke No. I don't believe in miracles.
matthew_abaddon You should. I had one happen to me.
john_locke Hey, look. I just want to go back to my room.
matthew_abaddon You know what you need, Mr. Locke? You need to go on a walkabout.
john_locke Wha—what's a walkabout?
matthew_abaddon It's a journey of self-discovery. You go out into the Australian Outback with nothing more than a knife and your wits.
john_locke I can't "walkabout" anything. In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cripple.
matthew_abaddon Is that what you are, Mr. Locke? I went on my walkabout convinced I was one thing, but I came back another. I found out what I was made of, who I was.
john_locke And here you are, an orderly.
matthew_abaddon Oh, I'm a lot more than just an orderly, John.
matthew_abaddon When you're ready, Mr. Locke... you'll listen to what I'm saying. And then when you and me run into each other again... you'll owe me one.
omar_idris Hey, doc. Wanna hear something weird?
ray Ah, sure.
omar_idris You know that morse code message that I got from the beach? It said that the doctor washed up on the shore with his throat slit.
ray But I'm the doctor.
omar_idris Crazy, right?
martin_keamy Everything here?
omar_idris Yes sir.
martin_keamy Good. Get it packed up.
frank_lapidus What are you gonna do with all that?
martin_keamy Fire her up, Frank.
frank_lapidus Mr. Keamy, I was hired to fly scientists.
martin_keamy Get your ass in the cockpit and fire up the chopper, Frank.
frank_lapidus I'm not taking you.
martin_keamy I'll kill you, Frank.
frank_lapidus Yeah, well, you do that, you'll never get back to the island 'cause I'm the only pilot you got.
martin_keamy Sorry, Doc.
martin_keamy That change anything, Frank? Huh? Another 30 seconds goes by and someone else's turn—
captain_gault I fixed your gun. Now stand down, Martin, or I will fire.
martin_keamy I don't think you want to do that, Captain.
captain_gault What's that on his arm? What's that on his arm?!
martin_keamy Hey! What'll it be, Frank?
frank_lapidus We're flying.
martin_keamy Come on. Let's go, boys. Come on! Get the rest of the weapons onboard, and let's go. Let's go! Let's get out of here. Let's move out.
martin_keamy Thanks, Captain. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
dr_juliet_burke Hey! What did I say to you?
dr_jack_shephard You told me not to leave my tent. I was hungry.
dr_juliet_burke Jack, you have to rest. You can't run around. I know that it is hard for you to ask for help, but if you tear your stitches...
dr_jack_shephard Okay. Okay. I got it.
dr_juliet_burke Doctors make the worst patients.
dr_juliet_burke Jack!
dr_jack_shephard I think they want us to follow 'em.
john_locke All right. Let's do this.
ben_linus I'm not going in there with you.
john_locke What?
ben_linus The island wanted me to get sick and it wanted you to get well. My time is over, John. It's yours now.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I'm cool with you going in alone too.
ben_linus Good luck, John.
john_locke Are you Jacob?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 No. But I can speak on his behalf.
john_locke Well, who are you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode11 I'm Christian.
john_locke You know why I'm here?
dr_christian_shephard Yeah, sure. Do you?
john_locke I'm here... because I was chosen to be.
dr_christian_shephard That's absolutely right.
john_locke Claire?
claire_littleton Hi John.
john_locke What're you doing here?
claire_littleton Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm with him.
john_locke Wh—where's the baby?
dr_christian_shephard The baby's where he's supposed to be, and that's not here. It's probably best that you don't tell anyone that you saw her.
john_locke Why? Why is she—
dr_christian_shephard We don't have time for this. The people from the boat are already on their way back, and once they get here, all of these questions won't matter one bit. So why don't you ask the one question that does matter?
john_locke How do I save the island?
ben_linus Did he tell you what we're supposed to do?
john_locke He did.
ben_linus Well?
john_locke He wants us to move the island.
