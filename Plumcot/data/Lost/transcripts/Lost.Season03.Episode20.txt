MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Come on! Dammit, push!
dharma_worker Something's wrong! I can't...oh...
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Emily! You can do this! Now push, come on! Come on, baby. You can do it, now come on.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Come on, there you go. Come on.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 It's a boy! You did it.
emily_linus It hurts.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Oh...
emily_linus Roger, it hurts.
roger_linus Emily, no one knows we're out here. We gotta get back, okay, honey? Can you hold on to the baby? Emily! Can you hold the baby? Hold him tight.
roger_linus Help. Help! Help!
roger_linus Oh my God, help me.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 DRIVER Hey, what happened, man?
roger_linus We were hiking. She went into labor and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 DRIVER Okay, okay, look, we'll put her in the car, okay? Let me get you to the hospital.
roger_linus Oh, okay, okay, honey.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 DRIVER Okay, it's all right. Let's keep her warm, all right? How's the baby?
roger_linus Fine, I guess—I don't know.
emily_linus Roger? Roger.
roger_linus I'm right here.
emily_linus Call him Benjamin.
roger_linus Stay with me. Stay with me. Emily! Emily! Emily! Oh God, no!
richard_alpert What you got there?
ben_linus It's a birthday present. Mine just happens to be today. You do remember birthdays, don't you Richard?
richard_alpert So do you want me to bring the tape back to Juliet?
ben_linus What?
richard_alpert The tape with your instructions for Juliet, do you want me to bring it back to the medical station?
ben_linus I recorded it yesterday, before we left. I thought you already took it!
richard_alpert No.
ben_linus Where's Tom? Tom! Have you seen my recorder?
john_locke You said that if I killed my father, you'd tell me everything I wanted to know about the Island.
john_locke So why don't you start at the beginning?
ben_linus I know I promised to tell you everything, John, and I wish it was as simple as me taking out a dusty old book and opening it up.
ben_linus But it's not that simple.
john_locke How about you just tell me?
ben_linus You probably think I'm the leader of this little community, but that's not entirely true. We all answer to someone, John.
john_locke And whom might that be?
ben_linus His name is Jacob.
john_locke Okay, then. Take me to Jacob.
ben_linus I can't do that.
ben_linus Where are you going?
john_locke Hell, Ben, if you don't wanna take me, maybe someone else will. I'll just go and ask Richard...
ben_linus Why would Richard take you? He doesn't know where Jacob is. He doesn't talk to Jacob...
john_locke Well, who talks to him?
ben_linus I do.
john_locke So you're the only one who talks to him?
ben_linus That's right!
john_locke And no one else knows where he is?
ben_linus I was born here on this Island. I'm one of the last that was. Most of these people you see—I brought them here. So Jacob talks to me, John. He tells me what to do, trusts me.
john_locke And no one else has ever seen him?
ben_linus That's right.
john_locke How convenient. You know what I think, Ben? I think there is no Jacob. I think your people are idiots if they believe you take orders from someone else. You are the man behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz. And you're a liar.
ben_linus And what might you base that theory on, John?
john_locke Because if you were telling the truth, your hand wouldn't be shaking.
dharma_worker Namaste!
roger_linus Thanks.
dharma_worker Namaste!
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 DRIVER Hey, welcome to the Island, man! Namaste.
roger_linus Namaste, yeah!
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 DRIVER So, what do ya think?
roger_linus Wow, this is...some place. Thanks again for the opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.
horace_goodspeed GOODSPEED Horace! Please.
roger_linus Horace.
horace_goodspeed And this must be Ben.
roger_linus Yeah. Mr. Goodspeed was there the day you were born.
horace_goodspeed Yes, I was.
roger_linus He's doing us a big favor here. Gave your old man a job. Ah, he don't say much.
horace_goodspeed That's okay. I bet he will when he has something to say. Right, Ben? Hey, you hungry, kiddo? Huh, huh? Great. Well, I'll tell you what. After you're done processing, we'll have some lunch. How's that sound?
roger_linus Yeah, thank you.
horace_goodspeed You're gonna love it here.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Welcome to the Island. For your own comfort and safety, we ask that you stay within the confines of your new living quarters. Our Barracks are surrounded by a high frequency sonar fence, to protect us from the Island's abundant and diverse wildlife. You are now a member of the DHARMA Initiative...
roger_linus What kind of wildlife you think this fence is protecting us from?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Roger Linus? Roger Linus?
roger_linus Yeah.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 ...Every morning you will be given a new code which will allow you to cross outside the fences if you so desire... there are properties on this Island that exist nowhere else on Earth. Our mission is to study these properties for the betterment of mankind and advancement of world peace. Most of you will be working on the mainland. Should you be assigned zoological studies, the Pala Ferry will carry you to and from the Hydra 3 times a day...
GIRL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Hey. You're new, huh?
GIRL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 I'm Annie. Want one?
annie We can have as many as we want.
roger_linus Work man? What is this? Work man? I'm a janitor?!
OPAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.
roger_linus Goodspeed told me you people were doing experiments, changing the world. I didn't come here to clean up after ya!
OPAL#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Look, if anything else opens up, you can feel free to apply for it.
roger_linus Come on.
charlie_pace I think he'll grow out of it.
claire_littleton You don't think it's too big?
hugo_reyes Dude, you know what I'm saying? It can't be worse than haggis.
desmond_hume Oh I dunno, I could murder some haggis right now.
james_ford Hey! Sayid!
sayid_jarrah What happened to you?
james_ford I was with Locke.
sayid_jarrah Well, where is he?
james_ford He went back.
sayid_jarrah Back where?
james_ford With them. Don't ask me where the hell it is, 'cause it don't matter right now. What does matter , is this.
mikhail_bakunin Where is Ben?! Where is he?!
ben_linus I thought you were dead.
mikhail_bakunin I'm fortunate the pylons were not set to a lethal level.
mikhail_bakunin What is he doing here?
ben_linus It's all right.
mikhail_bakunin He's the one who tried to kill me!
ben_linus He's with us now. Where have you been, Mikhail?
mikhail_bakunin I encountered several of his people in the jungle. They had an injured woman with them. Apparently, she had just parachuted onto the Island.
ben_linus What?!
mikhail_bakunin Her helo crashed into water. She says her ship is approximately 130 clicks to the west of us. She has a radio telephone.
ben_linus Where is she now?
mikhail_bakunin I assume they have taken her back to their camp.
ben_linus We'll be visiting their camp day after tomorrow. We'll take care of it then.
mikhail_bakunin Day after tomorrow? We have to go now!
john_locke Ben's not going anywhere with you.
mikhail_bakunin Excuse me?
john_locke He and I are going to see Jacob.
mikhail_bakunin Please tell me this isn't true, Benjamin.
ben_linus I'm sorry, I have to deal with this now, John. Our excursion will have to wait.
mikhail_bakunin Since when do you explain yourself to him? An outsider-
ben_linus Tom? Richard?
john_locke So when do we leave?
ben_linus You know, you didn't have to beat Mikhail senseless to make your point, John.
john_locke Yes, I did.
alex_rousseau Locke.
alex_rousseau I hear you're gonna go see Jacob. You're gonna need this.
john_locke Thanks.
alex_rousseau Happy birthday, Dad.
olivia So, once water is added to the bicarbonate, we will get our very own volcanic reaction.
olivia Yes?
annie Is that what happened to the volcano on this Island?
olivia Exactly Annie, but that was a long time ago. Okay! Let's get ourselves an eruption.
olivia Just add water, and...voilà. Now I know it's not lava, but—
olivia Okay, everyone into your positions! That's right, all together. Annie, lock the back door please!
olivia Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move. Ben!
annie Come on!
annie Don't worry. It's just the Hostiles. We'll be okay.
horace_goodspeed Hey, man, heard you ran into a little trouble.
roger_linus We're driving back from the Flame and we hear this huge explosion. Next thing I know, there's a siren wailing, and we're driving through the middle of a shootout.
horace_goodspeed Look, we're having some skirmishes with the natives.
roger_linus What do you mean, "natives"?
horace_goodspeed Well, we're not exactly sure who they are.
roger_linus Oh, this ain't what I signed up for!
horace_goodspeed Roger, I did you a favor, man. You were having trouble finding work. And don't forget about Ben—he's getting a quality education here.
roger_linus I don't give a damn about his education! If I'm gonna get shot at, I want hazard pay! I want another thirty grand.
horace_goodspeed Calm down, man.
roger_linus And don't try to tell me you don't have it, you hear me?!
roger_linus All right, get the hell out of my house!
roger_linus I thought I told you to go to bed.
sayid_jarrah She's not here.
james_ford I noticed.
kate_austen What are you doing?
sayid_jarrah Looking for Juliet.
kate_austen Well, you're not gonna find her in there. She left with Jack.
sayid_jarrah Juliet left with Jack?
kate_austen He took off right after I told him about Naomi.
james_ford Who's Naomi?
sayid_jarrah And why would you do that, Kate?
kate_austen Because she's hurt, because he's a doctor, and because he has a right to know.
sayid_jarrah Where is he now?
kate_austen I dunno, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Of course you don't.
kate_austen You know, it might be time for you to tell everybody else about Naomi, too.
sayid_jarrah Play her the tape!
kate_austen What tape?
ben_linus Something you should know, John, before we go. Whether or not you think he's the Wizard of Oz, I can assure you that Jacob is very, very real. And we're gonna go see him, and he's not gonna like it. In fact, I have a feeling he's going to be very...angry. And that's why my hand was shaking, because this is not a man you go and see. This is a man who summons you.
john_locke Well, I guess there's a first time for everything.
annie It's us. That's you and that's me. Now we never have to be away from each other. Happy birthday, Ben.
ben_linus Thanks.
annie You're welcome.
roger_linus Wow... It's your birthday. Sorry I forgot. Kinda hard to celebrate on the day you killed your mom. She was just seven months pregnant. We went for a hike, but you had to come early. Now, she's gone. And I'm stuck here on this island...with you. Happy birthday, Ben.
ben_linus Mom?
emily_linus Ben, don't!
ben_linus Mom!
emily_linus It's not time yet, Benjamin.
ben_linus Mom!
ben_linus Let's go, John. John!
claire_littleton So, what, the whole world thinks we're dead?
sayid_jarrah That's not important right now.
sunhwa_kwon Not important?!
claire_littleton What do you mean it's not important, Sayid?
naomi_dorrit Excuse me. I'm sorry, don't you people want to be rescued?
sayid_jarrah We kept her a secret to keep her safe.
kate_austen Safe from what, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Safe from Jack. He spent a week with the Others, and he brought one of them back with him. Here, amongst us. And every time we try to get answers from this woman, he prevents her from giving them.
sunhwa_kwon But it's Jack! He would never do anything to hurt us. And Juliet? I believe she's a good person.
james_ford Good person, huh? You basing that on what? Wouldn't involve her taking you to one of their medical stations would it now, Mrs. Kwon?
sunhwa_kwon How—
dr_juliet_burke Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband, he was sterile before they got here.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 일이야?
dr_juliet_burke I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
dr_jack_shephard Where'd you get that?
sayid_jarrah Where have you been, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I asked you where you got it.
james_ford You really think you're in a position to be asking us questions?
dr_juliet_burke Turn the tape over.
james_ford Stay out of it.
dr_juliet_burke You wanna burn me at the stake, here I am, but first, turn the tape over, press play.
ben_linus Juliet, it's Ben. I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon the night after tomorrow. We won't have time to run Austen's sample, so if you determine that she or anyone else is pregnant, mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. Good luck.
dr_juliet_burke The night I saw your baby on the ultrasound, I told Jack what they were making me do.
sayid_jarrah Why didn't you tell us?
dr_jack_shephard Because I hadn't decided what to do about it yet.
sayid_jarrah "Yet"?
dr_jack_shephard I think we've got some catching up to do.
ben_linus Mom..? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom!
richard_alpert Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, I didn't mean to scare you. Wait, wait! Are you lost? Wait!
ben_linus Are you one of them?
richard_alpert One of whom?
ben_linus A hostile.
richard_alpert Do you even know what that word means? What's your name?
ben_linus Ben.
richard_alpert Ben? So you wanna tell me what you're doing in the middle of the jungle all by yourself?
ben_linus I left home, and...I'm looking for my Mom.
richard_alpert You think she's out here?
ben_linus You wouldn't believe me.
richard_alpert Try me.
ben_linus She's dead.
richard_alpert Did she die here, on the Island?
ben_linus No. When I was a baby.
richard_alpert Did you see her, out here, Ben, in the jungle?
ben_linus She talked to me.
richard_alpert What did she say?
ben_linus That I couldn't come with her. She said it wasn't time yet.
richard_alpert You should go home now, your people will be looking for you.
ben_linus I don't want to go back there! I hate it there! Take me with you.
richard_alpert Maybe that can happen, maybe. But if that's what you really want, Ben, if that's what you want, I want you to really think about that. And you're gonna have to be very, very patient.
ben_linus We're here.
ben_linus You'll wanna turn off your flashlight, John.
john_locke Why?
ben_linus Jacob feels the same way about technology as you do.
ben_linus Once I open this door, there's no turning back. You sure this is what you want?
ben_linus So be it. Jacob? I'm here with John Locke. We're coming in now.
ben_linus Jacob. This is John. Aren't you going to say hello, John?
john_locke What?
ben_linus I told you he wouldn't.
john_locke Who—what are you talking about?
ben_linus You can't see him?
john_locke See who?
ben_linus Jacob! He's sitting right here, in this chair! Yes, I know, but he insisted.
john_locke What is this?
ben_linus You wanted the secrets of the Island? Well, here they are. This is the man who can answer every single- I am not. He made me bring him here—do you think that that was my—sorry, may I finish?
john_locke You're crazy.
ben_linus Excuse me?
john_locke You don't know anything about the Island, do ya? You just...made it all up.
ben_linus Jacob, please, I can't hear him if you're gonna talk over what he's saying—
john_locke Stop. Stop. Shut up! You're putting on a show for me? Or do you...do you really think there's someone there?
ben_linus I know there's someone there!
john_locke You don't know anything.
ben_linus I'm sorry you feel that way, John. And I'm sorry that you're too limited to see.
john_locke You're pathetic.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode20 Help me.
john_locke What did you just say?
ben_linus I—I didn't say anything.
john_locke Oh yes you did. I heard you, you said...
ben_linus That's enough, you've had your fun!
john_locke What was that?
ben_linus That was Jacob.
ben_linus What did you hear in there, John? What did Jacob say to you?
john_locke He didn't say anything to me. You did.
ben_linus What are you talking about?
john_locke There is no Jacob, Ben. I'm not gonna be taken in by the little show you put on last night. You're a fraud. And it's time your people were told the truth. And this is not the way we came.
ben_linus I'm taking us back another way. I wanted to show you something first.
john_locke I've seen enough.
ben_linus You know, John, you're not wrong. Some of the things I've told you—some of the things I've told everybody—are simply not true.
john_locke Like what?
ben_linus Well, for starters, I wasn't born on this island.
john_locke Then where did you come from?
ben_linus That's what I wanna show you.
roger_linus Morning. Okay, wait. Put it right—right down there. What's the problem now? You're usually Chatty Cathy in the morning.
ben_linus It's my birthday. I dunno why I keep fooling myself into thinking that one of these years you're actually gonna remember.
roger_linus Well, I'll tell you what. All we gotta do this morning is run this stuff out to Pearl station. Why don't we go up to the mesa, drink some beers? Have some...I dunno, father and son time.
ben_linus I'd like that.
roger_linus Okay.
roger_linus Well, you sure can't say it ain't beautiful.
ben_linus Do you really blame me?
roger_linus What?
ben_linus Do you really think it's my fault that she died?
roger_linus What do I know...
roger_linus Why do you keep looking at your watch? You got a date? Listen...if it makes you feel any better, I will do my best to remember your birthday next year.
ben_linus I don't think that's going to happen, Dad.
roger_linus What do you mean?
ben_linus You know, I've missed her too. Maybe as much as you have. But the difference is, for as long as I can remember, I've had to put up with you. And doing that required a tremendous amount of patience.
ben_linus Goodbye, Dad.
roger_linus Ben?
richard_alpert You want us to, um...go get his body?
ben_linus No, leave him out there.
ben_linus This is where I came from, John. These are my people. The DHARMA Initiative. They came here seeking harmony, but they couldn't even coexist with the Island's original inhabitants. And when it became clear that one side had to go, one side had to be purged, I did what I had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch. Which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.
ben_linus What did Jacob say to you?
john_locke Why did you do this?
ben_linus Because you heard him. Now, I need to know what he said.
john_locke Help me...
ben_linus John, I'm not going to ask you again. What did he say to you?
john_locke He said, "Help me."
ben_linus Well, I certainly hope he helps you, John.
