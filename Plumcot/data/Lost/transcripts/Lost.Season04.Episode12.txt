pilot We got a little chop ahead.
pilot Put that away, man. You're freaking me out.
copilot We need this thing. With the cargo we got back there? Bad mojo.
pilot Ms. Decker?
mrs_paik DECKER Yes?
pilot Wanna head back there and let 'em know we're landing?
mrs_paik DECKER Sure. Of course.
mrs_paik DECKER We're coming in for a landing.
mrs_paik DECKER It's a military facility just west of Honolulu. It's completely private. Your—your families are already here. Now there's a lot of press that wanna speak to you, but as far as Oceanic is concerned, you don't have to speak to any reporters.
dr_jack_shephard We'll talk to 'em.
mrs_paik DECKER Is that all right with all of you?
dr_jack_shephard It's fine. We all agreed. We just—we just wanna get it over with.
mrs_paik DECKER Okay. Um, they're referring to you as the "Oceanic Six". That's not the best branding as far as we're concerned, but it's catchy. We'll see you on the ground.
dr_jack_shephard We all know the story. If we get any questions that we don't wanna answer, or that we can't answer, let's just keep our mouths shut. It's okay. They'll—they'll think that we're in shock.
sunhwa_kwon We are in shock, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Well... then this should be easy.
rose_nadler It was Sayid and—and Desmond in the helicopter, right? I mean, it had to be. Why else would they have dropped that thingamabob right over us?
sunhwa_kwon Then why wouldn't they just land?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know, but this thing is trackin' the chopper. So if they were on it, they want us to know where they're going.
sunhwa_kwon It's a phone, right? Can't we just call?
dr_jack_shephard Well?
dr_jack_shephard Don't try anything stupid.
dr_daniel_faraday Understood.
martin_keamy Put it down over there.
dr_juliet_burke Is that from the chopper?
dr_daniel_faraday Sh shh.
frank_lapidus We're still 5 klicks from the site.
martin_keamy I said put it down, Frank. Okay, gear up, boys. Soon as we hit the ground, we deploy to the Orchid. Heads down! Let's do this.
dr_jack_shephard You know what "the Orchid" is?
dr_juliet_burke No. I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.
dr_jack_shephard Kate. Wanna take a walk?
kate_austen Absolutely.
dr_jack_shephard I'll get the guns. You get some water, okay?
kate_austen Okay.
dr_juliet_burke You can't possibly be serious. You just had surgery, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I'm gonna be fine.
dr_juliet_burke If your sutures rip, you're not gonna be fine.
dr_jack_shephard I can't just sit around waiting.
dr_juliet_burke Recovery is not "sitting around"!
dr_jack_shephard Look, I have to do this.
dr_juliet_burke Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because I promised those people that I would get 'em off this island.
dr_juliet_burke Don't bleed to death, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I'll see ya in a couple hours.
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel? What's wrong?
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte, did you hear what he said? They're going to the Orchid. They're using the secondary protocol.
dr_charlotte_lewis What are you talking about?
dr_daniel_faraday We have to get off this island. Right now.
dr_jack_shephard We're catchin' up. The chopper must've landed.
kate_austen Why don't you take a break?
kate_austen You're bleeding.
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm not bleeding. I'm... I'm suppurating. It's... discharge. My body's just fightin' the infection around the stitches.
kate_austen You know when most people are lying and they can't look you in the eye? You do the exact opposite.
miles_straume Hey, long time no see.
james_ford Hey, who are you talkin' to up there, Genghis?
dr_jack_shephard Where's Claire?
james_ford We lost her.
dr_jack_shephard You what??
james_ford She just walked off in the middle of the night. We looked for her for a day, but she was just gone. I was hopin' maybe she went back to the beach.
dr_jack_shephard She didn't.
james_ford Well, what are y'all doin' out here? What's that phone for?
dr_jack_shephard The chopper flew over the beach. Someone tossed this out. It must've been Sayid.
james_ford Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid, 'cause if he's with those animals that just blew up half of New Otherton, you do not wanna tussle with 'em.
kate_austen What, they tried to kill you?
james_ford Just like Locke said they would.
dr_jack_shephard So... what? We're supposed to just... turn around and hide? 'Cause it seems like that didn't work so well for you.
james_ford I'm sorry, Doc, maybe this is déjà vu, but didn't you just do the whole "run through the jungle with a walkie" plan?
dr_jack_shephard That helicopter is our only way off this island.
james_ford What's with you and "gettin' off the island"? You're like a damn broken record.
kate_austen Stop it! Are you two fightin' each other now?
dr_jack_shephard Look. I put Sayid and Desmond on that chopper. It was my call. It's my responsibility. I'm going after it whether they're on it or not. You can all head back to the beach.
kate_austen Jack... no, no, no. You can't go by yourself.
dr_jack_shephard Take care of the baby. Okay?
james_ford That son of a bitch is stubborn.
james_ford Hold up! You don't get to die alone.
mrs_paik DECKER Based on the location of the wreckage, our best estimate of the crash site is... here. From there, the survivors were carried by the ocean's current to... here—an uninhabited island in the Lesser Sunda Islands known as Membata. As you've all read in your briefing books, on day 103... a typhoon washed up the remnants of an Indonesian fishing boat, including basic supplies and a survival raft. On day 108, the remaining six survivors, including Ms. Austen's baby which she gave birth to on the island of Membata, used this raft to journey here— an island called Sumba. They then came ashore near a village called Manukangga. This photo was taken by the local fisherman who found them. Once it was discovered who they were, they were transported to Honolulu by the U.S. Coast Guard. As you can imagine, this has been an extraordinarily trying experience. They have, however, agreed to answer a few questions. So, ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of Oceanic 8-1-5.
mrs_paik DECKER Yes.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 Dr. Shephard! Dr. Shephard! Can you tell us what it was like when the plane hit the ocean? Uh, how you survived.
dr_jack_shephard Um...
dr_jack_shephard It—it all happened really fast. I remember the impact. I remember the—the plane filling up with water. A group of us got to the emergency door, and, um... got out before it went down.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 And those of you who survived—you swam to the island?
dr_jack_shephard No. We had, uh, cushions. We had some life jackets. We were in the water for over a day before the current took us in. By then, there was only eight of us left.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 What happened to the other three?
dr_jack_shephard One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle, suffered tremendous internal injuries and died a few days after the crash. A woman, Libby, she didn't make it through the first week. Charlie Pace, he drowned a few weeks before we were able to leave.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 Over here! Over here, please! Considering the ordeal that you've all been through, you look pretty healthy having been on an island for more than a hundred days.
hugo_reyes Was that directed at me, Dude?
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 Well, actually, Mr. Reyes, you were worth more than $150 million at the time of your... death. How does it feel to know you're going to get all that money back?
hugo_reyes I don't want it back, any of it. That money was bad luck.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 KOREAN REPORTER 권선화 씨, 섬에서 사망한 사람 중 한 명이 당신의 남편이 맞습니까?
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #2 What did she say?
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #3 Can somebody translate that?
sunhwa_kwon She asked if my husband was one of the people who died on the island.
sunhwa_kwon The answer is no. He never made it off the plane.
arabic_reporter REPORTER Are you aware of the situation in Iraq, Mr. Jarrah? Do you have any plans to return?
sayid_jarrah There is nothing for me in Iraq.
arabic_reporter REPORTER Mr Shephard, now that you are home, what are your plans?
dr_jack_shephard I haven't really thought too much about it, uh—my father died in Sydney, I was bringing him home for the funeral when the plane crashed. Even though the body is...—I'd like to put him to rest.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #4 Ms. Austen...
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #4 What was it like giving birth on the island?
kate_austen Scary.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #4 Your son—uh, Aaron? How old is he now?
kate_austen He's just a little over 5 weeks.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #4 So that would've made you about six months pregnant when the U.S. Marshal service apprehended you in Australia for an outstanding murder warrant. Is that correct?
mrs_paik DECKER Uh, I'm afraid Ms. Austen's legal issue is off the table. Next question.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 REPORTER #1 Mr. Jarrah, given the amazing circumstances surrounding the survival of you six, is it possible there are any other survivors from the crash yet to be discovered?
sayid_jarrah No. Absolutely not.
dr_jack_shephard You did good.
mrs_paik DECKER Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman outside. She says she knows you, but she wasn't on the list of family members. Her name is a Noor Abed Jaseem.
sayid_jarrah Nadia? Nadia.
sayid_jarrah Hey! Over here!
sunhwa_kwon Sayid! Where's Desmond?
sayid_jarrah He's fine. He's on the freighter. Listen, I'm going to start taking people back—six at a time. We have to go right now before the helicopter gets back to the boat.
dr_juliet_burke Why do we have to go to the boat before the chopper gets back?
sayid_jarrah Because the men on that helicopter have every intention of killing us all.
sayid_jarrah What?
dr_juliet_burke Jack and Kate just went running after it.
hugo_reyes So when is someone gonna tell me where we're going?
ben_linus We're going to a place called the Orchid, Hugo.
hugo_reyes And what's that?
ben_linus It's a greenhouse.
hugo_reyes And why are we going to a greenhouse exactly?
ben_linus You heard John. We're going to move the island.
hugo_reyes Right. And how are we gonna do that?
ben_linus Very carefully.
hugo_reyes Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?
ben_linus Because doing it is both dangerous and unpredictable. It's a measure of last resort.
hugo_reyes Awesome.
john_locke Allow me.
ben_linus May I have that mirror, please?
ben_linus You know, those are 15 years old.
hugo_reyes What are you doing, Dude?
ben_linus Communicating.
john_locke Communicating with who?
ben_linus Who do you think?
ben_linus All right. Now we can go.
john_locke Wait. What was that? What did you tell them?
ben_linus None of your business, John.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, Sayid, listen. If you wanna run off into the jungle after the chopper, you should do that. But in the meantime, we need to get these people off this island.
sayid_jarrah I won't be long. If I can catch up with Jack and Kate—
dr_daniel_faraday I can start ferrying people now. I can get them there safely. By the time you get back, I can have most of these people on our boat.
sayid_jarrah I trust you know the bearing. You'd better get going.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you. All right, first group in the raft. We can fit six.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, okay, hold on. Sun is pregnant. You should go first.
kate_austen Sayid? What are you doing here? Jack thought that you—
sayid_jarrah I know what he thought. That's why I'm going after him. How far ahead is he?
kate_austen I don't know. He's—he's with Sawyer. I left them about an hour ago. Jack's got a sat phone, and they're headed for the helicopter. I can track them. Look, you are not gonna catch up to them unless I go with you.
sayid_jarrah Let's go.
kate_austen Okay. Sun.
sunhwa_kwon Where's Claire?
kate_austen Get Aaron on the boat, okay?
sunhwa_kwon What?
kate_austen It's all right. Just... I'll see you there.
kate_austen Just keep him safe!
sunhwa_kwon Shh.
dr_daniel_faraday All right, this is just the first trip. Here we go.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 Okay.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 You okay?
dr_daniel_faraday Okay.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 Okay.
jinsoo_kwon 이 섬을 벗어나게 해 준다고 내가 약속했지.
woojung_paik 어떻게 된 거야?
UNDERLING#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 누가 했는지 모르겠지만요, 다른 은행을 다섯 군데나 썼습니다.
woojung_paik 당장 가서 윤을 데리고 와! 어서!
sunhwa_kwon 아버지, 제가 방해한 건 아니죠?
woojung_paik 아니다. 항상 사업 상 하는 일인데 뭘.
sunhwa_kwon 무슨 일이라도 있으세요?
woojung_paik 내가 말해 줘도 넌 이해하기 힘든 복잡한 회사 일이야. 그래, 몸은 좀 어떠냐?
sunhwa_kwon 아버지가 진수 씨를 얼마나 싫어했는지 다 알고 있는데... 새삼스럽게 아이에게 관심있는 척 하지 마세요.
woojung_paik 너 지금 뭐라고 했냐?
sunhwa_kwon 제 뜻 아시잖아요. 진수 씨를 증오하셨잖아요.
woojung_paik 너 지금 누구한테 함부로! 난 니 아버지야! 버르장머리라고는 하나도 없이!
sunhwa_kwon 오세아닉 항공사로부터 상당한 금액의 합의금을 받았어요. 그 돈으로 오늘 아침에 아버지 회사 지분 반을 구입했고요. 이제부터는 저를 동업자로 존중해 주셔야겠죠.
woojung_paik 뭐? 너... 뭐 때문에?
sunhwa_kwon 제 남편 인생도 망가뜨리고, 그런 아버지 때문에 우리가 그 비행기를 탄거라고요. 그러니까 전 아버지 하고 또 다른 사람이 진수 씨 죽음에 책임 있다고 생각해요.
sunhwa_kwon 우선 이 아이를 낳고 나서 이 회사 미래는 그때 가서 얘기하죠. 우리 회사에 대해서.
hugo_reyes Mom? Dad?
hugo_reyes Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh?
hugo_reyes Hello?
hugo_reyes Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?
all@ Surprise! Happy birthday!
carmen_reyes Happy birthday!
david_reyes Happy birthday, Hugo!
carmen_reyes Hugo, what are you doing with that?
hugo_reyes I don't know. I thought there might be a prowler or something.
carmen_reyes Jesus Christ is not a weapon. Okay. Enjoy your party.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode12 Wwhoo! Happy birthday!
hugo_reyes No way.
kate_austen Happy birthday, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hey, Kate.
kate_austen Hey.
hugo_reyes Hey, little buddy.
kate_austen Say hi. Jack's running late. Sorry.
noor_abed_jaseem Happy birthday, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Wow, you guys are here.
sayid_jarrah Interesting choice of theme.
hugo_reyes Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, Dude.
david_reyes Hey! How's everybody doing? What are you talking about? Building a fire or huntin' boars? I guess not. Uh, listen. Uh, do you mind, uh, excusing us for a little while? I-I wanna show you your birthday present. Hmm? Come on. Bye-bye now.
hugo_reyes I told you I don't want anything.
david_reyes Hugo, it's your birthday. You gotta get somethin'.
hugo_reyes Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.
david_reyes Relax. I got this before you gave us the money. Ta-da! Check it out.
hugo_reyes You fixed it.
david_reyes Yeah. After the crash, I—I worked on it as a memorial to you. When I was fixing it up, it was almost like I was with ya. But now you're back, and it's all yours. Wanna take her for a little spin?
david_reyes Is somethin' wrong, son?
hugo_reyes Is this some kind of joke?
david_reyes What are you talking about?
hugo_reyes 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Did you do this?
david_reyes Do what?
hugo_reyes Those are the numbers! Right there! The numbers I won the lottery with!
david_reyes Wow. What—what a coincidence.
hugo_reyes No. No, not a coincidence. I don't want this. I don't want any of it!
david_reyes Hugo? Wait—wait a minute. Hugo, what are you... son! Hey!
david_reyes Hugo! Hugo! Hugo, where you goin'? Come on! Hugo!
hugo_reyes Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah, I get it. It's really dangerous and unpredictable. But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island. Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?
ben_linus Yes, I suppose they would.
hugo_reyes Well, isn't that, you know, a problem?
ben_linus I'm working on it.
hugo_reyes Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!
john_locke I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Hugo.
ben_linus May I have the binoculars, please? You might wanna get down lower to the ground.
john_locke And why might we wanna do that?
ben_linus Because we're at the Orchid.
john_locke What are we waitin' for?
ben_linus We're waiting, John, because Charles Widmore, the man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you, knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside.
john_locke I thought you said you had no idea why he was trying to find he island.
ben_linus I wasn't being entirely truthful.
john_locke Yeah. When are you ever entirely truthful?
ben_linus You need to see this.
john_locke What am I looking for?
ben_linus Look over there on the left-hand side. Watch the plants at the back.
john_locke I don't see any—
ben_linus They're already here.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, hey! Hey, we're back!
desmond_hume Where's Sayid?
dr_daniel_faraday He had to go after Jack. You go. They're headed for the chopper.
desmond_hume You okay?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm gonna head back for the next group.
michael_dawson Engine's fixed. Tell Hendricks to try it.
desmond_hume Okay, engine should be working.
hendricks Indeed they are.
desmond_hume All right, well, take us to the island.
desmond_hume But make sure you—you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5. It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5.
hendricks We've got some kind of RF interference with the the fathometer. I can't see the reef, mate.
desmond_hume RF interference? How is that possible? The radio room's down.
hendricks I don't know, but something on this boat is broadcasting. If we don't turn it off, I'm not going any closer than 5 miles off the coast.
desmond_hume Then I'll find it.
james_ford Cut yourself shavin'?
dr_jack_shephard Juliet took out my appendix a couple of days ago.
james_ford You kiddin' me.
dr_jack_shephard Nope.
james_ford Well, what else did I miss?
dr_jack_shephard We're here.
frank_lapidus Ah!
dr_jack_shephard Lapidus!
frank_lapidus Yeah!
james_ford You know this yahoo?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
frank_lapidus "Yahoo"? This yahoo dropped that phone on you guys so you could find me—
frank_lapidus —and I could fly you outta here. So why don't you do me a favor and get in that back compartment? There's a toolbox. See if you can find something to get me outta these things.
dr_jack_shephard You heard the man.
james_ford Well, all right. Can I get you boys a nice, cold glass of lemonade while I'm back there?
dr_jack_shephard Where are Desmond and Sayid?
frank_lapidus Your buddies were smart enough to keep their asses on the boat because right now that's the safest place to be. Because when the boys that I brought over here come stompin' out of this jungle, you're gonna wanna be long gone.
dr_jack_shephard Where'd they go?
frank_lapidus They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to snatch Linus.
dr_jack_shephard Soon as we cut you free, you'll be able fly us out of here?
frank_lapidus Hell, yeah.
james_ford Hang on, Shaggy. You said the hit squad's gonna grab Ben Linus?
frank_lapidus Well, I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.
james_ford What are they gonna do with the people that are with him?
frank_lapidus Nothin' good.
james_ford Hugo's with Ben.
dr_jack_shephard Son of a bitch.
dr_jack_shephard About ten months ago, I wrote what I wanted to say at my father's funeral on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Sydney airport. I don't remember what I wrote, but whatever it was... he would've hated it.
dr_jack_shephard My father couldn't stand eulogies. "The only good thing about a wake is the free booze", he'd say.
dr_jack_shephard Not much of a wake because I won't even be able to bury him. So... What I wanna say is not for my father. It's for me. Good-bye, dad. I loved you. I miss you.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks very much for coming.
margo_shephard Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you.
margo_shephard Thank you for coming.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
margo_shephard I'll see you back at the house?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
margo_shephard I love you, sweetheart.
dr_jack_shephard I love you, Mom.
margo_shephard I'm so glad you're home.
dr_jack_shephard I'll see you soon.
margo_shephard Okay.
kate_austen You did that well.
dr_jack_shephard Had a lot of practice.
carole_littleton Excuse me. May I have a word with you? Mr. Shephard... I'm very sorry for your loss.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you. How did you know my father?
carole_littleton I believe I'm the reason he was in Australia when he died.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would he have come to see you?
carole_littleton Oh, he... he didn't come to see me. I was still in the hospital. I never saw him. He came to see his daughter. My daughter, Mr. Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard My father didn't have a daughter—
carole_littleton Yes. He did. If you don't believe me, check his phone records. Would you like to know the—the strangest thing about all this, Mr. Shephard? My daughter was on your plane, too. She was on flight 8-1-5. You were in the air for six hours, probably just a few rows from her and you never even knew she was your sister. she was one of the ones who died when your plane hit the water. Her name was... Claire. I didn't mean to burden you with this, but... you needed to know. I'm... sorry for your loss.
carole_littleton Your son is beautiful.
kate_austen Thank you.
sunhwa_kwon I don't understand. How'd you get back to New York?
michael_dawson Uh, Walt and I, uh, uh... we took Ben's boat and we followed his bearing. A couple of days, we came to an island, you know, with people. I sold the boat... we hopped a cargo ferry back to the States. Didn't tell anybody who we were.
sunhwa_kwon And now you're working for Ben?
michael_dawson I do not work for Ben. I'm trying to make up for what I did. I'm trying to help you out here. Translate what I said.
jinsoo_kwon I understand.
desmond_hume Hey! Michael! I need you now!
michael_dawson Oh, my God.
jinsoo_kwon 아기 데리고 위에 가서 기다려. Now.
sayid_jarrah What's the matter?
kate_austen These aren't Jack or Sawyer. They're different tracks, fresh... and they're doubling back behind us.
sayid_jarrah Whoever you are, come out now!
richard_alpert All right. All right, let's just relax. All right, let's—let's just rel—let's relax.
kate_austen Stop! Stop!
richard_alpert Just relax. Put the guns down. Pl—
kate_austen I said stop right there!
richard_alpert Please just drop your guns.
sayid_jarrah Take one more step—
richard_alpert I said drop your guns.
john_locke I see two of them, but not the one who killed Alex.
ben_linus He's there. Hold on to that for me, will you?
john_locke What?
ben_linus Listen to me very carefully, John, because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this. You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there. Once inside, you're gonna turn left. Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left. They're in an alcove against the north wall. Face the wall, reach down with your left hand. You'll find a switch that activates the elevator. The elevator takes you down to the actual Orchid station.
hugo_reyes Whoa. Wait. What?
john_locke Okay, I'm sorry, Ben, but maybe I missed the part where you explained what I'm supposed to do about the armed men inside.
ben_linus I'm gonna take care of them.
john_locke And how the hell are you gonna do that?
ben_linus How many times do I have to tell you, John? I always have a plan.
john_locke Ben! Ben!
ben_linus My name is Benjamin Linus. I believe you're looking for me.
