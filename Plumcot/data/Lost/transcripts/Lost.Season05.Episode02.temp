HURLEY Dude, they'll find out.
JACK Not if we stick to the story.
SAYID I don't know, Jack. It could be a risk.
JACK It's the only way. We have to do this.
LAPIDUS They're still at it, huh?
JACK Look, we're running out of time. We gotta make a decision now. So are we all okay with this?
SAYID This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives. I'm not taking it lightly.
JACK Kate?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Sun?
JACK Frank?
LAPIDUS What?
JACK Sorry you got dragged into this, but we need to know that you're with us.
LAPIDUS Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.
JACK Hurley, what about you?
HURLEY I don't think we should lie, dude.
JACK We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
HURLEY How does lying protect them?
JACK It protects them from Charles Widmore. The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us. He faked a plane crash. I mean, you think telling him the truth, he's just gonna—he's gonna leave them alone?
HURLEY Look, he's your dad, right? Can't you just, like... call him off?
PENNY There's no calling my father off.
HURLEY But he'll never find them. I mean, the Island disappeared. We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!
JACK You think anyone's gonna believe that... believe any of it? They're gonna think you're crazy.
HURLEY Not if someone backs me up. Sayid, come on. They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth. But what if we all do? And if we can stick together, we can make 'em believe us. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying. Do you?
SAYID No. But... I don't believe we have a better choice.
SAYID Sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
HURLEY You know what, dude? I'm gonna remember this. And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now... you're not gettin' it.
HURLEY Wake up, Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, wake up! Sayid!
HURLEY No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!
HURLEY What am I supposed to do?!
HURLEY Okay, okay, okay. Just stay calm.
ANA LUCIA What the hell were you thinking?
HURLEY Ana Lucia?
ANA LUCIA You were driving like a maniac. And why'd you pull over?
HURLEY I just... I—I thought—
ANA LUCIA You didn't think. What if I were real? What if a real cop stopped you? They already have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
HURLEY Actually, it's ketchup. We went to a—a drive-thru, and, uh...
ANA LUCIA Well, you need to pull it together. You've got a lot of work to do.
HURLEY I do?
ANA LUCIA Let's start with the basics. First off, you need new clothes. Then you need to go to a safe place. And take Sayid to somebody you trust. You getting all this?
HURLEY Yeah.
ANA LUCIA Then get to it. And stay away from the cops.
ANA LUCIA Do not get arrested.
HURLEY Thanks, Ana Lucia.
ANA LUCIA Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.
HURLEY Well... you heard her.
ROSE You really think that thing's gonna work?
BERNARD Rose, I told you a hundred times. Of course it's gonna work. Yes. I worked hard on it. It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
ROSE Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do, is rub—
BERNARD Yeah? Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?
ROSE Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside. That's gonna smother the leaves.
BERNARD Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.
FROGURT Fire? Who cares about fire? Any minute the sky could light up, and who the hell knows what could happen this time?
ROSE Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control. You are either gonna help or be quiet!
SAWYER Whose shirt is this?
FROGURT It's mine.
SAWYER Can I have it?
FROGURT What does it matter? We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
SAWYER I'll take that as a "yes," Frogurt.
FROGURT It's Neil.
SAWYER Yeah, yeah.
SAWYER Still in one piece?
JULIET As far as I can tell.
SAWYER I figured it would've disappeared with the rest of our stuff.
JULIET I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
SAWYER What?
JULIET Look who's back.
SAWYER Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
MILES I think it's Mr. Wizard.
SAWYER Shut up. You've been gone for two hours. What the hell were you doing?
FARADAY Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I... left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back I—I—I just—it was a while before I realized that I was just... uh, I was really lost.
SAWYER Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
FARADAY I don't know.
SAWYER Well, you at least got a plan?
JULIET I think we should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
FARADAY No. No, no, no. We can't just sail out on any course. For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, and, uh, to do that...
FARADAY ...I need to determine where we are now... in time.
CHARLOTTE And what are the rest of us supposed to do?
MILES I'm gonna go find us something to eat.
JULIET And how are you planning on doing that?
MILES Don't worry about it.
JULIET I guess we'll get the water.
HURLEY Dude, wake up! Come on. I can't do this on my own!
HURLEY I promise I'll pay you back.
HURLEY Wait right here.
 my Wirehaired" shirt for a yellow one that says "I my Shih-Tzu".]
CLERK Shih Tzus?
HURLEY I like Shih Tzus.
CLERK It looks like you "heart" them.
CLERK Rough night?
HURLEY Yeah.
CLERK Your friend's pretty wasted.
HURLEY Yeah.
CLERK I know you from somewhere, don't I?
HURLEY No.
CLERK I think I do. Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
HURLEY I just have one of those faces.
CLERK You're lying.
HURLEY I don't believe in lying.
CLERK I remember! You're the guy who won the lottery... and crashed in that plane!
HURLEY No. I must look like him.
CLERK You're him. Hey! Buy a ticket here. If you win, we get a commission. You're good luck.
HURLEY Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change.
HURLEY Okay. Okay, we're outta here.
AARON Mommy, I wanna go home.
KATE Look at your book, baby.
KATE Hello? .... I—I can't believe it's you. .... No. Hi. How are you? ... Wait, you're in L.A.? ... Of course I can meet, yeah. What... I know exactly where that is. I'll be there in half an hour.
AARON Mommy, where are we going?
KATE To see a friend.
BEN You looking for your pills, Jack? I flushed them down the toilet.
JACK Thank you. I was just gonna do that myself.
BEN Yeah, I figured you were.
JACK Going somewhere?
BEN I'm checking out.
JACK Where are we going?
BEN You're going home. And find yourself a suitcase. If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there... because you're never coming back.
JACK Good. 
BEN Good. I'll pick you up in six hours.
JACK And where will you be going?
BEN John's casket is outside in a carpet van. I need to move it somewhere safe.
JACK Safe? He's dead, isn't he?
BEN I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
DAVID Mmm.
DAVID Mmm.
ANNOUNCER Previously on Exposé...
WOMAN 1 It looks like the Scorpion is taking over all the Cobra's business.
WOMAN 2 You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
WOMAN 1 Yeah.
WOMAN 2 I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work Stage 3.
MAN She's hit!
DAVID Hmm.
HURLEY Hey, Dad. How's it going?
HURLEY You seen the news?
DAVID No. I just got up. Why, are you wanted again?
HURLEY Uh, yeah. Kinda. Is Mom here?
DAVID No, she's out shopping. Hey, set him over there. Oh, man, he's out.
HURLEY Is he... breathing?
DAVID Barely. What happened?
HURLEY He got shot by a dart.
DAVID Dart? What, were you in the zoo or something?
HURLEY No, we were at the safe house.
DAVID Safe house?
HURLEY Sayid took me there to protect me. Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts, and now he's—he's in a coma or something.
DAVID Hugo, this doesn't make sense. And what are you doing out of the mental institution?
HURLEY Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. We both are.
DAVID Danger from who?
HURLEY I'm not sure exactly.
DAVID Hello?
DETECTIVE Mr. and Mrs. Reyes? L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?
DAVID Just what kind of trouble are you in?
HURLEY Dad, please! Just don't tell 'em I'm here!
DAVID All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.
DETECTIVE Well, give us a call if you hear anything. We really appreciate it.
DAVID Thanks, bye-bye. I'll have to tell him.
DAVID You killed three people?
HURLEY No. Sayid did.
DAVID Oh. Well, that's better. Come on. Let's get him to the couch.
HURLEY He saved me.
DAVID I think we should call a lawyer—right now.
HURLEY No, no, no. We can't go public. They're after us.
DAVID Who? Who is after you?
HURLEY I don't know. Sayid knows. He can explain.
DAVID Sayid ain't explaining nothing. We need to get him to a hospital.
HURLEY Did you not hear me? People are trying to kill us. We go to a hospital, they'll find us! Like—like The Godfather. It's the last place you go. Everyone knows it. Wh—they—they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident. Sayid, please wake up!
DAVID That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.
HURLEY I think I know what to do.
AARON Mommy, Mommy, can I push the button?
KATE Sure you can, sweetie. But we're all the way to the top, okay?
KATE So I want you to press number 3-1. You see it? You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.
KATE Yeah! That's the one! You pressed it! You pressed it!
KATE Hi.
SUN Hello, Kate.
JILL Have a nice day. I'll be right with you.
JILL Hello, Ben. If it's the Porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
BEN No, no Porterhouse. I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me.
JILL Is it what I think it is?
BEN It is.
JILL He'll be safe with me.
BEN Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
JILL Yeah. Everything's moving right on schedule. How's it going with Shephard?
BEN He's with us.
JILL Really? What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?
BEN Cut the man some slack. He's been through a lot. We all have.
JILL Right. Of course. Sorry.
BEN So keep him safe, Jill. Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all.
ROSE Aah! Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it! You got it. You got it.
MAN All right! Finally we got...
ROSE Why did you do that?
BERNARD Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.
FROGURT I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.
ROSE And I thought you said you didn't care.
FROGURT I care about surviving.
ROSE I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.
ROSE You'll get it, Bernard. You will.
BERNARD Yeah. All right.
ROSE Just—just try again.
CHARLOTTE Hey.
FARADAY Hey. Give me one second.
CHARLOTTE I got you something.
FARADAY Ooh. Hey.
CHARLOTTE I found these in the jungle.
FARADAY Look at that. Thank you.
CHARLOTTE There was only two, but I thought we could both do with a bite to eat. 
FARADAY Thank you very much, very much.
FARADAY You all right?
CHARLOTTE I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache. 
FARADAY Well... I'm sure it'll pass.
CHARLOTTE No, it's not just that. It's the weirdest thing. Earlier, I was... I was thinking about my mom, and all of sudden, I—I couldn't remember her maiden name. I mean, isn't that odd?
FARADAY Don't worry about it. Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress. Okay?
CHARLOTTE Daniel... do you know what's happening to me?
MILES Dinner!
BERNARD That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?
MILES I found it.
SAWYER What do you mean you "found" it?
MILES It died in the jungle. I found it. Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.
MALE SURVIVOR What?
MILES Who's got a knife?
FROGURT A knife? You need a knife? Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
MILES What's your problem?
FROGURT My problem is, we don't have a knife. W—we don't have anything. And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 'cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.
SAWYER Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.
FROGURT It's Neil, you inbred!
FROGURT And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed! We're all screwed!
JULIET Calm down, Neil. We're gonna get through this.
FROGURT How are any of us gonna get through this?! Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!
FROGURT Aah!
SAWYER Run!
SAWYER Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!
CHARLOTTE Ow! Dan!
WOMAN Keep moving!
MAN Aah! Uhh!
ANOTHER MAN Uhh! Uhh!
SAWYER Come on. He's dead.
JULIET No!
SAWYER Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!
SAWYER There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!
HURLEY Dude, they're on a stakeout?
DAVID You just escaped from a mental institution. There's dead bodies everywhere! Of course they're on a stakeout! They think you're crazy enough to come back home. S—so are you... crazy?
HURLEY Do you think I am?
DAVID Well, either that or you're lying to me.
HURLEY I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
DAVID W—well, what is it?
CARMEN Why there is a dead Pakistani on my couch?!
HURLEY He's not dead, Ma.
CARMEN Well, he's not breathing.
HURLEY He's not?!
DAVID It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.
CARMEN A plan? What are you talking about?
HURLEY He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.
CARMEN Hugo, what's happening?
HURLEY Mom, please!
CARMEN No "Mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news? Do you know what they are telling about you?
HURLEY Yeah, Mom. I know. Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.
CARMEN It better!
DAVID Officers.
KATE So how long are you in L.A.?
SUN Just a few days. I have some business to attend to. But I wanted to see you.
SUN Here it is. Her name's Ji Yeon. Here's a baby picture.
KATE Oh! She's beautiful.
SUN Thank you. She's with her grandmother in Seoul. I hope someday you get to meet her. It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
KATE Yeah.
SUN Kate? Are you all right?
KATE Yeah. I'm fine.
SUN Are you?
KATE Somebody knows we're lying.
SUN What?
KATE Some lawyers came to see me.
SUN Who?
KATE Two men. They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample. Some kind of lawsuit. They wanted to test to see if... to see if Aaron's my son.
SUN Who did these lawyers represent?
KATE I don't know. They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
SUN Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
KATE How do you know?
SUN Because if they were, they would just do it. They wouldn't come to you in private. They don't care that we're lying. They just want Aaron.
KATE But who... who would do that? We—
SUN I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
KATE What do you mean, "take care of them"?
SUN Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
KATE What kind of a person do you think I am?
SUN Jin! Jin!
SUN The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
KATE You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin.
SUN Like you did on the freighter. You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
JACK We gotta get outta here!
KATE Sun, I hope you don't think...
SUN But you did what you had to do. And if you hadn't... we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.
KATE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
KATE I... 
SUN I don't blame you.
SUN So... How's Jack?
DAVID Hugo said I could trust you. I wasn't so sure. But he swore I could, so... can I?
JACK Yes. Of course.
DAVID All right.
JACK What happened to him?
DAVID Hugo said he got hit with some dart. Must've been some drugs or something.
JACK And where is Hurley right now?
DAVID At our house, freaking out.
JACK Let me get my car. Help me move him over. I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.
DAVID No. No, H—Hugo said that whoever did this—they'll come back after him.
JACK All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, so I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.
DAVID All right, fine. Take him to the hospital. But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shephard, when this is over, you're gonna do something for me.
JACK What?
DAVID Stay away from Hugo. Whatever it is you talked him into, something tells me you don't have his best interests at heart. So stay away from my son.
BEN Hello?
JACK Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
BEN Who?
JACK Sayid.
CARMEN Who is Sayid? I thought he was your friend.
HURLEY He is my friend... but he's also got this double life where he does crazy Ninja moves and spy stuff. But he's a good guy.
CARMEN A good guy doesn't kill three men. A good guy doesn't kill any men.
HURLEY Mom—
CARMEN Don't "mom" me. You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
CARMEN The news thinks you did this. And if the news does, everyone does. Why is this happening? How can anybody want to hurt you?
HURLEY I don't know.
CARMEN Tell your mother the truth.
HURLEY We lied, Ma!
CARMEN What do you mean you lied?
HURLEY All of us—the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
CARMEN And what did happen?
HURLEY Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true. But the re...
HURLEY But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.
CARMEN I believe you. I don't understand you, but I believe you.
HURLEY A lot of people died, ma. And now this bad stuff is happening because... well, um... we shouldn't have lied. 
SAWYER Ow!
JULIET You okay?
SAWYER Yeah, I'm fine. I just stepped on something. Something jammed...!
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
SAWYER We should keep moving. We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
JULIET It's a long creek, James. Which part?
SAWYER I don't know—the wet part. Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan—
[Leaves rustle, footsteps approach. Sawyer and Juliet step back and crouch behind some cover. They observe a man in a uniform walking with a rifle. When it appears he has gone, they sigh.
SAWYER Who were those people? Are they yours? Did they shoot the arrows?
JULIET You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?
SAWYER You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying to—
JULIET Aah!
SAWYER Hey!
JONES What are you doing on our island?!
VOICE OVER P.A. Respiratory therapist to ICU. Respiratory therapist...
JACK Come on. Son of a bitch. Come on, Sayid. Come on.
JACK Say— Sayid. It—it's... it's Jack. Hey! Uhh!
JACK It's okay. It's all right. You're okay. You're all right.
JACK Ahh.
SAYID What happened?
JACK You're fine. You're in the hospital. Hurley's father brought you to me.
SAYID Hurley's father?
JACK Sayid, you've been attacked.
SAYID Where's Hurley?
JACK He's at his parents' house.
SAYID Who's with him?
JACK I don't know. His mother, maybe?
SAYID Does anyone else know he's there?
HURLEY Aah! Aah.
BEN Hello, Hugo.
HURLEY Aah!
HURLEY Get away from me. Get away!
BEN Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything.
BEN I have a car waiting for us out back. The police didn't see me come in. I can get you out of here.
HURLEY No way, dude. Sayid warned me about you.
BEN I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack. That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me. How else would I know that they're together?
HURLEY No. You're—you're playing one of your mind games. They would never trust you.
BEN In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust. But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
HURLEY And what's that?
BEN To go back to the Island. Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over. You can stop hiding. You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions. If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again.
BEN Please. Let me help you.
HURLEY Never, dude.
HURLEY Hey! Hey, you got me! That's right, you got me! That's right! I'm the killer!
DETECTIVE Stop! Police! Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees!
HURLEY I'm the killer. I'm crazy. I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people. However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them.
HURLEY I killed them all. J—just—just get me away from here.
DETECTIVE You have the right to remain silent. Anything can and will be used against you in a court of law.
DETECTIVE You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have one present during any questioning...
HURLEY Just get me out of here.
DETECTIVE If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
JONES I'm gonna make this quite simple for you. You're gonna tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
SAWYER Let her go.
JONES Unless you're answering my questions, don't speak! I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand.
JULIET What?!
SAWYER Other?
JONES The first one isn't negotiable.
JONES It's just to illustrate how serious I am.
JULIET No!
SAWYER Hold on! Hold on! Chill out! We're not supposed to be here. Something's happening to the Island. There are these flashes—
JONES Do it!
JULIET No!
SAWYER Wait a second! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!
JONES Do it!
JULIET No!
JONES Uhh!
MATTINGLY Uhh! Uhh!
LOCKE James. Juliet.
LOCKE Nice to see ya.
BEN Any luck?
SHROUDED WOMAN Yes.
BEN Really?
SHROUDED WOMAN Really. What about you?
BEN I'm having some... difficulties.
SHROUDED WOMAN Well, you better get busy... because you only have 70 hours.
BEN No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least—
SHROUDED WOMAN What you need is irrelevant.
MS. HAWKING 70 hours is what you've got.
BEN Look, I lost Reyes tonight. What happens if I can't get them all to come back?
MS. HAWKING Then God help us all.
