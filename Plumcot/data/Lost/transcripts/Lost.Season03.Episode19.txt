john_locke Save your breath. Nobody's gonna hear you.
john_locke Dad? What is this?
ben_linus You tell me. You brought him here.
john_locke I didn't bring him here.
ben_linus I'd be careful about getting too close to him, John.
john_locke Where did you find him? Why did you bring him here?
ben_linus I already said. We didn't.
john_locke You want me to ask him how he got here?
ben_linus Be my guest.
ben_linus Tom!
ben_linus I warned you, John.
anthony_cooper Don't you know, John? Don't you know where we are?
john_locke What did he mean?
ben_linus I'm afraid we don't have time to deal with that right now, John. We're leaving first thing in the morning, all of us.
john_locke Where are you going?
ben_linus We're going to a new place. Well, an old place, actually. Would you like to come with us?
john_locke Yes.
ben_linus Good. We're holding Kate a few buildings over from here, maybe you'd like to say goodbye.
james_ford Hey, where you going?
kate_austen I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.
james_ford Fine, let's go to your tent.
kate_austen Um... its nothing personal, it's just... old habits, you know?
james_ford Fine, scram.
james_ford You want me to walk you home?
kate_austen It's five tents, I think I'll make it.
james_ford Sure? I gotta pee anyway.
kate_austen That is so romantic.
james_ford What the hell are y'all doing?
hugo_reyes What the hell are you doing?
james_ford Going to take a leak.
hugo_reyes Yeah well, so were we.
james_ford Well alrightey then.
john_locke Hello, James.
john_locke Wanna zip your pants up?
james_ford The hell are you doing here?
john_locke Looking for you, actually.
james_ford OK Tarzan, so now that you're back from your blow-up-everything-that-could-get-us-off-the-Island tour, how 'bout you tell me why you joined up with the damn enemy?
john_locke I didn't join them. I infiltrated them.
james_ford You're undercover with the Others.
john_locke That's right.
james_ford But how 'bout you give me one reason to believe that?
john_locke Because a few hours ago I snuck into Ben's tent and kidnapped him. I tied him up, dragged him off into the jungle.
james_ford And you came all the way back here to tell me this because...?
john_locke Because this is the same man who tortured you, beat you, humiliated you. And I want you to kill him.
james_ford You want him dead, you kill him.
john_locke I'm not a murderer.
james_ford Neither am I!
john_locke 'Cept for the man you killed in Sydney. They got files on us, James. All of us.
james_ford Yeah well, their file's got their facts wrong.
john_locke Then I made a mistake coming to you. Please don't tell anyone that I was here.
james_ford Hey, stop.
james_ford I said stop!
james_ford Dammit! Wait up.
john_locke There. That ought to do it.
cindy_chandler Thanks. That would have taken me hours to do myself.
john_locke Glad I could help.
cindy_chandler Don't mind them. They're all just excited you're here.
john_locke Excited?
cindy_chandler We've been waiting for you.
tom_friendly John. You got a minute?
john_locke Yeah.
tom_friendly Ben's asking for ya.
john_locke OK.
dr_juliet_burke Ben, it's 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband; he was sterile before they got here...
ben_linus Hello, John. Thanks for coming.
john_locke What's that?
ben_linus Juliet is gathering information for us at your former camp. She's determining if any of the women are pregnant. Then we're gonna go in and... take them.
john_locke Take them?
ben_linus This is not the first time we've done this, John. Trust me, no one will get hurt.
ben_linus Could you pass me that please?
ben_linus Thank you.
ben_linus I believe I have you to thank for this, John.
john_locke Me?
ben_linus A week ago I couldn't move my toes. But the minute you showed up, I started to feel pins and needles. And this is only the beginning, John. I can't wait to show you what this Island can do. But unfortunately, you're not ready, John.
john_locke Well er, no, I'm ready.
ben_linus No, John, you're not. You're still crippled by the memories of the man you used to be before you came to this Island. And you'll never be free until you release the hold that your father has over you. Why do you think you brought him here?
john_locke Oh oh oh, the, magic box, OK Ben, how about you show me—
ben_linus The magic box is a metaphor, John. I can't show you anything until you can show me that you're ready and willing to be one of us. When people join us here on this Island, they need to make a gesture of free will, of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. When'd you get back?
charlie_pace Jack. Hey. Uh, last night. Well, early this morning.
dr_jack_shephard So, camping huh? What were you guys doing out there?
charlie_pace We figured we'd, er, explore a bit. You know, see what was further down the beach. Male bonding.
dr_jack_shephard Well, next time you go out, sign me up.
charlie_pace Yeah, next time. Sure.
charlie_pace Thanks, Jin. We have to tell Jack.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I mean shouldn't he check out her wound?
desmond_hume Can you give me your word that Jack can be trusted? Now, he spent 10 days with those people and then nothing happened to him? And that woman he's spending all his time with—
charlie_pace Juliet?
desmond_hume Aye, Juliet. Two weeks ago she had your friends in cages. Naomi... I mean, you heard everything that she said. If we keep her safe, she's our way off this Island. So given that, do you trust Jack? Or don't you?
desmond_hume Right. So you better bring us someone we can trust.
john_locke You should have put some shoes on.
james_ford Ya think? So what else is in it?
john_locke In what?
james_ford The file they got on me.
john_locke Not much. That your parents died when you were very young. But it doesn't say why your father shot your mother or why he turned the gun on himself. That must have been hard for you.
james_ford What else?
john_locke High school transcripts. Uh, criminal record. All the con jobs you were arrested for. I guess that's why you use an alias, huh? Why did you choose the name Sawyer—
james_ford How stupid do you think I am, huh?! I've already been conned by Ben once. Maybe you heard about it, bunny with a number painted on it. Think I'm just gonna follow you through the jungle—
john_locke James, please, you have to, you have to trust me...
james_ford Where are you taking me? Tell me the truth! What do you want from me?!
john_locke I'm bringing you there to do exactly what I said. I need you to kill Ben.
james_ford Why did you come back to get me?
john_locke I had to.
james_ford Why me?! Why won't you do it yourself?
john_locke James, please!
james_ford Don't call me James! Why won't you do it yourself?!
john_locke Because I can't! I can't!!! I can't do it! That's why I came back for you.
james_ford Get up.
james_ford I'll go to wherever you got him, but then we're bringing him back to our camp. I ain't killing nobody, you understand me?
john_locke Yeah. I understand. But you'll change your mind. When you hear what he has to say. You'll change your mind.
hugo_reyes Hey dude.
sayid_jarrah Hello Hurley.
hugo_reyes Can you keep a secret?
sayid_jarrah You've already spoken to her?
charlie_pace Yeah. You're gonna wanna hear it for yourself.
sayid_jarrah And you haven't told Jack?
charlie_pace No.
sayid_jarrah Good.
sayid_jarrah My name's Sayid Jarrah. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the Island.
naomi_dorrit Actually, it crashed in the water.
sayid_jarrah What's your name?
naomi_dorrit Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.
sayid_jarrah Naomi, from where exactly did you take off?
naomi_dorrit A ship. Freighter. About eighty nautical miles west of here. We're part of a search-and-recovery team.
sayid_jarrah You told my friends the wreckage of Flight 815 was discovered. Did you mean the partial wreckage?
naomi_dorrit No. They found the entire plane off the coast of Bali. In an ocean trench four miles deep. They sent down cameras in these little robots to survey the wreck. The bodies were all there.
sayid_jarrah Well, obviously we're not dead.
naomi_dorrit Obviously.
sayid_jarrah So if you weren't looking for us, then who were you looking for?
naomi_dorrit Him.
sayid_jarrah Desmond?
naomi_dorrit My company was hired by a woman named Penelope Widmore. I don't know why, I never met her. She gave us a set of coordinates. We'd be conducting a differential GPS grid search ever since.
sayid_jarrah You knew about the Island?
naomi_dorrit Island? We were given coordinates in the middle of the bloody ocean. We thought it was a fool's errand. 'Til three days ago. I was flying back for the ship when all of a sudden the clouds cleared and I saw land. The instruments started spinning, I realized I was going down, so... I grabbed my chute and I bailed.
sayid_jarrah Did you actually see her helicopter?
desmond_hume No.
naomi_dorrit You think I'm lying, mate?
sayid_jarrah And I take it you have no means whatsoever of communicating with that freighter of yours?
naomi_dorrit What was your name? Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
naomi_dorrit Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.
james_ford So Ben. You said I'd kill him when I heard what he's got to say.
john_locke That's right.
james_ford Well, you wanna give me a head's up?
john_locke It's not really my place to tell you.
james_ford Look, what you read in that file, about the guy in Sydney. I thought he was someone else. I made a mistake; I didn't mean to kill him.
john_locke Well, who'd you mean to kill?
james_ford Are we almost there?
john_locke Almost.
ben_linus Wake up, John. It's time.
ben_linus I know it won't be easy. But the quicker the better.
anthony_cooper You're kidding me, right? You expect him to kill me?
ben_linus John. The hesitation that you're feeling is just the part of you that still feels like he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney. Throwing you out of an eight-story window. Don't you want to be free from him?
anthony_cooper The hesitation he's feeling is because he is a spineless—
john_locke Shut up!
john_locke I... I gotta think.
ben_linus Don't think, John.
anthony_cooper You're wasting your time, bug-eye. Me and him have been through all this. All he wants is his daddy—
john_locke Shut up! I said shut up!!
anthony_cooper You really haven't figured it out yet, have you?
ben_linus Let go of him, John.
john_locke Why are you doing this to me?
ben_linus You're doing this to yourself. As long as he's still breathing, you'll still be that same sad pathetic little man that was kicked off his walkabout tour because you couldn't walk.
anthony_cooper I'll be here the rest of the week, John, if you change your mind--
ben_linus I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was.
james_ford Son of a...
james_ford Nice place you got here, Locke.
john_locke Ben's inside in the brig. You ready?
james_ford Yeah I'm ready.
james_ford Friends of yours?
john_locke It's an old slaving ship. Mid-19th century. My guess is they captured the slaves and brought 'em here to try and mine the Island.
james_ford What's in the boxes?
john_locke That'd be dynamite.
james_ford Son of a bitch. You really kidnapped the little bastard. We ain't killing him, Locke.
john_locke Whatever you say, James.
james_ford Well well well.
james_ford Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Open the damn door!
james_ford Shut up! Open up!
james_ford I said shut up!
james_ford Who the hell are you?
hugo_reyes So is that like a radio?
sayid_jarrah It's like a radio, yes. But I've never seen equipment this sophisticated.
hugo_reyes You can still make it work, right?
sayid_jarrah I hope so.
hugo_reyes And what about the other part? The part about they found the plane and we were all dead.
sayid_jarrah One thing at a time.
sayid_jarrah There's not a single audible channel. Whatever that interference is, it's blocking our ability to send out our own transmission. If we—
kate_austen What's that? Is that a radio? Where'd you get it?
hugo_reyes Uh, the luggage.
kate_austen What? You just found a radio in the luggage?
sayid_jarrah Kate, if I explain, I want you to keep this very quiet.
kate_austen Keep what very quiet?
james_ford Locke! Open this damn door! Open it up! I can hear you, you bald bastard!
john_locke Rousseau.
danielle_rousseau Locke.
john_locke What brings you to the Black Rock?
danielle_rousseau Dynamite. And you?
james_ford Open this door! Open up!
john_locke Crates are right over there.
james_ford Open this damn door!
john_locke Be careful, its unstable.
james_ford Locke! LOCKE!
richard_alpert It's beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend on the Island, you just never get tired of this view. We haven't been formally introduced. I'm Richard.
richard_alpert You mind if I, join you here?
john_locke Nah, sure.
richard_alpert He wanted to embarrass you.
john_locke I'm sorry?
richard_alpert Ben knew you weren't gonna kill your own father. He put you in front of everyone in our camp just so they could all watch you fail.
john_locke Why?
richard_alpert 'Cause when word got back here that there was a man with a broken spine on the plane who could suddenly walk again, well, people here began to get very excited because that, that could only happen to someone who was extremely special. But Ben doesn't want anyone to think you're special, John.
john_locke And why are you telling me this?
richard_alpert Ben has been wasting our time with novelties like fertility problems. We're looking for someone to remind us that we're here for more important reasons.
john_locke What do you want from me?
richard_alpert I want for you to find your purpose. And to do that, your father has to go, John. And since you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna suggest someone else.
john_locke Sawyer! Why would Sawyer kill my father? He doesn't even know him.
richard_alpert Keep reading.
james_ford Open this damn door! Son of a bitch!!
james_ford I'm pointing my gun at you John-boy. You got three seconds to open this door.
john_locke You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.
james_ford One! Two!
john_locke If there were any bullets in that gun, why would you hold a knife to my throat?
james_ford Ah! Son of a bitch!!
anthony_cooper Guess I didn't raise no dummies.
james_ford The hell's that mean?
anthony_cooper It means that bald-headed bastard outside the door is my son.
james_ford Come again?
anthony_cooper My son. As in I'm his father. You do speak English?
james_ford You're his... How did you get here, to the Island?
anthony_cooper Island? OK. I'm driving down I-10 through Tallahassee when bam, somebody slams into the back of my car. I go right into the divider at 70 miles an hour. The next thing I know, the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney, stuffing me into the back of an ambulance, and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the IV in my arm. And then, nothing. Just, black. And the next thing I know I wake up in a dark room tied up, gag in my mouth, and when the door opens, I'm looking up at the same man I threw out a window, John Locke. My dead son.
james_ford And he's dead 'cause you threw him out a window?
anthony_cooper No, he survived that. But it paralyzed him, permanently. He's dead because the plane he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.
james_ford Well, I got bad news for ya, pops, 'cause I was on that plane with your son. He sure as hell wasn't crippled. And we didn't crash in the Pacific, we crashed here on this Island.
anthony_cooper You sure it's an Island?
james_ford Well, what else is it?
anthony_cooper A little hot for heaven, isn't it?
james_ford Oh, OK, so we're dead?
anthony_cooper They found your plane on the bottom of the ocean. One minute I'm in a car wreck, and the next minute I'm in a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle. If this isn't hell, friend, then where are we?
james_ford Why did you throw Locke out a window?
anthony_cooper He was becoming a nuisance. I conned him into giving me one of his kidneys. He never got over it.
james_ford Conned?
anthony_cooper Yes sir, conned.
james_ford What's your name?
anthony_cooper Hmm?
james_ford Your name.
anthony_cooper A conman goes by many names, friend. I've been Alan Seward, Anthony Cooper, Ted MacLaren, Tom Sawyer, Louis Jackson, Paul—
james_ford Tom Sawyer.
anthony_cooper I was young and Huck Finn was taken. And the ladies loved that one. Made me charming.
james_ford Well, how about that.
anthony_cooper How about what?
james_ford Sawyer's my name, too.
john_locke Ben. What's going on?
ben_linus We're moving.
john_locke Moving? Where are we going?
ben_linus We are not going anywhere, John. You are going to stay behind. You both are going to stay behind.
john_locke What? You're not taking him?
ben_linus He's your mess, John. Why would we clean it up?
john_locke Ben! If you're trying to put me in my place, or embarrass me—
ben_linus Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?
john_locke Well, you can't leave me. After everything—
ben_linus Don't tell me what I can't do, John.
john_locke But I thought I was... special.
ben_linus Well, everyone makes mistakes. We're leaving now. We'll leave a trail, one you can track. And John, unless you're carrying your father's body on your back, don't bother.
anthony_cooper What's the matter with you?
james_ford You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?
anthony_cooper Why?
james_ford Have you or haven't you?
anthony_cooper Yeah, I've been to Jasper. Don't tell me I'm your daddy...
james_ford No. You killed my daddy.
james_ford Read it.
anthony_cooper "Dear Mr Sawyer." What is this?
james_ford Just read it.
anthony_cooper "You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. And I know what you done. You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away, so he got angry and he killed my mother, and then he killed himself" blah blah blah blah. So what? Is this supposed to be you, you wrote this letter? Hey, wait a second. Did you take my name because you were on some kind of revenge kick?
james_ford Keep reading.
anthony_cooper Easy, easy, don't get all worked up. Look, I ran that con two dozen times. If your mother was one of the—
james_ford Mary. Her name was Mary.
anthony_cooper Mary from Jasper, Alabama. Yeah, I remember her. She practically begged me to take her thirty-eight thousand dollars and to rescue her from her sorry little life.
james_ford You finish the letter.
anthony_cooper Look, I only took her money. It ain't my fault your dad overreacted. If he pulled the old murder suicide, then I'm sure he's down here somewhere. Er, maybe you could take this up with him—
james_ford FINISH IT!!!
anthony_cooper OK. OK.
james_ford You wanna go to hell?! You wanna go to hell?!!
john_locke Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard You missing those cheeseburgers yet?
dr_juliet_burke Only every second.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen I need to talk to you.
dr_jack_shephard OK.
kate_austen In private.
dr_juliet_burke No problem.
dr_jack_shephard Anything you wanna say to me, you can say in front of her.
kate_austen Not this.
dr_juliet_burke It's OK.
dr_jack_shephard No no no no, you can stay.
kate_austen Yeah, you know what, you should stay. Seems only fair considering she's the reason that no one wants to tell you that there's a woman in Hurley's tent who parachuted onto the Island yesterday.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen A woman. She jumped from her chopper before it crashed. She says that the boat that she took off from is about 80 miles off the coast and that if she can find a way to contact it, we'll all be rescued.
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't anyone tell me this?
kate_austen I already told you, because they don't trust you.
dr_jack_shephard How?
kate_austen How what?
dr_jack_shephard How is she supposed to contact her boat?
kate_austen Did you hear what I just said? Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends are afraid to...
dr_jack_shephard Kate! How?
kate_austen She had a phone radio thing, Sayid's trying to get it to work.
dr_juliet_burke We should tell her.
dr_jack_shephard No.
kate_austen Tell me what?
dr_juliet_burke We should tell her.
dr_jack_shephard Not yet.
john_locke You can go back now.
james_ford Why did you do this?
john_locke He ruined my life. And he ruined yours. And he had it coming. Juliet is a mole.
james_ford What?
john_locke She's working for Ben. He sent her back to find out which of our women were pregnant. Three days from now, there's gonna be a raid on the beach and they're gonna take them. They say they don't want anyone to get hurt.
james_ford Why are you telling me this?
john_locke So you can warn the camp.
james_ford You warn the camp.
john_locke I'm not going back.
james_ford You're going back undercover?
john_locke No, I was never undercover, James. I'm on my own journey now.
james_ford Even if Juliet is a mole, they ain't gonna believe me, I've been saying that since she showed up—
john_locke They'll believe you now.
james_ford Hey. Is it true?
john_locke Is what true?
james_ford That he threw you out a window. That you were a cripple.
john_locke Not anymore.
