sayid_jarrah It's getting late. This is a good place to make camp.
dr_jack_shephard I'll get some firewood.
kate_austen I'll go with you.
kate_austen You wanna talk about it?
dr_jack_shephard Talk about what?
kate_austen About the week... you spent over there with them.
dr_jack_shephard Well, after you left, I'd, uh, I'd made a deal with them. If I took care of Ben, that they'd let me off the Island. So I just, kept my head down, did what I was supposed to. Didn't ask any questions.
kate_austen And that's it.
dr_jack_shephard That's it.
dr_juliet_burke OK. Let's have it.
sayid_jarrah I want to know what you people are doing on this Island. Why you're terrorizing us. Making lists. Kidnapping children. I want to know everything. But the first thing I'd like to know is, who are you?
dr_juliet_burke Hi. I'm Juliet Burke, I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.
airport_guard I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you.
rachel_carlson Well. I think they're taking this whole corporate secrecy thing a little too seriously.
dr_juliet_burke I'm never gonna fit in with these people.
dr_ethan_rom Hey there, Dr. Burke. If you pop the trunk, I'll get your bags.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you.
richard_alpert Ah, you managed to find us.
dr_juliet_burke I didn't even know they had an airport out there.
richard_alpert I know it surprises everyone. Hi. You must be Rachel. Richard Alpert.
rachel_carlson Nice to meet you.
richard_alpert Thank you for letting us borrow your sister for a few months.
rachel_carlson Just promise me you'll bring her back in one piece.
richard_alpert Well, we'll do our best. Uh, so listen, it's, er, a security thing. We have to take you in the rest of the way, so, whenever you're ready' we'll be waiting right over here, but please do take your time. Pleasure to meet you.
rachel_carlson Thanks.
richard_alpert Thank you.
rachel_carlson It's better this way.
dr_juliet_burke Is this a mistake? I shouldn't go. What if you get sick again?
rachel_carlson I won't. Cancer's gone. And, I'm 100% preggers thanks to you.
dr_juliet_burke I'll be back...
rachel_carlson Yes, I know.
dr_juliet_burke ...before you give birth, I promise.
rachel_carlson I know. Don't worry about us, OK?
dr_juliet_burke OK.
rachel_carlson You spent your whole life working to get here. So... don't blow it!
dr_juliet_burke I love you.
rachel_carlson I love you.
dr_juliet_burke OK.
rachel_carlson Go make us proud.
sayid_jarrah Who are you?
dr_juliet_burke If I told you who I was, if I told you everything that I know, you'd kill me.
sayid_jarrah What do you think I'll do if you don't?
dr_jack_shephard Leave her alone.
sayid_jarrah Sooner or later she'll answer my questions.
dr_jack_shephard She'll answer your questions when she's ready. And you'll wait until she is. She's under my protection.
charlie_pace Claire? Claire? Claire? Oh, oh, what is it? Oh, it's OK. Shh, shh, its OK. Claire? Hey. Claire. You OK?
claire_littleton Charlie? What's, what's going on?
charlie_pace Didn't you hear Aaron?
claire_littleton Is he OK?
charlie_pace Nah, he's OK. Are you alright?
claire_littleton Yeah, I just, feel a little bit off. I didn't sleep well. I can't believe I didn't hear him crying!
charlie_pace Maybe you're coming down with something. Look, why don't you let me take Aaron, and, you get some more rest.
claire_littleton Yeah, do you mind?
charlie_pace Absolutely.
claire_littleton I won't sleep long.
dr_juliet_burke I guess it's no use asking them to wait up, huh?
dr_jack_shephard They'll come around. Just give them some time.
dr_juliet_burke My people kept Sayid chained to a swing-set for three days, then I dragged Kate into the jungle, handcuffed myself to her and lied about it. How much time do you think they need?
dr_jack_shephard We'll be back at our beach in a couple of hours, they'll probably be over it by then. You nervous?
dr_juliet_burke Hell, yes.
richard_alpert I know that, uh, six months sounds like an eternity, but you're gonna be amazed at how time flies once you're there.
dr_juliet_burke I can't wait to find out where there is.
dr_ethan_rom Dr. Burke? Wanna have a seat? I'd like to take some of your vitals. If that's OK with you.
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, sure.
richard_alpert You know, everyone at the company's really excited about you coming down Dr. Burke. And I think your research is really gonna have a major impact on us.
dr_juliet_burke What is that?
richard_alpert That, is orange juice, with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.
dr_juliet_burke You want me to drink it?
richard_alpert Oh yes , you're gonna wanna be asleep for the trip, Dr. Burke.
dr_ethan_rom It can be , kind of intense.
dr_juliet_burke Er, OK, I was fine with signing all over your paperwork. Fine with agreeing to not talk to anyone in my life for six months. Fine with the fact that no one in the medical community has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience.
richard_alpert Why were you fine?
dr_juliet_burke What?
richard_alpert Why were you fine with those things? It seems like, er, quite a leap for a job opportunity. I mean, we're not paying you that much. I think you're fine because deep down a part of you knows that the place we're taking you to is special.
dr_juliet_burke Special huh.
richard_alpert Let me ask you something, Juliet. You took a woman, your own sister, whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy, who was sterile. And you made her pregnant. You created life where life wasn't supposed to be. That's a gift, Juliet. You have a gift. And don't you think you're meant to do something significant with it? Where we're going, you can do just that.
dr_juliet_burke Where exactly are we...
richard_alpert I can't tell you that. But what I can tell you is that, you'll see things there that you never imagined. Now, no one is forcing you to do anything, so if you change your mind, we're happy to take you back to—
dr_ethan_rom Um, you probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.
dr_ethan_rom Good morning. No, no, its OK. You'll be hoarse for a few hours but it gets better as the day goes on. Sorry I had to, strap you in, but the last leg is always a little bumpy. Watch your head. Give me your hand.
dr_ethan_rom We're here.
dr_juliet_burke Here where?
ben_linus Hello, Dr. Burke. My name is Benjamin Linus. I'm really looking forward to working with you. Watch your step here.
charlie_pace Hey, wow, that's too much water, its going to be all soggy.
hugo_reyes It's oatmeal dude, it's supposed to be soggy.
james_ford Well if it ain't three men and a baby... I counted Hugo twice. Oh what, come on, I used your name.
claire_littleton Hey. Does anybody know where there's any aspirin?
desmond_hume Claire, you don't look so good.
charlie_pace What are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.
claire_littleton Yeah. No, I know, I just... my head's pounding.
james_ford I got you covered, two aspirin coming right up.
claire_littleton Thank you.
james_ford Son of a bitch.
sunhwa_kwon Jack? It's Jack!
james_ford The hell is she doing here?!
hugo_reyes Hey.
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
hugo_reyes So. You're, like, one of them, huh?
dr_juliet_burke I'm Juliet.
hugo_reyes I don't remember you from the dock. Where you put bags on our heads. After you shocked us.
dr_juliet_burke I had the day off.
hugo_reyes So I hear you're a doctor.
dr_juliet_burke I'm really more of a researcher.
hugo_reyes Uh-huh.
dr_juliet_burke They send you over here to keep an eye on me? OK.
hugo_reyes The last one of you guys that came over here. Ethan. He kidnapped Claire, and... Charlie got upset. We buried him over there.
dr_ethan_rom She's gone, Juliet, she's dead.
goodwin_stanhope It's OK. You tried. You go ahead and take off. I'll talk to Ben.
ben_linus It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant. She knew she was taking a risk.
dr_juliet_burke I think it happens at conception. And if that's the case, there's nothing I can do about it, at least not here.
ben_linus I'm not sure I understand.
dr_juliet_burke The only way to see if I'm right is to take a woman off the Island, back to Miami.
ben_linus No, you're not taking anybody off the Island.
dr_juliet_burke In that case, there's nothing more I can do. I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben. And I'm sorry I couldn't help you. My sister's giving birth in three months, and I haven't even been able to call her. It's time for me to go home.
ben_linus Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet. She'll be dead before then. Her cancer is back.
dr_juliet_burke Where did you get this?
ben_linus Mikhail. I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, I just didn't see what good it would do.
dr_juliet_burke What good it would do?! I could have gone home, I could have been with her!
ben_linus You still can. You can go home, Juliet. Be with her in her final days, or you can stay here and help me with our problem.
dr_juliet_burke Why would I stay?
ben_linus Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer.
dr_juliet_burke I'm supposed to take that on faith?
ben_linus You've been here for six months. You've done extensive work-ups on all of us, have you seen even a trace of cancer?
dr_juliet_burke That's here. And being that you won't let me my sister here, I'm going to need more—
ben_linus Jacob said he would take care of it himself. Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him. Every woman on this Island needs you. If you choose to stay, I promise you, we will save Rachel's life.
sunhwa_kwon Trust her? She's one of them.
dr_jack_shephard Not anymore. They left her behind.
charlie_pace Oh yeah, where'd they go?
dr_jack_shephard I told you, I dunno.
james_ford Well, maybe we better ask her.
dr_jack_shephard She doesn't know either.
james_ford Well, here's a wacky idea. Let's stick our resident Iraqi on her. Let him do what he does, then see what she says.
sayid_jarrah No, I don't do that anymore.
james_ford Well ain't that convenient.
sayid_jarrah But I don't trust her, Jack. If she's so innocent, why won't she answer my questions?
charlie_pace Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Just give her some time, she's afraid.
sayid_jarrah How much time?
dr_jack_shephard Look, the fact that I trust her should be enough.
sayid_jarrah It's not.
desmond_hume Where did Locke go?
dr_jack_shephard He went with them. Right after he destroyed the sub, the sub that was gonna take me off this Island.
hugo_reyes What?
james_ford They were gonna let you go?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford Said who?
dr_jack_shephard Ben.
james_ford Ben. Whose life you saved.
kate_austen Sawyer, lay off.
james_ford You should have let that bug-eyed bastard die.
kate_austen He did it for us.
james_ford Sounds like he did it for him.
kate_austen James.
dr_jack_shephard Something you wanna ask me, Sawyer?
james_ford Yeah Jack, I wanna ask you why you're fighting every one of us and sticking up for one of them.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I spent every moment over there trying to find a way off this Island—
charlie_pace Claire?
dr_jack_shephard —I was trying to help all of us. I was trying to get us rescued.
charlie_pace Claire... Jack! There's something wrong with Claire!
dr_jack_shephard Put her head back, put her head back. Let's get her up. How long's she been like this?
charlie_pace Er, she started feeling bad this morning.
dr_jack_shephard Before she got back, was she showing any symptoms at all?
charlie_pace No, she was fine.
dr_jack_shephard What about water, has she been drinking enough water?
charlie_pace I think so, yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, keep that head up.
dr_juliet_burke What happened to her?
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 상관이야?
sunhwa_kwon He said, what do you care?
dr_juliet_burke Kate! I need your help. I need you to go and get Jack.
kate_austen Look, he's busy right now.
dr_juliet_burke Please, I have to talk to him.
kate_austen You wanna tell me why you need Jack?
dr_juliet_burke Because I think I know what's wrong with Claire.
kate_austen Why?
dr_juliet_burke Because I did it to her.
james_ford Giving you a bad feeling in your stomach? Yeah, me too.
dr_juliet_burke Claire's immune system is turning on her. She's having a latent reaction to a medication in her bloodstream.
dr_jack_shephard What medication?
dr_juliet_burke It was designed to keep her alive during the late stages of her pregnancy.
dr_jack_shephard Designed by who?
dr_juliet_burke By me. For some reason, the women here can't have babies. The mother's body turns on the pregnancy, treats it as a foreign invader. I saw it happen over and over. Every pregnant woman on this Island died.
dr_juliet_burke That is, every pregnant woman until Claire.
dr_jack_shephard What did you do to her?
dr_juliet_burke One of our people infiltrated your camp, and began taking blood samples, right after your plane crashed.
kate_austen Ethan.
dr_juliet_burke Even though Claire didn't conceive on this Island, we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers, so we tried to save her life.
dr_jack_shephard By kidnapping her?
dr_juliet_burke No! That wasn't supposed to happen. She was our control case. I had developed a serum that I thought would reverse what was happening to her, Ethan was administering the injections. But then... you found out that he wasn't on the plane.
hugo_reyes The census, I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest — he wasn't on the plane.
dr_juliet_burke So... he improvised.
dr_ethan_rom Hello there.
dr_juliet_burke He kidnapped her, on his own. That was never the plan. Look, I know how this sounds, but without those injections, Claire would have died. Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal, and if I don't treat her quickly, her immune system could shut down entirely. Jack! I can fix this. I just need the serum. Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies near the caves where you used to live. If I go right now I can be back before its too late.
dr_jack_shephard Do it. Get moving.
goodwin_stanhope Where are you?
dr_juliet_burke In bed, with you.
goodwin_stanhope Uh-huh. And where were you?
dr_juliet_burke I was just realizing... that tomorrow I will have been on this Island for three years.
goodwin_stanhope Hm, well, then I better bake a cake.
dr_juliet_burke Stay here.
goodwin_stanhope What have you got there?
dr_juliet_burke Karl developed some X-rays for me.
goodwin_stanhope What's wrong?
UNNAMED#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode16 OTHER Morning, Juliet.
ben_linus Hi.
dr_juliet_burke Can I come in?
ben_linus Of course. I was just finishing Carrie. I still don't know why you picked it, but boy is it depressing—
dr_juliet_burke You have a tumor.
ben_linus What?
dr_juliet_burke When you told me about your back pain, I said that I would take some X-rays to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc. But that's not your problem. Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your L-4 vertebra. You're surprised.
ben_linus Well, you just told me I have cancer, Juliet, of course I'm surprised.
dr_juliet_burke No, I told you that you had a tumor.
dr_juliet_burke Why are you scared?
ben_linus I'm not scared.
dr_juliet_burke Why are you scared, Ben? You said no one on this Island ever had cancer, you told me that.
ben_linus I know what I told you, Juliet—
dr_juliet_burke You told me you could fix it. You said that, you said that you cured my sister, you lied to me!
ben_linus No, I did not lie to you!
dr_juliet_burke If you can cure cancer Ben, then why do you have it?
ben_linus I don't know.
dr_juliet_burke I want to talk to her. I want to talk to Rachel, I want to talk to her, now!
ben_linus It's not going to happen Juliet, but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.
dr_juliet_burke You never cured her!
ben_linus I did!
dr_juliet_burke You're a liar!
ben_linus No, Juliet—
dr_juliet_burke YOU LIED TO ME!!!
ben_linus I told you the truth!
ben_linus I gave you my word.
dr_juliet_burke I know. I wanna go home. I wanna go home, Ben, please. Can't you please just let me go home?
ben_linus No.
sayid_jarrah Step away from the case!
dr_juliet_burke Listen to me, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Step back.
dr_juliet_burke It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire. Jack knows all about it.
james_ford Jack ain't here right now is he?
dr_juliet_burke I'm telling you the truth.
sayid_jarrah You said earlier if you told me everything you knew, I'd kill you. I'm going to test the validity of that statement.
james_ford He means talk.
dr_juliet_burke We don't have time for this.
james_ford We cleared our schedules. We got all the time in the world.
dr_juliet_burke You know it's interesting... that you two are now the camp's moral police. I'm curious, Sayid, how long was it before you told everyone on that beach exactly how many people you've tortured in your life. Do they know about Basra? And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James, was to gather everyone in a circle, and tell them about the man you shot in cold blood the night before you got on the plane. So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous. I'm taking that medication back to Claire. And you're gonna let me. Because if she doesn't get it, she's gonna die. And the last thing, that either of you need right now, is more blood on your hands.
ben_linus Goodwin. Ethan. There might actually be survivors. And you're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go! So I guess I'm out of the bookclub?
ben_linus Juliet. Juliet! I was looking for you this morning. You and I need to talk.
dr_juliet_burke Now?
ben_linus We have some time. It's important. Take a walk with me.
ben_linus Mikhail? We're here. He never has his walkie on.
dr_juliet_burke What are we doing here?
ben_linus There's something I need to show you. Mikhail! It's Ben. I'm here with Juliet, we're approaching the house. Don't shoot us...
mikhail_bakunin Well hurry up then.
mikhail_bakunin Did you see it?
ben_linus A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. Of course we saw it. What do you have so far?
mikhail_bakunin Oceanic Flight 815. Left Sydney Australia headed for Los Angeles, 324 people onboard including the flight crew.
ben_linus I want detailed files on every single passenger.
mikhail_bakunin Already working on it.
ben_linus Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park please?
ben_linus Yesterday you called me a liar. I was hurt by that.
ben_linus Hello, Richard, can you hear me?
ben_linus Notice today's date, this is live. OK, Richard.
dr_juliet_burke Oh my god. Oh! Oh my god!
ben_linus A little over two years ago, to everyone's complete surprise, Rachel's cancer went into complete remission. Shortly after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. His name is Julian. OK, thank you Richard. You'll wanna get back here as soon as you can; we may have some new visitors.
dr_juliet_burke Oh, god! No! No!
ben_linus I'm not a liar, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke I want to go home.
ben_linus That's not our agreement, you need to stay here until your work is finished.
dr_juliet_burke It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.
ben_linus Then we'll find more mothers. Who knows, maybe there's even one on that plane.
charlie_pace Wait, what're you doing? She's not touching Claire — she's the one who did this to her.
dr_jack_shephard She can help her, Charlie.
charlie_pace Says who? Her? How can you even trust her?
dr_jack_shephard I do trust her. You trust me? Do you trust me?
charlie_pace Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Give us a couple of minutes here, OK?
dr_jack_shephard How long before this takes effect?
dr_juliet_burke We should see results in a few hours.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet. If this doesn't work, if something happens to her. I'm not going to be able to protect you anymore. You'll be on your own.
dr_juliet_burke I'm already on my own, Jack.
claire_littleton What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Got a tarp. A couple of blankets. Some airline pillows. Its not much, but it'll get you started. Claire's awake. There's a... a lean-to that we've been using for shade. And, everyone says that it'll be alright if you set up camp there. For now.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard They're good people. They're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But eventually they're gonna need some answers.
dr_juliet_burke Why don't you? You keep talking about them. Why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?
dr_jack_shephard You were there. You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded. In that moment, I saw it in your eyes. You wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world. That makes you one of us.
ben_linus Let's go over it again.
dr_juliet_burke I know what to do.
ben_linus Let's go over it again. Just to be sure.
dr_juliet_burke I drag Austen out into the jungle, handcuff myself to her, then tell her I was gassed, just like she was.
ben_linus And if she catches you in the lie?
dr_juliet_burke I'll admit to it. Tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.
ben_linus Good. What then?
dr_juliet_burke They'll take me back to the beach.
dr_juliet_burke I know you want me to go there, but after everything we've done to them, its going to be a problem.
ben_linus We've activated the implant in Claire, she should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours. By the time you get to that camp, you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.
dr_juliet_burke I'll need supplies.
ben_linus Pryce is already on his way. He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop-point. Tell Jack that you can save her. He trusts you... are you alright?
dr_juliet_burke I'm fine.
ben_linus See you in a week.
