CO-PILOT Wanna hear something crazy?
LAPIDUS What's that?
CO-PILOT Did you see the big guy when we got on in L.A.? Sitting in first class, curly hair, guitar case?
LAPIDUS What about him?
CO-PILOT He's one of the Oceanic Six. Guy's got nerves of steel, man. He survives a full-on commercial airliner crash. Now he's back flying over the same South Pacific?
LAPIDUS Yeah, well... maybe he doesn't believe that lightning will strike twice in the same place.
CO-PILOT You all right there, Frank?
LAPIDUS I'm just fine.
[The rattling resumes, more violently now, then stops. The co-pilot reaches above him and flips a switch.
HURLEY Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
LAPIDUS Oh, no.
CO-PILOT What?
LAPIDUS Autopilot off! I have the controls.
CO-PILOT Autopilot off. You have the controls.
LAPIDUS Pull that rudder!
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT Aah!
CO-PILOT What?
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE Stall.
CO-PILOT What?!
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE Stall.
LAPIDUS We've lost power!
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE Stall.
CO-PILOT Restarting one. Restarting two.
CO-PILOT Altimeter reading 650.
LAPIDUS Oh, my God.
LAPIDUS Give me more power! I can pull us out of this!
CO-PILOT You're gonna rip us apart!
LAPIDUS Do it!
LAPIDUS Come on. Come on.
CO-PILOT Is that a runway?
LAPIDUS Massive instrument failure! We're puttin' her down!
CO-PILOT Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Ajira 3-1-6! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE 4...8...15...16...
LAPIDUS Full flaps!
CO-PILOT Gear down! Airspeed 190!
CO-PILOT We're coming in too steep!
LAPIDUS Reverse thrusters!
CO-PILOT Come on!
LAPIDUS We're runnin' out! We're runnin' out!
LAPIDUS Hold on! Brace for impact!
LAPIDUS Hey!
CAESAR Hey. Hey, lady. Are you okay?
ILANA Jarrah?
CAESAR No. My name is Caesar. We had an accident. But we're okay now.
CAESAR Hey.
ILANA Ohh.
SUN Frank?
LAPIDUS Sun.
LAPIDUS You all right?
SUN Oh, my God. What happened?!
LAPIDUS I don't know.
LAPIDUS Where's everyone else? Jack and... Kate and Hurley--where'd they go?
BEN They're gone.
LAPIDUS Gone? Gone where?
BEN How would I know?
HURLEY You're alive. Dude! I can't believe it! 
HURLEY Oh! Oh!
SAWYER Easy on the ribs there, Kong.
HURLEY "Kong." I actually missed that.
SAWYER Missed you, too, Hugo.
JACK Sawyer.
SAWYER Doc.
SAWYER Good to see you, Kate.
KATE You, too, James.
SAWYER You're really here. Son of a bitch actually did it! Locke said he was gonna bring you back, but... where is he?
JACK John's dead.
SAWYER Dead? How?
JACK Doesn't matter. He's gone.
HURLEY So what's up with you guys and the old DHARMA jumpsuits?
SAWYER You didn't tell 'em?
JIN No. I was waiting for you.
KATE Tell us what?
SAWYER We're in the DHARMA Initiative.
JACK They came back to the Island?
SAWYER No. We came back. And so did you. It's 1977.
HURLEY Uh... what?
JACK So you're telling me that you've been here, living with the DHARMA Initiative for the past three years.
SAWYER That's right. How long's it been for you since the chopper?
KATE Three years.
MILES  Hey, Jin, this is Miles. Where are you? Over. 
JIN If I don't report in soon, they'll send out a patrol. What should we do with them?
HURLEY Dude, your English is awesome.
SAWYER What we do is we bring 'em in.
JACK Bring us in where?
SAWYER Back to the Barracks at DHARMAville. You can't be wandering around in the jungle with the Hostiles.
KATE "The Hostiles"?
SAWYER The Others.
HURLEY What about everyone else from the plane? They could still be out there.
SAWYER What do you mean, everyone else?
JACK We didn't come back alone. Sayid was on the plane, too. Lapidus... and Sun.
SAWYER Jin! Hold up! Where you goin'?!
JIN The Flame. If a plane landed on the Island, Radzinsky will know.
SAWYER Hold on! We gotta think about this!
SAWYER All right. That's it. Listen, you guys gotta stay put. Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing till I can figure out how the hell to explain where you came from.
KATE Sawyer, wait. Other than you and Jin, who else is still here?
JULIET Miles, have you seen James?
MILES Nope. He's not answering his walkie, either.
JULIET Jin called him this morning, then he just ran off without telling me what was going on.
MILES Well, let's see what we've got.
MILES Hang on. There he is.
JULIET Hey.
SAWYER You seen my baggy sweatshirt, the one with the bulldog on it?
JULIET It's in the laundry. James... what's going on?
SAWYER They're back.
JULIET I'm sorry. Who's back?
SAWYER Jack, Hurley, Kate.
JULIET What?
SAWYER I know. They came back, Juliet.
JULIET Are they here now?
SAWYER Yeah. They're out at the North Point, waitin' for me to tell 'em what to do.
JULIET How did they get...
SAWYER I'm not sure. They said they were on a plane.
SAWYER  I don't understand it any more than you do. But they're here, and I gotta find a way to bring 'em in before somebody else finds 'em and they screw up everything we got here.
JULIET There's, um, a sub coming in this afternoon.
RADZINSKY Hey, you understand the concept of knocking?
RADZINSKY Oh, get your hands off that! I thought you learned English. I said, hands off! Nobody handles any of the gear in this station except me. Understand?
JIN I need to check the radar logs.
RADZINSKY For what?
JIN Please. I need to know if a plane landed on the Island.
RADZINSKY If a plane landed? Here?
JIN Yes.
RADZINSKY What, so you think if a plane landed on our Island, I'd be over there just building my model? That I wouldn't have called anyone? That I wouldn't have put out an alert?
JIN Maybe you missed it. Can you check with the other stations?
RADZINSKY I just told you I would not be--
JIN Check with the other stations.
RADZINSKY Attention all stations, this is a system-wide broadcast from Radzinsky at the Flame. I'm checking in to see if anyone's seen an airplane over the Island.  No one else has seen an airplane, but if you have, could you call in to me, please? Over.
RADZINSKY So what are you all hot and bothered about, Kwon? Why is this plane so damn important?
JIN It just is.
ILANA Did you lose someone?
SUN Excuse me?
ILANA I just saw you looking around. I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane.
SUN No. I was traveling alone.
LAPIDUS Can I get everybody's attention?! Everybody, please! Listen up, folks! Here's where we're at. The radio's dead, so I haven't been able to call in our situation. But that's all right. Soon as they figure out we're not where we're supposed to be, they'll come looking for us. So best thing to do right now is just stick together. Stick together, hunker down and just wait till help gets here.
CAESAR And where is here?
LAPIDUS What's that?
CAESAR Where is here? What is this place?
LAPIDUS I don't know where "here" is because this island's not on my charts.
CAESAR Really?
LAPIDUS Really.
CAESAR Because there are some buildings over there... and animal cages. Down the beach, you can see a bigger island across the water. So maybe you should get some new charts.
LAPIDUS Right now, I'm just trying to keep everyone here safe. So let's gather up some firewood.
CAESAR If he wants to wait, let him! I say we search these buildings! Maybe they have a radio or some food! Who wants to help me?!
BEN Why are you following me?
SUN Where are you going?
BEN Back to our Island. ...You wanna come?
AMY Juliet?
JULIET Hey, Amy. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
AMY Oh, no, it's fine.
JULIET I just came to get the sub manifest.  Obviously, I don't want you working today.
AMY Thank you.
JULIET Full load?
AMY Almost. Two of the recruits dropped out in the eleventh hour. They didn't want to take the sedative for the trip. Can you tell Pierre for me?
JULIET Hi. Hi. Oh, hello, little one. Hi.
JULIET Have you and Horace decided on a name?
AMY Yeah, we have. We're gonna name him Ethan.
AMY Oh, hey, buddy. So... when are you and Jim gonna have one of these?
JULIET I don't know. Timing's gotta be right.
KATE So the woman who told you how to come back... did she mention that it would be 30 years ago?
JACK No. No, she left that part out.
KATE So what are we supposed to do now?
JACK I'm not sure yet.
HURLEY Sawyer's back!
SAWYER All right, listen. Y'all are gonna be the second batch of recruits comin' in off the sub pullin' into port right about now, so we ain't got much time.
SAWYER Nice suit, doc. Not exactly Island wear. Try this.
JACK You want us to say we came in on the sub. How's that gonna work?
SAWYER Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so no one meets each other until we process 'em.
JACK Look, we need to find the rest of the people from the plane.
SAWYER If there was a plane, Jin will find it. So we got about ten minutes to make intake, or y'all are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time. There ain't another batch of recruits due in for six months.
JACK What do you think?
KATE I think we should listen to Sawyer.
HURLEY I vote for not camping.
SAWYER Trust me. Do what I say. Everything will be fine. Let's move.
RADZINSKY I just heard from the Looking Glass. They were the last station to check in. They got nothing but an incoming sub. Why don't you go home, and I'll call you if something happens?
RADZINSKY Move. Move. Out of my way.
RADZINSKY Those bastards.
JIN What do you see?
RADZINSKY Grid 325. Motion sensor alarm was tripped. We got a Hostile inside the perimeter.
RADZINSKY Hey! Where you going?!
JIN Stop right there!
JIN Sayid?
SAYID Jin?
JIN Where's Sun?
SAYID I don't know.
JIN Shut up!
JIN Get down! Say another word, and you're dead.
HURLEY Okay, so it's 1977.
SAWYER Yep.
HURLEY And... you guys are all members of the DHARMA Initiative.
SAWYER Yep.
HURLEY Well, you do realize those dudes get wiped out, right? I saw where all the bodies got dumped.
SAWYER What about it?
HURLEY Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em? Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?
SAWYER I ain't here to play Nostradamus to these people. Besides, Faraday's got some interesting theories on what we can and can't do here.
JACK Did you say Faraday? He's here?
SAWYER Not anymore.
WOMAN ON PA ...recruits will be going inside for processing, where you'll be given your work assignment and lodging.
SAWYER Put these on and listen up. Juliet's got it worked out so your name's gonna be on the list, all right? So when you get in there, just watch the little meet and greet video, wait for 'em to call your name. When they do, just smile, step up, take your jumpsuits and work assignments.
JACK Work assignments?
SAWYER Yeah, don't worry. I got it covered. Just remember to act a little doped up, 'cause you just woke up from the sub.
HURLEY What if they start asking us questions we can't answer, like, uh, who's president in 1977?
SAWYER It's not a damn game show, Hugo. Besides, I'm gonna be in there to get your backs, all right? Let's move.
MILES LaFleur! Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you on the walkie.
MILES What--what the hell are they doing here?
SAWYER They're our new inductees. I'll explain everything later.  Stop staring and tell me what your damn problem is.
MILES It's, uh... it's Jin. There's a 14-J at the Flame.
SAWYER What?
SAWYER Jin, you there?
JIN James, we have a problem. We found a Hostile.
SAWYER What?! What do you mean you found a hostile? Where?
JIN He was wandering in the jungle. Radzinksy's taking care of him now.
SAWYER What's he doing in our territory? It's a violation of the truce.
JIN It's Sayid.
SAWYER What?! Son of a bitch! Was anyone else with him?
JIN No. He was alone.
SUN Wait!
BEN I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't interest me much right now. There are three outriggers near here and I'm gonna take one. So you can come along and help me row... or you can stay here. Frankly, it makes no difference to me.
SUN Why are you leaving?
BEN Why are you staying?
SUN The main Island... is that where Jin is?
BEN Honestly, I don't know. But that's where I'd start looking.
LAPIDUS Sun!
SUN Over here.
BEN Hello, Frank.
LAPIDUS You all right?
SUN Yes, I'm fine.
LAPIDUS I got worried when I couldn't find ya. I saw him leaving. What are you doing out here?
SUN Ben knows where there's a boat. I'm going back to the main Island with him.
LAPIDUS You don't think you can really trust this guy, do ya?
SUN I have to trust him.
BEN You're ready?
SUN Yes.
LAPIDUS Sun. I want you to think about this, okay? This guy is dangerous. Sun, that boat I came here on--it was filled with commandos whose only mission was to get him.
BEN And how'd that work out for everyone?
LAPIDUS Don't do it.
SUN Why don't you come with us?
LAPIDUS I can't. I got a group of people I gotta look after.
BEN That's right, Frank. A captain's first responsibility is to his passengers. But I have people I have to take care of, too. There's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water. It leads directly to a town where I used to live. There are resources there. So, if anyone can help you and the rest of the plane get out of here safely, it--
LAPIDUS I thought you trusted this guy.
SUN I lied.
KATE How are we gonna do this?
PHIL Shephard? Jack Shephard?
JACK Here we go.
PHIL Hey, Jack. Have a seat.
DR. CHANG Of course it isn't here... 
JACK What's that?
DR. CHANG Your file. Could they be any more disorganized on the other side? Sorry. Namaste. I'm Pierre Chang. Welcome to the DHARMA Initiative. How was your ride in?
JACK It was fine.
DR. CHANG Good. Who was your shuttle driver?
JACK I'm sorry?
DR. CHANG Uh... the shuttle from the sub. Who was your driver?
JACK Oh, that was, uh... um... Mr. LaFleur.
DR. CHANG Ah, yes. Good man, LaFleur. Runs a very tight operation.  I'm sorry for the disorganization. The woman who was supposed to be processing you in had a baby last night. I got pulled out of my lab. I... ah, here it is... your job assignment.  You've been assigned to the Shed.
JACK "Work man." What does--what does that mean?
DR. CHANG Based on your aptitude test, you'll be doing janitorial work.
PHIL Hey there, ma'am.
KATE Hi.
PHIL They haven't called you yet?
KATE No. Not yet.
PHIL What's your name?
KATE Kate... Austen.
PHIL Austen.  Austen... Huh. You're not on my list, and you're not on the sub manifest either. Who's your recruiter?
KATE Um...
JULIET Hold on, Phil.  I just got the new list from Amy. Some, uh, last-minute additions, including... Miss Austen?
PHIL All righty then. She's all yours.
JULIET I'm sorry for the mix-up. I'm Juliet.
KATE Kate.
JULIET Hi, Kate. Welcome to the Island.
SAWYER What the hell happened?
JIN Sayid just came walking out of the jungle in handcuffs alone.
SAWYER What? Did he say anything about the plane they were on?
JIN No, I couldn't talk to him. Radzinsky thinks he's a Hostile. He won't leave us alone.
SAWYER I got this.
SAWYER Where is he?
RADZINSKY Locked in the storage room.
SAWYER Give me the key.
RADZINSKY You need to know, LaFleur--he saw the model of the Swan, and he could've seen the survey of where we're building it.
SAWYER Your point is?
RADZINSKY He's a spy. This whole thing is an act, and we either play into it or we don't. We can end this right now.
SAWYER What the hell are you talking about, Radzinsky?
RADZINSKY We shoot him.
SAWYER Well, I appreciate your input there, quick draw. But I wanna talk to him first. Give me the damn keys.
SAWYER My name's LaFleur. I'm head of security. I want you to listen real carefully to what I got to say. And if you do that, you'll be fine. Understand?
SAWYER All right, let's start simple. Identify yourself as a Hostile.
SAWYER The terms of the truce say you gotta identify yourself as a Hostile, or we got the right to shoot you.
SAYID We do not refer to ourselves as "Hostile", but yes, I--I am one of them.
SAWYER All right. Good. Then we can proceed like a couple of gentlemen. Let's go. Just taking him back to the barracks.
RADZINSKY Oh, if you're taking him in, then I'm coming with you.
RADZINSKY This is a horrible mistake. I'm gonna talk directly to Horace about this.
SAWYER Fine. Talk away.
LAPIDUS You wanna remind me why the hell we're doing this?
SUN Ben said if my husband is on the Island, the best place to start looking for him is here.
LAPIDUS Oh, I see, that's some advice you took before you whacked him in the head.
LAPIDUS Whoa.
LAPIDUS Tell me you saw that.
SUN Probably just an animal.
LAPIDUS Animal. Right.
LAPIDUS I'm sorry to say, Sun, but... I don't think we're gonna find your husband here. Maybe we oughta just head back.
MAN Hello.
LAPIDUS Who the hell are you?
MAN My name's Christian.
SUN I'm looking for my husband. His name is Jin Kwon. Do you know where he is?
CHRISTIAN Follow me.
SUN What is this place?
CHRISTIAN '72... '76, '78...
SUN Where is my husband?
CHRISTIAN Uh, here we go. '77. He's, uh... he's with your friends.
SUN What are you talking about? What friends?
CHRISTIAN I'm sorry, but you have a bit of a journey ahead of you.
MAN Okay, ready? Everybody say, "Namaste!"
ALL Namaste.
HURLEY Nama-what?
PHIL Okay.  Right on. So you guys have the rest of the day to get acquainted with your security protocol handbooks waitin' in your new digs. Now some of it may seem a little scary, but I promise you all, we are perfectly safe here, okay? So make yourselves at home. Come on. We got hamburgers. We got punch.
SAWYER You there, Phil? We're coming in with a 14-J.
PHIL Roger that, Mr. LaFleur.
PHIL Okay, if I could get everyone to hold back, please, we have a minor security situation.
RADZINSKY Move.
HURLEY I guess we found Sayid.
SAWYER All right, you can hang out here until we can figure out what the hell to do with you.
PHIL What are we gonna do with him?
SAWYER Bring the man some damn food. We're not savages.
JACK Ah, excuse me. Um... Could you tell me where James LaFleur lives?
PHIL Uh, that's his house right there.
JACK Thanks.
PHIL But I wouldn't call him "James". He hates it.
JACK 
JULIET Hey, Jack.
JACK I saw you earlier today when you were helping Kate, and I wanted to say something to you then, but...
JULIET We're not supposed to know each other.
JACK Yeah. Um... I was looking for Sawyer. I guess I came to the wrong house.
JULIET No. Come in.
SAWYER Evening, Doc.
JULIET Well, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
SAWYER Take a load off. You want a beer?
JACK No.  No, I'm fine.
SAWYER What can I do for you, Jack?
JACK I don't even know where to start. Uh... how about with Sayid?
SAWYER I had no choice. He was running around in the jungle, got caught by my people. And seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here, I had to improvise.
JACK Improvise?
SAWYER Uh-huh. And for now, Sayid is safe, which is all that matters.
JACK So where do we go from here?
SAWYER I'm working on it.
JACK Really? Because it looked to me like you were reading a book.
SAWYER I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, even during the Blitz. He said it made him think better. It's how I like to run things. I think. I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you, 'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted. See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead.
JACK I got us off the Island.
SAWYER But here you are... right back where you started. So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think, 'cause that's how I saved your ass today. And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow. All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest. Let me do what I do.
SAWYER ...now ain't that a relief?
JACK Yeah.
BOY Hey, Phil. I'm just gonna go in there and deliver him a sandwich.
PHIL All right.
BOY Hello. I brought you a sandwich. I didn't put mustard on it, but if you'd like some, I could get some.
SAYID This will be fine. Thank you.
BOY Are you a Hostile?
SAYID Do you think I am?
BOY What's your name?
SAYID Sayid. What's yours?
BOY I'm Ben.
SAYID It's nice to meet you, Ben.
