CLAIRE Mom! Mom! 
CHARLIE Oh look Aaron! Your mom has finally decided to wake up.
CLAIRE Mmm...
CHARLIE Only way I could get you to sleep in, was to borrow the midget.
CLAIRE And, err, what is all this?
CHARLIE An aperitif...of mysterious island fruit before the breakfast picnic I have set up in your honor a short walk down the beach.
CLAIRE What's gotten into you Charlie?
CHARLIE Sorry?
CLAIRE It's just, you've been so depressed all week, and now it's breakfast in bed and picnics...
CHARLIE I woke up this morning and I thought it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and seize the day, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather do some day-seizing with than you. So, what do you say? Let's drop the cherub off with Auntie Sun and Uncle Jin and you and I, go for a little stroll.
CLAIRE I would love to.
SAYID From the position of this stream, we should be here, and if the scale is right, his people are two miles in that direction. I don’t expect you to confirm that.
LOCKE It's electrical wiring map, Sayid. I'm not sure it's as accurate as you think.
SAYID Well it's certainly not as infallible as the magical carvings on your stick.
LOCKE Hey, the stick did get us to that station.
SAYID Oh, the station which you accidentally blew up.
LOCKE Well, if you'da warned me that the basement was rigged with C4, I might'a been a little more careful.
KATE Why don't you just tell us if we're going the right way?
MIKHAIL You're going the right way.
LOCKE Remind me why we're keeping him alive.
SAYID What do you suggest, we shoot him like a dog?
LOCKE No, I like dogs.
ROUSSEAU He's right; they will not trade his life for his friend's. We should shoot him.
KATE Enough, nobody's shooting anybody. The map says where they are, and he says the map is right. Just keep moving.
CHARLIE Okay, here we are, here we are. Not bad eh?
CLAIRE Not bad at all...
CHARLIE Well, if you take a seat, we'll begin with our first course, which is cereal, we have fresh fruit salad—
DESMOND Good morning.
CHARLIE Morning yourself. What brings you down to the beach, Desmond?
DESMOND Boar running thick. I was hoping you might want to join me in a hunt.
CHARLIE Oh, well thanks for the invite, but as you can see we're just about to begin a picnic.
DESMOND I think hunting might be a better way to spend your day, Charlie. I mean of all the things you could choose to do today, hunting with me might be your best option.
CLAIRE Oh my god, oh, oh my god.
CHARLIE What is it?
CLAIRE I think I know how to get us off this island.
CLAIRE Sun, Jin!
SUN Claire! What's the matter?
CLAIRE I need Jin's nets and fish. We gotta hurry, and buckets, I'm gonna need those too.
JIN 뭐라고 하는 거야?
CLAIRE We have to catch the birds.
SUN What birds?
CLAIRE They just flew over and they're only gonna be here today, so if we're gonna catch one, we need to do it now.
SAWYER Oh, this sounds like fun.
CLAIRE Can you get some nets?
SAWYER Nets for what, Barb—
SAWYER Nets for what, Claire?
CLAIRE Okay, five minutes ago, a flock of seabirds flew over my head. Seabirds are migratory, which means they're going to keep heading south.
SUN I'm sorry; I don't understand why we need to—
CLAIRE They're tagged!
JIN Tagged?
CLAIRE Scientists tag these birds so they can track them. So, when they eventually land in Australia or New Zealand or wherever, somebody's gonna gather them up.
SUN We can send a message!
CLAIRE If we can catch one. Okay, so here's the plan. First we gotta cut up these fish, make chum, that'll get the birds to settle in the water. And then, umm, we're gonna need to cut up some of this net. Charlie, can you go get some knives?
CLAIRE Umm, Charlie.
CLAIRE Charlie!
CHARLIE Yeah, err, how do you even know this stuff about birds, Claire?
CLAIRE I, umm, I watched a lot of nature shows with my mum.
CHARLIE That doesn't exactly make you an expert. I just... I don't want to see you wasting your time, that's all.
CLAIRE So what happened to seizing the day?
CHARLIE Sorry, I don't see the point.
E.R. DOCTOR Hold still dear, just another second. There. We're through now.
OFFICER BARNES Miss Littleton? I'm Officer Barnes. I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to ask you a few questions. Can I—ask you how the accident happened?
CLAIRE A truck forced us off the road.
BARNES Okay... and who was driving?
CLAIRE Me.
BARNES Has anyone contacted your father?
CLAIRE My father died when I was two.
BARNES I'm sorry to hear that. I spoke with the truck driver — he's fine by the way — umm, he said that when you hit him—
CLAIRE No, he hit us.
BARNES At about what speed would you say that happened when you were driving?
CLAIRE It just came out of nowhere, I didn't—
BARNES That's not the question I asked, Miss Littleton.
CLAIRE I don't, I don't know how fast I was driving. Why are you even asking me these questions?!
BARNES These questions are standard procedure when there's a fatality.
CLAIRE My mother is in surgery, she's not dead.
BARNES Right. So she is.
CLAIRE This is not my fault.
BARNES Didn't say it was. Good day Miss Littleton.
KATE Can I ask you something? I told you that your daughter was living with them, and you haven’t asked me a single question about her, you haven't—
ROUSSEAU Your friend, Jack. Do you care about him?
KATE Yes.
ROUSSEAU Imagine 16 years from now, you're told he's still alive, but in your heart, you know that he wouldn't remember you. He wouldn’t know you. He wouldn't even know that you ever cared about him. I haven't asked you questions about my daughter because I do not want to know the answers.
KATE Water?
MIKHAIL No thank you.
KATE So how'd you get here? How'd you get onto this island?
ROUSSEAU Don't waste your breath; whatever he says will be a lie.
MIKHAIL I was recruited when I was 24; I was approached by a man—
KATE I didn't ask you when, I asked you how.
MIKHAIL They brought me on the submarine.
KATE So your people, they can just come and go whenever they want?
MIKHAIL Oh yes, but two weeks ago, our underwater beacon stopped emitting its locator signal. There was an event, an electromagnetic pulse. It would be impossible to come back.
KATE Why would you want to come back?
MIKHAIL You would not understand.
KATE Try me.
MIKHAIL I misspoke. What I meant to say is you are not capable of understanding.
KATE And why am I not capable?
SAYID Kate.
MIKHAIL Because you are not on the list.
KATE What list?
MIKHAIL The man who brought me here, who brought all of my people here, he is a magnificent man.
KATE If Ben's so magnificent, then why did he need one of us to save him?
MIKHAIL Ben? Ben is not. I will try to make this as simple as I can. You are not on the list because you are flawed. Because you are angry, and weak, and frightened.
SAYID The more I learn about your people, the more I suspect you're not as omniscient as you'd have us believe. Don't speak to us as if you know us.
MIKHAIL Of course I don't know you, Sayid Jarrah. How could I? And you, Kate Austen, are a complete stranger to me. But you John Locke, you I might have a fleeting memory of, but I must be confused, because the John Locke I know was paral—
ROUSSEAU Hey! Look at this! Over here... come on.
LOCKE Well, looks like we're here.
CLAIRE Will this work?
JIN Yes, work.
JIN Err, Sun, needs help.
CLAIRE Okay.
CLAIRE Mmm... smells great!
SUN Let's get it over with. This was my mother's worst fear.
CLAIRE What do you mean?
SUN That I would end up doing something very much like this, cutting bait. She had high hopes for my future. They did not include me marrying a fisherman's son.
CLAIRE Well, I guess we don't always turn out like our mother's wanted.
SUN Of course, mine never worked a day in her life.
CLAIRE My mom was a librarian.
SUN Was?
CLAIRE We should get this stuff out there.
LINDSEY Where were you?
CLAIRE Went home to take a shower.
LINDSEY Oh, that must have been nice.
CLAIRE They said she was still in surgery. I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.
LINDSEY Well I'm glad that you're feeling refreshed.
DR. WOODRUFF Good afternoon. Are you the daughter? I'm Doctor Woodruff, neural surgery. I'll be observing your mother for the next few days.
LINDSEY How is she?
WOODRUFF We’ve managed to stabilize her immediate injuries, but... your mother's suffered a severe head trauma. We'll have to wait for the swelling in her brain to go down before we determine the full extent of her injuries. But, uh, I'm afraid we're looking at fairly widespread damage.
CLAIRE Wait, what does that mean?
WOODRUFF It means that right now, these machines are sustaining her life.
CLAIRE It won't always be, I mean when she wakes up she won't need—
WOODRUFF I can't say with any real confidence—that she will wake up.
CLAIRE Can she hear us?
WOODRUFF I'd like to think she can.
LINDSEY How long will she be like this?
WOODRUFF Could be a day, a week, or years. We'll just have to wait and see. But I can assure you she'll be well looked after.
LINDSEY Oh, that's very nice, but we can't pay for that.
WOODRUFF Don't worry; her expenses have already been taken care of.
LINDSEY By whom?
WOODRUFF I've been asked to keep that confidential.
JIN One, two.
CLAIRE Oh no!
JIN 야...
DESMOND Look, I'm sorry.
JIN 이 멍청한 놈아!
DESMOND I'm sorry, man.
JIN 우리 다 죽을 뻔 했잖아!
DESMOND I said I'm sorry.
CLAIRE What the hell is wrong with you?!
DESMOND Look I was shooting at a boar, I had no idea you were out here.
CLAIRE Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
DESMOND He's back at the camp, look I'm really sorry.
CLAIRE So it's just you?
DESMOND Aye it's just me.
CLAIRE Hunting? In the exact same spot we're setting our trap!
DESMOND I was following a boar, Claire.
CLAIRE Oh, so it's just a coincidence then. Where is it?
DESMOND It got away.
CLAIRE You don't want me to catch the birds do you? You and Charlie. What's going on?
DESMOND Why wouldn't I want you to catch the birds?
KATE What is it?
SAYID Don't touch it! Don’t even go near it! What are these pylons?
MIKHAIL What do you think they are?
SAYID A security perimeter. Those sensors on the side would be triggered if anyone passed between them. It's an alarm system, or a trap. Either way, we'd be safer going around it.
MIKHAIL You're right, it was a security perimeter. But like everything else on this island, it hasn't functioned in years.
SAYID Of course it hasn't.
MIKHAIL If you wish to waste your time, be my guest. The pylons encircle the entire Barracks. There is no going around them. If you don’t believe me, look at your map.
SAYID He appears to be telling the truth.
SAYID John, John!
MIKHAIL Thank you.
KATE Oh my god.
LOCKE Sorry.
SAYID Looks like he suffered cerebral hemorrhage.
KATE Why did you do that? We needed him!
LOCKE They were never going to trade him for Jack.
KATE You don't know that!
LOCKE Well you don't know it either! What we do know is that he shot one of his own people who didn't want to be in this exact situation. So I'm going to stick with my opinion.
KATE Yeah, well we could've discussed it.
LOCKE Nobody asked me about it when we brought him along in the first place.
SAYID Alright.
LOCKE Pardon me, for not knowing that they had a— a sonic weapon fence. I didn't know he was gonna die, how would I know that?
SAYID Why are you really here? Are you here for Jack?
LOCKE Why else would I be here?
SAYID We'll talk about this later.
LOCKE Fine by me. Just tell me how we're gonna go through this.
KATE We're not going through it, we're going over it. Sayid, where's the axe?
SAYID It's in his pack.
LOCKE No wait a minute I got it— here I got it.
SAYID I thought you didn't know there was any C4?
LOCKE Well I stand corrected.
SAYID Why did you take it?
LOCKE You never know when a little C4 might come in handy.
SAYID You'll have to do better than that.
CHARLIE Okay, here we go. Ohh...
CLAIRE What's going on with you Charlie?!
CHARLIE Shh, I just put Aaron down.
CLAIRE No, you and Desmond, what's going on?
CHARLIE I don't know what you're talking about.
CLAIRE So you don't know anything about Desmond shooting off his gun and scaring away the birds?
CHARLIE I've been with Aaron, all morning.
CLAIRE You're lying to me Charlie.
CHARLIE I am not lying!
CLAIRE What happened to the guy that woke up this morning and wanted to go and have a picnic and seize the day?
CHARLIE You really wanna know the truth? The glint you saw could have been anything; a piece of glass stuck in the birds foot, or it coulda been nothing at all! I don't want to advocate false hope, Claire. That's all.
CLAIRE Well I'm sorry I bothered you with my stupid ideas. And err, it won't ever happen again. And Charlie, I don't want my baby around liars.
CHARLIE I think you might be overreacting.
CLAIRE Overreacting?! No, I thought you were here for me, that I could count on you! I was wrong!
CHARLIE Claire...
CLAIRE No, I'm on my own and at least I know that now.
CHARLIE Claire...
CLAIRE Just go!
HEAD NURSE Morning dear. Oh, I like your new doctor.
CLAIRE What new doctor?
HEAD NURSE Oh, the American. He's in with your mum now.
LOUDSPEAKER Dr. Brown to the OR stat, Dr. Brown to the OR stat.
CLAIRE 'scuse me.
CLAIRE The nurse said that—are you a doctor?
CHRISTIAN Yes, umm. I'm umm. I'm very sorry, I shouldn't be disturbing you, I was just leaving.
LINDSEY What are you doing here?
CHRISTIAN I was just on my way out, Lindsey.
LINDSEY If Carole knew you were here—
CHRISTIAN She'd what? What would she do? She wouldn't be acting the way you are.
CLAIRE Aunt Lindsey, err, what's going on here? Who is he?
LINDSEY It doesn't matter, just go.
CHRISTIAN Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey? She deserves to know.
LINDSEY Please, just leave us alone.
CHRISTIAN You are not the arbiter here.
LINDSEY No, you are taking advantage of my—
CHRISTIAN Under these circumstances, I do believe that Claire has every right to know!
CLAIRE Just stop it! You are the one paying the bills? Are you the one taking care of all this?
CHRISTIAN Yes.
CLAIRE Then who are you?
CHRISTIAN I'm your father, Claire.
SAYID The system appears to fire a sonic pulse when an object breaks the plane between two pylons. So, as long as we don't break the plane, we should remain unharmed.
ROUSSEAU Why don't we just use the plastic explosive you took?
LOCKE Be my guest, you wanna go stick it on there?
SAYID Whoever climbs over, give those sensors a wide berth.
KATE I'll go first.
LOCKE I guess I'll go next.
SUN Here you go.
CLAIRE Thanks.
SUN You have every right to be upset.
CLAIRE It just doesn't make any sense. Desmond's never gone boar hunting before, and the boar never come that close to the beach.
SUN Well whatever's going on, they're still talking about it.
CLAIRE Can you watch him? 
SUN What are you going to do?
CLAIRE Get some answers.
CLAIRE I'll be with you in a sec!
CLAIRE There you go, that'll be ten bucks.
CLAIRE What are you doing here?
CHRISTIAN Buy you a cup of coffee?
CLAIRE I have nothing to say to you.
CHRISTIAN Claire, I'm leaving tonight, then I'll be out of your life forever. Just one cup of coffee.
CLAIRE So it's true?
CHRISTIAN Yes, it's true.
CLAIRE How'd you find out about the accident?
CHRISTIAN A doctor friend here in Sydney told me. I got the call the minute your mother went into surgery.
CLAIRE Why did she tell me that you were dead?
CHRISTIAN Well, because I, no doubt, left her with so many wonderful memories. Look, we had a fling, I was back in Los Angeles, and she told me she was pregnant, that she was going to have the baby, have you.
CLAIRE And you didn't want to see me?
CHRISTIAN No, no, I came out a bunch of times when you were little. I stayed over, I gave you toys, I sang to you.
CLAIRE Why'd you stop coming?
CHRISTIAN Cause your aunt hates me and your mother didn't like the fact that I had another family.
CLAIRE Why are you here now then? And why'd you come? You could've just paid the bills from the States.
CHRISTIAN I came over because I wanted to help.
CLAIRE Help with what?
CHRISTIAN Claire, your mother is alive, but she's not really living.
CLAIRE What the hell's that supposed to mean?
CHRISTIAN It means that now may be the time to look at other alternatives; other ways to relieve her pain. Now, it is illegal to turn off her machines, but I know of ways that can achieve the same effect without the legal consequences.
CLAIRE Just stop it! You didn't come here to help me, you came here to try and fix a mistake that you made.
CHRISTIAN No honey, that's not true.
CLAIRE You think that just paying her bills makes you noble or something? You come down here and you try and get me to kill her? You know, just go. Why don't you just go, go back to your real family.
CLAIRE You know... You know, you might be my father, but I don't even know your name, and I umm, want it to stay that way.
CHRISTIAN Claire! Claire, Claire listen to me. Do not keep your mother alive for the wrong reasons. Now there is hope and there is guilt. And believe me, I know the difference. Bye kiddo, it was great seeing you again.
CLAIRE What the hell are you doing?!
DESMOND You followed me. Stay back!
CLAIRE It's one of the birds.
DESMOND Stay back!
CLAIRE It's a—
CLAIRE How did you know it was gonna be here?
DESMOND I didn't.
CLAIRE Yes you did, you had to. That's what you and Charlie were arguing about. You knew.
DESMOND How would I?
CLAIRE I don't know, but you know, you walked straight here, no doubt at all about where you were going. You came right to this beach and right to this rock, and lo and behold, there's the bird. What the hell is going on Desmond?
DESMOND See that spot over there? That's where Charlie slipped and fell. He got pounded again and again by the rocks and broke his neck.
CLAIRE What? What are you talking about?
DESMOND That's where Charlie died.
CLAIRE Look what Desmond found.
CHARLIE How 'bout that? It does have a tag. You were right.
CLAIRE Desmond told me everything. About all his visions; that he knew you were gonna get hit by lightning; that you were gonna drown, trying to rescue me in the ocean; how you died trying to get me this bird.
CHARLIE You don't believe all that, do you?
, walks into her mother's hospital room.]
CLAIRE Now who turned the telly off? Don't they know how much you love your nature shows?
CLAIRE That's better. So how are you today Mom? Did you have an okay night? There's umm, something I have to tell you, Mom, something I should have told you a long time ago. I'm pregnant. I err, I'm giving it away, it's for the best. I wish—I don't know how you did it... raising me alone? It must have been so hard. And I was just awful, awful... so horrible to you. I'm so sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all the awful things I said to you in the car; that I hated you; and that I wished you weren't my mother; and I wished you were dead. It's all my fault, the accident and everything. I'm so sorry, mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll see you soon, okay?
CHARLIE To whom it may concern, we are survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. We have survived on this island for 80 days. We were 6 hours into the flight when the pilot said we were off course and turned back towards Fiji. We hit turbulence and crashed. We've been waiting here, all this time, waiting for rescue that has not come. We do not know where we are; we only know you have not found us. We've done our best to live on this island. Some of us have come to accept that we may never leave it. Not all of us have survived since the crash, but there is new life too, and with it, there is hope. We are alive. Please don't give up on us.
CHARLIE It's—it's perfect, Claire.
CLAIRE You know, I'm not giving up on you either, Charlie. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We'll get through this together.
KATE What?
SAYID We're here.
KATE Jack—
TOM Ha! Whoop!
