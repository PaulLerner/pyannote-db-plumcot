JIN Hi there, Hurley.
HURLEY Jin, you're here.
JIN I sure am.
HURLEY Dude, you speak English.
JIN No, you're speaking Korean.
HURLEY 나? 
HURLEY 저 친구 여기서 뭐하는거야? 
JIN Everything's going to change.
HURLEY 뭐? 
JIN Everything's going to change. Have a cluckity-cluck-cluck day, Hugo.
KATE Hurley!
KATE You fell asleep?
HURLEY No, I was just -- resting my eyes.
KATE The Numbers are written right there.
HURLEY Yeah, I remember the Numbers. 
KATE Locke went back to the beach. So, I'll be taking the next shift.
HURLEY Awesome.
KATE Jack told me about your job. At least we have jobs again, right?
HURLEY Hurray for us. 
SAWYER Ain't life grand. What I wouldn't give for a cup of water right now.
JIN 나를 올려 줘. 어서! 포기 하지 마! 
SAWYER No way. No more human pyramids -- just forget it.
MICHAEL Hey. Hey! Hey, let us out of here!
SAWYER No. Just -- chill!
MICHAEL Every minute I spend down here is another minute my boy is still out there.
SAWYER Well, let me break it down for you, Mikey. Right now, Rambina and her buddies are trying to figure out what to do with us. Until they make up their damn mind there ain't nothing we can do.
JIN 어깨에 상처가 아주 심해보여.
SAWYER Ah, yeah. Why don't you pee on it?
LEADER Grab the rope. Please.
SAWYER Don't do it.
ANA LUCIA Climb the rope or I shoot your friend.
ANA LUCIA You next.
SAWYER Don't do it. She's bluffing. The gun's only got one bullet. She ain't going to waste it-
SAWYER Ow, son-of-a-bitch. Ow, God.
ANA LUCIA Grab the rope.
SAWYER You want me, Hotlips, you're going to have to come down here and get me -- -- bitch.
MARY JO 4, 8, 15, 16, and 23, with the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share in, a near record jackpot.
LOTTO OFFICIAL That's right, Mary Jo, because this is the 16th week without a winner.
CARMEN Hugo? Hu.. Hugo! Hugo, wake up. Wake up! 
HURLEY Stop, ow, ow, mom, stop. I just slipped.
CARMEN Slipped sitting down? Is it your heart?
HURLEY Mom, I'm fine.
CARMEN You're lying. I always know because you don't look me in the eye.
HURLEY I'm not lying.
CARMEN Then tell me what happened, huh?
HURLEY It must be something I ate.
CARMEN Yes, it must be something you ate because you eat basura, and you don't exercise.
HURLEY I do exercise.
CARMEN Falling down is not exercise. The only time you move is to lift a drumstick from the bucket. Everyday it's the same thing, Hugo -- you work, TV, chicken. You have to change your life, Hugo. You think someone else will change it for you? Maybe if you pray everyday, Jesus Christ will come down from heaven, take 200 pounds and bring you a decent woman, and a new car. Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.
HURLEY Maybe I don't want to change. Maybe I like my life.
CARMEN Oh, that must be Jesus. Hola, momento. Yes, it is Jesus! He wants to know what color car you want!
CHARLIE Hurley, we need to have a little chat. Don't worry, mommy's off for a walk, so it's just you, me and the baby. Spill it.
HURLEY Spill what?
CHARLIE What's in it?
HURLEY Uh, nothing, really.
CHARLIE You've been out there an entire day and night -- looking at nothing?
HURLEY Well, I guess it's kind of like a bunker, you know, from WWII, only newer.
CHARLIE What's in it?
HURLEY I don't know.
CHARLIE But somehow you know it's a bunker?
HURLEY Well, I guess someone told me.
CHARLIE You're going to lie to me? You're going to lie to the baby?
HURLEY Dude, look, I'd never lie.
CHARLIE Oh, and the time you told you were worth 150 million dollars?
HURLEY It's 156 million.
CHARLIE I'm sorry, I must have confused it with the 900 trillion I am worth myself. And this baby's made of chocolate lollipops. So, if you'll excuse us, I'm going to flap my wings and fly off this Island!
HURLEY Hey, Rose.
ROSE Hey yourself.
HURLEY So, doing laundry, huh?
ROSE Indeed I am. You want to hand me those dirty clothes over there? Thank you.
HURLEY Don't you want to know what happened?
ROSE What happened?
HURLEY You know, out there. Everyone's asking me what's in the Hatch.
ROSE That's your business, honey.
HURLEY Don't you want to know?
ROSE Well, whatever it is, it's not going to help get this laundry done, now is it?
HURLEY Well, actually, it sort of is.
HURLEY It's around here somewhere.
ROSE Someone actually lived down here?
HURLEY Uh-huh.
ROSE Oh. What -- what is it for?
HURLEY It's kind of a long story.
JACK Hurley? Who else did you tell?
HURLEY No one. I swear. Dude, it's a big job. I needed -- help.
ROSE Hello, Jack.
JACK Hey, Rose.
HURLEY She's cool. She won't tell anyone.
ROSE Honey, I don't even know what I would say.
ROSE All this is food?
JACK It's only a matter of time before we have to tell everyone what we found down here. So, do you know what to do?
HURLEY Inventory of all of it, and figure out how we make it last.
JACK And in the meantime, nobody gets anything -- no exceptions. That's your responsibility, Hurley. Okay?
ROSE What's that?
HURLEY You don't want to know.
HURLEY DHARMA Initiative Salad Dressing - Ranch composite. Sounds tasty.
HURLEY Apollo bars? Ever hear of these?
ROSE Huh-uh, but candy is candy. That's what Bernard always says. Talk about a sweet-tooth. That man has a mouth full of sweet-teeth.
HURLEY Bernard, that was your husband?
ROSE Is my husband.
HURLEY Oh, but, I thought he was in the back of the plane. I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
ROSE Oh, no, no -- that's okay. Don't feel bad. Bernard is fine. I know it. You want to get the canned tuna?
HURLEY Everyone's going to hate me, Rose.
ROSE Now that's just plain silly. You're about the only one on this Island that everybody loves.
HURLEY Well, that'll change.
KATE Hey, you guys happen to find any shampoo in here?
ROSE Yeah, there's some right over here.
HURLEY Uh, Kate, you can't take...
KATE Thanks, Hurley. 
ROSE It's just one bottle.
HURLEY That's where it starts.
JOHNNY Hey, Hugo. You okay, man?
HURLEY Yeah, I'm fine.
RANDY Reyes, my office, now!
RANDY You want to tell me something, Reyes?
HURLEY Uh, no.
RANDY You sure about that?
HURLEY Uh, yeah?
RANDY This is last night's surveillance tape.
RANDY You owe the company for an 8 piece dark meat combo.
HURLEY I didn't eat 8 pieces!
RANDY You want to watch the whole tape? Oh, and while you're here, how many times do I get to tell you those napkins cost money, alright? It's two per customer -- two. We are not made of money here at Mr. Clucks, Reyes. I'm not made of money. Are you made of money? Because if you're made of money -- maybe you don't want to work here. So get it together. What -- is that a problem, Reyes?
HURLEY Dude, I quit.
HURLEY Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
JOHNNY Dude, are you okay?
HURLEY I'm, I'm fine.
JOHNNY Randy's losing his brain in there.
HURLEY You should get back in there or he'll have you scrubbing johns for the rest of the week.
JOHNNY Doubt it. I quit, too.
HURLEY What?
JOHNNY Looks like we've got ourselves a day off. Who needs money when you've got good looks?
LOCKE You can come out now. I saw you back at the rock, and then at the mangrove tree. In fact, I walked in a big circle. I'm not sure how you didn't realize it.
CHARLIE Alright, you don't have to insult me.
LOCKE You want to tell me why you've been following me, Charlie?
CHARLIE Yeah. Quite simply, John, there are a lot of secrets around here, and I'm tired of being at the bloody kid's table. I got Claire's baby back. I didn't go swanning off to the Black Rock on the bloody A-Team mission, but I would have if someone had asked me. I think I'm entitled to some sodding answers around here.
LOCKE What do you want to know?
JACK How's it going?
SAYID It's not. On the other side of this door there's more concrete. I'd say it's at least 8 to 10 feet thick.
JACK You see this? 
SAYID Interesting. Good thing this is titanium. Almost no magnetic attraction. But we're not going to get in up here.
JACK Up here?
SAYID Perhaps we can go under it.
LEADER Grab the rope.
SAWYER I ain't doing nothing 'til I know if my friends are okay.
MICHAEL So, we're friends now, huh?
ANA LUCIA Do it now, or the rope comes up.
SAWYER Howdy boys. Thanks for the rescue.
MICHAEL Everything's cool. We had a talk and they believe we were on the plane, too.
SAWYER Swell, I guess we can all sue Oceanic together.
ANA LUCIA What you got there?
SAWYER Nothing.
ANA LUCIA You got a rock? You looking for some revenge? You've got 3 seconds to drop it.
LEADER Ana...
ANA LUCIA 1, 2...
SAWYER Now, hold on...
SAWYER Ow, you didn't say 3.
ANA LUCIA Shut up. When I tell you to do something, you do it -- I say move, you move -- I say stop, you stop. I say jump, what do you say?
SAWYER You first.
ANA LUCIA You don't like the rules, I toss your ass back in the pit right now, you understand?
SAWYER I understand.
ANA LUCIA It's getting dark, we're moving out.
SAWYER Moving out where?
ANA LUCIA What did I just tell you?
SAWYER Sorry, forgot. Just one thing, though -- you hit me again, I'll kill you.
ANA LUCIA Let's go.
CHARLIE He pushed that button every 108 minutes?
LOCKE He did indeed.
CHARLIE But how is that possible? I mean, didn't he sleep?
LOCKE Don't know -- didn't get a chance to ask him.
CHARLIE And after all that time, he just up and left? I mean, why? Where'd he go?
LOCKE Don't know. I tried to track him, but he didn't leave much of a trail. I guess he figured he found his replacements.
CHARLIE Meaning us?
LOCKE Meaning us.
CHARLIE It -- sounds a bit nutty, doesn't it?
LOCKE It is what it is, Charlie.
CHARLIE And what happens if we don't push it?
LOCKE We're not going to find out. I'm setting up a system. I'm still working on it, but it looks like it's going to be two person shifts every 6 hours or so.
CHARLIE Shifts? Pushing a button?
LOCKE Oh, and there's a record player.
CHARLIE What's Hurley been doing there?
LOCKE He's in charge of the food.
CHARLIE Food?
CHARLIE Hey mate? Where you been?
HURLEY Hey, I've been -- around.
CHARLIE I know, Hurley.
HURLEY You know what?
CHARLIE I know about the food. Locke told me everything.
HURLEY Yeah, well, Locke's lying.
CHARLIE Oh yeah, is he lying about the button we have to push every 108 minutes or the Island will explode?
HURLEY It's not going to explode!
CHARLIE Ah , come on.
HURLEY Look, Jack put me in charge. Look, I don't even want...
CHARLIE Is there peanut butter?
HURLEY What?
CHARLIE Peanut butter -- nutty, creamy, staple of children everywhere.
HURLEY Uh, yeah. A couple jars.
CHARLIE Brilliant. How about you give us one? -- It's for Claire.
HURLEY No can do, man.
CHARLIE You're saying no to a nursing mother?
HURLEY It's not like that.
CHARLIE Oh, it's exactly like that. You know, I never thought this would happen but it did. You've become one of them.
HURLEY One of them?
CHARLIE Them - the man... management! I thought we were friends. You've changed, man.
JOHNNY Drive Shaft - more like Suck Shaft.
HURLEY I'm going to go check out the headphones.
JOHNNY Sure, headphones.
STARLA Hu-go.
HURLEY Star-la.
STARLA Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?
JOHNNY We're currently exploring other opportunities.
STARLA You quit?
HURLEY I did.
JOHNNY He's mixing it up today. He's off the rail. Somebody get a straitjacket.
HURLEY Hey, can I try those on?
STARLA You're messing with my worldview here, Hugo. You're my rock. I mean if you quit your job the next thing you know bees will stop making honey, and flowers will die, and, hell, the whole damn thing will fall apart.
HURLEY So, Starla!
HURLEY Sorry. Uh, well, The Hold Steady is playing the Troubadour this weekend, and I was wondering -- maybe Friday...
STARLA Um, I have to work.
HURLEY Oh, no, I didn't mean...
STARLA I could probably go Saturday. Is that cool?
HURLEY Yeah, that's totally cool.
JOHNNY Dude, you've been crushing on this girl for months and doing nothing. Today you're fricking Fabio. Seriously, man, what has gotten into you?
HURLEY Nothing, I just wanted to ask her out before...
JOHNNY Before what?
HURLEY Nothing.
SAYID This is the last duct. I believe we're under the area where we began. They poured concrete all the way down here, too.
SAYID Just as thick.
JACK Maybe there's a way around it.
JACK What is all this stuff?
SAYID My best guess? There's a geothermal generator behind this wall. That's the power source. Careful with these pipes, they're very hot.
JACK That's it -- nothing -- it's blocked. So what do you think, Sayid?
SAYID What do I think about what, Jack?
JACK This place -- the computer? What do you think is going on?
SAYID The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl.
JACK Did you hit something?
SAYID I don't think so. It's coming from over there.
JACK I'm going to check it out.
JACK Hey.
KATE Hey.
JACK You, um, you took a shower.
KATE I had to see if it worked.
JACK How was it?
KATE Uh, pressure sucked, it kind of went cold at one point, and it smelled a little bit like sulfur but -- it was a shower.
JACK Yeah, I know what you mean.
KATE You could use one.
JACK Maybe a little later.
KATE I'll leave the shampoo for you.
LIBBY I'm Libby.
MICHAEL Michael.
LIBBY How many of you -- you know, on the other side of the Island?
MICHAEL When we left, around 40. How many of you survived?
LIBBY 23 of us.
LEADER Are you alright?
SAWYER Now you give a damn.
LEADER I said I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.
SAWYER A misunderstanding is when you bring me lemonade instead of iced-tea.
ANA LUCIA I said no talking.
SAWYER He was talking to me.
ANA LUCIA We're here.
SAWYER What are you going to do -- beam us up?
MICHAEL I thought you said there were 23 of you.
LIBBY There were.
CLAIRE Hi, Sun.
SUN What's wrong?
CLAIRE I -- I found something out in the water, and I told Shannon about it, and we thought you should know about it. It's the messages from the raft. We thought you should decide what to do.
HURLEY Why'd you tell Charlie, man?
LOCKE Because he asked, Hugo.
HURLEY Yeah, well you shouldn't have. You should have listened to me about coming down here, period. Now it's all going to change, everything.
LOCKE Change is good, Hugo.
HURLEY You know, people say that, but it's not true, man. Trust me, I know. And guess who gets to be the bad guy who has to say no you can't have peanut butter for the cute blonde and her poor Island baby. You know who? It's me. -- You know what? I'm not going to do it. Find someone else to deal with the chow, man.
LOCKE No, we all have our jobs, Hugo. My job is to convince people to push a button every 108 minutes without them knowing why -- or for what. Wanna trade?
HURLEY I don't want to do this, man!
LOCKE Yeah, I've had a lot of jobs I didn't want to do. I still did them. I'm sorry, Hugo, you don't get to quit.
HURLEY Okay, then.
JOHNNY Be careful.
HURLEY Dude, I am!
JOHNNY You got it?
HURLEY Yeah, I got it.
JOHNNY Alright, let's go.
JOHNNY Do you think we got enough gnomes?
HURLEY Okay, we're good.
JOHNNY This is genius.
HURLEY A little to the left, dude, and more of an angle.
RANDY Hey!
JOHNNY Run!
JOHNNY Cluck you, Randy!
JOHNNY Freedom!
HURLEY Dude, what are you doing?
JOHNNY Freedom! So, anything else you want to do tonight -- you better let me know now -- because our day off is just about over, Huggy Bear. In about 10 hours we going to have to find ourselves some new employment. I hear Pizza Bin is hiring, or we could try our luck at, ah, Gyro-Rama. But I do kind of dig the chick who works at the Bin.
HURLEY Dude, promise me something.
JOHNNY Okay, what?
HURLEY Promise me that no matter what happens, we'll never change -- this will never change.
JOHNNY Okay. Oh, I know what this is about. I know why you've been acting so weird lately. You're getting that, uh, that, uh, stomach stapling surgery thing, aren't you?
HURLEY I'm not getting surgery.
JOHNNY Awe, c'mon man, it's cool. I mean, I could still be all surprised and be like, ooh, my, Hurley, wow, is that you?
HURLEY Listen, Johnny, I'm serious. Promise me that you and I will always stay the same.
JOHNNY I'll do you one better. Not only will I stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it. Can I borrow 2 bucks?
ROSE What have you got there, Hurley?
HURLEY Uh, it's dynamite.
ROSE Dynamite? Well, what are you doing with it?
HURLEY I'm sorry, but I can't let it happen again.
JOHNNY Why is there a news crew here?
HURLEY Dude, we shouldn't go here. Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here.
JOHNNY Maybe somebody got shot.
ROSE Why are you doing this, honey?
HURLEY Look, just get out of here, Rose.
ROSE But you're going to hurt somebody.
HURLEY Not if I do it from outside the door. It's thick, and I'll make sure there's nobody around first. So, please, will you just go?
ROSE Uh-uh, you hauled me off of the beach and you dragged me into this place -- the least I can get is an explanation before you blow it up!
HURLEY You don't get it! This is going to mess it all up!
JOHNNY Dude, somebody won the lottery!
HURLEY Let me tell you something, Rose! We were all fine before we had any potato chips! But now we've got these potato chips and everybody's going to want them! So Steve gets them, and Charlie's pissed -- but he's not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me!
GAS STATION CLERK That's the guy! That's the guy!
HURLEY And I'm going to be in the middle of it! And then it's going to be well, what about us -- why didn't I get any potato chips? C'mon, help us out, Hurley. Why did you give Kate the shampoo? And why didn't I get the peanut butter? Then, they'll get really mad and start asking why does Hugo have everything -- why should he get to decide? Then they'll all hate me. I don't know what to do.
HURLEY Come on, Jack. The inventory's done, this is the only way.
JACK Are you serious?
HURLEY Dude, there's enough food in there to feed one guy, 3 meals a day for another 3 months. We have 40 people, it's just not going to work. You put me in charge, this is what we're doing.
JACK Okay.
HURLEY Okay?
JACK Yeah, okay.
HURLEY Okay.
BERNARD Um, excuse me. Hi. Back where you guys, uh, where you came from -- is there a woman named Rose there?
SAWYER Black chick in her 50's?
BERNARD Is she, is she okay?
MICHAEL Yeah, man, she's okay.
BERNARD Oh, oh.
MICHAEL Michael, I'm Michael.
BERNARD Thank you, Michael. I'm, I'm Bernard.
MICHAEL Okay, it's okay. She's good.
