ETHAN Hello.
RACHEL Oh, I fell asleep.
JULIET With candles burning -- it's real safe. We don't have to keep doing this, you know.
RACHEL Are you saying that because you don't think it's going to work? Or, because you're afraid he'll find out?
JULIET Lift up your shirt.
JULIET Okay.
RACHEL Some doctor you are.
JULIET I'm not doing this as your doctor. I'm doing it as your sister. I don't like you being here alone. Come stay with me.
RACHEL I like living on the beach.
JULIET This is Miami, Rachel -- everything's on the beach.
JACK You have about an hour's head start before they come after you. Take a walkie, take Sawyer. Go.
KATE Wait, where are you? Where are you?
JACK Kate, listen to me, just listen to me. Do you remember what I told you on the beach? Do you remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up? Do you remember it?!!
KATE Yes, yes, I remember!
JACK When you get safe, you radio me and you tell me that story.
KATE Jack, please.
JACK If I don't get a call from you in the next hour I'm going to know something went wrong and he dies!
KATE I can't leave without you!
JACK Yes you are. Go.
KATE Jack, I can't!
JACK Go! Now!
KATE No, I can't!!
JACK Kate, damn it, run!!!
TOM Juliet, stop the bleeding and stitch him up.
JACK She's not a surgeon; she can't fix this.
JULIET He's right.
KATE Sawyer, let's go! Sawyer!!
TOM Then what the hell do you suggest we do?
JULIET Go get Danny, then find Austen and Ford and bring them back.
JACK No, you do that and Ben dies.
JULIET Go.
JACK You think I'm lying?! You think this is a bluff?! I will let him die!
JULIET No, Jack, you won't. Go, get them back. If you have to, kill them.
JULIET Hello.
DIANA Dr. Burke?
JULIET Yes.
DIANA This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience. I'm calling to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
JULIET Two o'clock, right?
DIANA Two o'clock. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you that he's very much looking forward to meeting you.
JULIET Me too. Thank you.
DIANA Goodbye.
EDMUND These are the main labs... (unintelligible) ...this little baby here took most of last year's grant. You don't really want to talk about that now do you? 
EDMUND Hello, Juliet.
JULIET Hey. Hey, Ed.
EDMUND Why exactly are you here?
JULIET Uh, I, um -- today's lab work -- I got home and I realized I inverted some numbers.
EDMUND And it couldn't wait until the morning?
WOMAN Uh, Edmund?
EDMUND Oh, I'm sorry. How rude of me. Juliet, this is Sherry. Sherry, this is Juliet, my ex-wife. Juliet's leaving.
JULIET I am. 
EDMUND Jules? Could you please turn off the lights?
JULIET You haven't thought this through, Jack. Your plan's not going to work.
JACK Yeah? Why's that?
JULIET Your friends aren't going to make it back to your side of the island because we're not on that island. We're on a smaller island two miles offshore.
TOM Afraid so.
JULIET So why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful resolution?
JACK A peaceful resolution?
JULIET That's right.
JACK Is that what you call asking me to kill Ben while on the operating table? Make it look like an accident?
JULIET That's ridiculous.
JACK She wants Ben to die. She said if I did it that she would protect me!
JULIET Tom! He's lying! I don't know what you're trying to do, Jack, but...
TOM ENOUGH! Juliet, get out.
JULIET Tom, he's lying!
TOM You said you can't stitch him up -- then you don't need to be in here. Go Julie.
JULIET Don't let him fool you. He'll never let a patient just die.
PICKETT Hey! Hey, can anybody hear me?!
IVAN What happened?
PICKETT Open the cage.
IVAN Where's--?
PICKETT Just open the damn cage!
KATE That's our island?
SAWYER What, you didn't believe me when I told you before?
KATE We need a boat.
SAWYER Yeah, a couple of towels and buffet lunch.
KATE We'll just keep following the beach. There's got to be one around here somewhere. How else would they get back and forth?
SAWYER Why don't you stop and ask for directions?
KATE Jack, are you there?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
KATE Are you okay?
JACK I'm fine.
SAWYER Tell him I said hi -- get to the point!
KATE Jack, we need a boat. We need some way to get off this island.
JACK You heard her. How do they get off this island?!
SAWYER What's he doing?!
JACK Kate? Kate?!
JACK Kate?
ALEX This way.
PICKETT Jason, you alright?
PICKETT Over there! Over there!
ALEX Come on, get inside. Get inside, go.
PICKETT Come on. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Shh, shh. What? Where'd they go?
IVAN That way.
SAWYER Nice to meet you, Sheena.
TOM Is it true?
JACK Is what true?
TOM What you said -- did Juliet really ask you to kill him?
JACK Yeah, and in about 40 minutes she's going to get her wish.
BEN Hey, that's not helping anything. Now, could somebody please get Juliet?
SHERRY Juliet, Edmund wants to see you in his office.
JULIET Do you work here?
SHERRY I'm the new research assistant.
JULIET Of course you are.
EDMUND I want in.
JULIET In on what?
EDMUND I know what you're doing, Juliet.
JULIET I'm not really sure what...
EDMUND I read your notes. I know what you took from the lab. The only thing I don't know is who's your guinea pig.
JULIET Ed, I've been doing my research in my own lab, on my own time. I don't really see how--
EDMUND It's your sister, isn't it? Look, Jules, there's two ways this plays out. One is your research is potentially genius. And the other -- it raises some very serious ethical questions. Maybe even criminal concerns. But if you collaborate with me, based on my reputation, all this is viewed as cutting edge science. And we will win prizes and drink champagne. And do a lot of good for people. Why don't I give you some time to think about it?
TOM Juliet, Ben's awake.
JULIET How?
TOM Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon, not an anesthesiologist. Ben's asking for you.
SAWYER This a hobby of yours, Underdog -- digging holes?
ALEX Yep. That and basket weaving. Want one?
SAWYER Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?
ALEX No, but I've got a boat.
KATE Can we use it?
ALEX Yeah, but we've got to hurry.
SAWYER Hold on a second, sister. You just happen to find us in the woods? You just happen to have a boat, and you're going to let us use it, huh?
ALEX There's something we need to do first.
SAWYER Oh, gee.
ALEX My boyfriend is being held prisoner. If you help me rescue him, I promise you I'll get you back to the other island.
SAWYER Your boyfriend -- his name happen to be Karl?
ALEX Yeah.
SAWYER Aw, sheee, come on.
JACK I stopped the surgery.
BEN I know. I've been able to hear you for a few minutes now. It's very clever of you. I should have seen it coming.
JACK Are you in pain? I can...
BEN No, but thanks all the same.
BEN I'd like to speak to Juliet alone, please, Jack.
JACK No. No, I'm sorry.
BEN Please, I'm asking you one gentleman to another. It won't hurt you to give me three minutes, will it? Knowing I have only 27 left?
JACK If you touch him, if you try...
JULIET I won't.
JACK You've got three minutes.
TOM I'm Tom, by the way.
TOM They've got history.
JULIET I would like you to go back in there, put Ben under, and finish the surgery.
JACK And why would I want to do that?
JULIET Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.
ALPERT Thank you for taking the time to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke. Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon. We're just outside of Portland. Uh, these shots might seem a little cheese-ball, but our people really are this happy. Now why? Because we're privately funded. Privately funded means freedom. We organize trips every week in and around the Portland area which is just awesome for hiking and biking and river running.
JULIET Look, when you -- your company -- reached out to me I was flattered. But I don't really know why you would want me.
ALPERT Is it true that you successfully impregnated a male field mouse?
JULIET He didn't carry to term.
ALPERT Mind if I ask you something?
JULIET Sure.
ALPERT What do you see?
JULIET Well, that's a human womb, obviously. Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium I would say that the woman was somewhere in her seventies.
ALPERT Well, actually, she's 26.
JULIET What happened to her?
ALPERT What if I told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out? We think you're special, Dr. Burke. And we want you to lead a team of highly trained people because we think you're just that good.
JULIET I can't.
ALPERT Why can't you?
JULIET My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I...
ALPERT He wouldn't want you to have this opportunity?
JULIET No, he doesn't want me to have anything. He would never give the okay. It's...
ALPERT Maybe we could reach out to him on your behalf?
JULIET Don't bother.
ALPERT There must be something that he would respond to.
JULIET If he were hit by a bus. How about that? That would work. How totally inappropriate.
ALPERT No, no, no.
JULIET No, I, uh -- I'm sorry, but I've wasted your time.
ALPERT Dr. Burke, please -- no, you don't...
JULIET No, I'm sorry. Whatever you think I am, I'm not. I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert. I'm a mess.
JULIET Oh, hell.
ALEX Karl's got to be in there.
SAWYER What, you mean you ain't sure?
ALEX It's the only place I haven't looked.
KATE You know the guard?
ALEX Yeah, his name's Aldo.
SAWYER Aldo? Okay, Lollipop, you want to tell me how we're going to get by him with one gun and no bullets?
KATE I've got an idea.
SAWYER Of course you do.
ALEX Open the door!
ALDO Alex? What the hell are you doing?
ALEX They must have gotten out of their cages. I caught them in the jungle. Now open up, Aldo!
ALDO Whoa! Whoa! Just stop! Alex, you're not supposed to be here. If your dad finds out, he's going to kill me.
ALEX My dad was the one who told me to bring them here -- to you. Look, maybe you should call him. I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.
ALDO Danny, I need Ben.
PICKETT Why?
ALDO Listen, I've got Alex here. She's got Austen and Ford with her.
PICKETT Damn it, whatever she says, don't believe it. Hold them right there. I'm on my way.
SAWYER Don't get mad at me just because you were dumb enough to fall for the old Wookiee prisoner gag.
ALEX Where's Karl?
ALDO I have no idea what you're talking about.
KATE Shoot him in the knee.
SAWYER What?
KATE Give me the damn rifle. We don't have time for this. I'll do it.
ALDO Whoa! Whoa! Okay, alright! He's at the end of the hall, room 23. Keys are in my back pocket.
SAWYER Damn good con, Freckles. I almost believed you were going to shoot that boy.
KATE It wasn't a con.
ALEX Here it is!
SAWYER Give it to me.
KATE Help! Help!
ALEX It's okay; we're here to help.
ALEX Is he okay?
SAWYER Look, we got your boyfriend back. Now, where's your damn boat?
PICKETT Idiot! Where are they?
ALDO I don't know. Alex is with them.
JULIET Danny! We're letting them go.
PICKETT Letting them go?
JULIET Ben gave the order.
PICKETT Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
JULIET He woke up.
PICKETT Oh, he woke up, huh?
JULIET Shephard won't finish the surgery unless he knows his friends are off the island. Do you want Ben to die?
PICKETT I know Ben would rather die than let them go.
RACHEL Hey. How was the interview?
JULIET It's not for me.
RACHEL What?
JULIET It's fine. We're too far away, anyway. It's Portland.
RACHEL Jule, you didn't say no because of me.
JULIET Well, why would I want to go all the way to Portland for research that doesn't even work?
RACHEL Because it does work. I'm pregnant. I'm pre -- I'm pregnant.
JULIET What?
RACHEL Look, look. I took a blood test, too. I didn't want to tell you until I was sure.
JULIET It worked.
RACHEL Yeah.
RACHEL My whole life all I ever wanted was to have a baby. And now because of you I can. Oh, God. Now I just need to get healthy. Now I just need to get healthy so I can see the little bugger get into an Ivy League school, you know.
JULIET You will. Of course you will. You will.
RACHEL Now you can tell that bastard ex-husband of yours what he can do with his ethics.
EDMUND Because you're insufferable. And you're mean. Well, you asked me for the truth, Mom, and that's the truth.
JULIET Ed!
EDMUND Let me call you later, okay? Okay, bye. Hello, Jules. What's up?
JULIET She's pregnant.
EDMUND Excuse me?
JULIET It worked. Rachel's pregnant.
EDMUND Ju -- Julia, that's -- wow. I need, uh -- I need to see your labs. We'll have to verify the data if we're going to...
JULIET No! I'm not interested in publishing, Ed. It's my sister.
EDMUND Fine, then, if you're not interested why are you concerned--?
JACK You okay?
TOM Yeah, I just don't like blood too much.
JACK Well, then you probably won't want to be looking at that. So, if you really can get off the island why didn't you just take him to a facility? Why all this?
TOM Because ever since the sky turned purple, we've been...
TOM What the hell happened?!
JACK I just nicked an artery.
TOM Isn't that what you already did?
JACK Yeah, well, that was on purpose.
TOM Can you fix it?!
JACK Damn it!
SAWYER You got him?
KATE I got him.
SAWYER Nice ride.
KATE Karl, we've got to go now, okay? Can you stand?
ALEX Help me.
KATE Okay, can you stand?
SAWYER So, you're the boss's daughter, huh? I never saw that coming. Let's go, Cheech; we're going for a little ride.
ALEX Careful.
SAWYER Alright, alright, easy. I'm going to put you in the boat, alright?
ALEX Wait, wait. You'll be okay.
KARL Danny.
SAWYER No, Sawyer.
KARL Danny!
KATE No!
JULIET Danny!
TOM What happened? Is he...?
JACK I can't see.
TOM What?
JACK I can't see. There's too much blood. Alright, get over here. Tom, he's going to die if you don't get over here right now.
JULIET Go. Get out of here.
SAWYER You heard the lady.
ALEX Let's go.
JULIET Not you, Alex. You're staying.
ALEX Why?
JULIET We both know your father. The only way he'll let Karl live is if you're here when he wakes up. I'm sorry, Alex.
KARL Hey, Alex.
ALEX Hey.
KARL I missed you.
ALEX I know. I missed you, too. You have to go away now; but I'll see you real soon.
KARL I love you. I have to go sleep now.
JULIET Wait.
JACK Easy. Okay, easy.
TOM Wait. Wait!
JACK Hold it steady, damn it. Hold it steady.
KATE Jack, are you there?
JACK Alright, hold that up to me. The walkie, hold it up to me.
TOM What about the surgery?
JACK Just do it!! Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?
KATE Yeah, I -- we've got a boat. They're letting us go.
JACK Who's letting you go?
KATE The blond woman.
JACK So you're safe -- you and Sawyer?
KATE Yes, yeah.
JACK Tell me.
KATE Tell you?
JACK The first day on the beach -- the day of the crash -- the story that I told you. If you're safe, tell me.
TOM You think this is the best time, doctor?
JACK Shut up!!!
KATE You were doing surgery on a girl and you messed up. You made a mistake. You tore something on her back and all the nerves came loose. And you said you were so afraid. And you said the fear was so real. And you didn't know what to do, so you counted to five. And then you weren't afraid anymore. And then it was just gone. And you fixed her. You saved her.
JACK I need you to make me a promise, Kate.
KATE Jack?
JACK Promise me that you'll never come back here for me. Don't come back, Kate.
KATE Jack, where are you?
JACK Turn it off. 
KATE Jack! Jack, please, where are you? 
SAWYER The trades are coming. We've got to go. Let's go.
MORGUE EMPLOYEE We have some paperwork we need you to sign; but take your time. There's no rush.
JULIET Thank you. 
JULIET Were you able to remove the tumor?
JACK Yeah. You'll want to do a biopsy -- see if it's malignant. So what now? I just go back to my cell?
JULIET Until they figure out what to do with you.
JACK "They." What did he say?
JULIET I'm sorry?
JACK Ben. What did he say that made you want to save his life?
JULIET It doesn't really matter what he said.
JACK It matters to me. After everything that I have been put through, you owe me an answer. I want to know what he said.
ETHAN Tissue?
JULIET Thank you. Thanks. Have we met?
ALPERT Hello, Dr. Burke.
JULIET Mr. Alpert?
ALPERT I'm so sorry for your loss.
JULIET What are you doing here?
ALPERT I saw what happened on the news and your office said you were down here. I just wanted to express my condolences in person before I went back up to Portland. This is Ethan. He's one of my colleagues.
ETHAN It's a pleasure to meet you.
JULIET He was hit by a bus.
ALPERT I know. They say you were there when it happened. You must have been...
JULIET No! No. In our interview I said -- I said that I wanted him to get hit by a bus.
ALPERT Dr. Burke, I realize that you're a little shook up right now, but this is just a tragic accident. You can't blame yourself. I don't even remember you saying that.
JULIET Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?
ALPERT Look, I know the timing is horrible. But we came because we're that serious about getting you to come work with us. Just give us six months. If you need to, you can be back before your sister gives birth.
JULIET How did you know that my...?
ALPERT Well, we're very thorough in our recruitment process.
JULIET Can my sister come?
ALPERT Won't work. We're pretty remote. She wouldn't have access to the treatment that she needs.
JULIET But, it's Portland. There's plenty of clinics and...
ALPERT Well, actually we're not quite in Portland.
JACK I want to know what he said.
JULIET I've been on this island for 3 years, Jack. 3 years, 2 months, and 28 days. He said that if I let him live and I helped you -- that he would finally let me go home.
