dr_jack_shephard Hey mom.
margo_shephard SHEPARD Have they found him yet?
dr_jack_shephard No, I... I called a couple of hours ago, and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.
margo_shephard SHEPARD How do you lose a body?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know mom, but there's nothing we can do except for wait for more information.
margo_shephard SHEPARD I don't want to wait Jack, how am I supposed to get anything done. I can't even find his will. Papers everywhere!
dr_jack_shephard Look mom, I'll come over in a couple of hours an we'll find it together, okay?
margo_shephard SHEPARD Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Now, mom, when did I have my appendix taken out?
margo_shephard SHEPARD You were seven, or eight, maybe. You collapsed at school. Your father wanted to do the procedure himself, but they wouldn't let him. You don't remember that?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I... I guess I do.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, dammit. Mom, I gotta go.
margo_shephard SHEPARD Well don't forget to call--
dr_jack_shephard Hey. Sorry I'm late. Thought I had enough time to go home and change after work.
david_shephard Don't worry about it.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry David, okay.
david_shephard Okay, Dad.
dogen I was afraid you'd left.
dr_jack_shephard Is leaving an option?
dogen Everything is an option. But I would have to stop you.
dr_jack_shephard Well...I appreciate your honesty.
dogen Your friends - Ford and Austen and Kwon - they are not coming back, are they?
dr_jack_shephard No, probably not.
dogen I appreciate your honesty.
hugo_reyes Tie again, Dude.
miles_straume Shocker. That's it for me.
hugo_reyes Hungry?
miles_straume Are you?
hugo_reyes I could eat.
hugo_reyes Hey man, you know if there's like a kitchen in this place?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode05 It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Dude, what are you doing here ?
jacob I'm here because I need you.
hugo_reyes For what?
jacob You should probably get a pen, you're going to have to write a few things down.
hugo_reyes What kind of things?
jacob Someone's coming to the island. I need you to help them find it.
dr_jack_shephard Hooked up the cable in here, so you can watch the Red Sox if you want.
david_shephard Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard You reading this?
david_shephard Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard I used to read this to you when you were little. You always wanted to hear about Kitty and Snowdrop, they were Alice's...
dr_jack_shephard Hey. Hey! David.
dr_jack_shephard What are you listening to?
david_shephard You haven't heard of them.
dr_jack_shephard I'm just trying to have a conversation with you David.
david_shephard Why? We see each other like once a month. Can't we just... get through it.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah mom?
margo_shephard Where are you? I thought you were coming over?
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. I'm heading out right now. I'll be right there.
dr_jack_shephard I have to go over to your grandmother's house, you wanna come?
david_shephard No thanks.
dr_jack_shephard All right well, I'll be back in about an hour, then we'll eat, OK?
david_shephard Great.
sayid_jarrah Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Why are they all staring at me?
dr_jack_shephard Just ignore them.
sayid_jarrah Look, you told me these people think I have an infection, that they wanted to give me some mysterious pill that you instructed me not to take. And then you disappeared. What are you hiding from me?
dr_jack_shephard The pill was poison. They wanted me to kill you. Whatever it is they think happened to you Sayid, they say it happened to someone else too.
sayid_jarrah Who?
jinsoo_kwon Claire!
claire_littleton I'm gonna get you out of there.
jinsoo_kwon How long have you been out here?
claire_littleton Since you all left. How long ago was that?
jinsoo_kwon Three years.
claire_littleton I can get you somewhere safe. Come on - think you can walk?
jinsoo_kwon I don't know.
dogen What are you doing?
hugo_reyes Nothing. I'm just you know...looking...because I'm a fan of ...temples and like history...Indiana Jones stuff.
dogen You shouldn't be here. Go back to the courtyard.
jacob Tell him you can do what you want. Tell him you're a candidate.
hugo_reyes I'm a candidate and I can do what I want.
dogen Who told you that?
hugo_reyes Doesn't matter. Why don't you go back to the courtyard ?
dogen Ore ga omae wo mamoraneba narannowa,un ga yokattana Denakereba sonokubi wo haneteta
hugo_reyes What'd he say?
jacob You don't want to know. What are you doing here Hugo?
hugo_reyes Going through the secret passageway like you told me.
jacob I told you to bring Jack with you.
hugo_reyes You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's like impossible. I can just go myself.
jacob You have to bring him with you Hugo.
hugo_reyes OK it's bad enough you already made me write down way too much stuff, and I just lied to a Samurai. Look, if you've any idea of how to get Jack to go on your little adventure, I'm listening dude.
hugo_reyes Be cool man. Act natural.
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes Dude, keep your voice down. I'm gonna get up and go. Wait ten seconds and then follow me.
dr_jack_shephard Follow you where?
hugo_reyes I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.
dr_jack_shephard You found a secret tunnel?
hugo_reyes Well, Jacob told me about it. Said you and me have to go.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.
hugo_reyes I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you "You have what it takes."
dr_jack_shephard What'd you just say?
hugo_reyes He said you have what it takes, he said you'd know what that meant.
dr_jack_shephard Where is he?
hugo_reyes What?
dr_jack_shephard Jacob. Where is he?
hugo_reyes He's kind of dead. Turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi. But...if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude.
dr_jack_shephard Well then let's go see Jacob.
jinsoo_kwon Claire?
claire_littleton Get in there!
claire_littleton So, look what I found! One of the men who tried to kill you! He was just pretending to be dead but he wasn't. Now we get to talk to him!
justin You wanna talk to me about what?
claire_littleton About where you're hiding my son.
claire_littleton We'd better get that cleaned up. If there's one thing that'll kill you around here it's infection.
claire_littleton I'll be right back, don't move, okay?
jinsoo_kwon Claire?
jinsoo_kwon Have you been out here all this time...by yourself?
claire_littleton Oh, no, no, I'm not by myself.
justin Look, we've gotta get out of here now.
jinsoo_kwon It's okay. I know her.
justin No. I know her. Do you have any idea what she's gonna do to us...if we don't get outta here now?! She's gonna kill us both!
dr_jack_shephard Which way?
hugo_reyes It's this way.
dr_jack_shephard Whoa! Hey, it's me!
kate_austen Jack! I almost shot you!
dr_jack_shephard I noticed! What are you doing out here? Where...where's Jin and Sawyer?
kate_austen Jin went back to the Temple, and... Sawyer's on his own.
hugo_reyes Hey, Kate. There's a secret door to get back into the Temple on the north wall by the big tree...
kate_austen Yeah, I'm not going back to the Temple. I'm going to find Claire.
dr_jack_shephard Kate...
kate_austen I'm going back to the beach camp. She might still be there, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, she's not at the beach... The people at the Temple said that something happened to her.
kate_austen Do they know where she is?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know, they didn't say.
kate_austen I have to...I have to find her.
dr_jack_shephard Kate...wait...wait! Come with us and then we'll all go back to the Temple together.
hugo_reyes Dude! Jacob said just you and me...she's kinda not invited.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'm inviting her.
kate_austen Jack, it's okay. Just go. It's alright. I hope you find what you're looking for. .
margo_shephard We're never going to find it.
dr_jack_shephard Take it easy, Mom. It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.
margo_shephard It's like a needle in a damned haystack. Why your father wouldn't just give his will to his lawyer is beyond me.
dr_jack_shephard Well, why would he make it easy on us now?
margo_shephard You want a drink?
dr_jack_shephard Uh...no, no, no thanks.
margo_shephard Good for you.
margo_shephard How's David holding up?
dr_jack_shephard What?
margo_shephard He was really upset at the funeral.
dr_jack_shephard He was?
margo_shephard He didn't tell you?
dr_jack_shephard No...no, he didn't. Communication is not one of his strong suits.
margo_shephard Well, it runs in the family. When you were David's age your father was lucky if he could get more than one word out of you at a time.
dr_jack_shephard That's because I was terrified of him, Mom.
margo_shephard How do you know David isn't terrified of you?
dr_jack_shephard Why would he be?
margo_shephard I don't know, Jack. Maybe you should ask him.
margo_shephard Found it. Last will and testament.
margo_shephard Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah?
margo_shephard Did your father ever mention a Claire Littleton?
justin Psst! Hey! Untie me before she comes back in!
jinsoo_kwon Why would I do that?
justin Are you not listening to me? She's gonna kill us both! Loosen my ropes, and when she comes back in, I'll snap her neck.
claire_littleton So, I'm...really sorry you got stuck in my trap. Gonna get you all cleaned up, now, okay?
claire_littleton It's alright, you're doing good. Well. at least you don't have to stitch yourself up. . I had to do that once. They shot me right here .
jinsoo_kwon You've been living here since we left?
claire_littleton Not always here. I had to, um, move around quite a lot. To hide from them.
claire_littleton Lucky I'm still alive.
jinsoo_kwon What are you going to do with him?
claire_littleton He's gonna tell me where they've got my baby. Where they...where they've got Aaron.
justin We don't have your kid!
claire_littleton You're lying, okay, I know you have him.
justin You're crazy! We never took your...
claire_littleton Shut up.
jinsoo_kwon Claire, how do you know they took him? How can you be so sure?
claire_littleton How can I be so sure? Well, first my father told me, and then my friend told me, so I'm pretty damn sure.
jinsoo_kwon Your friend? Who's your friend?
claire_littleton My friend. You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Yes, yes, of course.
claire_littleton Good. I'm glad. All done. Good as new.
claire_littleton Okay. So. Now it's your turn.
hugo_reyes Sorry, dude.
dr_jack_shephard For what?
hugo_reyes You know, what happened back there. Wrecking your game with Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Don't worry about it. There's nothing left to wreck.
hugo_reyes Yeah? What happened to you guys? I thought you were gonna get married and have like a dozen kids.
dr_jack_shephard Guess I wasn't cut out for it.
hugo_reyes Really? I think you'd make a great dad.
dr_jack_shephard I'd make a terrible dad.
hugo_reyes What is that?
dr_jack_shephard Asthma inhaler.
hugo_reyes Dude, it's Shannon's.
dr_jack_shephard We're at the caves.
hugo_reyes The caves we used to live in?
hugo_reyes I totally forgot these were in here, man.
hugo_reyes Wait a sec. What if we time-travelled again? To, like, dinosaur times? And then we died and then we got buried here? What if these skeletons are us?
hugo_reyes What's that?
dr_jack_shephard Did I tell you how I found this place?
hugo_reyes You were looking for water, right?
dr_jack_shephard No. I was chasing the ghost of my dead father. He led me here. That was his coffin. Before I smashed it to pieces.
hugo_reyes Why'd you do that?
dr_jack_shephard Because he wasn't in it.
dr_jack_shephard David? I got us pizza!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, dinner's...
david_shephard This is David. Leave a message.
dr_jack_shephard David, i-it's me again. Listen...uh....if I did something to upset you I am really, really sorry. I'm gonna drive over to your mother's house, I know that she's out of town, so if you are there, just...just don't go anywhere, okay? What...whatever I did, I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard David?
ANSWERING#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode05 MACHINE MESSAGE "Ahhh yes this message is for David Shepard. Hi David this is Dr. Summerland from the Williams Conservatory, just calling to confirm you slot next Friday the 24th at 7 pm. We look forward to seeing you, and good luck."
ANSWERING#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode05 MACHINE MESSAGE Hey David, it's dad. I'm uh..., I'm in Sydney, Australia. Something...something happened...and I... I just needed to hear your voice. Ummm...I guess I'll try again later. I love you.
hugo_reyes This is cool, dude. Very old school.
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes You know, you and me trekking through the jungle, on our way to do something that we don't quite understand. Good times. You mind if I ask you something?
dr_jack_shephard Sure.
hugo_reyes Why'd you come back, you know, to the island?
dr_jack_shephard Why'd you come back?
hugo_reyes Back in L.A., Jacob hopped into the back of my cab, and told me I was supposed to, so I came.
hugo_reyes What? If you have a good reason for coming back, let's hear it man.
dr_jack_shephard I came back here because I was broken. And I was stupid enough to think this place could fix me.
hugo_reyes Dude, I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard How much further we got, Hurley?
hugo_reyes It's not far. It's not far at all.
hugo_reyes It's right there. It's a lighthouse.
dr_jack_shephard I don't understand. How is it that we've never seen it before?
hugo_reyes Guess we weren't lookin for it.
claire_littleton Tell me where my son is.
justin I don't know where your son is.
claire_littleton Stop covering for them. They're not going to help you anymore. All you gotta do is just tell me the truth.
justin I am telling you the truth. We don't have your kid. We never had your kid.
claire_littleton Stop lying to me! Your people took me to the temple and tortured me.
justin No, we captured you because you were out here in the jungle picking our people off.
jinsoo_kwon Claire wait! Hold on.
claire_littleton Hold on? Jin, they stuck me with needles. They branded me. And if I hadn't been able to escape from the temple, they would have killed me.
justin No, you're not remembering things right.
claire_littleton Look shut up, okay? You've got one more chance. One more chance - just tell me where my son is.
justin I don't know where your damn kid is.
jinsoo_kwon Kate! Kate took him! Kate took Aaron. She took him with her when she left the island.
claire_littleton What do you mean she took him?
jinsoo_kwon He's been with her, with Kate, for the past three years. Aaron is three.
justin He's telling you the truth. We had nothing to do with this. So if you just untie me, I'll leave, and I promise I will never tell anyone I ever even saw you. Just untie me.
hugo_reyes Pretty cool, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Jacob's in here?
hugo_reyes I guess so. First we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on.
dr_jack_shephard Does it say anything on your arm about the door being jammed?
hugo_reyes No.
dr_jack_shephard After you.
UNKNOWN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode05 BOY Is that your son?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
UNKNOWN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode05 BOY He's really good.
dogen Itsumo doori yareba daijoubu da Yoshi itte koi!
dogen They are too young to have this kind of pressure, aren't they?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. Yes they are.
dogen It's hard to watch and be unable to help. Your son has a gift. How long has he been playing?
dr_jack_shephard I... I don't know.
hugo_reyes Whoa! Dude this is cool. Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff. I guess they used the mirror because electricity hadn't been invented yet.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Jacob?
hugo_reyes Ahh he's not here yet. Lets get started. Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.
dr_jack_shephard Stop!
dr_jack_shephard Did you see that?
hugo_reyes Did I see what?
dr_jack_shephard The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.
hugo_reyes It's just ocean dude.
dr_jack_shephard These are our names. Turn it to 23 degrees.
hugo_reyes I...I don't think Jacob wants
hugo_reyes What. What is that?
dr_jack_shephard It's my house. It's the house I grew up in.
hugo_reyes Oh. That's weird.
dr_jack_shephard Haven't lived in that house since I was a kid. He's been watching. The whole time. All of us. He's been watching us. Hurley, where's Jacob?
hugo_reyes I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard You said that he'd be here.
hugo_reyes Well I was just...kind of...assuming.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, I wanna know why he was watching me. I wanna know. So you're going to ask him right now.
hugo_reyes It doesn't work like that, I told you. He just kind of shows up whenever he feels like it.
dr_jack_shephard Why was he watching?
hugo_reyes I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard Why is my name written down on this thing?
hugo_reyes He didn't tell me.
dr_jack_shephard What does he want from me?
hugo_reyes Aren't we supposed--
dr_jack_shephard What does he want from me?!
hugo_reyes I don't know, Jack!
dr_jack_shephard You were great in there.
david_shephard You...saw me? I missed a couple of notes.
dr_jack_shephard Sounded perfect from where I was standing. David you scared the hell outta me.
david_shephard You were at grandmas. I thought I could get back to your place before I got home.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't know you were still playing.
david_shephard I made mom promise not to tell you.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
david_shephard It was always such a big deal to you. You used to sit and watch me practice. You were so...into it. I didn't tell you I was coming here because...I didn't want you to see me fail.
dr_jack_shephard You know when I was your age, my father didn't want to see me fail either. He used to say to me that...he said that I didn't have what it takes. I spent my whole life carrying that around with me. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I will always love you, no matter what you do. In my eyes you can never fail. I just wanna be a part of your life.
david_shephard Okay.
dr_jack_shephard I've got some pizza back at the house. You hungry?
david_shephard Sure.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Let's go home.
jacob How'd it go?
hugo_reyes Where were you, man?
jacob Doesn't matter, he wouldn't have been able to see me anyway.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well if you'd told me that and I'd like, explained everything, then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces. Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way.
jacob You've got ink on your forehead.
hugo_reyes I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say? Jack broke your lighthouse, dude. Mission un-accomplished. Whoever you said we need to help get to the island is totally screwed.
jacob Well I'm sure they'll find some other way.
hugo_reyes So...everything you wanted me to do didn't get done, and you don't even care?
hugo_reyes Wait a minute. Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror? Why?
jacob It was the only way for him to understand how important he is.
hugo_reyes That was your plan? I think it backfired, man.
jacob Jack is here because he has to do something. He can't be told what that is. He's got to find it himself. Sometimes you can just...hop in the back of someone's cab and tell them what they're supposed to do. Other times...you have to let them look out at the ocean for a while.
hugo_reyes Well next time how about you tell me everything up front. I'm not big on secret plans OK.
jacob I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo. I had to get you and Jack as far away from that Temple as I possibly could.
hugo_reyes What? Why?
jacob Because someone's coming there. Someone bad.
hugo_reyes Dude, we gotta warn them!
jacob You can't warn them Hugo. I'm sorry, it's too late.
claire_littleton Look, if I didn't kill him, he would've killed me. Glad you didn't untie him.
jinsoo_kwon Claire, please, whatever you're thinking.
claire_littleton Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?
jinsoo_kwon I was lying.
claire_littleton Why?
jinsoo_kwon Because I wanted to save his life. But you were right. The others have your baby. Aaron is at the temple, I know because I saw him there. But you'll need me to get to him.
claire_littleton How do we get in?
jinsoo_kwon There's a secret way. No-one will see us.
claire_littleton Thank you Jin, thank you. And I'm so glad to know you were lying because...if what you said was the truth, if Kate was raising Aaron...I'd kill her.
john_locke Am I interrupting?
jinsoo_kwon John?
claire_littleton That's not John. This is my friend.
