mr_eko Here, eat. It's okay, Yemi.
nigerian_nun Eko?!
nigerian_nun Alright Eko. Go.
nigerian_nun Did you hear me? Go! Confess that you have stolen.
mr_eko Yemi was hungry.
nigerian_nun That is not an excuse. You have sinned, Eko! Hunger does not matter. Now go. Ask God for forgiveness.
nigerian_nun Confess!
sayid_jarrah How long has he been like this?
hugo_reyes Couple of days now.
sayid_jarrah Eko. Can you hear me? What happened to him?
charlie_pace Before or after we saved him from the polar bear cave?
hugo_reyes Come on. Locke will want to know you guys are back. Stay alive dude, ok?
yemi What are you doing here?
mr_eko I have come to give my confession.
yemi Hello, Eko.
mr_eko Hello, brother.
mr_eko I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country.
yemi You mean drugs.
mr_eko You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
yemi My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
yemi No! Stop! No more! No more!
mr_eko Yemi! Yemi! No! No! No! Help me get to the plane.
lead_soldier Father? Are you okay, Father?
yemi Eko! Eko, wake up!
yemi It is time to confess. To be judged, Brother. I will be waiting. You know where to find me.
hugo_reyes You guys smell smoke?
sayid_jarrah Get him clear!
charlie_pace Eko! Help!
charlie_pace Pick him up!
hugo_reyes Eko. Eko, come on!
charlie_pace Pick him up!
hugo_reyes We gotta get you outta here!
charlie_pace Cover him up. Cover him with this!
hugo_reyes Come on, Eko.
charlie_pace Careful...careful!
hugo_reyes It's hot, Eko! Careful!
charlie_pace Lay him down... lay him down.
charlie_pace You're ok. You're alright.
mr_eko My... brother. My... brother.
charlie_pace You're alright. It's ok.
mr_eko My... brother. Yemi.
charlie_pace It's alright. I'll be back.
mr_eko Yemi...
john_locke Charlie! Is everyone ok?
charlie_pace Yeah! We're good.
john_locke Where's Eko?
charlie_pace Hurley and I pulled him out... over...
charlie_pace He was right there! Eko? Eko?
ben_linus Good evening, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Good evening, Ben.
ben_linus I was hoping you might join me for a walk. What?
dr_jack_shephard Well, you say that like...you're not going to just throw a bag over my head and drag me out of here if I say no.
ben_linus Then don't say no. Why don't you put this on. I'll wait outside.
dr_jack_shephard Does it hurt?
ben_linus Sorry?
dr_jack_shephard Your neck, does it hurt? Any numbness in your fingers and toes, like pins and needles when your foot falls asleep, but permanent?
ben_linus Why are you asking me these questions, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Because, Ben, you have a tumor on your spine. An aggressive tumor... that... is going to kill you. I don't know when those x-rays were taken that I saw, but unless they were very recent... you're not going to be taking walks much longer.
ben_linus I have no idea what you're talking about.
dr_jack_shephard Ok. My mistake then. I'm ready whenever you are.
ben_linus Stay here.
ben_linus As we prepare to send Colleen on her way, I'd like to take a moment...
dr_juliet_burke I hate funerals. He let you out?
dr_jack_shephard Gave me a new shirt, too.
dr_juliet_burke Bye, Jack.
ben_linus Why did you show him my x-rays?
dr_juliet_burke I didn't tell him they were yours. But I guess you did.
john_locke I think I know how to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer.
sayid_jarrah Can I ask why he's being included in the conversation?
desmond_hume Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?
john_locke Tell him what you told me.
desmond_hume The computer in the hatch wasn't only for pushing the button. I'm pretty sure... it could be used to communicate with other stations.
sayid_jarrah This is fascinating. But you just told me the hatch exploded.
john_locke One of them did.
sayid_jarrah You want to try and communicate with the others.
john_locke Yup.
hugo_reyes No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere. Eko's gone.
charlie_pace There's no trail.
hugo_reyes Not that we, like, know what a trail looks like.
john_locke When you pulled him out of the tent, did he say anything?
charlie_pace Nothing coherent. Just mumbling 'My brother, my brother.'
john_locke Sayid, pack your gear. We're going to that computer.
charlie_pace Wait! What about Eko?
john_locke We'll catch up to him. We're all going to the same place.
lead_soldier You're home, father.
amina Father? Oh! I was looking for Father Yemi.
mr_eko Father Yemi is...is gone. He was called away quite suddenly. An emergency at the refugee camp... down South.
amina I am Amina. I work at the clinic. This is my son Daniel. He is the altar boy here. Are you taking his place?
mr_eko Yes.
amina Will Father Yemi still go to London?
mr_eko London?
amina He was leaving at the end of the week. He was going to continue his studies.
mr_eko I will take his place there, too.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode05 No! Don't! Please! No!
daniel Shhhhhh. Confess.
john_locke Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station. There's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody want to come along?
hugo_reyes What do you mean 'Anybody want to come along?'
john_locke I mean, if you'd like to join us, it's a free island.
hugo_reyes Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone. Or he'd take Sayid or Kate.
john_locke Yeah, well. I'm not Jack. The more the merrier.
nikki_fernandez I'll go.
john_locke Great!
paulo What?
john_locke Anybody else want to come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes. Bring water.
paulo You're not serious.
nikki_fernandez What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
desmond_hume Would you mind if I asked you a question, Brother?
john_locke Shoot.
desmond_hume Are we off to poke at a computer, or are we going after your man Eko?
john_locke Two birds, one stone. Eko's heading for the plane that crashed on top of the entrance to the Pearl station.
desmond_hume Well, that's quite a coincidence.
john_locke Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
daniel You're not supposed to do that. That's holy water.
mr_eko I'm washing away my sins.
daniel Father Yemi wouldn't...
mr_eko I am not Father Yemi.
mr_eko Wait there!
emeka ... where is Father Yemi?
mr_eko Who wants to know?
emeka Perhaps you did not hear me. I said, where is Father Yemi?
amina The shipment is late! I just got off the telephone. He assured me it would arrive on Friday.
mr_eko What shipment?
emeka You should explain our arrangement to the new priest.
amina We receive shipments of vaccines from the Red Cross. We are allowed to keep 20 percent. The rest we give to Emeka and his men.
emeka In exchange for protection. So you see Father, everybody is happy! Huh? Hmmm? Everybody's happy. Everybody benefits! So, I hope you will continue to honor our arrangement.
mr_eko I am not afraid of you.
emeka I'll be back for the vaccine on Friday, Father. You don't want more lives on your conscience.
john_locke Hello, Eko!
dr_juliet_burke You want to guess what's for lunch?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not... I'm not big on mysteries.
dr_juliet_burke Of course you're not.
dr_jack_shephard You people have cheeseburgers?
dr_juliet_burke You have no idea what I went through to make this for you. I killed the cow, processed the meat, baked the bun. And the fries... try rendering animal fat.
dr_jack_shephard No ketchup?
ben_linus I'd like to talk to him.
dr_juliet_burke Ok. So talk to him.
ben_linus Alone. Please.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine with her being here.
ben_linus And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack, but it's private. Doctor-patient confidentiality.
dr_juliet_burke Sure. Of course.
dr_jack_shephard Mind if I eat?
ben_linus We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Break me?
ben_linus Wear you down till you were convinced we weren't your enemies. Get you to trust us. And then of course we'd lead you to believe that you were choosing to do... whatever we asked you to do. All of this of course assumed that you would get... invested.
dr_jack_shephard Invested in what?
ben_linus Has it not occurred to you that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?
dr_jack_shephard Why are you telling me this?
ben_linus I'm telling you this, Jack, because my wonderful plan... got shot to sunshine when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying.
dr_jack_shephard All of this... you brought me here to operate on you. You... you want me to save your life?
ben_linus No, I want you to want to save my life. But we're beyond that now, so... all I can ask is that you think about it. Do you believe in God, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Do you?
ben_linus Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. And if that's not proof of God, I don't know what is.
john_locke Hey! Are you sure you are all right? We can stop for a bit and catch our breath.
mr_eko I'm fine.
john_locke You're heading for the plane wreckage aren't you? Charlie heard you call out for your brother before you left the camp. Is that what you're doing out here, looking for Yemi?
mr_eko Do not speak my brother's name again!
john_locke What are you so afraid of, Eko?
amina You need to come back in two days. Father! What can I do for you?
mr_eko Yes, is that... the vaccine that you spoke of? How often do the shipments come?
amina Every six months, if we are lucky. What makes you so interested in our shipments of vaccine, Father?
mr_eko You agreed to give most of it to the militia?
amina The vaccines fetch a high price in the black markets. Whatever you are thinking, do not cross these men. Before father Yemi, we got nothing. We owe whatever vaccines we have to his work. You remind me of him, you know. You're a good man, too.
WARLORD#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode05 I hear you have some vaccine to sell.
mr_eko I do. But it has to be done by Sunday. I'm leaving the country.
WARLORD#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode05 No problem.
john_locke The hatch is over here by the plane. Why don't you take everybody down.
sayid_jarrah And you?
john_locke I'll be there in a minute.
paulo What's Eko looking for?
nikki_fernandez His brother's body is in that plane.
john_locke So, what exactly did you see back there? I saw it once, you know.
mr_eko And what did you see?
john_locke I saw a very bright light. It was beautiful.
mr_eko That is not what I saw.
mr_eko My brother's gone!
john_locke You set the plane on fire. Yemi's body could have burned... or, not to mention animals... or...
john_locke So, you don't want to come down there with us?
mr_eko No. I will wait here.
john_locke Well...oh, I forgot, I found this when I was looking for you.
emeka Hello, Father. I hear you have a shipment of vaccine for sale. If you thought you could do this without me knowing... you don't know who I am.
emeka You know, you're lucky Father, I'm a superstitious man. I don't relish taking the life of a holy man. That is why today, I'm only going to cut off your hands.
emeka No! Don't! Please! No! No!
mr_eko You do not know who I am!
Narration#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode05 I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the Orientation Film for Station 5 of the DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or, The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
john_locke Well?
sayid_jarrah The wiring is only one-way. It's a closed system. A dead end.
nikki_fernandez Hey, guys? What are these other TVs for?
john_locke Sorry?
nikki_fernandez All these TVs... this guy says that there's 6 stations. Uh, here, check it out.
Narration#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode05 ...is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
nikki_fernandez Projects. More than one. So, maybe some of these TVs are connected to the other hatches.
john_locke Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.
sayid_jarrah Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds. See if we can get another picture.
paulo Ahhhh. The uh, toilet still works.
sayid_jarrah Anything yet?
john_locke Nothing.
sayid_jarrah What about now?
sayid_jarrah John?
john_locke Yeah, we got something.
nikki_fernandez Wow! What is it?
john_locke That's a good question.
paulo Hmmm. Those are computers! Great! That's what you're looking for. Now we can get out of here.
john_locke I guess he'll be expecting us.
dr_jack_shephard You don't trust me anymore?
dr_juliet_burke I trust you just fine. Just thought I'd put a movie in.
dr_jack_shephard You know what, I'm going to pass on the movie.
dr_juliet_burke You'll like this one Jack. It's "To Kill A Mockingbird". It's a classic.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet, I don't want to watch a movie right now!
dr_juliet_burke I'll turn the sound down then.
dr_juliet_burke I felt like I should apologize. Say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you here. And for everything that's been done to you. And your friends. You have to know we were desperate. It was only so that we could save his life.
dr_juliet_burke Ben. He's a great man.
dr_juliet_burke I know you find that hard to believe but... he is.
dr_juliet_burke You probably feel like you don't have a choice. But you do, Jack. Free will is all we've really got, right?
dr_juliet_burke Anyway, just wanted to put in my two cents.
dr_juliet_burke I told you before, you can trust me. I want you to trust me, now, when I tell you that doing the surgery is absolutely the right thing for you to do.
dr_juliet_burke It's the right thing because he deserves to live.
dr_jack_shephard Turn the movie off.
dr_juliet_burke Jack...
dr_jack_shephard Turn it off! Now.
dr_juliet_burke Alright. It's off.
dr_juliet_burke Think about what I said. Please.
daniel Where are you going?
mr_eko London.
daniel Are you a bad man? My mom says you're a bad man.
mr_eko Only God knows.
mr_eko I see you have your vaccine.
amina Do you expect me to be grateful? I know what you are planning to do.
mr_eko Those men! I helped--
amina Those men will be replaced by other men.
mr_eko What are they doing? What is the meaning of this?
amina They are boarding up the church. We can no longer use it.
mr_eko This is Yemi's church. You have no right to do this!
amina It is no longer sacred! And one day you'll be judged for what you did! If I were you, I would start making my peace now. I would go to London and begin to repent. Because you owe God for every life you've taken. And you truly believe this is Yemi's? You owe him one church.
mr_eko Yemi!
mr_eko Wait! Yemi!
mr_eko Yemi! You say you want to hear my confession! Why? Why now, eh? Show yourself! Where are you! Where!
yemi Are you ready, Eko?
mr_eko Yes. I am ready, Yemi.
mr_eko I ask for no forgiveness, Father. For I have not sinned. I have only done what I needed to do to survive.
mr_eko A small boy once asked me if I was a bad man. If I could answer him now, I would tell him that... when I was a young boy, I killed a man to save my brother's life. I am not sorry for this. I am proud of this.
mr_eko I did not ask for the life that I was given. But it was given, nonetheless. And with it... I did my best.
yemi You speak to me as if I were your brother.
mr_eko Who are you?
mr_eko Who are you!? Who are you!?
mr_eko Who are you?
mr_eko The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. The Lord is my shepherd...
mr_eko Oh!
john_locke Eko!
john_locke Ohh...Eko. It's ok. It's ok.
sayid_jarrah What did he say, John?
john_locke He said, 'We're next.'
