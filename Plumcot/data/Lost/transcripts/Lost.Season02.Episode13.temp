LOCKE Is that all of them?
JACK All 6 of them. And there's uh, 1 box of ammo.
LOCKE At least we don't have to worry about running out any time soon. Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place. Oh, I had to take them from Charlie -- his heroin stash. I figure it might have therapeutic value, if it ever came to that.
JACK You're just going to leave it all in the statues?
LOCKE You want to break 7 Virgin Maries, be my guest. I'm superstitious.
JACK John, the combination.
LOCKE I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room, rather than this being an issue of trust.
JACK Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.
LOCKE Alright, but I think we should agree, Jack, that if either of us need to open this door, we consult each other first.
JACK Absolutely.
LOCKE Right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down?
JACK Nope, I got it.
LOCKE Alright. And, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too.
JACK Why would I need to do that?
SAWYER Well, well, now look who had to relocate to the suburbs. Ain't that just like a woman? She keeps the house and you get the cheap-ass apartment. Man, I thought these people hated me, but I've got to hand it to you -- stealing a baby, trying to drown it -- now, that's a new low. You even made Locke take a swing at you. Hell, that's like getting Gandhi to beat his kids.
CHARLIE Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now?
SAWYER What?
SAWYER What the hell do you think you're doing?
JACK You stole these from the Hatch.
SAWYER You stole them from me.
JACK What?
SAWYER They were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine.
JACK These belong to all of us, Sawyer -- to the group. You don't have a stash anymore.
SAWYER Seriously, Doc, you don't want to do this. Just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened.
JACK Are you threatening me?
SAWYER Last chance, Doc. 
SAWYER What do you want -- right now?
CASSIDY Just you.
SAWYER Oh, damn it!
CASSIDY What is it?
SAWYER I'm going to be late to that meeting I told you about.
CASSIDY Meeting, huh? You got another date you could just say so.
SAWYER I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time -- but I appreciate the permission. Back in flash, gorgeous. You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
CASSIDY Are you serious?
SAWYER What?
CASSIDY You're not serious. You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash? And you go to pick it up and the lock just happens to break?
SAWYER Give me that.
CASSIDY It's not even real. Newspaper? Are you trying to con me? What, I ask you what all the money's for and you do some song and dance about an investment or something? And then I say, "Oh, hey, I've got some money."
SAWYER Look, you got me. Good for you. No harm, no foul.
CASSIDY You should have done your homework. I didn't take anything from him in the divorce. I'm not even worth your trouble.
SAWYER Well, shame on me.
CASSIDY I want you to show me what you do. Show me what you do -- what you really do.
SAWYER And what do I do?
CASSIDY Show me how to con people, Sawyer.
KATE I like what you've done with the place.
SAWYER Maid's day off. You want to move?
KATE I heard Jack took your pain killers.
SAWYER Well, I guess me and the Doc are on the outs. One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.
KATE Maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the Hatch. I know you're hard up for new reading material.
SAWYER Well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair , I lost my damn glasses on the raft. You want to read it to me? What, you got an appointment or something?
KATE Alright, "10 Ways To Tell If He's A Sensitive Man".
SAWYER This ought to be good.
LOCKE Morning.
KATE Hey, John.
SAWYER Now, there's a sensitive man.
KATE Claire asked him to sleep down here.
SAWYER Come on. Locke's got himself needs -- just like anyone else.
KATE Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.
SAWYER I guess that's why El Jacko and Ana-Lulu didn't ask me to join their revolution. What, you didn't hear about their little army? I guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the Doc.
HURLEY Hey, man. You gonna put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up? Lime in the coconut? The song?
SAYID What do you want, Hurley?
HURLEY So, I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the Norwegian plane.
SAYID Nigerian.
HURLEY Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this. 
SAYID That is a short wave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie.
HURLEY Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire with a red wire -- make it stronger.
SAYID We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver and all we got was the French woman's message on a loop. Why would I bother?
HURLEY Come on, man, I mean, it's worth...
SAYID It's worth nothing. It's a waste of time.
HURLEY Just trying to cheer you up, dude.
SAYID I don't need cheering up.
HURLEY Okay, man. Sorry. No problem.
ANA Hey. Hey.
JACK Hey.
ANA You get the combo? Nice. I didn't think it would be that easy convincing your pal to give it up. That's the nice thing about you people -- you're not scared enough.
JACK Not scared enough?
ANA Same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army. Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.
JACK Trust me, Ana. No one thinks we're safe.
ANA So, Jack, what's the combo? I was just kidding.
SUN Oh, Vincent! What are you doing out here? 거기 조심해, 밟으면 안 돼.
SAWYER Oh, man. It's really coming down. Get under here, Freckles.
KATE I like the rain.
SAWYER Yeah, me too, if I'm under here.
KATE That's Sun.
SAWYER Is she alright?
KATE She's breathing.
SAWYER Go get Jack. -- Go get Jack!
KATE Okay.
LOCKE What happened?
SAWYER Where's Jack?
JACK Was she conscious at all? Did she say anything?
SAWYER Nothing. Not a word.
JIN 자기야, 자기야!
JACK She's okay. She's okay.
JIN 어떻게 된거야?
JACK She's going to be alright. You need to let me take care of her, alright, please. Where'd you find her?
SAWYER I heard her scream. Found her out in the jungle about a half a click from here.
KATE She was out cold and her hands were tied.
JACK What do you mean, her hands were tied?
ANA They're back.
LOCKE They told us they would leave us alone.
JACK Well, John, it looks like they broke their promise.
LOCKE We don't even know what happened.
JACK Do we need to know?
ANA Where'd you find her?
KATE Just outside her garden.
ANA We should take a look around -- with guns.
LOCKE No.
JACK No?
LOCKE If we arm up we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.
JACK Okay, we'll wait for Sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened. Then we're going to do something about it.
LOCKE Sounds like a plan.
KATE They usually don't leave any trail.
SAWYER It's worth a look. Let me ask you something. This whole scenario make sense to you?
KATE What do you mean?
SAWYER Think about it. First off, how'd she get away? The woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds soaking wet.
KATE She was fighting for her life. People are capable of almost anything...
SAWYER You couldn't get away. You versus Sun -- hot oil death match -- my money's on you, Sheena.
KATE Thanks for your vote of confidence.
KATE It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.
SAWYER No it's not. This one's black, different weave. It's all in the details -- and they're wrong.
KATE Well, if it wasn't them, then who? What are you saying, one of us did it? Who the hell would want to go after Sun?
SAWYER Not much upside to scaring the crap out of 46 people -- unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.
CASSIDY Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer. A 5 year old could tell that.
SAWYER They ain't going to be looking at the necklaces. They're going to be looking at the price tags. It's all in the details, Dimples.
CASSIDY What if we get caught?
SAWYER We ain't going to get caught. Anybody goes to the cops, the only thing they're going to remember is a guy that looks like he's been in a bar fight. -- You're scared, huh?
CASSIDY A little bit.
SAWYER Well, here's the good news, baby -- everybody's scared. The thing they're scared of most is missing an opportunity.
SAWYER Hey, you guys want to buy some necklaces?
GUY Where'd you get them?
SAWYER Where do you think? You want to buy them, or not? Oh, forget it. 
CASSIDY Hey, how much?
SAWYER 100 a piece.
CASSIDY For any of them?
SAWYER Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.
CASSIDY I'll take the 1200 dollar one and the 1300 dollar one. Thanks. 
GUY Hey, wait.
GUY #2 Hang on, man. I'll buy some of those.
GUY Yeah, me too. It's Gina's birthday next week.
GUY #2 They love their jewelry.
JACK The pulse is good. Strong. We just need to watch her. She's going to be okay, man.
KATE That bump on her head -- do you think she fell or that someone hit her?
JACK I don't know.
KATE Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia? It's just -- the Others, I -- I was out there with you. I heard that man say that if we stayed away they'd leave us alone. And we've left them alone. So why would they attack us a few days later?
JACK Well, if it wasn't them then who was it?
KATE Like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia?
ANA I got a couple more people interested in joining up.
JACK Yeah, who?
ANA Uh, the big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott.
JACK You mean Steve, Scott's dead.
ANA Scott, Steve -- the point is, after what happened people are finally willing to do something.
JACK Where were you this morning?
ANA Lots of places.
JACK During the rain storm.
ANA You think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed? Now, where would you get an idea like that?
CLAIRE Jack! Jack, Sun's awake.
JACK Hey. How's your head? Any pain, dizziness?
SUN Just a little bit.
JACK Do you remember anything?
SUN I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up. Then it started raining and there was a bag over my head and I was being dragged.
JACK How many were there?
SUN I don't... I didn't see anything.
JIN 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 나한테도 말해봐!
SUN 당신한테 말한 것 그대로에요. I kicked and I fought, and I just ran as fast as I could and then I fell...
JIN 이렇게 당하고만 있을 수는 없어! 저 놈들을 잡아야 돼!
SUN 여보, 제발...
JIN 아니야! Gun. Gun! -- Gun.
KATE Hey, what's going on?
SAWYER It looks like the good folks of Island Town are about to form a posse -- get themselves armed up. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack didn't find that horse of yours and start leading the charge in a big white hat.
KATE The guns. This is all her play to get her hands on the guns. Locke -- you need to go and tell him that they're coming.
SAWYER I need to tell him? 
KATE Sawyer, please.
CASSIDY So what's next?
SAWYER Next?
CASSIDY Next play.
SAWYER I'll show you the pigeon drop.
CASSIDY We already did that - twice. And the Tulsa Bag Scam and the Lookie-Loo. I want to do a big one.
SAWYER You want to do a big what?
CASSIDY A big con.
SAWYER It's called a long con.
CASSIDY Okay, a long con. How does it work?
SAWYER It works by getting someone to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea, it's your idea. But none of that matters because the one thing you need for the long con we ain't got -- money.
CASSIDY I have money.
SAWYER Sorry, Cassidy, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.
CASSIDY Remember what I told you, that I didn't get anything from the divorce?
SAWYER Mmmhmm.
CASSIDY I kind of lied.
SAWYER Kind of lied how much?
CASSIDY 600 grand.
SAWYER Well, hell baby, with that kind of money let's go find an island somewhere and sit on a beach drinking Mojitos 'til we go toes up.
CASSIDY Sawyer, for the first time in my life I'm actually happy. And it's not really about the action and the money. It's about doing this with you. Come on, one long con? And then the mojitos.
SAWYER I'll think about it.
CASSIDY Why don't you think about it in here?
SAWYER Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doing. What are you doing?
LOCKE I'm alphabetizing.
SAWYER Oh, sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle and you figure it's a good time to start the damn Dewey decimal system. Good thinking.
LOCKE How can I help you, James?
SAWYER Well, actually, John, I'm here to help you -- give you the heads-up.
LOCKE Heads-up?
SAWYER Seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs. You should know he's not alone. The whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose. I'm guessing everybody's going to want to play Cowboys and Indians. And once those guns are out and about -- something tells me they ain't never going back in.
LOCKE Why are you telling me this?
SAWYER Because it'll piss off Jack. If I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto.
LOCKE But that won't work. The door will just slow him down. If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in. Will you help me?
SAWYER Help you what?
LOCKE Move the guns.
SAWYER Move them where? Fine, you don't want to trust me -- lots of luck.
LOCKE But I can't leave the Hatch unmanned.
SAWYER Sure, you move the guns and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.
LOCKE How long 'til they get here?
SAWYER Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours.
DIANE Steak sandwich, two beers.
SAWYER Thank you.
GORDY Aw, shucks, you got a beer for me?
SAWYER You want one? Ask the lady.
GORDY Well, hell, I do want one. And could I get a plate of chicken salad -- white meat only -- and please, god, no celery, okay, sweetheart?
DIANE That's how we make it here, darlin'.
GORDY So, tell me you got her.
SAWYER Yeah, I got her.
GORDY All 600 grand?
SAWYER All 6.
GORDY You fell for her. Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding me.
SAWYER Look, it's got nothing to...
GORDY Hey, I found that bitch.
SAWYER Her name is Cassidy.
GORDY Well, I waited 6 months while you and Cassidy played house. Now, if you think--
SAWYER I ain't doing it.
GORDY You know what's making you stupid right now? It's your damn hormones. You think you're in love, but you're not. You know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James. You're a con man, just like me. And it's not what you do, it's what you are. Do I make myself clear?
SAWYER I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.
GORDY No, you're going to do it -- because that girl, she doesn't know you one bit. But when she finds out who you are -- who you really are -- she's going to hate your guts.
SAWYER Yeah, well -- enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.
GORDY Wait a minute, you don't walk away now. You owe me. You don't want to pay me? I'll put one in your ear, James. You and your little friend, Cassidy.
JACK What are you doing here?
SAWYER One second, I'm like this close to the high score on Donkey Kong.
JIN 뭘 기다려? 총을 빨리 꺼내자.
SAWYER Now, what can I do you for?
JACK Where is Locke?
SAWYER I don't know. I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.
SAWYER Uh-oh, it looks like we've got ourselves a break-in. Who's going to call the cops?
JACK Where are they?
SAWYER Don't look at me. I was just pushing a button. Oh yeah, I believe these are yours.
JIN No. 소이어는 신경 쓰지 마, 응? 그만 해.
JACK John, where are they? You moved the guns. Where are they? We had an agreement!
LOCKE An agreement that you were about to violate, Jack. Yes, I moved the guns.
JACK Where? Where? Where, John?
LOCKE Oh, are you going to start handing them out? How many? Who gets them? How much time before there's an accident? Another accident. I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot and now he's... He could be dead for all I know -- and that, that was my fault. I take responsibility for that and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns, too.
JACK I want 2 guns, John!
LOCKE I'm sorry, Jack! That's the way it's going to be, Jack!
JACK 2 guns! Now tell me where they are, right now!
JACK You gave him the guns?
LOCKE No. I hid them.
SAWYER That's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are. You were so busy worrying about each other you never even saw me coming, did you? How about you listen up because I'm only going to say this once. You took my stuff. While I was off trying to get us help -- get us rescued -- you found my stash and you took it, divvied it up -- my shaving cream, my batteries, even my beer. And then something else happened, you decided these two boys here were going to tell you what to do and when to do it. Well, I'm done taking orders. And I don't want my stuff back. The shaving cream don't matter. Batteries don't matter. The only thing that matters now are guns. And if you want one you're going to have to come to me to get it! Oh, you want to torture me, don't you? Show everybody how civilized you are. Go ahead, but I'll die before I give them back. And then you'll really be screwed, won't you? New sheriff in town, boys! You all best get used to it.
CASSIDY What's going on? Where were you? Sawyer what happened?
SAWYER You see that black car?
CASSIDY Who is it?
SAWYER His name's Gordy, my partner.
CASSIDY What partner?
SAWYER If I don't walk out the front door with that briefcase in the next 2 minutes we're both dead.
CASSIDY What happened? That's the guy from the Mercado deal? What...?
SAWYER There is no Mercado deal! I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get go. Cass -- you were the long con.
CASSIDY Son of a bitch. Go to hell. Go to hell.
SAWYER You've got to understand! Everything that's happened between us in the past 6 months, all of it -- that was real.
CASSIDY Get out! You get out!
SAWYER Listen. You can hate me all you want later, but right now you've got to listen to me. He's going to kill us -- because I told him I wasn't going to take your money.
CASSIDY Oh my god.
SAWYER Look, this is him. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I want you to go out back through Evan's yard. There's a rental car parked out front. Go to Sioux City. I want you to check in at the Sage Flower Motel, off highway 29. Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.. It'll all be over.
CASSIDY Let me just pack a few things.
SAWYER There's no time. Remember when you said I was all you ever wanted? Well, now you know better. I love you.
CASSIDY I love you, too.
SAWYER Go. Go.
KATE How'd you do it?
SAWYER How'd I do what?
KATE Locke said that he left you in the Hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn. So, how'd you get them?
SAWYER A magician never tells his secrets.
KATE You played us. You played me. All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia -- you knew I'd go to Jack. And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.
SAWYER Now, how in the world would I know all that?
KATE Did you have anything to do with Sun?
SAWYER What kind of person do you think I am?
KATE What kind of a person do I think you are? I don't think this has anything to do with guns, or with getting your stash back! I think you want people to hate you!
SAWYER Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.
KATE Why do you have to do this?
SAWYER You run. I con. Tiger don't change their stripes.
HURLEY Hey, check this out. I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book.
SAYID I want to show you something.
HURLEY Cool, you fixed it!
SAYID We'll see. Hold on to this. Don't expect anything. The chances of getting a signal are slim at best.
HURLEY Static's good, right?
SAYID No, reception is good.
HURLEY Wait, what's that?!
SAYID It's Rousseau's signal.
HURLEY Oh, crap.
SAYID But this radio has a wider bandwidth.
HURLEY Hold it, stop! Do you hear that?!
RADIO ANNOUNCER That was the old classic "Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'" by Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, featuring Cootie Williams on the trumpet. Up next on WXR, the Glenn Miller Orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade".
HURLEY Whoa, you hear how clear that is? It's got to be close, right?
SAYID Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere. They can travel thousands of miles. It could be coming from anywhere.
HURLEY Or, anytime. -- Just kidding, dude.
SAWYER He never saw you, huh?
CHARLIE No, he was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.
SAWYER Figured you'd want your friends back.
CHARLIE If I wanted them I would have taken them before I told you where they were. That's not why I did it.
SAWYER It's not, huh?
CHARLIE I wanted him to look like a fool -- to feel like a fool.
SAWYER Well, well, it looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.
CHARLIE Sun can never find out what I did to her. Never.
SAWYER Don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now.
CHARLIE Sawyer, this idea -- all of this -- what we did -- what made you... How does someone think of something like that?
SAWYER Now go.
SAWYER 1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, 3-Mississippi, 4-Mississippi, 5-Mississippi.
SAWYER I'm not a good person, Charlie. Never did a good thing in my life.
