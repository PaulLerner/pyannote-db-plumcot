miles_straume I think you can let go of that now.
james_ford No. No! No!
james_ford No! No! No!
dr_juliet_burke James, don't.
james_ford Come on! Help me!
dr_juliet_burke James... Stop.
dr_juliet_burke We can't help him. Wherever John went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
miles_straume Yeah, I'd say way before.
jinsoo_kwon What makes you—
john_locke James! Can you hear me?! Can anyone hear me?!
john_locke Aah!
dr_juliet_burke What the hell was that?
miles_straume That one was different. It was... that was more like an earthquake.
james_ford Locke!
dr_juliet_burke James, wait!
james_ford Great.
dr_juliet_burke My headache is gone.
miles_straume Yeah, mine is, too.
miles_straume And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
dr_juliet_burke I think it's over. I think John did it.
jinsoo_kwon Now what?
james_ford Now we wait for him to come back.
dr_juliet_burke For how long?
james_ford As long as it takes.
phil Are you kidding me?
phil I'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
jerry Don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her.
rosie Yeah.
phil She shouldn't be here, Jerry. We're on the clock, man.
jerry Ah, mellow out, Phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
phil That's not the point. If LaFleur finds out what you're doing here—
jerry LaFleur's not gonna find out anything.
phil —it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
rosie Guys? What...
jerry Relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
rosie Guys. What...
phil Is that a Hostile?
jerry I don't know.
rosie Is that... Horace?
jerry Oh, he's got dynamite.
rosie Aah!
phil Get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
jerry Come on, Rosie.
phil I told you not to bring her here. I told you!
jerry You gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go! Okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
phil We gotta get LaFleur.
jerry 300 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake LaFleur up?
phil No, of course not, but—
jerry No, no, no. Maybe—maybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
phil And maybe Horace blows himself up, and LaFleur kills us for not waking him.
phil We gotta go—now!
phil Do you wanna knock?
jerry You knock.
phil Fine.
LAFLEUR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 What?
phil Mr. LaFleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
LAFLEUR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 What kind of situation?
jerry Uh, it's, uh, Horace.
phil He's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
james_ford Son of a bitch.
miles_straume Relax! I'm comin'!
miles_straume Hey, boss.
james_ford Evening, Enos. You got your zapper with ya?
miles_straume Yep. You wanna tell me why I need it?
james_ford 'Cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
miles_straume Why's he doin' that?
james_ford 'Cause he's loaded.
miles_straume Since when does Horace drink?
james_ford He doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
miles_straume Oh, man.
james_ford All right. You put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
miles_straume Why don't you put out the fire, pack up, and—and I'll take him home?
james_ford You wanna tell Amy where we found him?
james_ford Help me get him up.
amy_goodspeed Oh, my God. Is he okay?
james_ford You tell me.
amy_goodspeed Bring him inside.
amy_goodspeed The couch. The couch is fine.
amy_goodspeed Oh. Where'd you find him?
james_ford By the Flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
amy_goodspeed We had a fight.
james_ford Must've been a doozy.
amy_goodspeed Please, Jim. It's personal.
james_ford Personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
amy_goodspeed It was about Paul.
james_ford Go on.
amy_goodspeed Oh.
james_ford What's the matter? You okay?
amy_goodspeed Ohhh! The baby—it's coming. Ohhh!!
james_ford Oh, hell.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
james_ford Where's Red?
dr_juliet_burke I don't know.
dr_daniel_faraday No. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
dr_juliet_burke Daniel? You okay?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
dr_juliet_burke Daniel, where's Charlotte?
dr_daniel_faraday She's not here. She... She's gone.
dr_juliet_burke Where?
dr_daniel_faraday She's... dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... and she was... she was just gone.
dr_daniel_faraday Her... body just... disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
dr_juliet_burke I'm so sorry.
james_ford Hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
dr_daniel_faraday Of course it's over. Wherever we are now... whenever we are now... we're here for good. I won't do it.
dr_juliet_burke Okay. Okay.
dr_daniel_faraday I won't. I'm not gonna—I'm—I'm...
dr_juliet_burke Okay.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not gonna—I w—I won't.
dr_juliet_burke Okay. Okay.
dr_daniel_faraday Tell...
james_ford Okay. Swell. Until Dan checks back in, I say we head back to the beach. When Locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
miles_straume The beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
dr_juliet_burke Sawyer's right, Miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
miles_straume Or maybe when we get there, you'll—you'll wanna go back to the Orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
james_ford Hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
miles_straume Who put him in charge?
james_ford Thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
dr_juliet_burke You should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
james_ford Well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
dr_juliet_burke Any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if I hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
james_ford Well, I'm open to suggestions.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Oh, no! No, Paul! Oh, God! Oh, God!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 No, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 No, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just having—Paul. Paul, please. Oh, my God! No! No, Paul, please. Please.
dr_juliet_burke Who do you think they are?
miles_straume Who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are. Hey. Dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
dr_daniel_faraday Doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
james_ford Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato. I'm going over there. You still got my back?
dr_juliet_burke Absolutely.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Paul, Paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, Paul!
BEARD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 On your feet!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 No, I can't! I can't!
BEARD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Come on, get up! Now!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Aah!
BEARD#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Shut up!
james_ford All right, drop the gun!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Oh, God.
james_ford It's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
amy_goodspeed Who are you?
dr_juliet_burke Her friend's wearing a DHARMA jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
james_ford The guys with the bags—Others?
dr_juliet_burke Beats me.
james_ford What, y'all don't know each other?
dr_juliet_burke Before my time.
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer. Walkie.
dr_juliet_burke We need to go.
james_ford I'm on it.
james_ford Listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
amy_goodspeed Who are you people?
james_ford Our ship wrecked here on the way to Tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of this—those two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
amy_goodspeed We have to bury them.
james_ford Bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
amy_goodspeed We—we—we have to. The truce. Oh, God. We have to bury them. And—and we have... we have... and we have to bring it—him back home. We have to bring Paul back with us. Please. Please? Please.
jinsoo_kwon I'll carry him.
james_ford All right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
amy_goodspeed He wasn't... my friend. He was my husband.
james_ford All right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
miles_straume You really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
james_ford I'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
dr_juliet_burke Daniel! Stop!
dr_juliet_burke Turn it off.
amy_goodspeed Turn what off?
JULET#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
amy_goodspeed Where did you say your ship was going?
james_ford Listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
amy_goodspeed Okay. Okay, fine.
james_ford "Sonic fence"? Didn't I say let me do the talking?
dr_juliet_burke One more step, Dan would've fried his brain.
james_ford His brain's already fried.
amy_goodspeed Okay, it's off.
james_ford You first.
amy_goodspeed See? It's fine.
james_ford All right, let's go.
james_ford And going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'—
amy_goodspeed It hurts! Oh!
doctor You're gonna be okay, Amy. Just try and relax.
doctor Where's Horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
james_ford He's unavailable.
doctor Look, Amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
james_ford What the hell does that mean?
doctor It's upside down. She needs a Caesarean.
james_ford Well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
doctor I'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on Tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
james_ford Can you deliver this baby or not?
doctor I don't know.
james_ford Hey, man. Where is she?
dr_juliet_burke What's up?
james_ford Amy's having her baby.
dr_juliet_burke What?
james_ford Mm. Did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a Caesarean.
dr_juliet_burke We had an agreement.
james_ford Screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
dr_juliet_burke Don't you understand that every time I try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
james_ford Well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
dr_juliet_burke The baby's breech?
doctor Yes, but—
dr_juliet_burke Did you try an external cephalic version?
doctor What? No. I—
dr_juliet_burke It's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutures—half-round if you've got them—and an epidural anesthetic.
doctor You're gonna need? Where is Horace?
james_ford I'm speaking for Horace now, and I say she's delivering this baby.
doctor I don't think it's a good idea.
amy_goodspeed I want her. I want her to do it. Huh? Mm.
james_ford You heard the lady.
james_ford Listen... you're gonna do great. I know you are.
dr_juliet_burke Okay.
amy_goodspeed Oh!
dr_juliet_burke Okay. Shh.
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
jinsoo_kwon Is everything okay?
james_ford Amy went into labor.
jinsoo_kwon I know. Is she okay?
james_ford I don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
jinsoo_kwon Juliet?
james_ford Yeah, I pulled her out of retirement.
james_ford Any luck?
jinsoo_kwon We finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
james_ford Well, 1-3-4 then.
jinsoo_kwon How long do we look, James?
james_ford As long as it takes.
james_ford What happened?
dr_juliet_burke It's a boy.
james_ford He's okay? She's okay?
dr_juliet_burke Everyone's okay.
james_ford Mm.
horace_goodspeed How's your head?
james_ford It hurts.
james_ford Where are my people?
horace_goodspeed They're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and I really appreciate what you did.
james_ford Well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
horace_goodspeed Look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
james_ford My name's James LaFleur. You can call me Jim.
horace_goodspeed How'd you get to the island, Jim?
james_ford If my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
horace_goodspeed They told me I need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
james_ford We got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
horace_goodspeed What kind of ship?
james_ford A salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of Portsmouth, England, called the Black Rock. You heard of her?
horace_goodspeed Can't say that I have.
horace_goodspeed So... once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
james_ford Some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
horace_goodspeed Hmm. Well... I tell you what, Jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
james_ford Send 'em where?
horace_goodspeed There's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
james_ford Hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
horace_goodspeed Nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the DHARMA Initiative. And look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, Jim, but you are not DHARMA material.
miles_straume We're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
dr_juliet_burke Sawyer's gonna be fine.
miles_straume What are you lookin' at?
dr_juliet_burke I lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
miles_straume You were in the DHARMA Initiative?
dr_juliet_burke No. The Others took over these Barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
miles_straume Well... welcome home.
jinsoo_kwon Daniel... no more flash?
dr_daniel_faraday No. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
RED-HEADED#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 GIRL Hey, Mum. Where's Dad?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Come on, Luv.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte.
horace_goodspeed Hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, Mr. LaFleur here can fill you in on the situation.
miles_straume "Mr. LaFleur"?
james_ford It's Creole. I improvised.
dr_juliet_burke What happened in there?
james_ford Well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to Tahiti.
miles_straume How's that bad news?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 You guys, come on! Now!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Let's go! Get out of here!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode08 Come on! Come on!
phil Come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
phil Heather, keep an eye on them.
james_ford Uh-oh.
horace_goodspeed Hello, Mr. Alpert.
richard_alpert Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.
horace_goodspeed I wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
richard_alpert That fence may keep other things out, but not us.
richard_alpert The only thing that does keep us out, Horace, is our truce... which you've now broken.
horace_goodspeed I don't know what you're talking about.
richard_alpert Where are my two men?
miles_straume You know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
james_ford Hold your horses, Banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
horace_goodspeed Okay, LaFleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
james_ford Well, that depends on how hard he looks.
horace_goodspeed Call the Arrow. Tell them we're at Condition One. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
phil Yes, sir.
james_ford Let me talk to him.
horace_goodspeed Excuse me?
james_ford Your buddy out there with the eyeliner—let me talk to him.
horace_goodspeed We had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
james_ford I understand I'm the one that killed his men, and I'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why I did it.
horace_goodspeed I can't let you do that.
james_ford Well, it's a good thing I ain't asking your permission.
dr_juliet_burke James, are you sure you know what you're doing?
james_ford Not yet. But I'll figure somethin' out.
james_ford Hello, Richard.
richard_alpert I'm sorry. Do we know each other?
james_ford I'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and I defended myself.
richard_alpert Is that so?
james_ford That's so.
richard_alpert Your people know that you're telling me this?
james_ford They ain't my people, Hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
richard_alpert If you're not a member of the DHARMA Initiative, then what are you?
james_ford Did you bury the bomb?
richard_alpert Excuse me?
james_ford The hydrogen bomb with "Jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
richard_alpert How...
james_ford Yeah, I know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... he went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is John Locke, and I'm waitin' for him to come back. So... you still think I'm a member of the damn DHARMA Initiative?
richard_alpert No. I guess I don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
richard_alpert Now what are we gonna do about that?
horace_goodspeed How are you doing, Amy?
amy_goodspeed Is he gone?
amy_goodspeed Alpert?
horace_goodspeed No, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
amy_goodspeed You told him? Why?
horace_goodspeed We had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take Paul's body back with him.
amy_goodspeed Mm. No. Oh!
horace_goodspeed Hey.
amy_goodspeed Oh.
horace_goodspeed Hey, Ames. Listen, w—
horace_goodspeed We've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
amy_goodspeed They can take him. He would want to keep us safe. Can I have a minute, please?
james_ford I'm sorry.
james_ford You need some help?
horace_goodspeed Hmm? Oh. Nah, I've got it. Thanks.
horace_goodspeed Hey, Jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morning—it returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
james_ford Thanks.
james_ford I bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, Locke'll be back by then.
dr_juliet_burke And then what?
james_ford What do you mean, "Then what"?
dr_juliet_burke Locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now I've got my chance.
dr_juliet_burke I'm going to leave.
james_ford You do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... it don't exist yet.
dr_juliet_burke It's not a reason not to go.
james_ford Well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and Mr. "I Speak to Dead People"?
james_ford And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
dr_juliet_burke You'll be fine.
james_ford Maybe... but who's gonna get my back?
james_ford Come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all I'm asking. Two weeks.
dr_juliet_burke All right. Two weeks.
james_ford Mmm, somethin' smells good.
dr_juliet_burke Hey there.
dr_juliet_burke Is that for me?
james_ford You were amazing today.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you for believing in me.
james_ford Ah.
james_ford Mm.
dr_juliet_burke I love you.
james_ford Mmm. I love you, too.
james_ford Mmm.
dr_juliet_burke Mmm.
james_ford Wake up, boss.
horace_goodspeed Ah. Oh!
james_ford How's your head?
horace_goodspeed It hurts.
james_ford I got good news and bad news. What you want first?
horace_goodspeed Good news.
james_ford You're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
horace_goodspeed Oh, gosh. Amy... she had the baby?
james_ford It's a boy.
horace_goodspeed A boy?
james_ford Mm.
horace_goodspeed Ohh.
james_ford Now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
horace_goodspeed I was, uh... I was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so I went to grab a pair of Amy's, and... I found this...
horace_goodspeed ...in the back of her drawer. It was Paul's.
james_ford You got in a fight over a necklace?
horace_goodspeed I know. But... It's only been three years, Jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
james_ford I had a thing for a girl once. And I had a shot at her, but I didn't take it. For a little while, I'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now I can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her face—it's... she's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
james_ford Oh.
james_ford What? ... Wait. What? ... H—no. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the North Valley.
dr_juliet_burke Who was it?
dr_juliet_burke James, what's going on?
james_ford It was Jin.
dr_juliet_burke Is everything okay?
james_ford Yeah. I just... I gotta go.
