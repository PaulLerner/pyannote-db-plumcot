kate_austen "We have to go back"? "We have to go back"?
dr_jack_shephard Now hold on—
kate_austen Who do you think you are?! You call me over and over again for two days straight, stoned on your pills! And then you show up here with an obituary for Jeremy Bentham. When he came to me and I heard what he had to say, I knew he was crazy. But you... You believed him.
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
kate_austen Him, of all people.
dr_jack_shephard Yes, Kate, I did, because he said that that was the only way that I could keep you safe—you and Aaron.
kate_austen Don't you say his name. I still have to explain to him why you are not there to read to him, so don't you say his name!
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry.
kate_austen I've spent the last three years trying to forget all the horrible things that happened on the day that we left. How dare you ask me to go back?
james_ford You sure we're going the right way?
dr_jack_shephard Lapidus said they were headed northeast.
james_ford You might wanna slow down a little, 'cause you look like you're about to keel over, Doc.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine.
james_ford Of course you're fine. You're always fine—
james_ford Is this it?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
james_ford So what's the plan, Sundance?
dr_jack_shephard The plan is we wait til—
james_ford Hugo?
hugo_reyes Sawyer!
james_ford You all right?
hugo_reyes Dude, you came back. How'd you know where I was?
dr_jack_shephard It's good to see you, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Yeah. Yeah, man. You, too.
dr_jack_shephard So where the hell is he?
dr_jack_shephard Locke!
john_locke Hello, Jack.
desmond_hume There's enough C-4 here to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier. When I was in the army... I did six months' explosive ordnance disposal, which, as the saying goes, is just enough time to learn how to blow yourself up.
michael_dawson Is it on a timer? And why hasn't it gone off yet?
desmond_hume This is a—a radio receiver. It's... it's like a walkie-talkie. You send it a signal, and, uh... it—it triggers a bomb remotely.
jinsoo_kwon So can we... turn off?
desmond_hume This is a... this is a trip wire. Move it, and... boom. This is dummy wiring. If you cut the wrong one... boom. This is multiple firing systems. You disable one, and the next one... boom. Uh, this... battery's the power source. If you disconnect it—
jinsoo_kwon Boom.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing in here?
john_locke There's a—a DHARMA station below us, and, um, I'm looking for a way to get in.
dr_jack_shephard Get in and do what?
john_locke Hugo, James, would you mind if I spoke to Jack alone?
dr_jack_shephard Don't bother. We just came back for Hurley. Let's go.
john_locke Jack, you need to hear what I have to say—
dr_jack_shephard What I need to do is to walk back to the chopper, get on it, and get the rest of our people off this island.
hugo_reyes Uh, dude, probably not the best idea right now. Those Rambo guys are taking Ben to that helicopter. He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago.
dr_jack_shephard Now why the hell would he do that?
martin_keamy So tell me something, Ben. What is it that makes you so important, hmm? I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Mr. Widmore would pay me so much money just to come out here and capture you and bring you back alive.
ben_linus Charles Widmore tell you to kill my daughter?
martin_keamy Hey! How'd he get the toolbox?
frank_lapidus Damn.
martin_keamy Who gave you the toolbox, Frank?
frank_lapidus Who, uh...
martin_keamy Hey!
martin_keamy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're good right there.
martin_keamy Who are you?
kate_austen I'm Kate. I'm one of the passengers of Flight 815.
martin_keamy Why are you running?
kate_austen I'm being chased... by his people.
martin_keamy Kocol... Lacour... Redfern on flank.
martin_keamy Come here.
kate_austen Whoa. Hey.
martin_keamy Get on your knees.
kate_austen Uhh!
martin_keamy Hands above your heads, both of you.
martin_keamy Now! Spray it!
kate_austen Ben, stay close. Run! Run.
frank_lapidus Grenade!
ben_linus Uhh!
kate_austen Get up. Come on. Get up.
martin_keamy Uhh! Aah!
martin_keamy Aah!
martin_keamy Aah!
ben_linus Thank you for coming, Richard.
richard_alpert My pleasure.
ben_linus Could you cut me free, Kate?
ben_linus What was the arrangement?
richard_alpert They, uh, help us free you, and we let 'em off the island.
ben_linus Fair enough. The helicopter is yours. You and Sayid have a safe journey back.
kate_austen So we can go? Off the island? That's it?
ben_linus That's it.
mrs_dawson Thank you, miss.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Mm-hmm.
mrs_dawson Are you Hurley?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
mrs_dawson Are you dangerous?
hugo_reyes I'm sorry. Do I know you?
mrs_dawson No, you don't know me... but you know my grandson.
mrs_dawson Now we've traveled all the way across country just so he could see you. I need to know if you're gonna do anything crazy.
hugo_reyes I won't do anything crazy.
hugo_reyes Hey, Walt.
walt_lloyd Hey, Hurley.
hugo_reyes You're getting big, Dude.
walt_lloyd You know, when you came back, I was waiting for one of you to come see me, but... nobody did.
hugo_reyes I'm sorry.
walt_lloyd Do you know who did come see me? Jeremy Bentham. I don't understand why you're all lying.
hugo_reyes We're lying... because it's the only way to protect everyone that didn't come back.
walt_lloyd Like my dad?
hugo_reyes Like your dad, yeah.
james_ford What the hell they talkin' about in there, anyway?
hugo_reyes I don't know. Leader stuff?
james_ford Where'd you get that?
hugo_reyes Came from a box Ben dug up out of the ground. They're good.
hugo_reyes Thanks for coming back for me.
james_ford Ah, you got it.
hugo_reyes Claire and the baby okay?
dr_jack_shephard What did you wanna talk to me about, John?
john_locke I want you to reconsider leaving the island, Jack. I would like you to stay.
dr_jack_shephard You'd like me to stay?
john_locke Yeah, that's right.
dr_jack_shephard You threw a knife into the back of an unarmed woman. You led half of our people across the island and got most of them killed.
john_locke Well, Jack, you put a gun to my head and you pulled the trigger. I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'll tell you what. You stay here in your little greenhouse, but the rest of us are going home.
john_locke But you're not supposed to go home.
dr_jack_shephard And what am I supposed to do? Oh, I think I remember. What was it that you said on the way out to the hatch—that crashing here was our destiny?
john_locke You know, Jack. You know that you're here for a reason. You know it. And if you leave this place, that knowledge is gonna eat you alive from the inside out...until you decide to come back.
dr_jack_shephard Good-bye, John.
john_locke You're gonna have to lie.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
john_locke If you have to go, then you have to lie about everything...everything that happened since we got to the island it's the only way to protect it.
dr_jack_shephard It's an island, John. No one needs to protect it.
john_locke It's not an island. It's a place where miracles happen. And—and—if you—if you don't believe that, Jack, if you can't believe that, just wait till you see what I'm about to do.
dr_jack_shephard There's no such thing as miracles.
john_locke Well... we'll just have to see which one of us is right.
ben_linus Am I interrupting?
ben_linus Nice to see you, too, Jack.
ben_linus Couldn't find the Anthuriums, could you?
john_locke I don't know what they look like.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?
ben_linus Didn't you tell him?
john_locke I tried.
ben_linus Sayid and Kate are waiting for you at the helicopter. I understand that your people from the beach are being brought to the freighter even as we speak.
dr_jack_shephard What?
ben_linus I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, Jack, but you, Hugo, James, you need to get moving. If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour. Good-bye, Jack. Let's go.
john_locke Lie to them, Jack. If you do it half as well as you lie to yourself, they'll believe you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Yeah, I'll be right here.
sunhwa_kwon Michael? What's going on down there?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Ready to go?
michael_dawson Did you tell anybody?
sunhwa_kwon No, Michael. I—I didn't. Can you... t-turn it off?
michael_dawson It isn't even on yet. But, yeah, if what's in this tank does what it's supposed to do, we're gonna be okay.
michael_dawson Look, I'll send Jin upstairs. There's no need for him to be down there with me when he can be up here with you.
sunhwa_kwon I'm pregnant.
michael_dawson Congratulations, Sun.
desmond_hume You're gonna what?
michael_dawson Freeze it. This is liquid nitrogen. We use it in the refrigeration hold. The bomb needs a charge from the battery to detonate, right? And the battery runs on a—a chemical reaction. I spray the battery. I can keep it cold. No reaction.
desmond_hume And what's the catch?
michael_dawson The catch is we only have one canister. We use it up, we're right back where we started.
desmond_hume Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red?
michael_dawson If we see that light turn red and the battery's not already cold, that is the last thing we will ever see. Either way, at least we'll have a warning, buy ourselves some time.
desmond_hume All right, um, freeze the battery. Jin, help me trace back these wires, make a list of where each of them goes to.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Boat!
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Down there.
dr_juliet_burke Did you get them all to the boat?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, everybody's safe.
dr_juliet_burke Are they coming closer?
dr_daniel_faraday They fixed the engine, and they're gonna get as close to the island as they can without hitting the reef, so the next trip shouldn't take so long. I'm just gonna get some water, and I'll come back in a minute.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, I'll get the next group ready to go.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Dan!
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah?
dr_juliet_burke Thanks for helping us.
dr_daniel_faraday Absolutely.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, let's go!
rose_nadler Uh, who told you you could eat those peanuts?
miles_straume May—may I eat these peanuts?
rose_nadler I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles...
miles_straume Somethin' wrong with your neck?
dr_daniel_faraday Follow me, please.
dr_charlotte_lewis Dan, you're back. Hey. What's wrong?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the next group of people to the freighter. You need to make sure that you're with me on that raft, all right?
miles_straume Well, don't worry about me, 'cause I'm gonna stay.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, no, uh, uh, I don't think I'm getting across the... direness of the circumstance.
miles_straume Oh, no, you're very dire, but I'm still gonna stay.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, ten minutes.
dr_charlotte_lewis Yep.
miles_straume I'm surprised you wanna leave.
dr_charlotte_lewis Sorry?
miles_straume It's just weird. You know, after all that time you spent trying to get back here.
dr_charlotte_lewis What do you mean, get back here?
miles_straume ...What do I mean?
john_locke How deep is the station?
ben_linus Deep.
john_locke Is this the magic box?
ben_linus No, John, it's not.
john_locke What is all this stuff for?
ben_linus Same things that all the DHARMA stations are for —silly experiments.
john_locke What kind of experiments?
ben_linus You know what, John?
ben_linus Why don't you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions...
ben_linus ...and I'll take care of some business.
SCIENTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 Hello. I'm Dr. Edgar Halliwax... and this is the orientation film for station six of the DHARMA Initiative. As you've no doubt surmised, station six, or "The Orchid," is not... a botanical research unit. The unique properties... of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect, allowing the DHARMA initiative to conduct unique experiments in both space and time. This... is "the vault", constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe... to be negatively charged "exotic matter". Great care must be taken to avoid leaving inorganic materials... inside the chamber. The electromagnetic energy within the island can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Now, for your own safety and the safety of those around you, metallic objects must never... be placed within the vault.
SCIENTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 In our first demonstration, we will attempt to shift the test subject 100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space. For the briefest... of moments, the animal will seem to disappear, but in reality...
john_locke Hey. Uh... was he talking about what I think he was talking about?
ben_linus If you mean time-travelling bunnies, then yes.
john_locke You do know that he said specifically not to put anything metal in here.
john_locke You expecting someone?
ben_linus May I have my weapon back?
hugo_reyes Sayid! Kate! Good to see you, Dude.
james_ford He say somethin' to tick you off, Freckles?
kate_austen Didn't kill that one.
james_ford Well, which one did you kill?
dr_jack_shephard Where's the baby?
kate_austen He's with Sun, and they should be at the freighter by now. Are you okay?
dr_jack_shephard I am now.
james_ford Hey Kenny Rogers. What you trying to do there, pick a lock?
frank_lapidus You got a better idea?
james_ford Hacksaw.
frank_lapidus For the handcuffs, right?
frank_lapidus Okay, take it easy.
james_ford Ay. All right, all right.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, how'd you get back?
sayid_jarrah I took the Zodiac from the freighter.
dr_jack_shephard Is it safe? A body from the boat washed up on the beach.
sayid_jarrah It's safe now.
frank_lapidus All right! Let's get the hell outta here!
james_ford Let's go, Freckles. I've seen enough of this rock.
hugo_reyes After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back and look for Claire, right?
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely.
frank_lapidus Hands and feet inside the vehicle! Let's go for a ride!
SCIENTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 ...properties of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect...
martin_keamy I know you're down here, Ben. Crouching in the dark, just waiting to take a shot at me.
SCIENTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 This... is "the vault"...
martin_keamy Well, you better aim for the head, Ben! Not like your boyfriend who shot me in the back like a coward!
SCIENTIST#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 ...to avoid leaving inorganic materials inside...
martin_keamy This body armor's, um, been known to take a bullet or two in its time.
martin_keamy But before you take your shot, Ben, let me tell you about this.
martin_keamy See that? I took out a bit of a—a life insurance policy, Ben. It's a heart rate monitor, and it's connected to a radio transmitter. W—we call it a "dead man's trigger", Ben. If my heart stops beating... it sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of C-4 that I've got hardwired out there on the freighter that'd kill a lot of innocent people, Ben. If you think I'm bluffing, need I remind you of, uh... how your daughter looked as she bled out? Face-down in the grass?
martin_keamy Who the hell are you?
john_locke My name is John Locke, and I have no... conflict with you. And neither do the people on that boat. So... why don't you put your knife down? We can talk about this.
martin_keamy Well, John Locke... I've never really been one for talk.
ben_linus You killed my daughter.
martin_keamy Aah!
ben_linus You killed my daughter!
john_locke Ben! Ben! Ben, stop! No, no! Stop!
john_locke Ben, what did you do?
john_locke You just killed everybody on that boat.
ben_linus So?
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, Charlotte! Listen, uh, I wanted to say before you get on the boat, please—
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm gonna stay, Daniel... for now, anyway.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte... there is no "for now". If you don't come with me, "for now" could be forever.
dr_charlotte_lewis Nothing's forever.
dr_daniel_faraday Why?
dr_charlotte_lewis Would it make any sense if I told you I was still looking for where I was born?
dr_daniel_faraday N—no.
dr_charlotte_lewis Good-bye, Daniel.
dr_daniel_faraday Let me guess. You're not coming.
dr_juliet_burke I promised I wouldn't leave until I got everyone here safely off this island. Relax. I'll still be here when you get back.
dr_daniel_faraday Right, right... when I get back. Okay. Everybody ready? Let's get started. Off we go.
desmond_hume I think I might have something. Okay, so... so if... if I cut this wire, it... it should disconnect the firing mechanisms.
jinsoo_kwon Stop! 여기 연결돼 있어. No good.
desmond_hume Damn it! I—I just don't know enough. H—how do we even know your little freezing trick's doing anything?
michael_dawson We'll know if that light turns red and we're still here.
desmond_hume How much stuff do we have left?
michael_dawson We got a quarter tank.
desmond_hume What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb?
michael_dawson We better get everybody the hell off this boat.
sayid_jarrah What's the matter?
frank_lapidus We're losing fuel.
dr_jack_shephard What?!
frank_lapidus We're losing fuel! Look outside, tell me if you can see anything!
sayid_jarrah We have a fuel leak! A bullet must have pierced the tank!
frank_lapidus We gotta find a place to set her down!
dr_jack_shephard No, don't land!
frank_lapidus What?!
dr_jack_shephard There's no fuel on the island! We've gotta get to the boat, or this chopper's useless!
frank_lapidus I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat!
dr_jack_shephard Well, then keep looking!
frank_lapidus We gotta get every ounce of extra weight off this chopper now! Anything that's not bolted down, toss it out!
dr_jack_shephard Now what? Is that enough? Can we make it?!
frank_lapidus I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we were a few hundred pounds lighter! Well, if we don't make it, we're still close enough to ditch it on the beach.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Do not go back to the island!
frank_lapidus We might not have a choice, Doc.
james_ford Hey...
kate_austen Why are you telling me this?
james_ford Just do it, Freckles.
kate_austen Sawyer!
sayid_jarrah Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you. But do you have the time, please?
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode13 IN CAR Yeah. It's eight fif—
