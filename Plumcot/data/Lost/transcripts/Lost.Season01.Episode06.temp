KATE It's not like I'm asking a personal question.
JACK It is a personal question.
KATE You don't have to get all quiet on me. I just want to know.
JACK Well, you're not going to know.
KATE What's the big deal?
JACK It's not a big deal. It's just something I did. I had my reasons. And I don't want to put it out there.
KATE It's just that you and your tattoos don't add up. Are you one of those hard-core spinal surgeons?
JACK That's me. Hard-core.
CHARLIE If you guys are finished verbally copulating we should get a move on. There's a whole beach of people waiting for us to get some drinking water for them. And the great white hunter's getting restless.
JACK Okay, let's do this.
KATE Hey, Charlie. Ask Jack about his tattoos.
CHARLIE Oh, you guys have an inside joke. How absolutely wonderful for you both.
JIN Miss. 샴페인 드실래요? 
JIN Miss. 뭘 두고 가셨네요. 
SUN 그래요? 뭐죠? 우리 아빠는? 
JIN 손님 때문에 바빠. 
SUN 빨리 이 곳을 떠나고 싶어. 응? 
JIN 어디로? 
SUN 미국. 
JIN 날 좀 봐. 자기야, 사랑해. 널 데리고 도망 가고 싶지는 않아. 
SUN 우리한테는 오직 이 방법 밖에 없어. 
JIN 너희 아버지가 절대 허락 안 할거야. 
SUN 아빠가 허락할 문제가 아니야. 우리가 결정할 문제지. 
JIN 내가 아버지한테 말씀 드릴게. 그리고 설득해 볼게. 
SUN 자기야. 우리 아빠를 몰라서 하는 얘기야. 지금. 
JIN 날 믿어봐. 
SUN 너무 예쁘다. 
JIN 이게 다이아몬드였다면 좋았을 텐데. 언젠가는 그렇게 될 거야. 
SUN 여보, 왜 그래요? 
MICHAEL Hey, hey, what the...
WALT Stop! Hey stop!
Sun 여보, 그만 해. 그만 해! 뭐하는 거야? 여보! 여보! 여보!
WALT Get off of him, please! Stop! Stop!
WALT Do something! He's going to kill him! Stop him, please!
SAYID The handcuffs from the Sky Marshal! Now!
SAYID What happened?
JACK Water's this way.
KATE How'd you find this place?
JACK Luck.
JACK This is it.
LOCKE It's amazing.
CHARLIE Absolutely. It's totally you. Hey guys, shouldn't someone look through this stuff? Could be something useful in here.
LOCKE He's got a point.
CHARLIE I do?
JACK Yeah. Bring me your bottles, and keep an eye out for any medical supplies, drugs in particular.
CHARLIE Drugs, right.
LOCKE Don't move.
CHARLIE Look, I was just going to take...
LOCKE Do not move.
JACK What's going on?
LOCKE He's standing on a beehive.
CHARLIE What's a beehive doing there? Beehives are supposed to be in trees.
JACK What now?
LOCKE If he moves, he'll split the hive.
CHARLIE I don't like bees, okay. I have an irrational fear of bees. I think I'm allergic to bees.
LOCKE Please be quiet. We need to get something to seal the hive.
KATE To cover it?
LOCKE Hurry.
MICHAEL I'm getting tired of saying this. I was just walking the beach with my son, and all of the sudden this dude is all up on me. I didn't do anything.
Jin 시끄러워!
SAYID Surely there must be something you're not telling us.
MICHAEL Surely? Where you from man?
SAYID Tikrit. Iraq.
MICHAEL Okay. I don't know how it is in Iraq, but in the United States of America where I'm from, Korean people don't like black people. Did you know that?
JIN 거짓말 하지 마!
MICHAEL So maybe you ought to talk to him !
Sun  지금 시계 때문에 그래요, 시계.
SAYID The cuffs stay on!
SAWYER A little louder, Omar. Maybe then she'll understand you.
HURLEY Guys, that Chinese dude is going to get pretty crispy out here. How long are you going to keep him tied down like that?
SAYID He tried to kill Michael. We all saw it. The cuffs stay on until we know why.
MICHAEL Come on, man. Let's go.
[Everyone disperses, Sawyer stays looking over at Jin and Sun off camera.
SUN 어떻게 됐어? 
JIN 그게 말이야, 너희 아버님이—허락하셨어. 
SUN 다시는 그런 장난 치지 마! 어떻게 된 거야? 
JIN 내가 아버님을 설득했지. 일 년 경영 수업을 받고, 일 년 공장에서 일 하면, 우리가 원하는 돈이 생길거야. 
SUN 아빠 밑에서 일 할거야? 
JIN 그렇게 하는 게 옳은 거야. 
SUN 하지만 자기야, 그거는...
JIN 아니, 그렇게 해야… 잠깐 뿐이야. 
SUN 어머, 자기야… 이렇게 비싼 걸 어떻게 샀어? 
JIN 이제 이 정도는 할 수 있어. 
JACK Okay. Just keep still man. I'm going to try to cover the hive.
CHARLIE This is the most crap idea ever. It's never going to work.
LOCKE Now, pull yourself together, son.
CHARLIE It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together, would it?
KATE Who is he. How'd he get here?
JACK I can't exactly perform an autopsy but there doesn't seem to be any major trauma to the bones. There's another one over here. Someone laid them to rest here.
KATE Who?
JACK I don't know.
KATE Where would they come from?
JACK Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Where'd that come from?
KATE Any idea how long they've been here?
JACK Long. It takes 40 or 50 years for clothing to degrade like this.
KATE What is it?
LOCKE Hello? Anybody there? Everyone alright?
JACK A few stings aside.
CHARLIE You two run away fantastically. Glad my diversion spared you. I was only stung several hundred times. Oh, and uh, someone left this .
KATE It was, um, it was full of bees.
CHARLIE I'd have thought C's, actually.
CHARLIE Sorry.
CHARLIE Bloody Hell! Are these the people who were here before us?
LOCKE What are you talking about?
CHARLIE Uh, just, you know, the, the, there could have been people here before us, right?
LOCKE Clearly. But, who were these men?
JACK Actually, one of them is female.
LOCKE Our very own Adam and Eve.
JIN 뭐 하는 거야? 
SUN 상처가 너무 심해서. .]
JIN 조심해. 
JIN 어때? 좋아? 내가 사무실 가서 보내는 시간이 많으니까, 개라도 키우면 어떨까 해서. 물론, 니가 밥도 주고, 훈련도 시켜야 되는데. 괜찮겠지? 
SUN 당신의 꽃 한 송이가 내 인생의 전부였을 때? 
JIN 아버지네. 
LOCKE I think one of us should stay and help Charlie salvage the wreckage.
KATE You offering?
LOCKE Sure. Give me a chance to get to know him a little better.
KATE We should move out. People are probably getting thirsty. What?
JACK 46 people need to drink a half gallon a day each. Carrying all this water back and forth is going to be real pain in the ass.
KATE You're starting to make me regret volunteering.
JACK These caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial. Adam and Eve, they must have lived here. Their plane crashed, or maybe they were ship-wrecked. They probably found this place and knew they could survive here. Unlimited supply of fresh water, tree canopy keeps the temperature down, shields out the sun, , the openings are narrow, easier for protection against predators. We don't need to bring the water to the people. We need to bring the people to the water. . I think we could live here.
MICHAEL Hey, what are you doing? You say something to my boy?
MICHAEL Yeah, nice talking to you, too. Move it, Walt.
WALT How come he doesn't like us?
MICHAEL What?
WALT You said people like him don't like people like us.
MICHAEL Oh man. You know, uh, look, that's not true, and you know what, I don't think like that anyway. I was, I was angry.
WALT What did you do to him?
MICHAEL What did I do to him? You tell me? I've been with you since we crashed. Have you seen me do anything, to anyone? What kind of man do you think I am, anyway? What did your mother say about me?
WALT She never talked about you.
MICHAEL You don't know anything about me, do you?
WALT You don't know anything about me.
MICHAEL I know a lot about you.
WALT Yeah?
MICHAEL Yeah.
WALT When's my birthday?
MICHAEL August 24th. When's mine? Forget it, come on, man.
SUN 여보, 제발. 내가 가서 설명을 하게 해 줘. 내가 얘기를 잘 하면 당신을 풀어 줄 수도 있잖아. 
JIN 니가 어떻게 설명해? 그냥 여기 있어. 도둑놈한테 일일이 얘기할 필요 없어. 
SUN 여보, 왜 그래? 
SUN 도대체 말 좀 해 봐. 여보, 다쳤어? 무슨 일이야? 무슨 일 했어? 이 피는 누구 피야? 밖에서 무슨 일 있었구나. 밖에서 무슨 일이 있었냐구? What happened to you? What were you doing? Whose blood is this? What were you doing? What happened?]
JIN 일 하고 왔어. 
SUN 일 하고 왔다구? 도대체 아빠 밑에서 무슨 일을 하는 거야? 날 좀 봐. 얘기 좀 해 봐. 날 좀 바라봐. 
JIN 아버님이 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 다 우리를 위해서 하는 거야. 
KATE You checking me out?
JACK What?
KATE No harm in it.
JACK Trust me, if I was checking you out, you'd know it.
KATE Yeah, so then what were you thinking? Right now.
JACK Well, I sure as hell wasn't thinking that.
KATE Don't stop to think, just tell me.
JACK I was thinking that if we were living at the caves we could build a dam around that spring so that everybody could have fresh water and we could get the infirmary off the beach. You think it's a bad idea?
KATE No, no. It makes sense.
JACK But?
KATE No but.
JACK Good, because a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boat is going to show up. They're not thinking about their own safety. We're going to have a lot of convincing to do.
KATE We? You still haven't convinced me yet.
CHARLIE You following me?
LOCKE Yes.
CHARLIE There's no need. I'm just going to the loo.
LOCKE Is there something you want to tell me, Charlie?
CHARLIE I'm going to the loo.
LOCKE It's dangerous out there. Until we get back to the beach, I'm not breaking line of sight with you.
CHARLIE Bugger off.
LOCKE I know who you are. And I know what you're looking for. Drive Shaft -- you played bass.
CHARLIE And guitar -- on a couple of tracks. You really heard of us?
LOCKE Hey, just because I'm over 40 doesn't mean I'm deaf. I have both your albums. Although, I thought that your self-titled debut was a much stronger effort than Oil Change. It's a shame what happened to the band. How long since you played?
CHARLIE My guitar? Uh, 8 days, 11 hours, give or take.
LOCKE You miss it? Well, a lot of wreckage. It might still turn up.
CHARLIE Undamaged? Still playable? I don't think so. I mean, I wish, but there was this bloke at the counter made me check it in.
LOCKE No.
CHARLIE Yeah. There wasn't enough room in the cabin, fascist.
LOCKE You'll see it again.
CHARLIE Oh yeah? What makes you say that?
LOCKE Because I have faith, Charlie.
SAYID It's about time. I am dying of thirst.
SAYID I think I'll let him sit in the sun a while longer. Then I'll take his wife aside, find some way to communicate. I think she knows why he attacked Michael.
JACK You're sure you don't want me to talk to her? Okay. If you've got that under control I'm going to start talking to people about the caves. Might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall, start setting up camp.
SAYID You're serious? Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization?
JACK I'm only talking about moving into the valley.
SAYID Well, what happened to live together, die alone?
JACK Digging in together is the only way we're going to survive.
SAYID Our best hope of survival is in being spotted by a plane or a ship, and for that we need to organize everyone to keep that signal fire burning while others scout the Island for supplies. Digging in anywhere else is suicide!
KATE It is the only source of fresh water we've found, Sayid.
JACK And staying on the beach, in the sun without water? That's not suicide?
SAYID I'm not going to admit defeat.
MICHAEL Now what? I already gave you my statement, sheriff.
SAYID I came to apologize. I shouldn't have been suspicious. You were the victim in the attack this morning.
MICHAEL I appreciate that, but I can tell you didn't come all the way over here just to say you're sorry.
SAYID People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves. I'd like to know where you stand.
MICHAEL Right here. I've got one priority right now and that's to get my kid off this Island. A boat passes, I'm not going to be on the hook for missing it.
SAYID Good.
JACK Slowly, just a little bit at a time, little bit.
JACK Glad you're coming.
HURLEY Hey man, I go where the boar's at. So, what's up with you and Kate? You guys going to move into a cave together, or what?
JACK Sorry, am I in high school?
HURLEY Well, that wasn't a denial.
JACK Just get your stuff together, we've got to get out of here soon.
SAWYER Well, well, well, if ain't the belle of the ball? So what's it like having both the doctor and Captain Falafel fighting over you? Just call 'em how I seem 'em, Freckles. Truth be told, I'm not the only one wondering where you're going to weigh in on this whole moving off the beach thing. Are you going with the pessimists, or staying here and waiting for the rescue boats?
KATE Are you going?
SAWYER Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? We all pack up stakes for the caves and the next day a plane passes by, they're going to go on their merry way and be none the wiser. On the other hand, stay here, get eaten by boars, fall off a rock, not going to be anyone around to answer that 911 call.
KATE Still haven't answered my question.
SAWYER You didn't answer mine. And I asked first.
INTERIOR DECORATOR 당신 남편이 이 곳을 새로 인테리어 하는 데 돈에 대해서는 신경 쓰지 말라 그러시더군요. 당신은 정말 럭키 와이프에요. 
SUN 네. 
JIN 여보, 개 좀 치워라. 
SUN 그럼 우리 먼저 침실로 들어가서 볼까요, 한 번? 
INTERIOR DECORATOR 당신 확실해요? 
SUN 네. 
INTERIOR DECORATOR 레슨 받았어요? 공부는 했구요? 
SUN 네. 
INTERIOR DECORATOR 당신 알죠? 당신 남편이나 당신 아버지가 당신을 찾기 위해서 무슨 일이든 할 수 있다는 거. 당신… 남편이랑 다시 화해하는 건 어때요? 대답해 봐요. 예? 
SUN 제가 떠난 후에 우리 강아지 좀 부탁할게요. 
INTERIOR DECORATOR, 당신들이 여행하는 동안, 공항에서, 시간은 열 한 시 십오 분. 당신은 무슨 수를 써서라도 공항 밖으로 빠져나와야 해요. 나올 땐 아무 것도 가지고 나와선 안 돼요. 당신이 납치 됐다고 생각할 거에요. 첫 일주일 동안은 당신 가족들이 당신이 죽었다고 생각할 때 까지 당신은 조용히, 가만히 있어야 돼요. 그 후엔 당신이 원하는 대로 자유롭게 움직일 수가 있죠. 말해봐요. 언제라 그랬죠? 
SUN 공항에서, 열 한 시 십오 분에. 
INTERIOR DECORATOR 다시 한 번. 
SUN 열 한 시 십오 분. 열 한 시 십오 분. 열 한 시 십오 분. 
MICHAEL Oh great, look who came to chat.
SUN I need to talk to you.
MICHAEL You speak English?
SUN Yes.
MICHAEL What? You speak English? Why didn't you say anything?!
SUN My husband doesn't know.
MICHAEL Why would you learn English and not tell your husband?
SUN He has a bad temper. What my husband did to you today, it was a misunderstanding.
MICHAEL No. I got it. Loud and clear.
SUN It was the watch.
MICHAEL Your husband tried to murder me for a watch?! I found this watch two days ago.
SUN It belongs to my father. Protecting that watch is a question of honor.
MICHAEL He calls trying to kill me in front of my kid, honor?!
SUN You don't know my father. I need your help.
CHARLIE Listen to me, you old git, I'm going in the jungle. A man has a right to some privacy.
LOCKE Just hand it to me. You're going to run out. My guess is sooner rather than later. Painful detox is inevitable. Give it up now at least it will be your choice.
CHARLIE Don't talk to me like you know something about me.
LOCKE I know a lot more about pain than you think. I don't envy what you're facing. But I want to help. . Do you want your guitar?
LOCKE More than your drug?
CHARLIE More than you know.
LOCKE What I know is that this Island might just give you what you're looking for, but you have to give the Island something.
CHARLIE You really think you can find my guitar?
LOCKE Look up, Charlie.
CHARLIE You're not going to ask me to pray or something.
LOCKE I want you to look up.
JACK Hey. It's almost time to go.
KATE I don't want to be Eve.
JACK No one's asking you to.
KATE I just can't -- dig in.
JACK Why not? Someone else can stay here, keep a look out, wait for rescue. Why does it have to be you?
KATE That's not it.
JACK Then what is it? Kate, how did you get to be this way? Just what is it that you did?
KATE You had your chance to know.
JACK If you need me you know where to find me. 
KATE You know where to find me, too.
MICHAEL I know you can't understand a word, and normally I'm not the talking out loud type, but since I have a captive audience, I hope for your sake you pay attention. I'm not exactly having the best month of my life. I barely knew my son, and now, I gotta be his daddy. And then to top if off, I have a deranged Korean guy trying to kill me and for what?! Look, I get it, right . It's the watch. Mine broke and I found this in the wreckage, and I figured, "hey, why let a $20,000 dollar watch go to waste"? Which is ridiculous since time doesn't matter on a damn Island!
MICHAEL Stay away from me. And my kid.
JIN 왜 그래? 
SUN 너무 예뻐서. 
JACK Hello?
LOCKE What's this?
JACK New tenants.
HURLEY Short walk. They lied.
WALT Can I ask you something?
MICHAEL Anything you want, man.
WALT When's your birthday?
