shannon_rutherford You thirsty, dog? Yeah, you're always thirsty, aren't ya? So drink.
sayid_jarrah Come on, gather your things.
shannon_rutherford Where are we going? Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Right over here.
shannon_rutherford Where are we going?
sayid_jarrah What do you think?
shannon_rutherford Does it have an inside?
shannon_rutherford When did you do this?
sayid_jarrah It's all yours.
shannon_rutherford Thank you.
sayid_jarrah You're quite welcome.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry.
shannon_rutherford You need to carry that all the time?
sayid_jarrah I only carry it because I have someone to protect.
cindy_chandler Ana, it's got to be over an hour. Shouldn't we start moving again?
ana_lucia_cortez Let them rest a little while longer.
cindy_chandler Yeah, but what if they come?
james_ford She's lost.
ana_lucia_cortez I'm not lost.
james_ford Then tell me, Ponce de Leon, which way are we supposed to go?
ana_lucia_cortez Alright then, genius, where would you go?
james_ford Hey, I'm with you -- sit tight and wait for Mr. Eko to show up and guide us.
ana_lucia_cortez If your friend didn't run off, Eko would still be here now, wouldn't he? You sure didn't have any problem leaving him behind, though, huh?
james_ford Mike only cares about himself and his kid, and neither's got squat to do with me.
michael_dawson Glad you feel that way.
james_ford Didn't expect to see you again.
jinsoo_kwon 걸을 수 있겠어?
james_ford Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know. My arm's about to fall off.
ana_lucia_cortez You okay?
mr_eko Yes, but we have to go. I saw them.
cindy_chandler What?
bernard_nadler What do you mean, you saw them?
cindy_chandler How many were there?
libby_smith Did you see the kids?
ana_lucia_cortez Libby.
mr_eko We need to go. Now.
ana_lucia_cortez Alright. We're moving out. Now.
shannon_rutherford So, does all this -- the tent, flowers -- mean that we're serious now?
sayid_jarrah Quite definitely not. I do this for all the girls I meet on deserted Islands.
shannon_rutherford Don't go anywhere.
sayid_jarrah Where are you going?
shannon_rutherford To get some water.
sayid_jarrah Let me. I'll be right back.
shannon_rutherford That was quick.
sayid_jarrah There's nothing -- no one there.
shannon_rutherford I am telling you I saw Walt.
sayid_jarrah It was a dream, Shannon.
shannon_rutherford He was here. I saw him. He went into the tent.
sayid_jarrah I was only gone a few moments. You must have fallen asleep.
shannon_rutherford This was not a dream! I saw Walt!
sayid_jarrah Then where is he?
charlie_pace Hey, what's going on?
sayid_jarrah Nothing. It's just a dream; everything's fine.
sayid_jarrah Shannon...
claire_littleton What's wrong?
charlie_pace Shannon had a nightmare. Why's he up?
claire_littleton I woke him.
charlie_pace Woke him?
claire_littleton I heard screams -- I got worried. Why, would you rather I had left him over there alone?
charlie_pace You heard screams so woke up the baby and ran toward them?
claire_littleton Okay, it sounded like she needed help.
charlie_pace Well, he's going to need feeding now. He's going to be up all night and fussy all day.
claire_littleton Sorry.
charlie_pace Alright, well, no harm done -- give him here then. I got him.
sayid_jarrah Wait. Wait! Come back with me; let's talk about this.
shannon_rutherford Do you believe me? No. I know what I saw.
shannon_rutherford Beautiful, Sophie. Okay, can you bring your shoulders down for me a little -- extend up, good -- and finish. Very nice, ladies.
sophie Did my papa see me?
shannon_rutherford I think so. Wonderful, alright, thank you for a great class today, ladies.
nora He wants me to be his au pair, can you believe that?
shannon_rutherford Au pair, my ass.
nora Live in my big house, take care of my kids -- next thing you know it's Oh, I'm so sorry; I did not know you were in the shower. What a perve!
shannon_rutherford Hello.
sabrina_carlyle Shannon, your father's been in an accident. I'm on my way to St. Sebastian's, I'll meet you there.
doctor Mrs. Rutherford?
sabrina_carlyle Yes.
doctor Why don't we talk down here?
sabrina_carlyle Doctor, my husband, Adam, how is he?
doctor Your husband was in a head-on collision with an SUV. He suffered massive internal injuries. He stopped breathing at the site of the accident. I'm afraid we were unable to resuscitate him. I'm so sorry.
sabrina_carlyle May I see him?
doctor Of course. Would your daughter like to come?
sabrina_carlyle Step-daughter. Come on, Shannon.
ana_lucia_cortez How much further to their camp?
mr_eko A day -- maybe more, maybe less.
ana_lucia_cortez Thanks for being so specific.
james_ford Damn it!
james_ford Okay, okay. I'm fine.
libby_smith You want to let me just take a look at your shoulder?
james_ford What, are you a doctor?
libby_smith A clinical psychologist.
james_ford You're a shrink? Well, maybe you ought to talk to my shoulder.
libby_smith How'd you get shot, anyway?
james_ford With a gun.
michael_dawson He got shot when they took my kid.
james_ford It's bad, right?
libby_smith Yeah, it's bad. But it's not real bad. C'mon, you're going to be okay. Let's go.
james_ford I got it. I'm alright. I'm fine.
bernard_nadler Let me give you a hand, okay?
hugo_reyes Um, tell me again why we're doing this here when there's a dryer in the hatch?
rose_nadler I don't like the hatch.
hugo_reyes Oh, it's because of the doomsday button, isn't it?
rose_nadler Well, who needs a dryer when we've got sun and fresh air? We wouldn't want to spoil ourselves, now would we?
hugo_reyes Yeah, spoiled.
shannon_rutherford Hey, do you guys know where Michael and Walt left the stuff they didn't take with them on the raft?
hugo_reyes What kind of stuff?
shannon_rutherford Their clothes.
hugo_reyes I think their stuff's still on the beach back where their tent is.
shannon_rutherford Thanks.
rose_nadler Poor thing, it can't be easy losing the one person you love on the Island.
shannon_rutherford Here, smell this, that's his, right? Come on, get a good whiff of it. You're always trying to run off and find him? Then find him. Find Walt.
shannon_rutherford Good dog. Find Walt.
claire_littleton I know I woke you and I'm very, very sorry; but please, staying awake for 8 hours straight -- isn't that just cruel and unusual punishment?
john_locke How's that cradle treating you?
claire_littleton The cradles great. It's the baby that's the problem.
john_locke What's wrong?
claire_littleton He just won't sleep.
john_locke May I?
claire_littleton Sure.
john_locke Babies like the feeling of being constricted. It's not until we're older that we develop a desire to be free. There.
claire_littleton You know, I think everybody knows more about my baby than me.
john_locke Everybody?
claire_littleton Charlie read me the riot act last night for waking him. And as mad as it made me -- turns out he was right. You know, it's like we're playing mum and dad to this baby. Yet, I don't remember marrying him. No, seriously. I mean, we're practically strangers, him and me. For all I know, Charlie could be some religious freak.
john_locke Yeah, I seriously doubt that.
claire_littleton Then why is he carrying around a Virgin Mary statue?
john_locke What?
claire_littleton You know, one of the little statues? He says he found it in the jungle.
john_locke Hmm, how about that?
boone_carlyle Death sucks, doesn't it?
shannon_rutherford Boone!
boone_carlyle Hey. I'm so sorry, Shannon.
shannon_rutherford You came back.
boone_carlyle Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?
shannon_rutherford I'm 18, Boone. Your mom's going to freak.
boone_carlyle It's a wake. I mean, seriously, who doesn't serve booze at a wake? Scotch? To your dad. Maybe after all this you'll come visit me in New York.
shannon_rutherford I won't have to visit if I get that job at the Martha Graham dance company. I'll be living there.
boone_carlyle Right. Internship.
shannon_rutherford I know it's like a 1 in 3000 chance, but I may get it.
boone_carlyle Absolutely. Have you spoken to my mother?
shannon_rutherford She's going through her thing and I'm going through mine.
boone_carlyle Have you two been getting along?
shannon_rutherford She hates me.
boone_carlyle Just try to talk to her.
shannon_rutherford From day one she resented my relationship with him, my dad.
mr_eko We need a break.
ana_lucia_cortez 5 minutes!
mr_eko Here.
ana_lucia_cortez What are you looking at?
mr_eko We have to cut inland.
ana_lucia_cortez What? Into the jungle? They said their people were on the beach. If we keep walking...
mr_eko The beach goes into a peninsula ahead. It may not be passable.
ana_lucia_cortez May not?
mr_eko May not.
ana_lucia_cortez You're doing this to get the cowboy back faster, aren't you? You would risk our lives to help him?
mr_eko It's the only way I know.
ana_lucia_cortez I liked you better when you weren't talking.
claire_littleton I can't believe he's still asleep.
john_locke Swaddling works every time.
claire_littleton Uh-huh. Hey, do you want to hold him?
john_locke That's okay.
claire_littleton Put your arms out. It's okay.
john_locke He smells good.
claire_littleton He does, doesn't he?
john_locke Yeah.
charlie_pace Oh.
john_locke Hello, Charlie.
charlie_pace Hello.
claire_littleton Hey, John just taught me a new trick swaddling.
charlie_pace That's excellent. I just came to take him so you could have your walk.
john_locke Well, great timing, yeah. I've got to get going.
claire_littleton Well, thanks for your help, John.
john_locke Welcome.
claire_littleton What?
jinsoo_kwon 나한테 기대.
jinsoo_kwon 나한테 기대.
james_ford I'm fine.
jinsoo_kwon 기대라니까! 내가 부축해 줄게.
james_ford I'm fine.
jinsoo_kwon 기대라니까!
ana_lucia_cortez Shhhh - shut up.
michael_dawson What? They can't talk at all?
ana_lucia_cortez If he talks he's going to get us all killed.
michael_dawson By what? Them? I thought they lived a day back that way?
ana_lucia_cortez How about you shut your mouth and get your buddy over here moving?
michael_dawson What happened to you people? You want us to take you back with us? Fine. But you want me to keep quiet then you need to tell me why I have to.
ana_lucia_cortez They came the first night that we got here. They took three of us. Nothing happened for two weeks, then they came back. They took nine more. They're smart, and they're animals, and they could be anywhere at any time. Now we're moving through the jungle -- their jungle -- just so you can save your little hick friend over here. And if you think that one gun and one bullet is going to stop them -- think again. So shut your mouth and keep moving.
michael_dawson They took my son.
ana_lucia_cortez They took a lot of things.
sayid_jarrah I know what it is to lose someone you care deeply about.
shannon_rutherford You really think that this is all about Boone? I saw Walt, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Then why are we sitting at Boone's grave.
shannon_rutherford Just go back, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Where are you going?
shannon_rutherford To find him.
nora It came.
shannon_rutherford Oh my god.
nora Open it.
shannon_rutherford I can't open it.
nora You what?
shannon_rutherford You open it.
nora You have been waiting 6 months for this letter -- no way I'm opening it.
shannon_rutherford I got it!
nora You got it?1
shannon_rutherford I got it!!
nora Oh my god, you're going to New York!
shannon_rutherford Hello. This is her. Uh, that's impossible. Okay, are you sure? Of course, I will certainly do that. Sorry.
nora What?
shannon_rutherford My rent check bounced.
nora But you're, like, rich.
sabrina_carlyle I'm sorry, I would have offered you something to drink, but I have to be at a meeting in 10 minutes.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, um, my checks are bouncing.
sabrina_carlyle Well, that's what happens when you make withdrawals and don't make deposits, Shannon.
shannon_rutherford When do I get the money dad left me? The money from the will.
sabrina_carlyle There was no will.
shannon_rutherford What?
sabrina_carlyle Shannon, your father and I had a living trust. Everything passed to me. I'm afraid there was nothing specifically designated for you.
shannon_rutherford Why would he do that?
sabrina_carlyle Well, maybe he just wanted you to find your own way. We all have to work, Shannon. Most of us are the better for it.
shannon_rutherford I can work. I just -- I just got this really prestigious internship. And I'm not going to make any money for a while but I'm going to be working like 16 hours a day.
sabrina_carlyle The only thing I've ever seen you do 16 hours a day straight is sleep.
shannon_rutherford I just need to get to New York. I need just something -- something to get started. I'll pay you back.
sabrina_carlyle This week it's an internship -- last year it was what -- interior design? You'll never pay me back. And you'll only hate yourself even more.
shannon_rutherford I really want this, Sabrina. I can do this.
sabrina_carlyle I'm sorry, Shannon. You're on your own.
charlie_pace Oh, double-6's, how nice for you.
john_locke Lucky. I hope you didn't get the wrong idea seeing me with the baby?
charlie_pace What wrong idea would that be?
john_locke You and Claire are close, and you spend a lot of time with Aaron -- I just wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
charlie_pace Did she tell you we had a fight?
john_locke She didn't say it was a fight.
charlie_pace She was going to give it up, you know -- for adoption. Did she tell you that?
john_locke Yeah, when I built the cradle.
charlie_pace Ah, of course, when you built the cradle.
john_locke Why do you ask?
charlie_pace She's got a bit to learn about being a mum -- responsibility and all.
john_locke Hmmm, now that's an interesting thing to say -- for a heroin addict.
charlie_pace Recovering addict.
john_locke Recovering. It's your turn.
bernard_nadler Here, let me help you.
jinsoo_kwon 아냐, 아냐.
michael_dawson I got it.
jinsoo_kwon 나 혼자도 할 수 있어.
michael_dawson I said I got it, man. Take a break.
jinsoo_kwon 안 쉬어도 돼.
james_ford What? You suddenly give a damn about me? Leave me alone. Both of you. I got it.
michael_dawson Hey, hey, hey Okay. Hey, Sawyer, hey you okay?
james_ford I would have left you behind.
michael_dawson Shut up, man. Don't try that.
james_ford I did leave you behind.
michael_dawson Yeah, well, good thing I ain't you. No, no, hey, Sawyer. Sawyer, hey.
jinsoo_kwon Water! Water!
libby_smith Here you go. Here, here.
michael_dawson What's the matter with him?
libby_smith Well, the fever -- he's got an infection -- he's dehydrated.
ana_lucia_cortez We gotta keep moving.
michael_dawson What?
ana_lucia_cortez We gotta keep going.
jinsoo_kwon 소이어를 두고 갈 순 없어!
ana_lucia_cortez You wanna stay, that's fine. But we're rolling out.
bernard_nadler We can't just leave him, Ana.
libby_smith Maybe if we just rest a little while, he'll regain consciousness.
ana_lucia_cortez Rest? Here? Do you remember what happened to us? What they did to us? You remember Goodwin?
cindy_chandler Ana's right, maybe we should just push on.
michael_dawson Hey, you know what? I don't remember Goodwin. And I'm really sorry about whatever happened to him, but I don't care. Mr. Eko, can you help me make a stretcher? And Bernard, I need 4 sticks -- sturdy ones -- about 5 feet long.
bernard_nadler Yeah, got it.
ana_lucia_cortez You're going to carry your friend.
michael_dawson Yeah, we're going to carry him.
sayid_jarrah Why are you doing this, Shannon?
shannon_rutherford I didn't ask you to follow me.
sayid_jarrah No, you'd rather be out here alone and get lost or hurt.
shannon_rutherford I don't need your help, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Walt is not out here. You're following a Labrador, not a Bloodhound -- in an effort to find a boy who's on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
shannon_rutherford He's not on the raft.
sayid_jarrah What are you talking about?
shannon_rutherford We found the bottle on the beach.
sayid_jarrah The bottle with the messages that they brought with them?
shannon_rutherford I know he's out here somewhere. I saw Walt. And the raft is gone, and he is all alone.
sayid_jarrah Shannon.
michael_dawson F*** me...
ana_lucia_cortez Cindy. Cindy? Where's Cindy?
bernard_nadler She was just here.
ana_lucia_cortez Cindy! Cindy!
bernard_nadler I don't know, she was...
libby_smith Did they take her?
michael_dawson How could she just be gone?
bernard_nadler Cindy! Cindy!
ana_lucia_cortez I'm going after her.
mr_eko No, we stay together -- we split up, we give them what they want.
ana_lucia_cortez This is all your fault. We never should have gone through the jungle. You risked our lives to save him and he's already dead. This one's on you.
michael_dawson What the hell is that?
libby_smith Oh, god.
ana_lucia_cortez Run!
boone_carlyle Hey.
shannon_rutherford Hey.
boone_carlyle She said no. She knew why I asked for the money.
shannon_rutherford Can I crash at your place in New York for just a little while -- until I get on my feet.
boone_carlyle I'm leaving New York. She offered me a job.
shannon_rutherford You're going to work for your mother?
boone_carlyle It's a really good job, Shannon. Look, this is all I have right now, but my trust fund's going to kick in at the end of the month. And after that I can absolutely keep you afloat.
shannon_rutherford Thank you, but I'm going to figure out a way to make my own money.
boone_carlyle But who knows when that's going to be, just take it.
shannon_rutherford Why, you don't think I can do it?
boone_carlyle I didn't say that.
shannon_rutherford Do you believe I can, or don't you, Boone? Okay, you know what, I really want you to just take your money -- go work for your mother -- I don't want it...
boone_carlyle Shannon, it's just money...
shannon_rutherford Just take it, alright!
boone_carlyle I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
shannon_rutherford I don't want your money!
sayid_jarrah Shannon! Are you okay?
shannon_rutherford Do not help me up.
sayid_jarrah Let's go back.
shannon_rutherford Why don't you believe me? I need you to believe in me.
sayid_jarrah I do believe in you.
shannon_rutherford You don't! No one does. They think that I'm some kind of joke. They think I'm worthless.
sayid_jarrah Shannon, you are not worthless.
shannon_rutherford You say that now, but you don't -- you're just going to leave me. I know as soon as we get out of here you're just going to leave me.
sayid_jarrah I will never leave you. I love you and I believe you.
shannon_rutherford You do?
sayid_jarrah I believe you.
walt_lloyd Shhh.
shannon_rutherford Do you see him?
shannon_rutherford Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt!
sayid_jarrah Shannon!
shannon_rutherford Walt! Wait!
sayid_jarrah Shannon!
sayid_jarrah Shannon! Shannon.
