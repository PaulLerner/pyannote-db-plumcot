jinsoo_kwon YEON 엄마 보고 싶어. 언제 와?
sunhwa_kwon 엄마 빨리 갈게. 그래, 사랑해. 안녕.
kate_austen Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
ben_linus Because he's not your son, Kate.
sunhwa_kwon Move away, Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Sun—
sunhwa_kwon I said, move away!
kate_austen S-Sun! What are you doing? Where's Aaron?
sunhwa_kwon He's in the car.
dr_jack_shephard Sun, listen. I know you think you're helping—
sunhwa_kwon If it wasn't for you, Jin would still be alive.
ben_linus I didn't kill your husband, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon Yes, you did.
ben_linus No, I didn't. Neither did anyone else, because he's not dead.
sunhwa_kwon You're lying.
ben_linus No, Sun. Jin's still alive, and I can prove it.

montand Allez, j'sais par où passer.
robert T'es sûr ?
montand Ecoute, le signal est puissant. Ce qui veut dire qu'il y a sûrement une antenne sur cette île. Si on la trouve, on pourra appeler du secours.
robert Is there an antenna on the Island?
robert Hey, Jin! Is—uh, please. Is there, um... ra—a radio tower?
robert Um... um... okay.
robert Like that. Is there a-a radio tower here?
jinsoo_kwon Yes. But I—I must find my camp because maybe, uh, helicopter go there.

danielle_rousseau Rien, c'est rien.
robert Je savais que c'était une erreur, t'es enceinte de sept mois—
danielle_rousseau Robert, ça va! Elle m'a juste donné un petit coup de pied.
robert Elle ?
danielle_rousseau Elle !

danielle_rousseau T'es pas Robert! T'es changé! Cette machine t'as changé!
robert Danielle, je t'en prie. Pose ton arme. Je t'aime, pourquoi tu agis comme ça?
danielle_rousseau Parce que t'es pas Robert. T'es malade. Ce monstre t'a rendu malade.
robert Mais il n'y a pas de monstre. C'est un système de sécurité qui garde ce temple, c'est tout.
robert Maintenant, pose ton fusil.
robert Je t'aime, Danielle. Je ne veux que rien nous arrive. A toi, et à notre bébé. Je t'en supplie, fais pas ça.

jinsoo_kwon No! No, please, wait!
MAN'SVOICE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode05 Turn around slowly.
james_ford Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer?
james_ford I thought you were on that boat, I thought you were dead!
jinsoo_kwon No, no, I... in water.
james_ford Well what do you say!
jinsoo_kwon Where is Sun?
miles_straume Where'd that guy come from? I thought he was on the boat.
dr_daniel_faraday The blast must've thrown him in the water. He's been moving with every flash, just like us.
james_ford Every time the sky lights up, we... move through time.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 말을 하는지 도대체 모르겠어. Translate. Please, translate.
james_ford You heard the man, translate.
miles_straume Uh, he's Korean. I'm from Encino.
jinsoo_kwon 선이 이 섬에 없다는 것을 로크가 어떻게 알아?
dr_charlotte_lewis He wants to know how you're sure his wife is off the Island.
james_ford You speak Korean, Red?
miles_straume Obviously.
john_locke Tell him I'm sure. But none of it will matter if we don't make it to the Orchid.
dr_charlotte_lewis 확실해. 그리고 오키드까지 가야 한대.
jinsoo_kwon 오키드가 뭔데?
dr_charlotte_lewis 섬을 벗어나는 법. 로크는 여길 벗어나 당신 친구들 모두 데려 온대. 당신 와이프도. 그래야만 플래쉬를 막을 수 있대요.
jinsoo_kwon Bring Sun back? Why you bring her back?
john_locke Because she never should've left.
sunhwa_kwon I've spent the last 3 years thinking... believing that he was dead. You say you have proof that he's not. I want to see it.
ben_linus Why don't you put down the gun. No one wants it to go off.
sunhwa_kwon How do you know he's alive?
ben_linus There's someone—someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.
sunhwa_kwon Someone? Who?
ben_linus The same person that's going to show us how to get back to the Island.
kate_austen Is that what this is about? You knew about this?
dr_jack_shephard No, no, I was...
kate_austen And that is why you're pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?
dr_jack_shephard I wasn't pretending anything...
kate_austen This is insane, you guys are crazy.
dr_jack_shephard Kate...
kate_austen Jack, don't!
ben_linus Sayid, where are you going?
sayid_jarrah I don't want any part of this. And if I see you, or him again, it will be extremely unpleasant for all of us.
ben_linus 30 minutes, Sun. We can be there in 30 minutes. And you’ll have proof—proof that he's alive. Or you can shoot me and never know.
sunhwa_kwon Let's go.
jinsoo_kwon How far?
john_locke Just over the next ridge.
jinsoo_kwon How you will leave the Island?
john_locke I'm not sure yet.
jinsoo_kwon I'll go with you.
john_locke It doesn't work like that. It's a one man job.
jinsoo_kwon Why?
john_locke I don’t know why, Jin, it just is. But I promise I'll bring Sun back.
dr_daniel_faraday You okay? Want to take a break?
dr_charlotte_lewis Let's just get there.
dr_daniel_faraday So... you speak any other languages?
dr_charlotte_lewis Just Klingon. Dan, is this gonna work?
dr_daniel_faraday It... it does make empirical sense that if this started at the Orchid then that's where it's gotta stop. But as far as bringing back the people who left in order to stop these temporal shifts? That's where we leave science behind. You okay?
dr_charlotte_lewis Oh no!
james_ford Come on!
dr_charlotte_lewis Ah!
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte! Charlotte!
james_ford Juliet...?
dr_juliet_burke Huh?
james_ford ...you have a little...
dr_juliet_burke You too.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte! Can you hear me? Charlotte, it's Daniel. Talk to me...
dr_charlotte_lewis 데려 오지 말라고 해. 잘 들어. 데려 오지 말라고 해. 이 곳은 죽음 뿐이야.
james_ford What'd she say?
dr_charlotte_lewis Don't let them bring her back. No matter what—don't let them bring her back! This place is death!
sunhwa_kwon You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.
ben_linus I didn't account for traffic.
dr_jack_shephard Sun, I'm sorry.
sunhwa_kwon Sorry for what?
dr_jack_shephard For leaving Jin behind. When we landed that chopper on the boat, everything was just happening so fast. I knew he was down below. I should've waited for him.
sunhwa_kwon Why are you telling me this now, Jack? Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben if he's lying about my husband?
dr_jack_shephard After what he just did to Kate - if you don't do it, Sun, I will.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?!
ben_linus What I'm doing is helping you! And if you had any idea what I've had to do to keep you safe – to keep your friends safe – then you'd never stop thanking me! You wanna shoot me, then shoot me – but let's get on with it! What's it gonna be?
sunhwa_kwon Drive.
dr_charlotte_lewis Why can't Daddy come with us?
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte, can you hear me?
dr_charlotte_lewis You know what my mum would say about you marrying an American. I know more about ancient Carthage than Hannibal himself.
james_ford What the hell is she talking about?
dr_daniel_faraday I have no idea.
john_locke Let's go – we have to keep moving.
dr_daniel_faraday Alright. Somebody help me with Charlotte. We're going to have to carry her.
john_locke No – she's going to hold us up.
dr_daniel_faraday We can't just leave her.
james_ford Flashes are getting closer together. Maybe when your nose starts bleeding, you'll realize we gotta get out of Dodge now. We'll come back for her just as soon as we can.
dr_daniel_faraday No. No way. I'm not going to leave her behind.
dr_charlotte_lewis Let them go without me.
dr_daniel_faraday No, Charlotte, no, we're not going to leave you behind.
james_ford Hell!
john_locke We have to move, now!
dr_charlotte_lewis He's right, go!
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte...
dr_charlotte_lewis Just go!
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte...
dr_charlotte_lewis Oh, oh turn it up! I love Geronimo Jackson.
dr_juliet_burke We're running out of time, Dan.
dr_daniel_faraday Go. I'm going to stay with her.
james_ford Let me ask you something, John. If we don't even know when the hell we are, what happens if the Orchid ain't around anymore?
dr_charlotte_lewis Look for the well. You'll find it at the well.
james_ford I'll be sure and do that.
john_locke Let's go.
john_locke We're here.
dr_juliet_burke Thank God! What are the odds that we would end up in the same time as this thing?
james_ford You just had to say something.
miles_straume How the hell did Charlotte know this was here?
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel?
dr_daniel_faraday Yes?
dr_charlotte_lewis I've been here before.
dr_daniel_faraday You've been...been here before?
dr_charlotte_lewis I grew up here...on the island. And there was this thing...this... DHARMA Initiative. And then...I moved away with my mum. Just my mum...and...I never saw my dad again. And then when I got back to England, I would...I would...ask my mum about this place, yeah? But she would say that it wasn't real...and that I'd made it up. That's why... I became an anthropologist. To find this island again. It's what...I've been searching for my whole life.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte...why are you telling me this?
dr_charlotte_lewis Because I remember something now. When I was little, living here, there was this man... a crazy man, he really scared me. And he told me that I had to leave the island and never ever come back. He told me that if I came back I would die.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte, I don't understand.
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel – I think that man was you.
james_ford You're going down there?
john_locke Uh-huh.
james_ford What exactly are you hoping to find?
john_locke A way off the island.
james_ford You expecting a subway?
john_locke Goodbye, James, Juliet, Miles... I'll see you when I get back.
jinsoo_kwon No! Stop! You don't bring Sun back.
john_locke No, I have to bring them all back, that's... that's how it works.
jinsoo_kwon How you know?
john_locke I... I just know.
jinsoo_kwon I cut this!
john_locke No! You do that, you'll kill every one of us!
jinsoo_kwon This island is bad! You don't bring Sun back! You promise—you promise you don't bring my baby!
john_locke All right, all right—you have my word.
jinsoo_kwon Promise, John.
john_locke I promise.
john_locke I won't go to Sun, Jin, but she might find me. If she does, what do I tell her?
jinsoo_kwon You tell her I dead. You say I wash up. You bury me. Proof.
john_locke I'll be back as soon as I can.
james_ford You sure you don't want us to lower you down?
john_locke Where would be the fun in that?
dr_juliet_burke John, if whatever you're attempting to do actually works... thank you.
john_locke You're welcome.
miles_straume Uh-oh.
james_ford John, dammit, hold on!
miles_straume I think you can let go of that now.
james_ford No... no no, no no!
dr_juliet_burke James, stop.
james_ford No, no!
dr_juliet_burke James, stop.
james_ford C'mon and help me!
dr_juliet_burke James—we can't help him.
dr_daniel_faraday Hold on... hold on... hold on... hold on... stay.... stay... stay with me... stay, okay? You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I've got a plan... I've got a plan. When we were back at the hatch, I talked to Desmond. I told him to find my mother. She can help us, Charlotte, she will help us!
dr_charlotte_lewis How can your mother help us?
dr_daniel_faraday She can! She will...
dr_charlotte_lewis Hey, hey. Listen, listen.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah? What?
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner... mm....
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte... No...!
john_locke James! Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?
john_locke Who's there?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Hello, John.
john_locke You! What are you doing down here?
dr_christian_shephard I'm here to help you the rest of the way.
john_locke I... I don't understand.
dr_christian_shephard You came to see me in the cabin. You asked me how to save the island and I told you you had to move it. I said that you had to move it, John.
john_locke But Ben said he knew how to do it! He told me that I had to stay here and lead his people.
dr_christian_shephard Since when did listening to him get you anywhere worth a damn? The good news is that you're here now. You ready to go?
john_locke I don't... I don't... I... I don't know... what to do once I get there.
dr_christian_shephard There's a woman living in Los Angeles. Now once you get all your friends together—and it must be all of them, every one who left—and once you've persuaded them to join you, this woman will tell you exactly how to come back.
john_locke Who is she?
dr_christian_shephard Her name is Eloise Hawking.
john_locke What if I can only convince some of them to come back?
dr_christian_shephard I believe in you, John. You can do this.
john_locke Richard said I was going to die.
dr_christian_shephard Well, I suppose that's why they call it sacrifice.
john_locke All right. I'm ready.
dr_christian_shephard Good. Now, on the other side of this column here is a wheel, slipped off its axis. All you have to do is give it a little push.
john_locke Could you help me up?
dr_christian_shephard No. Sorry. I can't.
dr_christian_shephard Good luck John.
dr_christian_shephard Say hello to my son.
john_locke Who's your son?
ben_linus May I?
ben_linus Take it.
sunhwa_kwon 영원히 함께 하길. How do you have this?
ben_linus John gave it to me.
dr_jack_shephard You said John never came to see you.
ben_linus That's true, Jack. I went to see him. Jin gave it to him before he left the Island.
sunhwa_kwon Why did he not tell me himself?
ben_linus I don't know. Maybe he never had a chance before he died. I'm sorry I had to bring you here before I gave it to you, Sun. But all those people back on the Island—Jin included—need our help. There is a woman in this church and she can tell us how to get back to your husband. But we're running out of time, Sun. So I need you to decide right now. Will you come with me?
sunhwa_kwon Yes.
MAN'SVOICE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode05 What are you doing here?
ben_linus I assume the same thing you are.
desmond_hume You're looking for Faraday's mother too?
ben_linus Hello, Eloise.
eloise_hawking Hello, Benjamin. I thought I said all of them.
ben_linus This is all I could get on short notice.
eloise_hawking Well, I suppose it will have to do for now. All right! Let's get started.
