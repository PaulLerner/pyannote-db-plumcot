MILES I think you can let go of that now.
SAWYER No. No! No!
SAWYER No! No! No!
JULIET James, don't.
SAWYER Come on! Help me! 
JULIET James... Stop.
JULIET We can't help him. Wherever John went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
MILES Yeah, I'd say way before.
JIN What makes you—
LOCKE James! Can you hear me?! Can anyone hear me?!
LOCKE Aah!
JULIET What the hell was that?
MILES That one was different. It was... that was more like an earthquake.
SAWYER Locke!
JULIET James, wait!
SAWYER Great. 
JULIET My headache is gone.
MILES Yeah, mine is, too.
MILES And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
JULIET I think it's over. I think John did it.
JIN Now what?
SAWYER Now we wait for him to come back.
JULIET For how long?
SAWYER As long as it takes.
PHIL Are you kidding me?
PHIL I'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
JERRY Don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her. 
ROSIE Yeah.
PHIL She shouldn't be here, Jerry. We're on the clock, man.
JERRY Ah, mellow out, Phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
PHIL That's not the point. If LaFleur finds out what you're doing here—
JERRY LaFleur's not gonna find out anything.
PHIL —it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
ROSIE Guys? What...
JERRY Relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
ROSIE Guys. What...
PHIL Is that a Hostile?
JERRY I don't know.
ROSIE Is that... Horace?
JERRY Oh, he's got dynamite.
ROSIE Aah! 
PHIL Get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
JERRY Come on, Rosie.
PHIL I told you not to bring her here. I told you!
JERRY You gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go! Okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
PHIL We gotta get LaFleur.
JERRY 300 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake LaFleur up?
PHIL No, of course not, but—
JERRY No, no, no. Maybe—maybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
PHIL And maybe Horace blows himself up, and LaFleur kills us for not waking him.
PHIL We gotta go—now!
PHIL Do you wanna knock?
JERRY You knock.
PHIL Fine.
LAFLEUR What?
PHIL Mr. LaFleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
LAFLEUR What kind of situation?
JERRY Uh, it's, uh, Horace.
PHIL He's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
MILES Relax! I'm comin'!
MILES Hey, boss.
SAWYER Evening, Enos. You got your zapper with ya?
MILES Yep. You wanna tell me why I need it?
SAWYER 'Cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
MILES Why's he doin' that?
SAWYER 'Cause he's loaded.
MILES Since when does Horace drink?
SAWYER He doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
MILES Oh, man.
SAWYER All right. You put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
MILES Why don't you put out the fire, pack up, and—and I'll take him home?
SAWYER You wanna tell Amy where we found him?
SAWYER Help me get him up.
AMY Oh, my God. Is he okay?
SAWYER You tell me.
AMY Bring him inside.
AMY The couch. The couch is fine.
AMY Oh. Where'd you find him?
SAWYER By the Flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
AMY We had a fight. 
SAWYER Must've been a doozy.
AMY Please, Jim. It's personal.
SAWYER Personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
AMY It was about Paul.
SAWYER Go on.
AMY Oh.
SAWYER What's the matter? You okay?
AMY Ohhh! The baby—it's coming. Ohhh!!
SAWYER Oh, hell.
FARADAY I'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
SAWYER Where's Red?
JULIET I don't know.
FARADAY No. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
JULIET Daniel? You okay?
FARADAY I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
JULIET Daniel, where's Charlotte?
FARADAY She's not here. She... She's gone.
JULIET Where?
FARADAY She's... dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... and she was... she was just gone.
FARADAY Her... body just... disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
JULIET I'm so sorry.
SAWYER Hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
FARADAY Of course it's over. Wherever we are now... whenever we are now... we're here for good. I won't do it.
JULIET Okay. Okay.
FARADAY I won't. I'm not gonna—I'm—I'm...
JULIET Okay.
FARADAY I'm not gonna—I w—I won't.
JULIET Okay. Okay.
FARADAY Tell...
SAWYER Okay. Swell. Until Dan checks back in, I say we head back to the beach. When Locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
MILES The beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
JULIET Sawyer's right, Miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
MILES Or maybe when we get there, you'll—you'll wanna go back to the Orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
SAWYER Hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
MILES Who put him in charge?
SAWYER Thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
JULIET You should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
SAWYER Well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
JULIET Any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if I hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
SAWYER Well, I'm open to suggestions.
WOMAN Oh, no! No, Paul! Oh, God! Oh, God!
WOMAN No, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
WOMAN No, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just having—Paul. Paul, please. Oh, my God! No! No, Paul, please. Please.
JULIET Who do you think they are?
MILES Who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are. Hey. Dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
FARADAY Doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
SAWYER Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato. I'm going over there. You still got my back?
JULIET Absolutely.
WOMAN Paul, Paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, Paul!
BEARD On your feet!
WOMAN No, I can't! I can't!
BEARD Come on, get up! Now!
WOMAN Aah!
BEARD Shut up!
SAWYER All right, drop the gun!
WOMAN Oh, God.
SAWYER It's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
AMY Who are you?
JULIET Her friend's wearing a DHARMA jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
SAWYER The guys with the bags—Others?
JULIET Beats me.
SAWYER What, y'all don't know each other?
JULIET Before my time.
JIN Sawyer. Walkie.
JULIET We need to go.
SAWYER I'm on it.
SAWYER Listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
AMY Who are you people?
SAWYER Our ship wrecked here on the way to Tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of this—those two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
AMY We have to bury them.
SAWYER Bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
AMY We—we—we have to. The truce. Oh, God. We have to bury them. And—and we have... we have... and we have to bring it—him back home. We have to bring Paul back with us. Please. Please? Please.
JIN I'll carry him.
SAWYER All right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
AMY He wasn't... my friend. He was my husband. 
SAWYER All right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
MILES You really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
SAWYER I'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
JULIET Daniel! Stop!
JULIET Turn it off.
AMY Turn what off?
JULET Whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
AMY Where did you say your ship was going?
SAWYER Listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
AMY Okay. Okay, fine.
SAWYER "Sonic fence"? Didn't I say let me do the talking?
JULIET One more step, Dan would've fried his brain.
SAWYER His brain's already fried.
AMY Okay, it's off.
SAWYER You first.
AMY See? It's fine.
SAWYER All right, let's go.
SAWYER And going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'—
AMY It hurts! Oh!
DOCTOR You're gonna be okay, Amy. Just try and relax.
DOCTOR Where's Horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
SAWYER He's unavailable.
DOCTOR Look, Amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
SAWYER What the hell does that mean?
DOCTOR It's upside down. She needs a Caesarean.
SAWYER Well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
DOCTOR I'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on Tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
SAWYER Can you deliver this baby or not?
DOCTOR I don't know.
SAWYER Hey, man. Where is she?
JULIET What's up?
SAWYER Amy's having her baby.
JULIET What?
SAWYER Mm. Did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a Caesarean.
JULIET We had an agreement.
SAWYER Screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
JULIET Don't you understand that every time I try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
SAWYER Well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
JULIET The baby's breech?
DOCTOR Yes, but—
JULIET Did you try an external cephalic version?
DOCTOR What? No. I—
JULIET It's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutures—half-round if you've got them—and an epidural anesthetic.
DOCTOR You're gonna need? Where is Horace?
SAWYER I'm speaking for Horace now, and I say she's delivering this baby.
DOCTOR I don't think it's a good idea.
AMY I want her. I want her to do it. Huh? Mm.
SAWYER You heard the lady.
SAWYER Listen... you're gonna do great. I know you are.
JULIET Okay.
AMY Oh!
JULIET Okay. Shh.
JULIET Hey.
JIN Is everything okay?
SAWYER Amy went into labor.
JIN I know. Is she okay?
SAWYER I don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
JIN Juliet?
SAWYER Yeah, I pulled her out of retirement.
SAWYER Any luck?
JIN We finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
SAWYER Well, 1-3-4 then.
JIN How long do we look, James?
SAWYER As long as it takes.
SAWYER What happened?
JULIET It's a boy.
SAWYER He's okay? She's okay?
JULIET Everyone's okay. 
SAWYER Mm.
HORACE How's your head?
SAWYER It hurts.
SAWYER Where are my people?
HORACE They're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and I really appreciate what you did.
SAWYER Well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
HORACE Look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
SAWYER My name's James LaFleur. You can call me Jim.
HORACE How'd you get to the island, Jim?
SAWYER If my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
HORACE They told me I need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
SAWYER We got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
HORACE What kind of ship?
SAWYER A salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of Portsmouth, England, called the Black Rock. You heard of her?
HORACE Can't say that I have.
HORACE So... once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
SAWYER Some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
HORACE Hmm. Well... I tell you what, Jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
SAWYER Send 'em where?
HORACE There's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
SAWYER Hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
HORACE Nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the DHARMA Initiative. And look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, Jim, but you are not DHARMA material.
MILES We're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
JULIET Sawyer's gonna be fine.
MILES What are you lookin' at?
JULIET I lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
MILES You were in the DHARMA Initiative?
JULIET No. The Others took over these Barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
MILES Well... welcome home.
JIN Daniel... no more flash?
FARADAY No. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
RED-HEADED GIRL Hey, Mum. Where's Dad?
WOMAN Come on, Luv. 
FARADAY Charlotte.
HORACE Hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, Mr. LaFleur here can fill you in on the situation.
MILES "Mr. LaFleur"?
SAWYER It's Creole. I improvised.
JULIET What happened in there?
SAWYER Well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to Tahiti.
MILES How's that bad news?
WOMAN You guys, come on! Now!
MAN Let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
MAN Let's go! Get out of here!
MAN Come on! Come on!
PHIL Come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
PHIL Heather, keep an eye on them.
SAWYER Uh-oh.
HORACE Hello, Mr. Alpert.
RICHARD Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.
HORACE I wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
RICHARD That fence may keep other things out, but not us.
RICHARD The only thing that does keep us out, Horace, is our truce... which you've now broken.
HORACE I don't know what you're talking about.
RICHARD Where are my two men?
MILES You know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
SAWYER Hold your horses, Banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
HORACE Okay, LaFleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
SAWYER Well, that depends on how hard he looks.
HORACE Call the Arrow. Tell them we're at Condition One. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
PHIL Yes, sir.
SAWYER Let me talk to him.
HORACE Excuse me?
SAWYER Your buddy out there with the eyeliner—let me talk to him.
HORACE We had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
SAWYER I understand I'm the one that killed his men, and I'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why I did it.
HORACE I can't let you do that.
SAWYER Well, it's a good thing I ain't asking your permission.
JULIET James, are you sure you know what you're doing?
SAWYER Not yet. But I'll figure somethin' out.
SAWYER Hello, Richard.
RICHARD I'm sorry. Do we know each other?
SAWYER I'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and I defended myself.
RICHARD Is that so?
SAWYER That's so.
RICHARD Your people know that you're telling me this?
SAWYER They ain't my people, Hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
RICHARD If you're not a member of the DHARMA Initiative, then what are you?
SAWYER Did you bury the bomb?
RICHARD Excuse me?
SAWYER The hydrogen bomb with "Jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
RICHARD How...
SAWYER Yeah, I know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... he went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is John Locke, and I'm waitin' for him to come back. So... you still think I'm a member of the damn DHARMA Initiative?
RICHARD No. I guess I don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
RICHARD Now what are we gonna do about that?
HORACE How are you doing, Amy?
AMY Is he gone?
AMY Alpert?
HORACE No, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
AMY You told him? Why?
HORACE We had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take Paul's body back with him.
AMY Mm. No. Oh!
HORACE Hey.
AMY Oh. 
HORACE Hey, Ames. Listen, w—
HORACE We've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
AMY They can take him. He would want to keep us safe.  Can I have a minute, please?
SAWYER I'm sorry.
SAWYER You need some help?
HORACE Hmm? Oh. Nah, I've got it. Thanks.
HORACE Hey, Jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morning—it returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
SAWYER Thanks.
SAWYER I bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, Locke'll be back by then.
JULIET And then what?
SAWYER What do you mean, "Then what"?
JULIET Locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now I've got my chance.
JULIET I'm going to leave.
SAWYER You do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... it don't exist yet.
JULIET It's not a reason not to go.
SAWYER Well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and Mr. "I Speak to Dead People"?
SAWYER And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
JULIET You'll be fine.
SAWYER Maybe... but who's gonna get my back?
SAWYER Come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all I'm asking. Two weeks.
JULIET All right. Two weeks.
SAWYER Mmm, somethin' smells good.
JULIET Hey there.
JULIET Is that for me?
SAWYER You were amazing today.
JULIET Thank you for believing in me.
SAWYER Ah.
SAWYER Mm.
JULIET I love you.
SAWYER Mmm. I love you, too.
SAWYER Mmm.
JULIET Mmm.
SAWYER Wake up, boss.
HORACE Ah. Oh!
SAWYER How's your head?
HORACE It hurts.
SAWYER I got good news and bad news. What you want first?
HORACE Good news.
SAWYER You're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
HORACE Oh, gosh. Amy... she had the baby?
SAWYER It's a boy.
HORACE A boy?
SAWYER Mm.
HORACE Ohh. 
SAWYER Now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
HORACE I was, uh... I was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so I went to grab a pair of Amy's, and... I found this...
HORACE ...in the back of her drawer. It was Paul's.
SAWYER You got in a fight over a necklace?
HORACE I know. But... It's only been three years, Jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
SAWYER I had a thing for a girl once. And I had a shot at her, but I didn't take it. For a little while, I'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now I can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her face—it's... she's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
SAWYER Oh. 
SAWYER What? ... Wait. What? ... H—no. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the North Valley.
JULIET Who was it?
JULIET James, what's going on?
SAWYER It was Jin.
JULIET Is everything okay?
SAWYER Yeah. I just... I gotta go.
