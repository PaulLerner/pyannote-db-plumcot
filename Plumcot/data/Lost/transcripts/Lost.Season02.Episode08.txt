matthew_reed So how're you doing?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Well, the family with the screaming baby moved.
matthew_reed You must be thrilled.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Actually, it's too quiet now.
matthew_reed So, how's Danny -- you two trying to work things out?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA There's nothing to work out. He left.
matthew_reed You okay with that?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I guess you could say I'm one of those people that's just better off alone.
matthew_reed So, how was the firing range?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Good.
matthew_reed How did it feel to hold a gun again?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Very good.
matthew_reed All these steps count, Ana. You've come a long way since we met 4 months ago.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Did she say -- you know, when I can come back to work?
matthew_reed She left the final determination up to me.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Right.
matthew_reed Do you think you're ready?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What do you think?
matthew_reed Welcome back to the force, Officer Cortez.

mr_eko No.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You, you do it. Tie him. Use the vines from the stretcher.
michael_dawson Hey, if we take that thing apart we won't be able to...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Shut up!
libby_smith Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor or he'll die.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I know what I'm doing.

ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.
captain_teresa_cortez They got you a cake, try and act surprised.
rose_nadler Jack, nice to see you out of the Hatch. You could use more sunshine.
dr_jack_shephard I'll take that under advisement.
rose_nadler A little fruit might do you good, too. Good for the constitution -- at least that's what they say.
dr_jack_shephard Well, if that's what they say.
rose_nadler Mmmm?
dr_jack_shephard Where'd you get these?
rose_nadler Well, now just because you're a little excited -- no reason to talk with your mouth full.
hugo_reyes Past the hanging tree, double or nothing.
kate_austen You sure?
hugo_reyes Dude, double or nothing, there's no way you're hitting it that far.
charlie_pace Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.
kate_austen Double's 10 thousand bucks.
charlie_pace Oh, that's nothing to someone who's worth 150 million dollars. He'll build you your own course, if you'd like.
kate_austen What are you talking about?
hugo_reyes Ignore him, he's an idiot.
hugo_reyes Crap!
dr_jack_shephard You hooked it. Try keeping your left arm straight.
kate_austen You giving me tips?
dr_jack_shephard Kate, I'm -- I'm a doctor.
kate_austen So, you think you could do better?
dr_jack_shephard Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.
kate_austen And what's golf?
dr_jack_shephard Golf is accuracy.
kate_austen Well, why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate.
charlie_pace Oooh, fighting talk.
dr_jack_shephard You're kidding, right?
kate_austen 3 holes, no handicap, we play for bragging rights. What are we waiting for?
libby_smith Ana, let's just get to their camp. It was an accident; they'll understand.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They'll understand? I killed one of them. If those two move, shout.

ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm not-
sayid_jarrah Untie me!!!
libby_smith Ana.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you doing?
mr_eko I'm taking him back to his camp.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Don't leave, please. If that were you, he'd let you die.
mr_eko I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me.
BIG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode08 MIKE So'd the shrink give you any good drugs?

kate_austen Shut up, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Nice.
kate_austen You're up.

mr_eko Where is the doctor?
dr_jack_shephard I got him. I got him.
kate_austen Where are we headed?
dr_jack_shephard Bathroom. He's burning up. We've got to get him in the shower -- bring his fever down.
kate_austen What can I do?
dr_jack_shephard Okay, go through the medical stash; there's a bottle of Ofloxacin...
kate_austen Ofloxacin.
dr_jack_shephard Ofloxacin -- little white pills. Bring the alcohol and some gauge patches, and strip that bed and make sure it has clean sheets on it. Kate?!
kate_austen Uh, yeah, yeah.
john_locke What happened?
dr_jack_shephard John, the button.
john_locke Hello.
mr_eko Hello.
bernard_nadler Hey, what are we doing here, Ana? I mean, their camp has got to be close. I just want to get back to my wife.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA How long have I kept you alive out here, Bernard? That's right. So cut me some slack.
libby_smith Hey, we just want to know what you're doing. What's the plan?
sayid_jarrah She has no plan. She only has her guilt and a gun.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You want a plan? Do you have any ammo, back at your camp?
michael_dawson What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Ammo -- for the gun -- do you have any back at your camp?

jinsoo_kwon Go. 사이드를 절대로 다치게 할 수는 없어.
michael_dawson I'll be back, man.
libby_smith Ana, what are you doing? You can't live out here alone.

ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What, you talking to me, now?
BIG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode08 MIKE I just want to go home A-L.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice.
BIG#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode08 MIKE So does that mean every time we run into some yo-yo with a TV in his hands, you're going to draw down?
detective_raggs Hey, Ana Lucia -- your guy -- we got him.
captain_teresa_cortez His name is Jason McCormick. We picked him up on an assault on an elderly woman in Echo Park. His fingerprints matched a partial from your crime scene. We questioned him and he confessed. The D.A. is ready to file charges -- all he needs is for you to I.D. him.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA It's not him.
captain_teresa_cortez He confessed.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I don't know him.
captain_teresa_cortez Can you guys give us a minute? Why are you doing this?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Because it's not him.
captain_teresa_cortez He put 4 bullets into you -- hollow points through your vest -- he tried to kill you. You want a list of his priors? You want to put this guy back out on the street?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA It's not him.
john_locke What happened? Out there -- what happened?
mr_eko There was an accident.
john_locke What kind of accident?
mr_eko A girl was shot and killed.
john_locke What did she look like?
mr_eko She was tall with blonde hair. There was an Arab man...
john_locke Shannon. You said there were 5 of you from the tail section?
mr_eko 4.
john_locke 4 -- why didn't the rest of them come back with you? And Michael, Jin?
mr_eko They cannot come back right now.
john_locke Can you take me to them?
mr_eko No.
kate_austen Here you go. What's happening? Why is he shaking?
dr_jack_shephard He's septic. The infection's gotten into the blood stream. If the anti-biotics don't bring the fever down he'll go into shock. Hold him up.
kate_austen Okay, I've got him.
dr_jack_shephard Swallow it, swallow it, swallow it.
kate_austen I'll do it.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, I've got it.
kate_austen I can do it. Sawyer? Hey, you have to listen to me, okay? The only way that you are going to get better is if you take this pill. So I want you to swallow it, okay? Okay, here we go. Now swallow, swallow. Good, good.
dr_jack_shephard Nice job. I never learned the whole whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you doing?
bernard_nadler I'm going, Ana. I don't want to be a part of this. I know everything you've done for us, and I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. But I'm going.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What about you?
libby_smith I just don't think you're the best judge of character. I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Alright, you want to go? Go. Leave. You -- go.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Get out of here. Go.
sunhwa_kwon Michael!
michael_dawson Hi. Listen, it's alright. Jin is okay.
sunhwa_kwon Where is he?
michael_dawson He's fine; and I'll explain. But right now, I need to find Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where are they? I said, where are they?
john_locke Jack, it's not his fault...
dr_jack_shephard Shannon's dead! I'm not... You're going to take me back out there, right now.
john_locke This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back.
dr_jack_shephard Half-dead with a bullet hole in his shoulder, John! Are you going to talk to me or are you just going to sit there?
mr_eko Anything I say will only make you angry. So, yes, I will sit here.
sunhwa_kwon Jack! Jack! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Michael.
michael_dawson We've got a problem, man.
dr_jack_shephard You remember how to get out there, right?
michael_dawson Yeah, I think so.
john_locke We should stop and think about this, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Think about what, John? Shannon's dead, Sayid's being held at gunpoint. You want to sit and hope that situation resolves itself -- be my guest. You know how to use this?
michael_dawson Yes, sir.
mr_eko Stop! Please. What do you want?
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
mr_eko Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you are going out with all these guns? What do you want?
dr_jack_shephard I want all of our people back here safely. Your friend murdered-
mr_eko Ana Lucia made a mistake.
dr_jack_shephard What did you say?
mr_eko Ana Lucia made a mistake.
dr_jack_shephard Ana Lucia.
mr_eko I will take you there. But only you, and no guns.
dr_jack_shephard Let's go.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where are you from? Where are you from?
sayid_jarrah I'm from Iraq.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Do you have any kids?
sayid_jarrah Why are you asking me if I have children?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm curious.
sayid_jarrah I do not. Do you have children?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No.
sayid_jarrah Are you going to kill me? That's what you're thinking about, isn't it?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Should I?
sayid_jarrah Almost 40 days ago on this very Island I tied a man to a tree and tortured him. I tortured him as I've tortured many men -- men whose voices I still hear in the night. Should you kill me? Maybe you should. Maybe you were meant to.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm a cop... I was a cop. One night my partner and I responded to a burglary call. We were the first ones there. I covered the front and he went around the back. I was there a minute and then this kid comes right through the front door -- I tell him to put his hands up -- and he says I'm making a mistake -- that he's a student and he wants to show me his I.D. I believed him. I just -- I let him reach. All I remember was a pop. By the time I hit the ground I thought I was dead. I feel dead.
sayid_jarrah What happened to him -- the man who shot you?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hey, Jason.
jason_mccormack I know you?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I was pregnant.
sayid_jarrah What happened to him?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Nothing. They never found him. Go ahead, pick it up, I deserve it.
sayid_jarrah What good it would be to kill you if we're both already dead?
kate_austen Hey! Hey, can you hear me? You're going to be okay. You're going to be alright. You're home.
