ANNOUNCER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 And now, dancing on stage three, the pride of Saint Paul, Corvette!
nikki_fernandez No! That's the money for the orphanage. That means, Mr. LaShade, you're the Cobra.
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Sorry, baby, it's just business.
nikki_fernandez All this time it was you.
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Pretty and smart. What a shame.
nikki_fernandez Razzle-dazzle! Ha!
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Autumn, Crystal, bad news. Corvette was working for the Cobra. But fear not he will pay.
howard_zukerman And, cut!
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Oh, let me give you a hand.
nikki_fernandez Oh, thank you. Billy Dee, it was so great working with you.
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine; thank you so much.
nikki_fernandez You're sweet.
BILLY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 DEE Take care.
nikki_fernandez You too.
howard_zukerman Alright, that's a series wrap for Corvette! Let's hear it for Nikki!
nikki_fernandez Thank you.
howard_zukerman Brilliant, Nikki. As always. You know, you don't need to die. We can bring you back next season.
nikki_fernandez How?
howard_zukerman Well, let's say that, uh, Corvette was wearing a bullet-proof vest?
howard_zukerman Bullet-proof breast!
nikki_fernandez Look, I'm just a guest star, and we all know what happens to guest stars.
howard_zukerman Now that your work's done here, I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney and heading back to LA.
nikki_fernandez No, I'm not leaving Sydney. I love you.
howard_zukerman I love you too.
james_ford Son of a bitch! Alright, come on, let's go one more.
dr_juliet_burke You said best out of five.
james_ford Well, now we're going best of seven.
james_ford Ah.
dr_juliet_burke Uh, you OK?
dr_juliet_burke What happened?
nikki_fernandez Pa... lies...
james_ford The hell's she saying?!
dr_juliet_burke I dunno.
james_ford Let's get her some water! Get help!
james_ford What are you doing?! Get moving!
dr_juliet_burke Dude... Nikki's dead.
james_ford ... Who the hell's Nikki?
nikki_fernandez Mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.
howard_zukerman Hm hm! My new chef; he's fantastic. Paulo, come in here.
paulo Yes, sir?
howard_zukerman Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan. I'd like you to meet Nikki.
nikki_fernandez The food is amazing.
paulo You're too kind. The secret is the shaved truffles. Luckily for you, they are in season.
nikki_fernandez You know, you should ask for a raise.
paulo Excuse me.
howard_zukerman He just came to Sydney. Heard I was hiring, and showed up at my office every day until I gave him the job. Apparently, back home, he's the, um, "Wolfgang Puck of Brazil".
nikki_fernandez Wow.
howard_zukerman Here. Try one of these home-made rolls. Please, please do.
nikki_fernandez Oh, it's... beautiful. Howie, you shouldn't have!
howard_zukerman I realize, of course, it's not a ring. Not yet. But, uh, when my wife--
nikki_fernandez Paulo..! Paulo!
paulo He's gone.
nikki_fernandez I would have loved it if you could have figured out a way where I didn't have to eat the same food as him.
paulo So nobody else knows about this thing?
nikki_fernandez Everything in here is way off the books.
paulo What?
nikki_fernandez Ashes are evidence, Paulo. We poisoned him; let's not poison ourselves.
nikki_fernandez Razzle-frickin'-dazzle.
charlie_pace What happened?
dr_juliet_burke We dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing.
sunhwa_kwon Maybe it was something she ate.
charlie_pace Maybe she was poisoned.
sunhwa_kwon We should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
charlie_pace She's got gunk. Under her fingernails. Where'd you find her?
james_ford Right here. She stumbled out of the jungle, face-planted, said something like "plywood", and... and, sayonara.
dr_juliet_burke Actually, I think she said "power lines."
james_ford Well, who the hell knows what she said — she was five seconds from dying. Probably seeing a light at the end of the tunnel—
dr_juliet_burke "Paulo lies!" That's what she said! "Paulo lies," not "power lines." "Paulo lies."
james_ford Who the hell's Paulo?
dr_juliet_burke Paulo's her... husband, or... boyfriend, or... whatever. They lived down the beach.
james_ford Well, where the hell is he? 'Cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
paulo English ex-pat, Howard L. Zuckerman, the creative force behind such hit shows as Exposé, Strike Team Alpha and Dr. Kincaid Esquire, was found dead in his palatial Sydney estate from heart failure.
nikki_fernandez Are you chewing gum?
paulo Nicotine gum. I quit.
paulo A toast. To our new life together.
nikki_fernandez Cheers.
shannon_rutherford There's nowhere to sit. No tables, no chairs, nothing. Good call, Boone.
boone_carlyle Do you wanna just grab a chair from the restaurant?
shannon_rutherford No, forget it, let's just leave. You already screwed us out of seats in first class, why would you be able to find them here?
boone_carlyle Hey, can I have this chair please?
paulo Yeah. Be my guest.
shannon_rutherford Boone, let's just go!
boone_carlyle Thanks anyway.
shannon_rutherford Boone!
boone_carlyle I'm coming, Shannon.
shannon_rutherford If you quit flirting with random guys, maybe you could actually get on the plane.
nikki_fernandez Promise me we'll never end up like them.
paulo I promise.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 PA Paging Captain Stewart, please pick up the courtesy call Captain Stewart.
shannon_rutherford BOONE!!! BOONE!!! BOONE!!!
john_locke Hey, hey, get away from there! Hey, get back, get down. Get away from there!!!
nikki_fernandez Paulo! Paulo!
dr_leslie_arzt Are we alive? Did we survive? Look at me, am I OK? Am I OK?
boone_carlyle Hey. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen? Hey does anybody have a pen?!
nikki_fernandez Paulo. Paulo, are you OK?
paulo Yeah. I think so.
nikki_fernandez Baby look at me. Look at me.
nikki_fernandez Where's the bag?
paulo What?
nikki_fernandez The bag, Paulo, where is it?
james_ford I'm telling ya, this is the trail.
dr_juliet_burke What do you know about tracking?
james_ford Well I know what a footprint is.
jinsoo_kwon Over here.
dr_juliet_burke Wow.
james_ford I'm guessing that's Paulo.
dr_juliet_burke He's just like Nikki, no wound, nothing.
jinsoo_kwon 이 친구 옷이 왜 이래?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah I know.
dr_juliet_burke Why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree?
james_ford Maybe he stepped on something.
dr_juliet_burke You see something? Sawyer?
james_ford Nothing.
james_ford No! Don't.
dr_juliet_burke Dude, what are you doing?
james_ford Two people are dead — you ever think they mighta been poisoned?
dr_juliet_burke That's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene.
james_ford Crime scene? There a forensics hatch I don't know about?
jinsoo_kwon STOP! Monster.
nikki_fernandez How many times do I have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters.
paulo Maybe it was a dinosaur.
nikki_fernandez Its not Jurassic Park, Paulo, its the South Pacific.
paulo Then what was it? You saw the trees move.
nikki_fernandez Would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, OK, the coastguard is gonna get here any second, and I really don't think that they're gonna take "hey, you know what, I'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
paulo OK, OK, OK.
dr_ethan_rom Hey. You guys lose your luggage? Yeah I lost mine too. I found some other stuff though, so if you need anything, pants or sweatshirt, I can help you find some that fit. I'm Ethan, by the way.
nikki_fernandez Hi, I'm Nikki, and this is Paulo.
dr_ethan_rom Nikki.
paulo Hi.
dr_ethan_rom Paulo.
nikki_fernandez And you are so sweet Ethan, but actually we're not looking for clothes. Yeah, see, Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.
dr_ethan_rom Ouch. You might have more luck looking inland.
paulo In the jungle?
dr_ethan_rom The plane split apart when it was over the Island , so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.
dr_leslie_arzt Boone. Boone took the water.
kate_austen What is going on?
boone_carlyle Someone had to take responsibility for it, it would have never lasted!
dr_jack_shephard Leave him alone! Its been six days, we're all still waiting for someone to come. We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. Now I found water. Fresh water up in the valley. I'll take in a group at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute. Because every man for himself is not gonna work. But if we can't live together, we're gonna die alone.
dr_juliet_burke I'm with Jin. It's the Monster.
james_ford Yeah, because that makes the most sense.
dr_juliet_burke It does. Locke said when Eko died, his last words were "You're next." And Nikki and Paulo were with them. He was talking about them.
james_ford He wasn't saying you're next about them, he was saying you're next as in you're all next.
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, that's not really better.
james_ford Alright, so here's how I see it. We wanna know what happened, we gotta find out whatever we can about these jabronis.
jinsoo_kwon Jabronis?
james_ford Nina and Pablo.
dr_juliet_burke Dude, show some respect. You know their names, its Nikki and Paulo.
james_ford Whatever, Hugo. Where's their tent? And we better get some shovels.
nikki_fernandez Hey Dr. Arzt.
dr_leslie_arzt Oh hi.
nikki_fernandez You're a scientist, right?
dr_leslie_arzt And an educator, yes.
nikki_fernandez What are you doing with all this stuff?
dr_leslie_arzt Oh, erm well, since we've been on here, I've discovered 20 new species. I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.
dr_leslie_arzt Ah, ah, that is a Latrodectus regina. Very dangerous. They call her the medusa spider. Her pheromones are very strong, one whiff and every male of the species would be here in seconds. Not unlike you I guess.
nikki_fernandez So, you're probably too busy to help me then.
dr_leslie_arzt No, no, not at all, I'm fine, er, I can help you, what can I do ya for?
nikki_fernandez Well I'm trying to find my luggage, and since the plane broke apart over the jungle, I was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.
dr_leslie_arzt Do I, do I know about trajectories? Allow me to draw you a map, madam.
paulo Are you sure we should be listening to a high school science teacher?
nikki_fernandez Junior high, and yes. What's your problem with Leslie anyway?
paulo Leslie?
nikki_fernandez Oh ho, you're jealous!
paulo Of him? Ha, never.
nikki_fernandez Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much, I had to sleep with him to get the map.
paulo I wouldn't be surprised. You slept with Zuckerman.
nikki_fernandez I did that for us.
paulo OK I'm sorry, I just, I don't trust that guy. We should have gone to Ethan, he would have helped.
nikki_fernandez Paulo, look.
paulo Another plane. Looks like its been here a while.
nikki_fernandez Go up there, maybe there's a radio or some—
paulo Are you insane? If I go up there that thing's gonna fall.
nikki_fernandez You're not gonna fall.
paulo What? You want me to die? Come on. Let's keep going.
nikki_fernandez What's that?
paulo OK, let's do it.
paulo Let's check it out.
nikki_fernandez Wow. So our carry-on bag fell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself? You don't wanna climb up to a plane, but now you wanna climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel. I don't think so.
dr_juliet_burke Hey, man, be careful.
james_ford Why? They don't live here any more.
charlie_pace So Sun checked the food. They were eating the same as us and no one else is sick. Could it be a virus?
dr_juliet_burke Dude, Monster. Creepy, they collected bugs.
charlie_pace Ah, I think these were Arzt's. Collected all kinds of creepy crawlies before he... exploded.
dr_juliet_burke They must have been friends.
charlie_pace Exposé.
dr_juliet_burke Did you just say Exposé?
charlie_pace Yeah.
james_ford What the hell's Exposé?
dr_juliet_burke Only the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like "Baywatch", only better. Its about Autumn and Crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.
james_ford How'd I miss that one?
dr_juliet_burke Check it out, look at the cast list, Nikki Fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in Australia. This must have been her big break.
charlie_pace Well it certainly sounds like it.
dr_juliet_burke No way. Mr. LaShade was the Cobra?
charlie_pace Is that supposed to mean something?
dr_juliet_burke Dude the Cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons.
dr_juliet_burke They had a walkie talkie?
james_ford Every damn one of those bastards on the other side of the Island had one exactly like this hanging from their belts.
charlie_pace So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?
james_ford I'll tell ya how. They were working with the Others.
shannon_rutherford What gives you the right?
kate_austen You have to understand, we thought it was best for everybody.
dr_leslie_arzt I'm sorry, you my mother? Cause she knows what's best for me — other than that, I decide.
nikki_fernandez Hey, what's going on?
shannon_rutherford Kate and her two boyfriends found a case of guns that fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
kate_austen Look. The case is locked. The key is around Jack's neck, alright. I promise you they're safe.
dr_leslie_arzt You're all out of control. The pigs are walking. Huh, the pigs are walking!
nikki_fernandez So, where did you say you found that case?
nikki_fernandez Its just water, Paulo. Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
paulo Why me?
nikki_fernandez Well as you had no trouble reminding me, I slept with Howie Zuckerman. So the least you could do is go for a swim, and Kate said they found the case on the bottom.
paulo Lemme ask you something.
nikki_fernandez What?
paulo If you didn't need me to find that bag, would we still be together?
nikki_fernandez That bag is worth eight million dollars. Just dive in, Paulo.
nikki_fernandez Well?
paulo Nothing.
nikki_fernandez There's nothing down there?
paulo Just dead bodies.
dr_juliet_burke OK, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the Others, like how?
james_ford Like Michael.
charlie_pace If that's the case, then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?
james_ford Who knows why those people do anything? What matters is they could be out there right now waiting to get us.
dr_juliet_burke I dunno, dude. I was with the Others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the Island.
sunhwa_kwon Then who dragged me into the jungle? The Others came into our camp, they grabbed me, put a bag over my head. And if I hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
james_ford Look, y'all stay here. Lemme see if I can see any sign of 'em. I'll do a perimeter sweep.
dr_juliet_burke Where'd you get the gun?
james_ford Got it off one of them.
dr_juliet_burke And when were you gonna let us know?
james_ford I guess right now.
dr_juliet_burke What exactly is a perimeter sweep?
charlie_pace Heyб shouldn't we cover them up?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, of course.
Flashback#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode14 - 32 days ago. At night, Paulo is on the beach digging through his carry-on bag that he found in the waterfall earlier. He opens and chews some nicotine gum before beginning to bury the Matryoshka doll in the sand.]
john_locke Nice night.
john_locke What you doing?
paulo Nothing.
john_locke It looks like you're digging a hole. Every man's entitled to his secrets Paulo, but can I give ya a piece of advice?
paulo Please, John.
john_locke You should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
paulo Why is that?
john_locke Things don't stay buried on this Island. The beach is eroding. Winter's coming, high tide. Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away. See you back at camp.
ben_linus Who left this open?
dr_juliet_burke Tom was down here a couple of days ago.
ben_linus Have him cover it up with the plane.
dr_juliet_burke That him? Shephard?
ben_linus Yes.
dr_juliet_burke He's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.
ben_linus No, I can convince him to do it.
dr_juliet_burke How?
ben_linus Same way I get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and I exploit it.
dr_juliet_burke So, what? We just grab all three of them, Ford and Austen too?
ben_linus No, they need to come to us.
dr_juliet_burke And how do we make that happen?
ben_linus Michael, of course.
dr_juliet_burke Are we done here? This place gives me the creeps.
dr_juliet_burke Hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to Nikki and Paulo?
desmond_hume Aye. Tragic.
dr_juliet_burke So, do you know anything?
desmond_hume How do you mean?
dr_juliet_burke Can you, you know, use your psychic powers?
desmond_hume Doesn't work like that. I only see flashes.
dr_juliet_burke No offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway.
desmond_hume I do know that she was with your mate this morning.
dr_juliet_burke My mate?
desmond_hume I saw her with your boy Sawyer. The dead girl, Nikki.
dr_juliet_burke He said he didn't know her.
desmond_hume Then why was she yelling at him?
dr_juliet_burke Yelling?
desmond_hume Aye.
dr_juliet_burke At Sawyer, this morning?
desmond_hume Right before she died.
dr_juliet_burke Vincent! Dude!
charlie_pace So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting. That doesn't prove anything.
dr_juliet_burke Look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is Sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with Nikki.
sunhwa_kwon Sawyer's not a murderer. He went all the way across the Island to help Michael. It is the Others, I know what they can do.
dr_juliet_burke OK, you know what, I'll go get Desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw.
charlie_pace Sun. It was me.
sunhwa_kwon What?
charlie_pace It was me who took you, not the Others. I wasn't myself. After Locke hit me. After he humiliated me. Sawyer told me I could get even by helping him steal the guns, we just made it look like, the Others. I didn't mean to hurt you.
charlie_pace Sorry.
john_locke Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station, there's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody wanna come along?
nikki_fernandez I'll go.
john_locke Great.
paulo What?
john_locke Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes, and bring water.
paulo You're not serious.
nikki_fernandez What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
nikki_fernandez Hey guys. What are these other TVs for?
john_locke Sorry?
nikki_fernandez All these TVs. This guy says that there's six stations,
paulo The toilet still works.
dr_juliet_burke Give me the gun.
james_ford The hell you talking about?
dr_juliet_burke Give it to me.
james_ford Ain't even loaded.
dr_juliet_burke Then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning.
james_ford Oh I see what this is. Villagers have got themselves some torches.
dr_juliet_burke Did you kill them?
james_ford No. No, I didn't kill them. Yeah, me and Nikki went at it this morning. Cause she wanted a gun.
dr_juliet_burke Why didn't you tell us this before?
james_ford Cause of the dirt under her nails.
dr_juliet_burke What?
james_ford She was digging. And when we found him I saw a fresh mound of dirt. She was burying something. And if you take the time to dig a hole right before you die, then what you're hiding's probably pretty damn good.
sunhwa_kwon So what was it? What did she hide?
james_ford Go ahead, take 'em. Cause whatever happened to those two, I had nothing to do with it.
nikki_fernandez Did you know Thanksgiving was two weeks ago?
nikki_fernandez We missed it, Paulo, just like we're gonna miss everything.
paulo They're going to find us. We'll get rescued. You'll see.
nikki_fernandez OK, where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?
paulo I dunno, I guess, it's how we look at things. Like the bag. I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.
nikki_fernandez How do you figure that?
paulo Look what it did. It might have torn us apart.
nikki_fernandez Yeah.
paulo Wait here. I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
nikki_fernandez OK.
nikki_fernandez OK, I know you have them. Give me a gun.
james_ford I don't have the guns. A-team took 'em all.
nikki_fernandez Right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.
james_ford Even if I had a gun I wouldn't give it to you. Judging by the fire you're breathing, I got a feeling no good would come of it.
nikki_fernandez Sawyer, give me a gun.
james_ford I got a better idea, sister. How about you go stick your head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
nikki_fernandez Thanks for nothing.
james_ford And who the hell are you?!
james_ford Thanks for nothing.
sunhwa_kwon Charlie told me it was your idea. To kidnap me.
james_ford You gonna tell Jin?
sunhwa_kwon No.
james_ford Why not?
sunhwa_kwon Because then we'd have to dig another grave.
james_ford Why are you giving me these?
sunhwa_kwon Because they're worthless here.
james_ford See, and I thought I was going to get out of this without a —
dr_juliet_burke Nikki and Paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But I know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved Exposé. OK then, goodbye—
james_ford Wait.
james_ford Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.
paulo Come on. You can just tell me.
nikki_fernandez Na-uh, it's a surprise. We're almost there. OK, ready?
paulo Yeah.
nikki_fernandez I found the diamonds, Paulo.
paulo What? Where?
nikki_fernandez Right here.
nikki_fernandez Give 'em to me.
paulo What're you talking about?
nikki_fernandez What am I talking about? What's this? Your nicotine gum. You wanted to stop looking for the bag cause you'd already found it. I know you have them, Paulo, so where are they?!
paulo Calm down, OK?
paulo What the hell's that?
paulo Are you out of your mind?
nikki_fernandez You remember Dr. Arzt's friend. Did it bite you? Does it hurt? He told me why they call it the Medusa Spider. Wanna know why?
paulo What did you do?
nikki_fernandez Because one look from Medusa will turn anyone to stone, just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you, for about eight hours. It won't kill you, it'll just slow your heart rate down to the point of where even a doctor would have a hard time—
nikki_fernandez —hearing it beat. You won't be able to move a muscle, so I'll be able to do, all sorts of nasty things to you. And since it bit you on your neck, I'd say paralysis will happen fast. I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you. Huh?
nikki_fernandez In a shoe, maybe?
nikki_fernandez I think I know where...
nikki_fernandez Son of a bitch.
paulo I'm sorry.
nikki_fernandez You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.
paulo I was... afraid... of losing you. If you found the diamonds, you wouldn't need me any more.
nikki_fernandez Ow, dammit! Oh no! No! No, no.
dr_juliet_burke Er, you OK?
dr_juliet_burke Hey, hey, what happened?
nikki_fernandez Para...lyzed.
