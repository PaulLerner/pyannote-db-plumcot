MAN He's coding!
MAN Gunshot wound. He's crashing!
DOCTOR Bay 7. Now!
PENNY Is he gonna be okay?
DOCTOR You're gonna have to wait here, ma'am.
PENNY Where are you--where are you taking him? What's happening?
DOCTOR Please, ma'am, wait here. We'll let you know as soon as we know anything.
PENNY Well, what's happening? Is he gonna be okay?
DOCTOR We're going to do everything we can. Please just wait.
CHARLIE HUME Daddy! 
PENNY He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay. 
MS. HAWKING How old is your son?
PENNY He's 2.
MS. HAWKING He has his father's hair.
PENNY I'm sorry. Do I know you?
MS. HAWKING Uh, no, but your husband does. I'm Eloise Hawking, and I believe it's my son's fault that Desmond has been shot.
PENNY Your son is Benjamin Linus?
MS. HAWKING Good lord, no. My son is Daniel Faraday.
FARADAY Hey, can I get a hand with this?
MILES Yeah, yeah.
MILES Dan.
FARADAY Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
DR. CHANG All right, ladies and gentlemen, you know why you're here. I wish you could all get a good night's sleep, but, uh...
MILES What the hell are you doing back here, Dan? Once you left for Ann Arbor, I figured you'd gotten rich, invented the DVD or something.
CHANG The shuttle will pick you up at the motor pool...
FARADAY This is what I'm doing back here. When did they get here?
MILES A few days ago. It's weird, huh? LaFleur managed to--
FARADAY We don't have time. I need you to take me to Jack's right now, okay?
FARADAY Jack. How did you get back here?
JACK Faraday? What the--
FARADAY How did you do it?
JACK Whoa.
FARADAY How did you get back to the Island?
JACK Where have you been?
FARADAY I was--I was just at DHARMA headquarters in Ann Arbor. I was doing some research. What's more important right now... how did you get back here to 1977?
JACK What's going on?
MILES Don't look at me. I just carried his luggage.
FARADAY Jack, how?
JACK Uh... we were on a plane, and then--
FARADAY Who told you to get on a plane?
JACK As a matter of fact, Dan, it was your mother.
FARADAY And how did she convince you, Jack? Did she tell you it was your destiny?
JACK Yeah. That's exactly what she said.
FARADAY Well, I got some bad news for you, Jack. You don't belong here at all. She was wrong.
BOY What's wrong, mom? Didn't you like it?
WOMAN I loved it. It was beautiful, Daniel.
ELOISE Daniel... do you know what destiny means?
DANIEL No.
ELOISE Destiny means that, if one has a special gift, then it must be nurtured.
ELOISE How many beats has that metronome counted since you started playing?
DANIEL 864.
ELOISE Your gift, Daniel, is your mind--a mind that is meant for science, mathematics. And it's my... job to keep you on your path. So... unfortunately, there's no more time...
ELOISE ...for distractions.
DANIEL But I want to keep playing the piano. I can do both. I can make time.
ELOISE If only you could.
FARADAY Miles, I need you to bring me to the Orchid. Can you drive me right now? Please?
MILES Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess.
FARADAY Thanks. Come on. Let's go.
JACK Faraday! Wait up!
FARADAY Miles, come on. Jack, we'll be right back.
JACK Hey, what did you mean, you mother was wrong? Daniel!
FARADAY I just--I just have an errand to run. Be right back!
SAWYER Yeah?
JACK Faraday's back.
SAWYER What do you mean Faraday's back? Why?
JACK I have no idea. He came in on the sub, and he woke me up. He--he started talking nonsense, and then he took off for the Orchid.
SAWYER I'd love to trade theories about this, but I'm a little busy right now.
JACK What are you busy with at 600 in the morning?
JULIET James, tell him.
SAWYER Get in here.
SAWYER Phil--one of my security guys--got himself a videotape of me and Kate taking the kid out to the Hostiles.
JACK And where's the tape?
SAWYER With Phil.
JACK And where is Phil?
SAWYER Phil, Jack. Jack... Phil.
MILES Are we... waiting for something?
FARADAY Right on time.
FARADAY I'll be back in ten minutes.
TONY So what do you want me to do?
DR. CHANG You're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen... then God help us all.
SEALS Hey! You need a hard hat down here.
DR. CHANG Watch yourself!
FARADAY Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.
MAN Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
TONY Did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
FARADAY Dr. Chang? Dr. Chang? Do you have a second, sir?
DR. CHANG I suppose.
FARADAY I just came in on the sub with the Swan team. We actually met three years ago, I'm Daniel Faraday.
DR. CHANG Yes. Yes. Uh, you arrived with LaFleur. I remember.
FARADAY Right.
DR. CHANG What can I do for you?
FARADAY I need you to order the evacuation of every man, woman and child on this Island.
DR. CHANG And why would I do that?
FARADAY A man is on a stretcher as a consequence of the electromagnetic activity that your drilling unleashed down here.
DR. CHANG Which is now contained.
FARADAY It's contained down here. But in about six hours, the same thing is gonna happen at the site for the Swan station, only the energy there is about 30,000 times more powerful, sir. And the accident... it's gonna be catastrophic.
DR. CHANG That is utterly absurd. What could possibly qualify you to make that kind of prediction? Hmm?
FARADAY I'm from the future.
FARADAY Dr. Chang, wait! Will you wait one second, please? Wait one--one second.
DR. CHANG Yes, yes, you're from the future. You heard me talking about time travel. Now you've had your fun. Good for you.
FARADAY No, no. Please, Dr. Chang. Just look at my journal, please. Look at these equations. Some of them won't be discovered for another 20 years. Dr. Chang--
MILES Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, Dan! Leave the man alone. Sorry, Dr. Chang. I think he had too many drugs on the sub--
FARADAY Dr. Chang... Miles is your son.
DR. CHANG Excuse me?
FARADAY Think about it. A Chinese man named Miles--the same name as your baby--shows up with me from the future. You--you really think this is all coincidence?
DR. CHANG Is this true?
MILES No.
DR. CHANG Please... stay away from me.
FARADAY Dr. Chang...
FARADAY Dr. Chang! If you--
MILES Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?
FARADAY I'm just making sure that your father does what he's supposed to do.
MILES And what's that?
FARADAY You'll see.
FARADAY Hi, Mom. I want you to meet Theresa.
THERESA Dan's told me so much about--
MS. HAWKING Pleased to meet you. Well done, Daniel. Ah...
THERESA You must be so proud of him.
MS. HAWKING Daniel, I thought we could celebrate your accomplishment with lunch. There's a nice restaurant nearby. I reserved us a table.
FARADAY We would love to. 
MS. HAWKING Actually, I was hoping it would be just the two of us.  You do understand, don't you? It's just that I don't get to see my son very often.
FARADAY Mother...
THERESA I understand. It's okay, Dan. Really.
MS. HAWKING Is there something bothering you, Daniel?
FARADAY You were so rude to Theresa.
MS. HAWKING was I?
FARADAY Theresa is my girlfriend.
MS. HAWKING She is your research assistant. You should be focusing your energies on your work.
FARADAY On my work.
MS. HAWKING Yes. That is what is important.
FARADAY Yes. You've made it abundantly clear. Why would I waste my gift on a woman--
MS. HAWKING I'm sorry to tell you, Daniel, but you're not going to have time for relationships. The women in your life will only be terribly hurt.
FARADAY What does that mean?
MS. HAWKING It means that your work will always comes first, that's all.
FARADAY Only because that's what you always push me to do. You pushed and you pushed and you pushed. And when will it be enough, Mother? When? I'm the youngest doctor to ever graduate from Oxford. I just got a new 1.5 million pound research grant. What else do I have to do?
MS. HAWKING A grant? That's wonderful! From whom?
FARADAY I don't know. Um... some industrialist. Widmore, I think. Charles Widmore.
MS. HAWKING I don't want to fight with you, Daniel. That's not why I came.
FARADAY Why did you come?
MS. HAWKING To congratulate you. Good luck, Daniel. And I do hope you know that I mean that.
SAWYER All right, people. Party's over. I know y'all just showed up. The rest of us have been here for the past three years. This is our home. The last thing I wanna do is leave. But we ain't got no choice.
HURLEY Well, that dude in the closet--I thought he worked for you. Can't you convince him that it was all, like, a misunderstanding?
SAWYER I punched the man in the damn face, Hugo. What am I supposed to say--"My fist slipped"?
KATE How much time do we have before someone realizes he's gone?
SAWYER Not enough.
JULIET So where do we go?
SAWYER We only got two options. We can either commandeer the sub, get the hell off this Island before anyone knows we're gone, or we can head back in the jungle, start from square one.
JIN I'm not getting on that sub if there's a chance that my wife is still on this Island.
HURLEY Yeah, me neither. After all we did to get back here? And now we're just gonna run off again? It'd be kinda wishy-washy.
SAWYER Right. That's two votes for square one. Anybody else wanna--
SAWYER Hold your horses. Be right there.
FARADAY Hey, James.
SAWYER Welcome to the meeting, Twitchy. Good to see you again. Pound cake's in the kitchen. Help yourself to the punch.  Is he still crazy?
MILES It's on a whole new level, man.
SAWYER Great.
FARADAY Jack, I'm sorry I was rude before, but what I came to do is of critical importance to everyone in this room. Does anyone know where I can find the Hostiles?
JULIET Why do you need to know that, Daniel?
FARADAY Because one of them is my mother. And she is the only person on this island who can get us back to where we belong.
NEWSCASTER This haunting footage comes to us from the Christiane I, a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean.
CAROLINE How do you want your eggs, Dan?
NEWSCASTER For more than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the Sunda Trench off Bali...
CAROLINE So what happened? They found that missing plane?
NEWSCASTER ...in search of the long-missing Oceanic Flight 815.
CAROLINE Dan?
NEWSCASTER Late last night, the Christiane deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs...
CAROLINE Dan...? Dan, why are you so upset?
NEWSCASTER ...that verified what the national transportation safety board had long feared...
FARADAY I don't know.
NEWSCASTER ...that the commercial aircraft...
NEWSCASTER ...on September 22nd, 2004...
CAROLINE You have a visitor, Dan.
CAROLINE Would you like some tea?
WIDMORE That would be lovely. Hello, Daniel.
FARADAY I'm sorry, sir. I don't... D--did Caroline tell you I have a condition that affects my memory?
WIDMORE Just... don't be embarrassed. We've never met. My name is Charles Widmore.
FARADAY Charles... Charles Widmore from... my research grant?  It's very nice to meet you, sir. Please, sit down. Um...
FARADAY Mm, a bit of a mess. I meant to thank you before I... before I left Oxford.
WIDMORE You mean, before you were dismissed.
FARADAY I tested it... I tested it out on myself first.
WIDMORE It's all right, Daniel.
FARADAY I would never hurt Theresa.
WIDMORE Please, it's all right. That's not why I'm here. I came to offer you a new opportunity.
FARADAY N--no, I... I'm sorry. I--I can't. I don't think I--I can... 
WIDMORE Did I say something to upset you?
FARADAY It's this plane crash. I don't know why it's bothering me so much.  it's just so sad. They're dead.
WIDMORE Daniel, what if I told you... they're not dead? What if I told you the plane was a fake? An elaborate... expensive fake.
FARADAY How would you know that?
WIDMORE Because I put it there.
FARADAY Well... why would you tell me that?
WIDMORE Because come tomorrow, you won't remember I did. Daniel, the real Oceanic Flight 815 crashed on an island--a special island with unique scientific properties. I want to send you to the Island. It will further your research, show you things you'd never dream of. But more importantly, it will heal you, Daniel--your mind, your memory.
FARADAY H--heal me? W--why are you doing all this for me?
WIDMORE Because you're a man of tremendous gifts, and it would be a shame to see them go to waste.
FARADAY You sound like my mother.
WIDMORE That's because we're old friends.
SAWYER Your mother is an Other?
FARADAY You met her, actually, when the Island was skipping, back in 1954. They were calling her "Ellie".
HURLEY You guys were in 1954? Like... Fonzie times?
JULIET You still haven't told us why you need to find her.
FARADAY I just need to talk to her.
SAWYER I thought you said we were supposed to lay low. "Whatever happened, happened"?
FARADAY Just tell me where they are, and I'll go--
SAWYER I'm not telling you anything, and you ain't going anywhere unless you wanna share with us what the hell it is you're doing.
JACK Sawyer, he said he can get us back to where we belonged. Whether we go on the sub or we head back into the jungle... we don't belong here.
SAWYER Well, I belonged here just fine till you came back, Doc.
JACK You know where the Hostiles are.
KATE What?
JACK You and Sawyer took Ben out to them. Can you get us back out there?
SAWYER Whoa, hold on a second. Don't say a word, Kate.
JACK She can say what she wants to say. Kate... You made me promise to never ask what happened to Aaron, or why you came back here. But I know that reason isn't... it isn't here.  It's not now.
SAWYER Whatever her reason is, helping H.G. Wells here talk to his mommy ain't got nothing to do with it. Come with us, Freckles.
JULIET The code for the fence is 1-4-1-7-1-7. You should take Daniel. It's over here for us anyway.
KATE Okay. Let's go.
DANIEL Great. Great. Thank you. Hey, Miles, can you drive us?
SAWYER When you realize you've made a huge mistake... we'll be back at the beach, right where we started.
SAWYER All right, the rest of us--pack anything you can carry, meet back here in 20 minutes.
SAWYER Time to go.
KATE These people are not gonna be happy to see us. It might be a good idea to bring some guns. There's a gun safe in the motor pool, but it's locked.
JACK Good thing I'm a janitor then.
KATE Hey, Dan?
FARADAY I'll meet you at the motor pool. I need just a minute. Okay?
CHARLOTTE I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner.
FARADAY It's okay, sweetheart. I won't tell.
CHARLOTTE My name's Charlotte. What's yours?
FARADAY I'm Daniel. I'm new here. Listen. Do you know Dr. Chang?
CHARLOTTE Uh-huh.
FARADAY Yeah? Hopefully really soon, Dr. Chang is gonna ask a bunch of people to get on the submarine and leave the Island.  When he does, you and your mommy... you're gonna have to leave. In case what I do doesn't work, you cannot be here. You have to leave.  I tried to avoid telling you this. I didn't think I could change things. But maybe I can.
FARADAY Hey, how long will it take us to get up there?
KATE Uh, it depends. We can take the road until we hit the pylons, but then once we're in their territory, we gotta go on foot.
FARADAY Okay. Uh, do you have something for a beginner?
JACK Let's go.
KATE That's ready to go.
RADZINSKY What's going on here? Aren't you one of the physicists off the sub?
FARADAY Yeah, that's right. Uh, we were just making sure that--
RADZINSKY You're supposed to be out at the Swan site.
FARADAY Right. Uh, there was--there was an accident at the Orchid station. Dr. Chang asked us to help.
RADZINSKY He's got a gun.
RADZINSKY I just left Dr. Chang. He's at home with his wife and baby. You're lying. Now drop the guns and get down on the ground!
FARADAY Hey. Listen to me. Listen. You really do not understand what's happening here. You have no idea. We have no time. We have to leave. All right? So we're just gonna leave. Okay? Nobody's--no...
FARADAY Aah!
RADZINSKY Aah!
KATE Are you okay?
KATE I think we can make it to the Jeep.
JACK All right. I'll cover you. Dan? You go, too, all right? Go, go, go!
RADZINSKY Sound the alarm!
MS. HAWKING Hello, Daniel.
FARADAY Mother.
FARADAY When did you get here?
MS. HAWKING Oh, I just arrived. I would have called you, but...
FARADAY I would have forgotten anyway.
MS. HAWKING I hear you have been offered a job.
FARADAY How do you know that?
MS. HAWKING Well, it's my business to know. I came here, Daniel, to tell you that it is very important that you say yes to Mr. Widmore... that you accept this opportunity.
FARADAY I can't. He needs someone who can do really, really complex space-time calibrations and calculate bearings, and I just... I don't know how to do that anymore.
MS. HAWKING Daniel...
FARADAY Mm.
MS. HAWKING This place he mentioned to you, this island--did he tell you that it could make you better? What if it's true? Why, then you could go on with your work. Just think of all you could accomplish.
FARADAY You really want me to... to go?
MS. HAWKING Yes.
FARADAY Will... will it make you proud of me?
MS. HAWKING Yes, Daniel. It will.
FARADAY Then I'll do it.
JACK You remember the code?
KATE Yeah, I got it.
JACK All right, I'm gonna take a look at that.
JACK Yeah, good. It's just a graze.
FARADAY Whew.
JACK This is gonna sting.
FARADAY Yeah.
FARADAY Ah.
JACK Yeah, you're gonna be fine.
FARADAY I guess I'm lucky.
JACK What's luck have to do with it? I thought you said "Whatever happened, happened"?
FARADAY You gotta understand, Jack, this is our present. When we met, did I have a scar on my neck? No. 'Cause I hadn't been shot yet. We can't be so naive as to think nothing can happen to us. Any one of us can die, Jack.
KATE Okay. It's off.
FARADAY Thanks.
FARADAY Which way?
KATE Just a couple miles in.
KATE Do you think he knows what he's doing?
JACK I sure hope so. There's no turning back now.
SAWYER You called it the minute those Yahoos got here. I shoulda listened to you. You can say, "I told you so."
JULIET Maybe after we get to the beach.
SAWYER Hey.  You still got my back?
JULIET You still got mine?
HURLEY That's not good, right?
JIN 
RADZINSKY LaFleur! Where have you been?
SAWYER Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, Stu. What the hell's going on?
RADZINSKY I just got shot by a physicist, and the new recruits are helping him. We've been infiltrated.
SAWYER That's ridiculous. Now just calm down for a minute. We can talk about this.
RADZINSKY What was that?
SAWYER It sounded like it was from outside.
RADZINSKY Get down on the ground now.
RADZINSKY I said now!
KATE Thank you.
JACK You need a gun to go talk to your mother, Dan?
FARADAY You don't know my mother, Jack.
JACK You ready to tell me why she was wrong? Why we don't belong here?
FARADAY In about four hours, the DHARMA folks at the swan work site--they're gonna--gonna drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy. The result of the release of this energy would be catastrophic. So in order to contain it, they're gonna have to cement the entire area in, like Chernobyl. And this containment--the place they built over it--I believe you called it "the Hatch." The Swan hatch? Because of this one accident, these people are gonna spend the next 20 years keeping that energy at bay... by pressing a button... a button that your friend Desmond will one day fail to push, and that will cause your plane--Oceanic 815--to crash on this Island. And because your plane crashed, a freighter will be sent to this Island--a freighter I was on and Charlotte was on and so forth. This entire chain of events--it's gonna start happening this afternoon. But... we can change that. I studied relativistic physics my entire life. One thing emerged over and over--can't change the past. Can't do it. Whatever happened, happened. All right? But then I finally realized... I had been spending so much time focused on the constants, I forgot about the variables. Do you know what the variables in these equations are, Jack?
JACK No.
FARADAY Us. We're the variables. People. We think. We reason. We make choices. We have free will. We can change our destiny. I think I can negate that energy under the Swan. I think I can destroy it. If I can, then that hatch will never be built, and your plane... your plane will land, just like it's supposed to, in Los Angeles.
KATE And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?
FARADAY I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.
WOMAN Satellite pharmacy...
PENNY Daniel Faraday? Your son is Daniel Faraday?
MS. HAWKING Yes.
PENNY That's the man who sent Desmond to Los Angeles to find you.
MS. HAWKING That's right. I came, Penelope, to apologize. Your husband has become a casualty in a conflict that's bigger than him, that's bigger than any of us.
PENNY What do you mean? Is Des gonna be okay?
MS. HAWKING I don't know. For the first time in a long time, I don't know what's going to happen next.
NURSE Ms. Hume?
PENNY Yes?
NURSE Your husband's in the recovery room, and he's asking for you.
PENNY The recovery room? Is he--
NURSE He's doing fine. Come with me. This nurse will watch your son.
PENNY Hi.
DESMOND Hi.
PENNY I thought I'd lost you.
DESMOND I promised you, Penny. I promised you... I'd never leave you again.
WIDMORE Is he all right?
MS. HAWKING Yes, Charles. He's fine.
WIDMORE Good.
MS. HAWKING Your daughter's in there. Why don't you go in and say hello?
WIDMORE Unfortunately, Eloise, my relationship with Penelope is one of the things I had to sacrifice.
MS. HAWKING Sacrifice? Don't you talk to me about sacrifice, Charles. I had to send my son back to the Island, knowing full well that--
WIDMORE He was my son, too, Eloise.
KATE This is a mistake. He's talking about erasing everything that's ever happened to us, Jack. It's insane.
JACK We disappeared off a plane in mid-air and ended up in 1977. I'm getting kinda used to insane.
OTHER MAN Well, that should be enough.
OTHER WOMAN I think we need more water.
FARADAY Wish me luck.
JACK Wait. Hey.
KATE No, let him go. Let him go.
FARADAY Back up. Step away. It's okay. Nobody move. I only want to speak to Eloise. Where is Eloise? Come on. Where is she?
RICHARD I'm sorry, but Elo--
RICHARD She's not here right now. Do we know each other?
FARADAY It doesn't matter. I need you to take me to Eloise.
RICHARD I--I already told you she's not here. Let's just take it easy.
FARADAY Where's the bomb, Richard? The hydrogen bomb that I told you people to bury--where is it?
RICHARD Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk. Okay? Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.
FARADAY I'm gonna give you three seconds. One...
RICHARD Don't do this.
FARADAY Two...
RICHARD Why did you do that?
ELOISE He had a gun on you.
RICHARD He wasn't gonna shoot me, Eloise.
FARADAY Eloise.  You knew. You always knew.  You knew this was gonna happen. You sent me here anyway.
ELOISE Who are you?
FARADAY I... I'm your son.
