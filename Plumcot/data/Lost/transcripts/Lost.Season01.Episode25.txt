dr_jack_shephard Throw it in -- now, Kate!

sunhwa_kwon They will bring him back.
claire_littleton Don't say that.
sunhwa_kwon They will.
claire_littleton How do you know that?
sunhwa_kwon Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back.
charlie_pace There!
sayid_jarrah Charlie, wait.
sayid_jarrah Charlie! See, let me see.
charlie_pace It's bleeding.
sayid_jarrah We need to put pressure on it.
charlie_pace Okay. Ow.
sayid_jarrah There.
charlie_pace Ow. Animal, what is she...
sayid_jarrah Keep the pressure on, like this.
charlie_pace Ow! Ow! Ow!
sayid_jarrah She's been here for 16 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. It's too deep. It's bleeding too much. You're going to have to go back.
charlie_pace No, I'm not going back! You're going to have to fix it.
sayid_jarrah I'm not a doctor.
charlie_pace You're a soldier! What do people do when you get wounded?! I'm not going back without that baby, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Don't move.
charlie_pace Gunpowder?
sayid_jarrah Remove the towel and tilt your head back. Remove the towel.
charlie_pace This is because I hit you, isn't it?
sayid_jarrah This is not going to be pleasant. You ready?
charlie_pace Yeah.
sayid_jarrah 1-2-3.
hugo_reyes Oh, man.
hugo_reyes I need my car. 20 minutes? Look, I can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday is tomorrow.
charlie_pace Some of us have a bloody flight to make!
hugo_reyes Excuse me, coming through. Excuse me.
hugo_reyes No, no, no!
hugo_reyes Excuse me, coming through, excuse me, excuse me. Look out, excuse me.
hugo_reyes Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. Or, today -- I don't know. I don't really get the whole time change thing, but I've got to make that flight.
ticket_agent AGENT I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You're confirmed for seat 20G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.
hugo_reyes What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.
ticket_agent AGENT Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?
hugo_reyes Fine, whatever. I'll buy the one next to it.
ticket_agent AGENT Alrighty. Here are two together.
hugo_reyes Book it.
ticket_agent AGENT Uh-oh.
hugo_reyes Uh-oh, what uh-oh?
ticket_agent AGENT It appears that your flight is already boarding in the Oceanic international terminal. Well, this is the domestic terminal. I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.
hugo_reyes Excuse me, sorry. Sorry, this is an emergency. I've got to cut through. Excuse me, dude. Dude?
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
hugo_reyes You've got to let me in. No, you don't understand...
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
hugo_reyes This is...
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
security_agent AGENT Next.
dr_leslie_arzt Now? You're taking the computer out now?
hugo_reyes Hey, old guy! I'll give you 500 bucks to borrow your scooter.
old_scooter_man SCOOTER MAN I just had a hip replacement. I need this thing.
hugo_reyes Okay, 1600 bucks.
hugo_reyes Hey, hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! I've got to get on this flight!
gate_attendant AGENT Sir, the jetway's closed.
hugo_reyes Please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane.
gate_attendant AGENT Alright, one second. Hunter, this is Jenna, we've got one more... ta. This is your lucky day.
hugo_reyes 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16...
kate_austen You say something?
hugo_reyes Nope.
kate_austen I thought I heard 23.
hugo_reyes Does that mean something to you?
kate_austen What?
hugo_reyes That number? 23?
kate_austen The guy who called the Feds on me, back in Australia, did it for a 23,000 dollar reward. Mean something to you?
hugo_reyes Nah, it's just a number. We better catch up -- can barely see them.
john_locke We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard If we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there, John?
john_locke What was what about?
dr_jack_shephard You asked me to let you go.
john_locke That's right.
dr_jack_shephard That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go.
john_locke It wasn't going to hurt me.
dr_jack_shephard No, John, it was going to kill you.
john_locke I seriously doubt that.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John. I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
john_locke I believe that I was being tested.
dr_jack_shephard Tested?
john_locke Yeah, tested. I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, and what does that make you?
john_locke Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
dr_jack_shephard Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
john_locke The Island. The Island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the Island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
dr_jack_shephard Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
john_locke Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
dr_jack_shephard And where does that path end, John?
john_locke The path ends at the Hatch. The Hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive.
john_locke Survival is all relative, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I don't believe in destiny.
john_locke Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
michael_dawson I turned it on a little while ago.
james_ford Sayid said every hour.
michael_dawson Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks. If that battery runs out...
james_ford The man said every hour.
james_ford Nothing.
michael_dawson 5 minutes, no more.
james_ford Aye, aye. You know what I like about you, Mike? You've got the patience of a saint.
michael_dawson Yeah? Why do you say that?
james_ford I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago.
michael_dawson You would, huh?
james_ford A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.
michael_dawson Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?
james_ford My daddy never got a chance to beat me. He shot himself when I was 8.
michael_dawson Is that why you want to die, man?
james_ford What?
michael_dawson Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out. Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else? The way I see it, there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die.
james_ford Well, I ain't no hero, Mike.
james_ford Is that what I think it is?
michael_dawson Something's out there.
gate_attendant AGENT I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers -- well, no one seems to know where it is right now. And unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.
john_locke There's not another flight until tomorrow.
gate_attendant AGENT Yes, I'm aware of that, sir, but there's nothing I can...
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 Look, I can get Michelle, we can carry him on. Would you mind if we carry you on?
john_locke No, that'll be fine.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 Here we go. Here's your seat.
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 I'll get your bag, sir.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 If you need anything just press the call button.
john_locke Okay. Thank you.
john_locke Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.
hugo_reyes Me? Oh, okay. Got it.
dr_jack_shephard Be careful.
hugo_reyes Can I have the flashlight? Because, uh, the torch with the dynamite thing, not making a whole lot of sense to me.
john_locke Kate, you run the fuse, Jack and I will rig the charges.
kate_austen Okay.
charlie_pace What the hell is that?
sayid_jarrah There's no footprints, no tracks.
charlie_pace This is it? This is the black smoke? Where are they?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
charlie_pace She's here.
sayid_jarrah Danielle!
charlie_pace You come out, right now!
sayid_jarrah Calm down.
sayid_jarrah Danielle! I can hear you, come out. Please, he needs his mother.
danielle_rousseau They were not here.
sayid_jarrah Danielle, you have to give us the baby.
danielle_rousseau I just wanted my Alex back. I thought if I gave them the baby...
sayid_jarrah It's okay. I know. It's okay.
charlie_pace I've got him. There never were any Others. You started the fires yourself!
danielle_rousseau No, I heard them whispering.
charlie_pace You're a nut job. You heard nothing!
danielle_rousseau I heard them say they were coming for the child. The Others said they were coming for the boy.
charlie_pace You're pathetic.
john_locke Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse.
dr_jack_shephard I'll do it.
kate_austen This is as far as it goes.
john_locke It's far enough. I'll light it. You take cover, there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley!
hugo_reyes Wait just a sec.
kate_austen So, what was that about back there?
dr_jack_shephard What was what about?
kate_austen Putting the dynamite in your pack.
dr_jack_shephard I made a judgment call.
kate_austen We drew straws.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us, Kate.
kate_austen You had no right to make that choice...
dr_jack_shephard Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me, Kate? That's your call. There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this, if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem. And I have to know that you've got my back.
kate_austen I've got your back.
john_locke Are we ready?
hugo_reyes Wait a sec, wait a sec.
hugo_reyes No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop, we can't do this! Stop! Wait! Stop we can't do this! Stop! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! We can't do this! We can't do this! Stop! Wait! You've got to stop it!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad! Stop! What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad! The Numbers are bad!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! Hurley stop!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! Hurley, you've got to get back!
james_ford It's closer. It's closer. Give me the damn flare gun.
michael_dawson Hold on a sec.
james_ford I'm telling you, it's closer. I'm telling you, look.
michael_dawson I know, okay. I've got one flare.
jinsoo_kwon 아무 것도 안 보여.
michael_dawson Okay, I know. You don't see anything. Okay.
james_ford What the hell are you expecting to see?! In case you haven't noticed, it's dark!
walt_lloyd What is it? Is it a ship?
michael_dawson We don't know, little man. We don't know.
jinsoo_kwon Starboard? Port?
michael_dawson Uh, Port. Port.
jinsoo_kwon 반대로 가는데?
michael_dawson Okay, what the hell am I supposed to do about it?
james_ford Hey, Han, you and Chewie want to slow down a second and talk to me here?! We have to fire the flare.
michael_dawson We don't know what it is. It could be anything -- a piece of floating junk. We don't even know if Sayid's radar works!!
james_ford Have you ever known that guy to fix something up that don't work?
walt_lloyd It's moving away.
james_ford Floating junk that knows how to steer, huh?
michael_dawson We're moving! It doesn't make-
james_ford Look, are you going to give me the damn gun, or am I going to have to take it?!
michael_dawson What are you going to do? Shoot me?
walt_lloyd It's almost gone. -- C'mon.
michael_dawson Please, god.
walt_lloyd It's coming back! It's coming back!
michael_dawson Are we glad to see you!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN What's going on?! What are you folks doing this far out here?!
michael_dawson We were, we were -- the plane crashed! We were on the Island for a month, man!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that?
michael_dawson We were on an Island -- oh, flight 815 -- hey, where are we?!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, it's a good thing we found you.
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah, we survived and there's a whole group of people on the...
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, ain't that something?
michael_dawson Yeah!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Only, the thing is, we're going to have to take the boy.
michael_dawson What? What'd you say?
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN The boy, we're going to have to take him.
michael_dawson Hey, what the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Just give us the boy.
michael_dawson I'm not giving you anybody.
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, alright then.
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad!
michael_dawson No!
walt_lloyd Help me!
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd Help me! Dad! Please!
michael_dawson Waaaaaaaaaaalt! Waaaahahahaaalt! No! Walt!
