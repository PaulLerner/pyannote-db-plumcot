sayid_jarrah Is there anything I can do for you? Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg -- he didn't want him using up the antibiotics. She said he knew what was happening to him -- that he was brave.
AIRPORT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode21 ANNOUNCEMENT Heathrow airport authority reminds traveling passengers that safety regulations require...
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Okay, Sayid, 18 hours in a holding cell should be enough. Let's get to it, shall we? I'm Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence, this is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS. We're here because you're going to do us a favor.
sayid_jarrah A favor?
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Last week 300 pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne. The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in Iraq. 300 pounds of C-4 - I want it back.
sayid_jarrah You're the CIA, plant a few bugs.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Oh, we have. But you're going to get inside for us.
sayid_jarrah I am Iraqi. I am not a terrorist.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE We didn't snatch you up because you are a terrorist, Sayid. We snatched you up because you know one.
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Essam Tasir, your roommate at Cairo University. He's a member of the cell.
sayid_jarrah And why should I care?
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT You'd be saving lives.
sayid_jarrah I repeat, why should I care?
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Because we know where she is. 7 years since you left Iraq -- 6 months here, 3 months there -- always moving. There's only two reasons a man would do that, Sayid. Either he's running away from something, or looking for something. Noor Abed-Jazeem.
sayid_jarrah Nobody calls her Noor.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE You want to know where she is? Then we're going to Sydney.
dr_jack_shephard Kate? What are you doing out here?
kate_austen Looking for you.
dr_jack_shephard Well, you found me.
kate_austen You're walking in circles. You need to come back.
dr_jack_shephard Not without Locke.
kate_austen You haven't slept. You gave Boone your own blood.
dr_jack_shephard Locke lied.
kate_austen Well, now you're-
dr_jack_shephard He lied, Kate. Boone did not fall off any cliff. His leg was crushed, and I based my medical treatment on his lie.
kate_austen People are scared and upset. They don't know what's going on. We need you to come back, Jack. Please.
dr_jack_shephard Shannon? Do you want to say something?
shannon_rutherford No.
sayid_jarrah I didn't know Boone very well, and for that I am sorry. On our 6th day here a woman named Joanna died. She drowned. And Boone was the first one into the water. I didn't know him, but I remember his courage. And I know he will be missed.
john_locke It was my fault. We found a plane, a Beechcraft, in the jungle. It was lodged in the canopy so -- I would have gone up, but I -- my leg was hurt so he -- there was a radio inside and he thought he could -- look, his weight must have made the plane shift and it fell -- and -- it happened because he was trying to help us. He was a hero.
dr_jack_shephard Where were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you, you son of a bitch?! What did you do to him?!
charlie_pace Hey, wait, wait, Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Where were you?! You left him to die! You lied to me! Where were you?!
charlie_pace Jack, okay, it's okay.
dr_jack_shephard Where were you?! Where were you?!
kate_austen Jack! Jack, what's the matter? Are you okay? Are you okay?
james_ford Get some water!
charlie_pace Breathe. He's okay. Just breathe, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard He's lying.
sayid_jarrah You're suffering from fatigue.
dr_jack_shephard Locke told Boone not to tell.
sayid_jarrah Tell about what?
dr_jack_shephard Something about a hatch. Locke's hiding something.
sayid_jarrah Jack, lis-
dr_jack_shephard Look, the man is hiding something.
sayid_jarrah Jack, listen to me. What we need is for the one doctor on this Island to get some sleep.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. I don't need it.
kate_austen Jack.
sunhwa_kwon You need some rest. C'mon.
essam_tasir Sayid! Sayid, it is you.
sayid_jarrah Essam.
essam_tasir I see you haven't forgotten me.
sayid_jarrah Hardly.
essam_tasir What are you doing in Sydney?
sayid_jarrah I've been traveling, and you?
essam_tasir I live here -- almost a year now -- I'm a tree-cutter. I cut trees.
sayid_jarrah It sounds like good, honest work.
essam_tasir So much for my philosophy degree, huh?
sayid_jarrah Whatever puts food on your table. How is Zahra?
essam_tasir She died -- stray bomb while she was shopping for a dress.
sayid_jarrah I'm so sorry.
essam_tasir Listen, listen, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Why don't you come over?
sayid_jarrah I'd love to.
yusef Damn it. I'm out of ammo.
haddad Use the crowbar.
yusef That only works on the zombies, not the big bugs.
haddad Indeed.
sayid_jarrah The 3 of you live here?
essam_tasir Sydney's very expensive. This is the best we can afford.
haddad And what is it you do, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah At the moment I'm at liberty.
essam_tasir He's on holiday. You'll love the beaches here. There's something to be said for Australian women.
sayid_jarrah I've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years. The last beach I was at was Sharm-el Sheikh with you Essam -- remember, before our English exams? I hear the beaches here are very nice, especially the women. Perhaps we can go. So tell me exactly what kind of trees do you cut?
haddad Who are you?
sayid_jarrah I was a communications officer.
essam_tasir Sayid was Republican Guard. He knows things.
haddad Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the Mosque. Perhaps it is fate.
claire_littleton It's okay. Look, I'm fine, really, okay?
charlie_pace You need rest, Claire. Sun, tell her.
sunhwa_kwon In a hospital they would have you sleep. The nurses would take your baby.
claire_littleton Yeah, but I'm not in a hospital.
charlie_pace Well, all the more reason to take extra care, Claire. Look, it's okay, I can take care of turnip-head for a while.
claire_littleton Turnip-head?
charlie_pace It's just what I'm calling him until you give him a name because his head -- it's like a turnip.
claire_littleton What if he needs something, okay?
charlie_pace You'll be there for him -- after you sleep.
claire_littleton No, okay? No.
charlie_pace Claire, no one is going to take this baby away from you. No one.
claire_littleton You don't know that, okay. You can't say that.
charlie_pace I won't let anything happen.
claire_littleton Just be really careful, okay? Make sure if he gets hot that you take his blanket off -- his neck, okay, got his neck?
charlie_pace Got it.
john_locke This was his. I didn't go through it.
shannon_rutherford Thank you.
john_locke Welcome. Storm coming. I should have said no -- the first time he offered to hunt with me I should have said no.
shannon_rutherford He would have gone anyway.
john_locke Yeah, I suppose he would have. I know how confused and angry you must be right now. I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I know what it feels like when you lose family. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry.
shannon_rutherford You asked if you could do anything for me.
sayid_jarrah Anything.
shannon_rutherford John Locke killed my brother. Will you do something about that?
kate_austen Little more.
dr_jack_shephard No.
kate_austen You need to get your blood sugar level up.
dr_jack_shephard Look, enough already. I've rested.
kate_austen Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine.
kate_austen Where are you going?
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to go talk to Locke.
kate_austen You need to lie down.
dr_jack_shephard No, I don't.
kate_austen I strongly advise it.
dr_jack_shephard Advise? Advice -- alright, what's going on now?
kate_austen Lie down, okay. I crushed up some sleeping pills -- put them in your juice.
dr_jack_shephard Why would you -- you drugged me?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, okay.
kate_austen Night.
sayid_jarrah How did you get that?
john_locke War wound.
sayid_jarrah Looks more like a surgical scar.
john_locke Like I said, war wound.
sayid_jarrah The plane's radio? Was Boone able to pick up a signal?
john_locke I was on the ground, all I could here was static.
sayid_jarrah But it was working?
john_locke Yeah, but I can't imagine it survived the fall.
sayid_jarrah Some of its parts might work in the transmitter I'm building for the raft. If you'd be willing to take me?
john_locke Of course.
sayid_jarrah How did you find this plane?
john_locke Luck.
sayid_jarrah You and Boone were hunting.
john_locke Was that a question?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
john_locke The boar got scarce a couple of weeks back. We weren't hunting, we were exploring.
sayid_jarrah So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees?
john_locke Yep.
sayid_jarrah At the funeral you said your leg was injured.
john_locke It was just a charlie-horse. A cramp.
sayid_jarrah I know what a charlie-horse is, John.
john_locke Back in Iraq you were an interrogator.
sayid_jarrah Is that a question?
john_locke Yeah.
sayid_jarrah A long time ago I was.
john_locke Well, you haven't lost your touch.
sayid_jarrah Why would I interrogate you, John?
john_locke Jack called me a liar in front of every man, woman and child I've come to know over the past month. Maybe there's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane out here at all.
sayid_jarrah I know when I'm being lied to. There's a plane.
john_locke Like I said, you haven't lost your touch.
sayid_jarrah You've lost your edge, old man.
essam_tasir I never had one when playing against you.
sayid_jarrah Were you always this slow?
essam_tasir C'mon, c'mon, let's keep playing.
sayid_jarrah You have to get out of that apartment -- practice more.
essam_tasir Haddad would like that -- more blending in with the community.
sayid_jarrah I think he's got his eye on a target.
essam_tasir What makes you say that?
sayid_jarrah For the last 2 weeks he's been asking me about explosives -- blast radius, transport.
essam_tasir Haddad's very thorough.
sayid_jarrah Do you know if he's gotten hold of any yet?
essam_tasir Explosives? I don't know. All I know is there's going to be an operation -- and there is going to be a martyr.
sayid_jarrah You?
essam_tasir Haddad told me this morning. C'mon let's keep playing. C'mon -- I'll wipe the floor with you.
sayid_jarrah Essam, what is it, huh? What is it?
essam_tasir I don't think I can do it.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE You're kidding me, right?
sayid_jarrah Listen to me, I can get Essam to turn himself in. He wants out.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Does he know where the C-4 is?
sayid_jarrah The other two are the ones you want. Essam's confused-
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Does he know where it is?
sayid_jarrah No.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE Then he's useless. These cells run top down. It's all need-to-know. The recruit's handed a bomb and target at the last possible moment. The only way to find that C-4 is to wait for Essam to walk out that door with a target to hit.
sayid_jarrah He's in over his head. He doesn't even know why he's doing it...
agent_alyssa_cole COLE That's why you're going to convince him to go through with it.
sayid_jarrah No. No, I will not.
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Excuse me?
sayid_jarrah I'm done. It's over.
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT No, no, you're not even close to being done, my friend.
sayid_jarrah What are you going to do? Arrest me?
agent_alyssa_cole COLE No, we'll arrest her. Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency. Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant, Sayid? So, if you want any chance of ever seeing her again you're going to go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up.
charlie_pace The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout, down came the rain and drowned the spider out...
hugo_reyes Dude, it's washed -- washed the spider out. Unless it's some kind of British version?
charlie_pace Oh, okay. Down came the rain and washed the spider -- oh, bollocks, shhhh, shhh, shhh.
hugo_reyes What's the matter, man?
charlie_pace Well, I can't get the bloody thing to stop crying.
hugo_reyes Maybe it's hungry?
charlie_pace Nope, Claire nursed him 5 times.
hugo_reyes Any deposits? You know, diaper-wise?
hugo_reyes Alright, it's time to break out the big guns. Dude, that's all I got.
sayid_jarrah Heroin.
john_locke The cargo hold's full of it. The best I can figure it -- they were smugglers.
sayid_jarrah The plane was perched in the canopy?
john_locke Right up there.
sayid_jarrah And Boone climbed up by himself because of your charlie-horse?
john_locke Yes, that's right.
sayid_jarrah Why did you lie?
john_locke I made a mistake.
sayid_jarrah I'm going to salvage what I can of the radio. If we leave now we should beat the storm back.
john_locke Why don't you trust me, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah For one thing, you've been carrying a gun you've told no one about.
john_locke We found one of the smugglers about a half a click West of here dressed as a priest -- Nigerian currency in his pockets, and this. Now you're armed and I'm not. Does that earn me any trust?
sayid_jarrah You gave this to me because I caught you concealing it. That earns you adaptability.
john_locke Okay, I'll tell you something you don't know.
sayid_jarrah Please do.
john_locke The first week after the crash there was a cave in. Jack was trapped. Do you remember that?
sayid_jarrah Of course.
john_locke You, Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to try and triangulate a signal.
sayid_jarrah Yes.
john_locke You were hit from behind -- knocked unconscious? When you woke up your transceiver, your equipment was destroyed. That was me.
sayid_jarrah This is one time you'd better not be telling the truth.
john_locke I did what was in everyone's best interest.
sayid_jarrah You ruined my chance to find the source.
john_locke The source of a distress call that kept saying they're dead, it killed them all, over and over? Is that a place you really want to lead people to?
sayid_jarrah Why wait all this time? Why not tell me then?
john_locke Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in reasonable debate, and nobody else would have. You were all so focused on getting off the Island that you weren't seeing things clearly. It's like what's happening now with the raft.
sayid_jarrah Did you burn the raft, John?
john_locke No, Sayid, I didn't.
sayid_jarrah What is the hatch?
john_locke The hatch?
sayid_jarrah Boone mentioned it before he died.
john_locke A hatch? Two hatches on a plane, Sayid, could be forward or aft.
essam_tasir I'm not sure if I can do this.
sayid_jarrah You would not be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear, Essam.
essam_tasir I'm not afraid to die. It's all the innocent lives -- all those people. The Imam preaches peace, Sayid. Every human life is sacred.
sayid_jarrah It's true, innocent lives will be lost -- in service of a greater good.
essam_tasir What if I'm doing this because I'm angry? What if I'm doing this because they killed her?
sayid_jarrah What if you are? Should we just accept what happened to Zahra? Do we just accept their deaths? Because if we do, it means that ultimately we can do nothing about them. I lost someone, too, Essam. I will never be whole again. There need to be consequences for those responsible. That's my duty. That is how I will honor her.
essam_tasir Haddad was right, it was fate that brought us back together. Sayid, will you do this with me?
sayid_jarrah I will.
sayid_jarrah How are you? Do you want to take a walk?
shannon_rutherford Sure.
sayid_jarrah I spoke to Locke.
shannon_rutherford What did he say?
sayid_jarrah He took me to the plane. I believe what happened was an accident.
shannon_rutherford Then why did he lie?
sayid_jarrah I have no idea. But I don't believe he meant to harm Boone.
shannon_rutherford So that's it?
sayid_jarrah I know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame.
shannon_rutherford You don't get it, do you?
sayid_jarrah Shannon.
shannon_rutherford Just forget about it, okay?
walt_lloyd How much weight can this hold?
michael_dawson I don't know. A lot. Enough.
jinsoo_kwon 그거... 조여줘요.
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah, tighter. Got it.
walt_lloyd What if it tips over?
michael_dawson It won't. That's why we made it this wide. There, that should do it. Right? Good?
jinsoo_kwon Good.
michael_dawson Alright.
walt_lloyd What if a shark attacks?
michael_dawson A shark's not getting anywhere near us, man.
walt_lloyd What if we die?
michael_dawson We are not going to die.
walt_lloyd Boone died.
charlie_pace Hey, Michael, do you know anything about babies? I can't get this little guy to be quiet.
michael_dawson Walk with him, he'll calm down.
charlie_pace Yeah, I tried that. Hey, Jin, have you seen Sun?
jinsoo_kwon 어?
charlie_pace Sun. I need some help with this baby.
jinsoo_kwon No.
charlie_pace Okay.
james_ford Hey, Chuckie, want to keep that kid quiet? Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard.
charlie_pace Oh, there you go. You happy now?
james_ford I was. If you're going to play nursemaid, at least do the damn job.
charlie_pace Hey, say something else. Just say something, say anything.
james_ford Okay, fine. I liked that thing a lot better inside than I like it outside.
james_ford What?
kate_austen Hey -- brought you something to eat.
dr_jack_shephard What's in it, chloroform?
kate_austen Soup.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks, but I think I'll -- Who was in here?
kate_austen I don't know, what's the matter...
dr_jack_shephard Was anybody in here?
kate_austen No, why are you...
dr_jack_shephard The key to the gun case, it's gone.
kate_austen Maybe it fell off this morning.
dr_jack_shephard It didn't fall off.
sayid_jarrah What's going on?
dr_jack_shephard Locke took the key -- he's after the guns.
kate_austen I haven't seen him all day, you don't know that...
dr_jack_shephard No, then who was it?
sayid_jarrah Jack, it wasn't Locke.
haddad Sayid, get in. It's time.
haddad Stay relaxed and focused; drive with the windows down -- the fresh air will keep you alert. You will need to wear these . If you run into any problems use this . You are heroes. Good luck.
sayid_jarrah Essam stop.
essam_tasir Don't be nervous, brother. We'll be okay.
sayid_jarrah I'm working with the CIA.
essam_tasir What?
sayid_jarrah I'm going to give you 10 minutes to get away before I call them.
essam_tasir You set me up?
sayid_jarrah Essam, just go.
essam_tasir Why would you do this to me?
sayid_jarrah You're wasting time.
essam_tasir You said we were going to do this together. You said you lost someone.
sayid_jarrah Her name is Nadia. We were separated years ago. They know where I can find her.
essam_tasir You used me to find a woman? You talked me into this.
sayid_jarrah Essam, don't.
essam_tasir You said it was for the greater good.
sayid_jarrah I'm begging you to go.
essam_tasir You said you were my brother. You were supposed to be my brother, my friend.
sayid_jarrah I am your friend.
essam_tasir A friend who told me to do this for Zahra just so you could find some woman that you love?!
essam_tasir Well, then, Sayid, I hope she makes you whole again.
sayid_jarrah Essam!
dr_jack_shephard Go! Go.
john_locke She doesn't believe me, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Shannon, Shannon, please listen to me.
shannon_rutherford He did it. I know it.
sayid_jarrah You're not thinking rationally. You've never fired a gun before.
sayid_jarrah Shannon, you don't want to do this.
shannon_rutherford Yes, I do!
sayid_jarrah If you do it, you can never take it back.
shannon_rutherford Stay back! What did you do to him?!
john_locke I told you it was an accident.
dr_jack_shephard Shannon.
shannon_rutherford Jack, you told me he was a liar!
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry.
shannon_rutherford Don't. Get away.
sayid_jarrah Shannon.
james_ford The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway. The 32 valve V-8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes all 400 horses and 350 pound feet rear-wheel torque.
charlie_pace Keep going. Keep going.
claire_littleton Charlie.
james_ford Beneath the hood the 4.4 liter power plant features a fully integrated super-charger made into a 6 speed transmission from the manual sequential shift feature.
charlie_pace Keep going.
james_ford This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of taste, comfort and economy.
kate_austen She just needs time. She's been through a lot.
sayid_jarrah Time won't make a difference. Perhaps I made a mistake.
kate_austen You couldn't let her kill Locke. You had no choice.
sayid_jarrah There's always a choice.
agent_alyssa_cole COLE She lives in Irvine, California, just south of Los Angeles -- works as a lab-tech at a medical testing company -- plane ticket, walking around money, you're on an Oceanic flight to LA. It leaves in two hours.
sayid_jarrah What happens to his body?
agent_alyssa_cole COLE He was a terrorist so he's not exactly getting a state funeral.
sayid_jarrah What happens to his body?
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT After it's released; he'll be cremated.
sayid_jarrah A Muslim man is supposed to be buried.
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Yeah, well, there's no one to claim the body.
sayid_jarrah I'll claim him.
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT You can't claim him when you're on a plane in 2 hours, mate.
sayid_jarrah Then change my flight to tomorrow.
sayid_jarrah How's your head?
john_locke It'll heal.
sayid_jarrah Another war wound.
john_locke I know what it cost you to do what you did. Thank you.
sayid_jarrah I did it because I sense you might be our best hope of surviving here. But I don't forgive what you did. And I certainly don't trust you. And now, you're going to take me to the hatch.
john_locke Hatch? -- I already showed you the...
sayid_jarrah John, no more lies.
