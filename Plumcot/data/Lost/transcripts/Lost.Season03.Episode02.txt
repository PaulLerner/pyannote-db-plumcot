woojung_paik PAIK 이거 네가 그랬어? 선화야. 이 발레리나 네가 깨뜨린 거니? 그럼 누가 깨뜨렸어? Did you do this? Sun -- did you break the ballerina? Then who did?
young_sun SUN 일하는 아줌마.
woojung_paik PAIK 네 말 대로 아줌마가 그랬다면 당장 조치를 취해야겠지. 내 말 알아듣겠니? 선, 누가 깨뜨렸지?
young_sun SUN 일하는 아줌마가 그랬어요.
woojung_paik PAIK 알았다.
jinsoo_kwon 문 열어봐.
sunhwa_kwon 괜찮아요, 그냥 입덧하는 거예요.
sunhwa_kwon 진수씨!
jinsoo_kwon 우리 가야해. 지금 당장! 사이드한테 얘기해.
sunhwa_kwon My husband says it's time to leave.
jinsoo_kwon 그들은 오지 않을거야.
sunhwa_kwon He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming. It's been over a day since we lit the fire. They should be here by now.
sayid_jarrah Jack knows we're out here. He's counting on our signal. Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke. If he's North of us, the mountains would block his view.
sunhwa_kwon 우리가 보내는 신호를 보지 못한 것 같아요.
sayid_jarrah We need to sail forward along the coast, clear the mountains, and start another signal fire.
sunhwa_kwon 돛을 해변쪽으로 돌려서 다시 한 번 신호를 보내쟤요.
jinsoo_kwon No!
sayid_jarrah I told Jack I would light a fire. I'm not abandoning him.
sunhwa_kwon 사이드 말은 우리가...
jinsoo_kwon 사이드? 사이드가 임신했어? 정신차려!
sunhwa_kwon My husband thinks we have to do as he says because he's the only one who knows how to sail. But he's wrong. I can help you sail the boat.
dr_juliet_burke Are you feeling any better? I made the soup myself, but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it.
ben_linus You never made soup for me.
colleen_pickett Am I interrupting something?
dr_juliet_burke Would it really matter if you were?
colleen_pickett We have a situation -- Ryan radioed in -- the Iraqi found the decoy village.
ben_linus Good, it's what we wanted.
colleen_pickett Ryan followed him back to the shore and they have a sailboat.
ben_linus How?!
colleen_pickett I have no idea.
dr_juliet_burke So they have a boat -- sailing in circles will keep them busy.
colleen_pickett They could find us. Ben?
ben_linus I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team?
colleen_pickett Within the hour.
ben_linus Then don't waste time talking to us. Hey Colleen, I want that boat.
kate_austen Nice alarm clock.
james_ford I've woken up to worse. Want half a fish biscuit?
james_ford What's this?
danny_pickett Lunch -- we're going to need you to keep up your strength.
james_ford Is that right?
colleen_pickett Danny, wait!
danny_pickett Hold up.
colleen_pickett They have a boat. (There's more whispering that's inaudible.)
danny_pickett Okay, be careful out there.
danny_pickett What are you looking at?
jinsoo_kwon 돛에가서 손 좀 보고 올게.
sunhwa_kwon 진수씨, 당신 말을 듣지 않은 거 미안해요. 사이드가 보는 앞에서.
jinsoo_kwon 그러니까 내 말을 처음부터 들었어야지. 당신은 그러면... 왜 왔어?
sunhwa_kwon 당신이랑 떨어져 있기 싫어서 왔을 뿐이예요.
jaehyeok_lee What's wrong?
sunhwa_kwon What's wrong is I'm married.
jaehyeok_lee Right. That.
sunhwa_kwon 재혁 씨, 안 되요. 안 되겠어요. 미안해요. ]
jaehyeok_lee 선화 씨, 잠시만요. ]
sunhwa_kwon 재혁 씨, 너무 아름다워요. 전 이거 받을 수 없어요. 남편이 어디서 났냐고 물으면...
jaehyeok_lee I don't want to share you anymore. Your English is excellent now. You can go to America.
jaehyeok_lee Does anyone know you're...
sunhwa_kwon No!
jaehyeok_lee 너네 뭐지? 내가 누군줄... What are you doing here? Get out of my--
jaehyeok_lee 회장님, 제가 뭐라 말씀...
woojung_paik PAIK 옷 입어.
danny_pickett Alright, here's the jig -- see these rocks, here? That's where you two come in. You're going to chop them loose. And you're going to haul them out of here.
kate_austen You expect me to work in this dress?
danny_pickett Well, it's up to you? You can take it off if you want.
james_ford How dare you?
danny_pickett Now, if you need anything -- you raise your hand. You get 10 minutes for lunch.
james_ford I got a question, boss.
danny_pickett No questions.
james_ford She got to ask a question.
danny_pickett If you try to run off, you will be shocked.
james_ford Shot?! We don't even get a warning?
danny_pickett Shocked. I said, shocked. If you talk to each other you're going to be shocked. If you touch each other, you're going to be shocked. If you're slacking, you're going to get shocked. Matter of fact, if you do anything at all that pisses me off, you're going to get shocked. Okay? Let's get to work.
kate_austen I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.
danny_pickett Now, that was a quarter charge. You got any more questions?
danny_pickett As soon as you're able to walk -- the wheelbarrow's right over there.
jinsoo_kwon 부르셨습니까, 회장님?
woojung_paik PAIK 들어오게. 앉지. 문제가 생겼네. We have a problem.]
woojung_paik PAIK 이 놈한테 내 것을 도둑 맞았어. 자네가 이 문제를 해결해주길 바라네.
jinsoo_kwon 뭘 도둑맞으셨는데요?
woojung_paik PAIK 그건 중요치 않아.
jinsoo_kwon 알겠습니다. 다시는 그러지 못하게 전하겠습니다, 회장님. I'll deliver a message.]
woojung_paik PAIK 그 정도로는 부족해! 아예 없애버려!
jinsoo_kwon 그렇게 할 수 없습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 할 수 없다니 무슨 소리야?
jinsoo_kwon 회장님, 이건 제가 할 일이 아닌 것 같은데요.
woojung_paik PAIK 자넨 내가 시키는 대로만 하면 돼!
jinsoo_kwon 그러면 더 이상 회장님 밑에서 일할 수가 없습니다. 그만두겠습니다. ]
woojung_paik PAIK 누구 맘대로 그만둬! 이 놈이 날 망신시켰어! 자네는 내 딸과 결혼했지? 그러니까, 자네는 내 아들이나 다름없네. 내 망신이 바로 자네의 망신 아닌가? 난 자네가 나서서 우리 가족의 명예를 되찾아 주길 바라네.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨, 여기 올라와 봐요.
sunhwa_kwon Why should there be a dock all the way out here?
jinsoo_kwon Others.
sayid_jarrah The dock's decaying. It's overgrown. It looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time. Whoever built it -- they're not here now.
sunhwa_kwon 누가 만든지 모르겠지만, 한동안 사용하지 않았대요.
sayid_jarrah Let's bring the boat in. We'll tie it to the dock and build a fire on the beach. The visibility's excellent. Jack will be able to see us for miles around.
jinsoo_kwon Safe?
sayid_jarrah Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.
danny_pickett Hey! Get back to work.
james_ford Whatever you say, boss.
alex_rousseau Hey, careful. Don't let them see you talking to me. Are they keeping you in the cages? Did you see another guy in there with you -- about my age, named Karl?
kate_austen No. Just Sawyer and me.
alex_rousseau You're not even supposed to be in that cage.
kate_austen What are you talking about? Who are you?
alex_rousseau Where'd you get that dress?
kate_austen They gave it to me.
alex_rousseau It's mine. You can keep it. It looks better on you anyway.
kate_austen Wait.
james_ford Are you having fun yet, Freckles?
kate_austen Quit staring at my ass.
james_ford Give me something else to stare at.
danny_pickett Hey! Shut up!
james_ford Yes sir, boss.
sayid_jarrah Thank you.
sunhwa_kwon What else can I do?
sayid_jarrah Help your husband. We need as much wood as we can find.
sunhwa_kwon We're building quite a large fire.
sayid_jarrah We have to make sure Jack will see the smoke.
sunhwa_kwon Why are you lying to me, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah And what would you know about lying, Sun?
sunhwa_kwon You're putting our lives in danger.
sayid_jarrah I'm fairly certain our friends have been captured. There are tracks all over the dock. They're fresh -- as recent as yesterday.
sunhwa_kwon You said this dock was abandoned.
sayid_jarrah That would be part of the lying you mentioned.
sunhwa_kwon You're not building this fire for our people; you're building it for the Others.
sayid_jarrah I suspect that when they see the smoke they'll send a scout party to investigate. By then it will be night. When they arrive, I'll ambush them. I'll take two of them hostage, and I'll kill the rest.
sunhwa_kwon Two?
sayid_jarrah One to make the other cooperate.
sunhwa_kwon What do you need me to do?
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.
sunhwa_kwon Why?
sayid_jarrah Because once the fire is lit it will be too late to go back.
sunhwa_kwon 이제 와요?
jinsoo_kwon 오늘 어땠어?
sunhwa_kwon 그냥 그랬어요.
jinsoo_kwon 아버님이 오늘 이상한 말씀 하시던데?
sunhwa_kwon 뭐요?
jinsoo_kwon 난생 처음으로 나를 아들이라고 부르셨어.
sunhwa_kwon 갑자기 왜요?
jinsoo_kwon 아버님만의 상술이시지.
sunhwa_kwon 그래서 당신 그 일 할 거예요?
jinsoo_kwon 해야 돼.
sunhwa_kwon 당신이 그럴 필요 없어요. 하지 마요.
jinsoo_kwon 당신 생각처럼 그게 그렇게 쉽다고 생각해?
sunhwa_kwon 우리 아무도 없는 곳으로 가서 처음부터 다시 시작해요. 우리 둘만 가서...
jinsoo_kwon 다시 시작? 우리가 도망가면 당신 아버지가...
sunhwa_kwon 아빠가 찾을 수 없는 곳으로 가면 되잖아요. 나도 당신이 그런 일 하는 거 너무 싫어. 당신도...
jinsoo_kwon 나도 너무 싫지만 이게 다 당신을 위해서야! 다 당신과 결혼한 대가겠지.
sunhwa_kwon 나도 당신이랑 결혼해서 치른 대가가 있는 거 몰라요? 진수씨, 어디가요?
jinsoo_kwon 일하러 가.
jinsoo_kwon Gun.
sayid_jarrah I don't think I understand.
jinsoo_kwon 자기야. 나도 여기서 무슨 일이 일어나는지 다 알아. 이건 잭을 위한 신호가 아니고, 그놈들을 유인해서 죽이려고 하는 거지?
sayid_jarrah What is it?
sunhwa_kwon He knows what we're doing. He knows it's a trap.
jinsoo_kwon 서로 영어로 하면 모르는 줄 알지? 당신이 생각하는 것보다 나 잘 알아들을 수 있어.
sunhwa_kwon He says he understands English better than I think he does.
jinsoo_kwon 나 다 알아.
sunhwa_kwon He knows I betrayed him.
jinsoo_kwon Gun.
sayid_jarrah Can you handle one of these? It's an automat...
jinsoo_kwon 보트에 가서 기다려. 어서 가.
sayid_jarrah I think you'd be safer on the boat. Sun, if by chance they get past us -- there's another gun. It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter.
sunhwa_kwon If they get past you, that means my husband is dead. And I won't care anymore.
sayid_jarrah As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.
james_ford Back off!
dr_juliet_burke James!
dr_juliet_burke Put the gun down. Right now. Put the gun down.
jaehyeok_lee 잠시만요!
jinsoo_kwon 내가 누군 줄 알아? 응? 내가 왜 여기 왔는지 알아?
jaehyeok_lee 정말 미안합니다.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 왜 왔는지 알면 뭘 할지도 알겠군.
jaehyeok_lee 미안합니다. 미안합니다.
jinsoo_kwon 넌 한국을 떠나. 내 말 알아듣겠지? 여길 떠나서 다시 돌아오지 마. 이름도 바꾸고 다시 새 인생을 살아. 만약 여기 왔다는 소리가 들리면 그 땐 넌 끝이야! 알았어? 이제 너는 이 세상 사람이 아니다.
sayid_jarrah I don't think they're coming.
sunhwa_kwon I want you to let me off this boat.
colleen_pickett I can't do that.
sunhwa_kwon Why not?
colleen_pickett It's not my decision to make. Do you realize there are 5 of my friends up there?
sunhwa_kwon Lower your voice.
colleen_pickett Okay.
sunhwa_kwon Stop; or I'll shoot.
colleen_pickett No you won't, Sun. I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon; and I know you're not a killer. But despite what you may think, I'm not the enemy. We are not the enemy. But if you shoot me, that's exactly what we'll become.
sunhwa_kwon Stop! I will -- I'll shoot you.
woojung_paik PAIK 네가 여기 있으면 안되겠다.
sunhwa_kwon 아버지, 여긴 웬일이세요?
woojung_paik PAIK 이 젊은이 아버지와는 사업 관계로 아는 사이다. 아마 베란다에서 뛰어내렸다지? 얼마나 치욕스러웠으면. 이제 그만 이제 남편이 있는 너의 집으로 돌아가.
sunhwa_kwon 아버지. 진수씨한테 얘기하실 거예요?
woojung_paik PAIK 이제와서 무슨 소용이 있다고.
jinsoo_kwon 당신이 없으면 내가 어떻게 살지 몰라. 당신하고 우리 아이.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry I dragged you into this. And please communicate to your husband that next time I will listen to him. We should go. We have a long walk ahead of us.
jinsoo_kwon 가자.
kate_austen Are you okay?
james_ford Never better.
kate_austen What the hell were you thinking?
james_ford I couldn't help myself -- you just looked so damn cute swinging that pickaxe. Chain gang looks good on you, Freckles.
kate_austen Sawyer.
james_ford Two of those guards got some real fight in them. The rest of them, I'm not so much worried about. That heavy-set guy -- he packs a hell of a punch. The shaggy-haired kid's got some kind of martial arts training, but I think I could take him if I had to. Oh, FYI -- those zapper things got a safety on them.
kate_austen Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle?
james_ford I'm guessing most of these boys have never seen any real action. But that blond who had a gun pointed at you? She would have shot you -- no problem.
kate_austen Why'd she call you James?
james_ford Because that's my name. I noticed something else, too. You taste like strawberries.
kate_austen You taste like fish biscuits. So what do we do now?
james_ford Well, Shortcake, now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake.
james_ford Sooner or later, they're going to let their guard down. And when they do, we're going to be there to put them in their place.
ben_linus Hello, Jack. You know what's crazy, Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry that I lied to you about who I was; but, hell, do you blame me? I mean, let's face it, if I had told you I was one of those people that you and your friends have been calling Others all this time it would have been right back to Sayid and his -- fists. Wouldn't it?
dr_jack_shephard What do you want from me?
ben_linus I want for you to change your at--perspective. And, the first step in doing that would be for me to be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so -- Hi, my name is Benjamin Linus and I've lived on this island all my life. You're not going to shake?
ben_linus Bring it in, please.
dr_jack_shephard Where are Kate and Sawyer?
ben_linus They're fine; and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now.
dr_jack_shephard You can tell me anything you want.
ben_linus Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm going to make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate; we send you home.
dr_jack_shephard Cooperate with what?
ben_linus When the time is right, I'll tell you...
dr_jack_shephard You tell me now.
ben_linus Patience, Jack. Patience.
dr_jack_shephard Home -- is that where you sent Walt and Michael?
ben_linus Yes.
dr_jack_shephard If you could leave this island why would you still be here?
ben_linus Yes, Jack, why would we be here?
dr_jack_shephard You're lying. You're stuck here just like we are. You don't have any...
ben_linus Your flight crashed on September 22nd, 2004. Today is November 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. Yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush; Christopher Reeve has passed away; the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. What?
dr_jack_shephard If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should have picked somebody else besides the Red Sox.
ben_linus No, they were down 3 games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won 8 straight.
dr_jack_shephard Sure. Sure, of course they did.
ben_linus That's home, Jack. Right there, on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me -- if you trust me -- if you do what I tell you when the time comes -- I'll take you there. I will take you home.
