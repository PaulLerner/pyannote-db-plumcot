KATE "We have to go back"? "We have to go back"?
JACK Now hold on—
KATE Who do you think you are?! You call me over and over again for two days straight, stoned on your pills! And then you show up here with an obituary for Jeremy Bentham. When he came to me and I heard what he had to say, I knew he was crazy. But you... You believed him.
JACK Yes.
KATE Him, of all people.
JACK Yes, Kate, I did, because he said that that was the only way that I could keep you safe—you and Aaron.
KATE Don't you say his name. I still have to explain to him why you are not there to read to him, so don't you say his name!
JACK I'm sorry.
KATE I've spent the last three years trying to forget all the horrible things that happened on the day that we left. How dare you ask me to go back?
SAWYER You sure we're going the right way?
JACK Lapidus said they were headed northeast.
SAWYER You might wanna slow down a little, 'cause you look like you're about to keel over, Doc.
JACK I'm fine.
SAWYER Of course you're fine. You're always fine—
SAWYER Is this it?
JACK I don't know.
SAWYER So what's the plan, Sundance?
JACK The plan is we wait til—
SAWYER Hugo?
HURLEY Sawyer!
SAWYER You all right?
HURLEY Dude, you came back. How'd you know where I was?
JACK It's good to see you, Hurley.
HURLEY Yeah. Yeah, man. You, too.
JACK So where the hell is he?
JACK Locke!
LOCKE Hello, Jack.
DESMOND There's enough C-4 here to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier. When I was in the army... I did six months' explosive ordnance disposal, which, as the saying goes, is just enough time to learn how to blow yourself up.
MICHAEL Is it on a timer? And why hasn't it gone off yet?
DESMOND This is a—a radio receiver. It's... it's like a walkie-talkie. You send it a signal, and, uh... it—it triggers a bomb remotely.
JIN So can we... turn off?
DESMOND This is a... this is a trip wire. Move it, and... boom. This is dummy wiring. If you cut the wrong one... boom. This is multiple firing systems. You disable one, and the next one... boom. Uh, this... battery's the power source. If you disconnect it—
JIN Boom.
JACK What are you doing in here?
LOCKE There's a—a DHARMA station below us, and, um, I'm looking for a way to get in.
JACK Get in and do what?
LOCKE Hugo, James, would you mind if I spoke to Jack alone?
JACK Don't bother. We just came back for Hurley. Let's go.
LOCKE Jack, you need to hear what I have to say—
JACK What I need to do is to walk back to the chopper, get on it, and get the rest of our people off this island.
HURLEY Uh, dude, probably not the best idea right now. Those Rambo guys are taking Ben to that helicopter. He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago.
JACK Now why the hell would he do that?
KEAMY So tell me something, Ben. What is it that makes you so important, hmm? I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Mr. Widmore would pay me so much money just to come out here and capture you and bring you back alive.
BEN Charles Widmore tell you to kill my daughter?
KEAMY Hey! How'd he get the toolbox?
LAPIDUS Damn.
KEAMY Who gave you the toolbox, Frank?
LAPIDUS Who, uh...
KEAMY Hey!
KEAMY Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're good right there.
KEAMY Who are you?
KATE I'm Kate. I'm one of the passengers of Flight 815.
KEAMY Why are you running?
KATE I'm being chased... by his people.
KEAMY Kocol... Lacour... Redfern on flank.
KEAMY Come here.
KATE Whoa. Hey.
KEAMY Get on your knees.
KATE Uhh!
KEAMY Hands above your heads, both of you.
KEAMY Now! Spray it!
KATE Ben, stay close. Run! Run.
LAPIDUS Grenade!
BEN Uhh!
KATE Get up. Come on. Get up.
KEAMY Uhh! Aah!
KEAMY Aah!
KEAMY Aah! 
BEN Thank you for coming, Richard.
RICHARD My pleasure.
BEN Could you cut me free, Kate?
BEN What was the arrangement?
RICHARD They, uh, help us free you, and we let 'em off the island.
BEN Fair enough. The helicopter is yours. You and Sayid have a safe journey back.
KATE So we can go? Off the island? That's it?
BEN That's it.
MICHAEL'S MOTHER Thank you, miss.
NURSE Mm-hmm.
MICHAEL'S MOTHER Are you Hurley?
HURLEY Yeah.
MICHAEL'S MOTHER Are you dangerous?
HURLEY I'm sorry. Do I know you?
MICHAEL'S MOTHER No, you don't know me... but you know my grandson.
MICHAEL'S MOTHER Now we've traveled all the way across country just so he could see you. I need to know if you're gonna do anything crazy.
HURLEY I won't do anything crazy.
HURLEY Hey, Walt.
WALT Hey, Hurley.
HURLEY You're getting big, Dude.
WALT You know, when you came back, I was waiting for one of you to come see me, but... nobody did.
HURLEY I'm sorry.
WALT Do you know who did come see me? Jeremy Bentham. I don't understand why you're all lying.
HURLEY We're lying... because it's the only way to protect everyone that didn't come back.
WALT Like my dad?
HURLEY Like your dad, yeah.
SAWYER What the hell they talkin' about in there, anyway?
HURLEY I don't know. Leader stuff?
SAWYER Where'd you get that?
HURLEY Came from a box Ben dug up out of the ground. They're good.
HURLEY Thanks for coming back for me.
SAWYER Ah, you got it.
HURLEY Claire and the baby okay?
JACK What did you wanna talk to me about, John?
LOCKE I want you to reconsider leaving the island, Jack. I would like you to stay.
JACK You'd like me to stay?
LOCKE Yeah, that's right.
JACK You threw a knife into the back of an unarmed woman. You led half of our people across the island and got most of them killed.
LOCKE Well, Jack, you put a gun to my head and you pulled the trigger. I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones.
JACK Well, I'll tell you what. You stay here in your little greenhouse, but the rest of us are going home.
LOCKE But you're not supposed to go home.
JACK And what am I supposed to do? Oh, I think I remember. What was it that you said on the way out to the hatch—that crashing here was our destiny?
LOCKE You know, Jack. You know that you're here for a reason. You know it. And if you leave this place, that knowledge is gonna eat you alive from the inside out...until you decide to come back.
JACK Good-bye, John.
LOCKE You're gonna have to lie.
JACK Excuse me?
LOCKE If you have to go, then you have to lie about everything...everything that happened since we got to the island it's the only way to protect it.
JACK It's an island, John. No one needs to protect it.
LOCKE It's not an island. It's a place where miracles happen. And—and—if you—if you don't believe that, Jack, if you can't believe that, just wait till you see what I'm about to do.
JACK There's no such thing as miracles.
LOCKE Well... we'll just have to see which one of us is right.
BEN Am I interrupting?
BEN Nice to see you, too, Jack.
BEN Couldn't find the Anthuriums, could you?
LOCKE I don't know what they look like.
JACK What are you doing?
BEN Didn't you tell him?
LOCKE I tried.
BEN Sayid and Kate are waiting for you at the helicopter. I understand that your people from the beach are being brought to the freighter even as we speak.
JACK What?
BEN I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, Jack, but you, Hugo, James, you need to get moving. If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour. Good-bye, Jack. Let's go.
LOCKE Lie to them, Jack. If you do it half as well as you lie to yourself, they'll believe you.
MAN Yeah, I'll be right here.
SUN Michael? What's going on down there?
MAN Ready to go?
MICHAEL Did you tell anybody?
SUN No, Michael. I—I didn't. Can you... t-turn it off?
MICHAEL It isn't even on yet. But, yeah, if what's in this tank does what it's supposed to do, we're gonna be okay.
MICHAEL Look, I'll send Jin upstairs. There's no need for him to be down there with me when he can be up here with you.
SUN I'm pregnant.
MICHAEL Congratulations, Sun.
DESMOND You're gonna what?
MICHAEL Freeze it. This is liquid nitrogen. We use it in the refrigeration hold. The bomb needs a charge from the battery to detonate, right? And the battery runs on a—a chemical reaction. I spray the battery. I can keep it cold. No reaction.
DESMOND And what's the catch?
MICHAEL The catch is we only have one canister. We use it up, we're right back where we started.
DESMOND Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red?
MICHAEL If we see that light turn red and the battery's not already cold, that is the last thing we will ever see. Either way, at least we'll have a warning, buy ourselves some time.
DESMOND All right, um, freeze the battery. Jin, help me trace back these wires, make a list of where each of them goes to.
MAN Boat!
FARADAY Thank you.
MAN Down there.
JULIET Did you get them all to the boat?
FARADAY Yeah, everybody's safe.
JULIET Are they coming closer?
FARADAY They fixed the engine, and they're gonna get as close to the island as they can without hitting the reef, so the next trip shouldn't take so long. I'm just gonna get some water, and I'll come back in a minute.
JULIET Okay, I'll get the next group ready to go.
FARADAY Thank you.
JULIET Dan!
FARADAY Yeah?
JULIET Thanks for helping us.
FARADAY Absolutely.
JULIET Okay, let's go!
ROSE Uh, who told you you could eat those peanuts?
MILES May—may I eat these peanuts?
ROSE I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty.
FARADAY Miles...
MILES Somethin' wrong with your neck?
FARADAY Follow me, please.
CHARLOTTE Dan, you're back. Hey. What's wrong?
FARADAY I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the next group of people to the freighter. You need to make sure that you're with me on that raft, all right?
MILES Well, don't worry about me, 'cause I'm gonna stay.
FARADAY Miles, no, uh, uh, I don't think I'm getting across the... direness of the circumstance.
MILES Oh, no, you're very dire, but I'm still gonna stay.
FARADAY Hey, ten minutes.
CHARLOTTE Yep.
MILES I'm surprised you wanna leave.
CHARLOTTE Sorry?
MILES It's just weird. You know, after all that time you spent trying to get back here.
CHARLOTTE What do you mean, get back here?
MILES ...What do I mean?
LOCKE How deep is the station?
BEN Deep.
LOCKE Is this the magic box?
BEN No, John, it's not.
LOCKE What is all this stuff for?
BEN Same things that all the DHARMA stations are for —silly experiments.
LOCKE What kind of experiments?
BEN You know what, John?
BEN Why don't you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions...
BEN ...and I'll take care of some business.
SCIENTIST Hello. I'm Dr. Edgar Halliwax... and this is the orientation film for station six of the DHARMA Initiative. As you've no doubt surmised, station six, or "The Orchid," is not... a botanical research unit. The unique properties... of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect, allowing the DHARMA initiative to conduct unique experiments in both space and time. This... is "the vault", constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe... to be negatively charged "exotic matter". Great care must be taken to avoid leaving inorganic materials... inside the chamber. The electromagnetic energy within the island can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Now, for your own safety and the safety of those around you, metallic objects must never... be placed within the vault.
SCIENTIST  In our first demonstration, we will attempt to shift the test subject 100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space. For the briefest... of moments, the animal will seem to disappear, but in reality... 
LOCKE Hey. Uh... was he talking about what I think he was talking about?
BEN If you mean time-travelling bunnies, then yes.
LOCKE You do know that he said specifically not to put anything metal in here.
LOCKE You expecting someone?
BEN May I have my weapon back?
HURLEY Sayid! Kate! Good to see you, Dude.
SAWYER He say somethin' to tick you off, Freckles?
KATE Didn't kill that one.
SAWYER Well, which one did you kill?
JACK Where's the baby?
KATE He's with Sun, and they should be at the freighter by now. Are you okay?
JACK I am now.
SAWYER Hey Kenny Rogers. What you trying to do there, pick a lock?
LAPIDUS You got a better idea?
SAWYER Hacksaw.
LAPIDUS For the handcuffs, right?
LAPIDUS Okay, take it easy.
SAWYER Ay. All right, all right.
JACK Sayid, how'd you get back?
SAYID I took the Zodiac from the freighter.
JACK Is it safe? A body from the boat washed up on the beach.
SAYID It's safe now.
LAPIDUS All right! Let's get the hell outta here!
SAWYER Let's go, Freckles. I've seen enough of this rock.
HURLEY After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back and look for Claire, right?
JACK Absolutely.
LAPIDUS Hands and feet inside the vehicle! Let's go for a ride!
SCIENTIST ...properties of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect...
KEAMY I know you're down here, Ben. Crouching in the dark, just waiting to take a shot at me.
SCIENTIST This... is "the vault"...
KEAMY Well, you better aim for the head, Ben! Not like your boyfriend who shot me in the back like a coward!
SCIENTIST ...to avoid leaving inorganic materials inside...
KEAMY This body armor's, um, been known to take a bullet or two in its time.
KEAMY But before you take your shot, Ben, let me tell you about this. 
KEAMY See that? I took out a bit of a—a life insurance policy, Ben. It's a heart rate monitor, and it's connected to a radio transmitter. W—we call it a "dead man's trigger", Ben. If my heart stops beating... it sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of C-4 that I've got hardwired out there on the freighter that'd kill a lot of innocent people, Ben. If you think I'm bluffing, need I remind you of, uh... how your daughter looked as she bled out? Face-down in the grass? 
KEAMY Who the hell are you?
LOCKE My name is John Locke, and I have no... conflict with you. And neither do the people on that boat. So... why don't you put your knife down? We can talk about this.
KEAMY Well, John Locke... I've never really been one for talk.
BEN You killed my daughter.
KEAMY Aah!
BEN You killed my daughter!
LOCKE Ben! Ben! Ben, stop! No, no! Stop!
LOCKE Ben, what did you do?
LOCKE You just killed everybody on that boat.
BEN So?
FARADAY Hey, Charlotte! Listen, uh, I wanted to say before you get on the boat, please—
CHARLOTTE I'm gonna stay, Daniel... for now, anyway.
FARADAY Charlotte... there is no "for now". If you don't come with me, "for now" could be forever.
CHARLOTTE Nothing's forever.
FARADAY Why?
CHARLOTTE Would it make any sense if I told you I was still looking for where I was born?
FARADAY N—no.
CHARLOTTE Good-bye, Daniel.
FARADAY Let me guess. You're not coming.
JULIET I promised I wouldn't leave until I got everyone here safely off this island. Relax. I'll still be here when you get back.
FARADAY Right, right... when I get back. Okay. Everybody ready? Let's get started. Off we go.
DESMOND I think I might have something. Okay, so... so if... if I cut this wire, it... it should disconnect the firing mechanisms.
JIN Stop! 여기 연결돼 있어. No good.
DESMOND Damn it! I—I just don't know enough. H—how do we even know your little freezing trick's doing anything?
MICHAEL We'll know if that light turns red and we're still here.
DESMOND How much stuff do we have left?
MICHAEL We got a quarter tank.
DESMOND What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb?
MICHAEL We better get everybody the hell off this boat.
SAYID What's the matter?
LAPIDUS We're losing fuel.
JACK What?!
LAPIDUS We're losing fuel! Look outside, tell me if you can see anything!
SAYID We have a fuel leak! A bullet must have pierced the tank!
LAPIDUS We gotta find a place to set her down!
JACK No, don't land!
LAPIDUS What?!
JACK There's no fuel on the island! We've gotta get to the boat, or this chopper's useless!
LAPIDUS I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat!
JACK Well, then keep looking!
LAPIDUS We gotta get every ounce of extra weight off this chopper now! Anything that's not bolted down, toss it out!
JACK Now what? Is that enough? Can we make it?!
LAPIDUS I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we were a few hundred pounds lighter! Well, if we don't make it, we're still close enough to ditch it on the beach.
JACK Hey! Do not go back to the island!
LAPIDUS We might not have a choice, Doc.
SAWYER Hey... 
KATE Why are you telling me this?
SAWYER Just do it, Freckles.
KATE Sawyer!
SAYID Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you. But do you have the time, please?
GUY IN CAR Yeah. It's eight fif—
HURLEY Sayid?
SAYID Hello, Hurley.
HURLEY I think visiting hours are over, Dude.
SAYID This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me.
HURLEY Come with you where?
SAYID Somewhere safe.
HURLEY And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
SAYID Because circumstances have changed.
HURLEY What circumstances?
SAYID Bentham's dead.
HURLEY What?
SAYID Two days ago.
HURLEY What happened?
SAYID They said it was suicide.
HURLEY What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "Bentham"? His name is—
SAYID Don't say it. We're being watched.
HURLEY Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia.
SAYID I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.
HURLEY We're not going back, are we?
SAYID No. Just somewhere safe.
HURLEY Okay then. Hold on a sec.
HURLEY Checkmate, Mr. Eko.
SAYID Where's the freighter?
LAPIDUS I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again.
SAYID How much fuel?
LAPIDUS Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump.
JACK As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.
HURLEY Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!
LOCKE Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.
BEN That's not my problem, John.
LOCKE Hang on, man. Hang on!
KEAMY Wherever you go... Widmore... he'll find you.
BEN Not if I find him first.
LOCKE Hey. No. No. Hey. Hey! Hey!
MICHAEL You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go!
JIN You go. Go. I stay.
DESMOND Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!
JACK Did he say "bomb"?
DESMOND Don't land!
JACK What are you doing?!
LAPIDUS I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!
DESMOND No! Don't land! No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!
JACK How long till we can fly again?
LAPIDUS Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!
DESMOND Give it to me. I'll do it.
LAPIDUS Here! Somebody pump some gas!
JACK I'll handle the fuel.
LAPIDUS Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go!
KATE Hey, Sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go.
SUN Jin's below with Michael. I can't—
KATE No, no, there's no time! There's no time. We have to go.
SUN I won't leave him!
KATE Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin. All right?
LAPIDUS Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island.
MICHAEL Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man.
JIN No, I can find—
MICHAEL Hey, come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to your wife and get her home.
JIN Thank you, Michael.
MICHAEL You're welcome. Go.
JACK Hey! Not yet!
LAPIDUS Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go!
JACK Kate! Come on!
KATE Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind.
JACK Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now.
LAPIDUS Let's go!
DESMOND Give me a minute! No! Wait!
SUN Where's Jin?
JIN 자기야! 자기야! 여기야! 여기야! 나 아직 여기 있어!
SUN It's Jin! No! Jin! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
LAPIDUS We can't do it!
SUN We have to! We need to go back!
CHRISTIAN You can go now, Michael.
MICHAEL Who are you?
SUN Jin! Aah!
SUN Jin!
SUN Go back lower! We have to go find Jin!
JACK Sun, there's nobody down there!
SUN You can't see anything from here!
LAPIDUS We didn't get enough fuel! We can't go back!
SUN Go lower! I know he's there!
SAYID Sun, I'm—Sun, I'm so sorry. He's not—
SUN He's down there! I know he's down there!
LAPIDUS We gotta go!
SUN No! I'm not leaving him!
SAYID Can't get to him!
SUN No, we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around!
JACK Sun! Sun! It's gone!
JACK He's gone.
KATE Shh. Shh.
JACK Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.
LAPIDUS You got it.
SUN No! No! No! No!
SUN 어, 엄마. 
MRS. PAIK 얘, 누가 너하고 얘기하고 싶대! 지연아, 엄마하고 얘기 좀 해볼래?
JI YEON 엄마, 엄마. 
SUN 우리 예쁜 딸! 
MRS. PAIK 얘, 너 어디 있니? 
SUN 런던에 있어요. 일 마무리 하고 오늘 밤에 출발해요. 
MRS. PAIK 그래, 그럼 여행 안전하게 잘 해. 
SUN 그럴게요, 엄마. 집에서 봐요. 
WIDMORE All right, guys. Thanks.
SUN Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?
WIDMORE Yes.
SUN I'm Sun Kwon... Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of Paik Industries.
WIDMORE Yes, of course. How is your father?
SUN Excellent, thank you.
WIDMORE Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.
SUN Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?
WIDMORE I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Kwon.
SUN Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore... just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them...
SUN Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island.
WIDMORE Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me?
LOCKE Why?
BEN "Why" what?
LOCKE Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?
BEN Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses.
BEN I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.
LOCKE What are you doing?
LOCKE I asked you a question!
BEN If I were you, I'd duck.
BEN I better change.
SAWYER Nice day for a swim.
JULIET What are you doing here?
SAWYER Decided to take a dip.
SAWYER Whatcha celebratin'?
JULIET I'm not celebrating.
SAWYER Is that our boat?
JULIET It was.
LOCKE What's that for?
BEN I'm going somewhere cold.
LOCKE Then where is mine?
BEN You don't need one because you're not going with me.
LOCKE Yes, I am going with you.
BEN No, John, you're not.
LOCKE Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions—
BEN He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences.
LOCKE What consequences?
BEN Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid.
LOCKE Waiting for me?
BEN Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.
LOCKE What do I tell 'em to do?
BEN You'll find your way, John. You always do.
RICHARD Hello, John. Welcome home.
BEN I hope you're happy now, Jacob.
DESMOND Yeah, what is that?
LAPIDUS Where's the island? Where's the island?! Where the hell's the island?!
HURLEY It's gone.
LAPIDUS Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!
JACK There's another smaller island close by they took us to!
LAPIDUS I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing but water in every direction!
LAPIDUS Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel!
LAPIDUS Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves!
SAYID Desmond! The life raft!
LAPIDUS Hold on!
KATE Where's Jack?!
LAPIDUS Kate! Where is he?!
SAYID Are you okay?
KATE Hurley, carry the baby.
LAPIDUS Sayid, are you all right?
SAYID Yes!
HURLEY Jack!
LAPIDUS Where's Desmond?
KATE Get the baby.
HURLEY I got him.
LAPIDUS Desmond?! Jack! Give me a hand!
SUN Here you go.
JACK Get him to the raft. Get him to the raft. Get him up in the raft. We've gotta get him in the raft.
HURLEY Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?
KATE Oh, my god.
JACK Oh, come on, Desmond.
JACK One, two, three.
JACK Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
HURLEY Yeah.
JACK Yeah. Yeah.
JACK Yeah, you're all right.
HURLEY You're all right, man. You're okay.
HURLEY Desmond.
JACK That's it. You're all right. That's it.
JACK It's okay. It's okay. We're alive. 
KATE Hello?
KATE Hello? Who's there?
KATE Don't move. Don't you touch my son!
KATE Claire? How did y—
CLAIRE Don't bring him back, Kate. Don't you dare bring him back.
KATE I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
HURLEY Is he okay?
KATE He's fine. It's a miracle.
HURLEY I can't believe he did it.
KATE Who did what?
HURLEY Locke. He moved the island.
JACK No, he didn't.
HURLEY Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, Dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.
LAPIDUS God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! There's a boat! You see it?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Does it see us?
DESMOND I think it does!
SAYID Hey!
HURLEY AND DESMOND Hey!
LAPIDUS Is it turning? It's turning! Hey! Hey!
JACK We're gonna have to lie.
KATE What?
JACK We're gonna have to lie.
SAYID Lie about what?
JACK Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island.
LAPIDUS Jack... now, I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?
JACK Your freighter... those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the bottom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there—someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind?
KATE Jack, we can't. We can't pull it off.
JACK Just let me do the talking.
MAN Aponta adiante, lá! Lá!
MAN Uma jangada. Cheio de gente! São oito deles!
MAN De onde eles vieram? De onde eles vieram?
HENRIK Ei, aqui! Dá uma olhada aqui!
MAN Depressa! Pega uns cobertores e a caixa de primeiros socorros. Traga pra aqui agora.
HENRIK Uma jangada com pessoas, Ms. Widmore! Ms. Widmore, venha à proa!
PENNY Throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern!
DESMOND Penny? Penny! Penny!
PENNY Are you okay?
DESMOND I'm—I'm fine. I'm fine. H—how did you find me?
PENNY Your phone call... I have a tracking station. 
DESMOND I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again.
MAN Não, não, não. Não faz isso. Não faz isso. Tá bom, tá bom, tá bom. Chega pra lá. Chega, chega.
DESMOND Uh... this is—this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.
KATE Hi.
PENNY Hi.
DESMOND Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.
HURLEY Hi.
DESMOND This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is—this is Penny.
JACK It's nice to meet you, Penny.
PENNY Hi.
JACK But we need to talk.
HURLEY What's this place called?
SAYID Membata.
HURLEY Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?
SAYID Because it's the only way to keep them safe.
JACK How long till we'll hit land?
LAPIDUS Well, if the wind's not too brutal... eight, nine hours. Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.
JACK Well... it's been a pleasure, Frank. I hope we never see each other again.
LAPIDUS Roger that, Doc. 
PENNY Bye, sweetheart.
DESMOND Are you sure about this, brother?
JACK Are you sure?
DESMOND As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.
JACK Don't let him find you, Desmond. And I'll see you in another life, brother.
DESMOND Aye. I guess you will.
JACK All right. Let's go home.
BEN Hello, Jack.
BEN Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?
JACK Yes, he did.
BEN When did you speak to him?
JACK About a month ago.
BEN And Kate?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too.
BEN And what did he say to you?
JACK He told me... that after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back.
BEN Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark.
JACK Why are you here?
BEN I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.
JACK Are you... Sayid—I don't even know where Sayid is. Hurley... is insane. Sun blames me for... and then Kate... She won't even talk to me anymore.
BEN Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you.
JACK How?
BEN I have a few ideas.
BEN Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too.
