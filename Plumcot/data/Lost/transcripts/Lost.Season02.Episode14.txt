tariq They're getting closer! Move it! Burn those! Shred faster! Hurry up! Sayid! Take these files! Burn them! Keep shredding you cowards! We leave when I say! Stop again, and I'll kill you myself! I'm your commanding officer and you will do --
U.S.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 SOLDIER #1 Get down! Get the hell down!
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI Get down. Get down. You, no, no, no, drop your gun. On the ground now.
U.S.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 SOLDIER #2 Freeze! On the ground, now!
U.S.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 SOLDIER #1 Get the hell down!
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI Who's in charge here? I said, who's in charge?! Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he's dead.
U.S.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 SOLDIER #1 They don't understand, Sergeant.
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI They understand. Listen up, I'll fire on 3. 1-2...
sayid_jarrah
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI You -- you in charge?
sayid_jarrah No, I am not.
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI Who is?
sayid_jarrah There is no commanding officer here. He left two hours ago for, for Hillah.
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI Your English is good, Abdul, but you're lying. And that ain't so good.
sgt_sam_austen BUCCELLI That's him, Sergeant.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Let's go, hombre. Son, we don't want to be here any more than you do -- your pal, Saddam, had to go marching into Kuwait -- here we all are. Buccelli here says that you speak English. Ever do any translating?
sayid_jarrah Formally, no.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Hell, the fact you know what "formally" means -- we're good. Apache helicopter went down in this sector 2 days ago. Our sources tell us the pilot was captured. It's very important that we get this pilot back. We know that he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander -- a man named Tariq. Do you know him?
sayid_jarrah Yes, he was our commanding officer.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Do you know where he is?
sayid_jarrah When the bombing started he fled to Hillah.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Hillah, huh?
sayid_jarrah Yes, that is right.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Welcome to Hillah.
ana_lucia_cortez Where's Jack?
sayid_jarrah Why?
ana_lucia_cortez There. See?
sayid_jarrah Go back, I'll deal with this.
ana_lucia_cortez What?
sayid_jarrah Go back, Ana Lucia. And don't tell anyone what you saw.
sayid_jarrah What are you doing here, Danielle?
danielle_rousseau Looking for you.
sayid_jarrah Where are we going? You said you were looking for me. What was your plan? To hide in the woods hoping I would pass you by?
danielle_rousseau I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.
sayid_jarrah Why?
danielle_rousseau We need to keep moving.
sayid_jarrah Not until you tell me where we're moving to.
danielle_rousseau Trust me.
sayid_jarrah The last time we met you arrived to warn us the Others were coming which they weren't. In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire's baby. So pardon me for not trusting you.
danielle_rousseau This place I'm taking you to -- there's something that will help you -- something important. As for trust, take this. If I'm lying it's yours to use.
sayid_jarrah How much further?
danielle_rousseau Not far.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Ask him where he took the pilot.
sayid_jarrah
tariq
sayid_jarrah He says he does not know.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday. Hell, probably in this room. Tell him if we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free.
sayid_jarrah
tariq
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN What's he saying?
sayid_jarrah He says he does not know.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday, son. Now, if you don't help me out here, someone else will take over. And that someone -- he won't play nice at all.
sayid_jarrah I am sorry. He does not know.
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN Okay, you had your chance. Guards, lock him back up.
james_ford This is unbelievable. Hey! Hey, you hear that thing? You hear that frog -- that frog? You want to help me find it?
james_ford What, we ain't friends anymore?
james_ford What do you got there, Rerun?
hugo_reyes Nothing.
james_ford Yeah, well, you've got a spot of nothing on your chin there. "DHARMA Initiative ranch dressing"? You know you're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it?
hugo_reyes Well, actually in the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years.
james_ford Well, well, look at who's got a secret stash?
hugo_reyes Please, dude, you can't tell.
james_ford What, that you stole food from the group? Now, why would I want to do that?
hugo_reyes Come on, man, please?
james_ford Son of a bitch.
hugo_reyes Dude, it's just a tree frog.
james_ford Have you seen it?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
james_ford Tell you what -- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dipping. We got a deal?
sayid_jarrah How much further? Danielle?
danielle_rousseau We're here.
sayid_jarrah And where exactly is here?
sayid_jarrah What is that for, Danielle?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Help me! Hey, somebody here!
danielle_rousseau Wait.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Help!
danielle_rousseau Sayid, listen to me.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Hey! Hey, over here! Please, help me.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Help me!
danielle_rousseau Don't believe a word he says.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Hey!
danielle_rousseau He's one of them.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 I have no idea what she's talking about. She's crazy.
sayid_jarrah How long has he been up there?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode14 Since last night. Please, just cut me down. My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. Please.
danielle_rousseau He's lying.
sayid_jarrah I'm going to cut him down.
danielle_rousseau Don't.
ben_linus Thank you.
danielle_rousseau You're making a serious mistake.
sayid_jarrah It's okay, it's okay. You're alright. You're alright. Hold on. Take it easy.
ben_linus No.
sayid_jarrah Wait. Danielle, don't!
sayid_jarrah You could have killed him.
danielle_rousseau If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him.
sayid_jarrah You shot this man with no provocation.
danielle_rousseau He is one of them. Tie him up. You should take him to your doctor. He's no good to you dead.
sayid_jarrah And then what?
danielle_rousseau You talk to him, Sayid. As I recall that is what you do. But know this -- he will lie -- a long time. He will lie.
kelvin_inman I want to talk to you about your buddy -- Tariq. Uh, look, I get it. You're a man who values loyalty. Even doing a little translating for us -- you feel like you're doing the wrong thing. I get that, and I respect it. This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit. He was the head of the chemical warfare battalion in the North. He personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village. You recognize it, don't you? You had relatives in that village didn't you, Sayid? So, you know what sarin gas does. No discrimination -- the entire marketplace -- innocent women, children.
sayid_jarrah Enough -- please.
kelvin_inman Loyalty is a virtue. But unquestioning loyalty -- I don't think that's you.
sayid_jarrah Why should I believe you?
kelvin_inman How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village? We liberated your personnel file, and Tariq's. All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family.
sayid_jarrah Tariq will never talk to you.
kelvin_inman That's why you're going to have to make him talk to you.
sayid_jarrah John, John wake up.
john_locke What?
sayid_jarrah Come out here.
john_locke Minnesota, huh?
sayid_jarrah That's the question, isn't it?
ben_linus Where am I?
sayid_jarrah Who are you?
ben_linus Henry, Henry Gale. Ah, my back.
sayid_jarrah We're going to take it out, but first I want you to relax. How did you get to this island?
ben_linus 4 months ago, we crashed, my wife and I.
sayid_jarrah Crashed in what?
ben_linus A balloon. We were trying to cross the Pacific.
sayid_jarrah Your wife, where is she?
ben_linus She died. She got -- she got sick 3 weeks ago. We were staying in a cave off the beach. Ah, my shoulder. At least untie my arms.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell's going here?
sayid_jarrah Rousseau trapped him in the jungle. She believes he's an Other.
ben_linus An other what?
dr_jack_shephard You shot him with an arrow?
sayid_jarrah Do I have a bow?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, hey, you with me? What, you were just going to let him bleed to death?
sayid_jarrah I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them. And his wound is far from life threatening.
john_locke We should let Jack treat him first, then we'll get our answers.
sayid_jarrah Jack, do not untie him.
hugo_reyes This is how people get killed in scary movies.
james_ford If this was a scary movie I'd be with a hot chick not you, Barbar.
hugo_reyes It's Babar.
james_ford How about you shut up, Hammo? Or your ranch disorder's going to be the new lead item on the coconut internet.
hugo_reyes Fine, go ahead. Tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing -- the fat guy likes to eat. Yeah, I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. You think I don't know that? At least people like me. You know what? Find the damn frog by yourself.
james_ford Hurley, wait, wait. Hey, Hurley! -- Look, man, I'm sorry, alright. This frog is killing me. You've got to help me out -- please.
john_locke So, what do you think?
sayid_jarrah What do you think, John?
john_locke I think he's pretty convincing.
sayid_jarrah Yes, he is.
john_locke The real problem is there's no way we can be sure he's telling the truth.
sayid_jarrah That is not necessarily true. Does Jack have the combination to the armory?
john_locke For now he does.
sayid_jarrah How long would it take for you to change it?
john_locke If you're angry -- looking for someone to punish...
sayid_jarrah Why would I need to punish anyone? I want to find out who he is. I want the truth. And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it. So how long, John, to change the combination?
john_locke Couple minutes, tops.
sayid_jarrah Then I suggest you get started.
sayid_jarrah Did he say anything while--
dr_jack_shephard No, he didn't. He was in shock.
john_locke We can't just leave him laying here, Jack. If people see him it'll create a panic.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, where do you think we should put him?
sayid_jarrah I say we put him in the armory, secure.
john_locke Better to err on the side of safety, Jack. At least until we can be sure.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. For now.
dr_jack_shephard We can pull that cot in here. He shouldn't be on his back.
john_locke Good idea.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, hey, what the hell are you doing?! Sayid! Sayid!
sayid_jarrah What needs to be done.
tariq
sayid_jarrah
tariq
sayid_jarrah
sayid_jarrah The pilot was executed 2 days ago. He's buried in a field 4 kilometers from here. I can take you there.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it. Sayid, open the door! Sayid, answer me!
john_locke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Why isn't this combination working, John? Did you change it?
john_locke Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Why would you do that?
john_locke You were raising an army.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke And why you didn't ask me to help -- well, that's your business -- but there's only one reason to raise an army, Jack. And that's because we're at war. And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door -- that's a part of it, too.
dr_jack_shephard What if he's telling the truth, John?
john_locke What if he's not?
sayid_jarrah Get up.
ben_linus What is happening?
sayid_jarrah Here, let me help you. You said you've been here for 4 months.
ben_linus What?
sayid_jarrah You said you came to this island 4 months ago, yes?
ben_linus Where am I?
sayid_jarrah Please, answer my question.
ben_linus Yeah, yes we landed 4 months ago. Maybe more. Who are you?
sayid_jarrah And you were in a cave for all that time?
ben_linus Off the beach on the North shore of the Island.
sayid_jarrah How far from this beach to where you were captured?
ben_linus I don't know.
sayid_jarrah How many days' walk?
ben_linus 2 -- 2 days.
sayid_jarrah Why did you stay on the beach for so long?
ben_linus Why wouldn't we? We wanted to be there for fly-overs. We had an emergency beacon, a transmitter.
sayid_jarrah What kind of transmitter?
ben_linus An ADF beacon. We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted. Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not. Please, please just -- tell me your name.
sayid_jarrah Your wife, what is her maiden name?
ben_linus Murphy.
sayid_jarrah Where did you meet her?
ben_linus University of Minnesota.
sayid_jarrah How did she die?
ben_linus She got sick.
sayid_jarrah She got sick?
ben_linus It started as a fever. After 2 days she was delirious. Then she died. I don't know why you're asking me all these questions. I don't know why you're treating me this way -- why I have to explain to you who I am when you don't tell me who you are.
sayid_jarrah I was 23 years old when the Americans came to my country. I was a good man. I was a soldier. And when they left, I was something different. For the next 6 years I did things I wish I could erase from my memory -- things which I never thought myself to be capable of. But I did come to learn this -- there was a part of me which was always capable. You want to know who I am? My name is Sayid Jarrah, and I am a torturer.
james_ford Where is it?
hugo_reyes There it is.
james_ford Gotcha.
hugo_reyes Dude, nice catch.
james_ford Well, I'll be damned. All that noise from this tiny critter.
hugo_reyes It kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had. Its name was Stuart. It ran off when I was 10. Well, that's what mom said. I kind of think she threw him out.
james_ford Well, you're a happy little fella, ain't ya?
hugo_reyes I have an idea. Why don't I take him -- far from here -- 2 beaches away? Then maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog. That way he won't keep you up anymore, and everyone's happy.
james_ford Yeah, that's one idea. Here's another.
hugo_reyes Dude.
james_ford I hear with a little ranch they taste just like chicken.
john_locke Give you a hand? Jack, I know this isn't--
dr_jack_shephard Shut up.
dr_jack_shephard Where are the pliers?
sayid_jarrah Tell me about this balloon.
ben_linus What?
sayid_jarrah This balloon that brought you here with your wife. Tell me about it.
ben_linus What do you want to know?
sayid_jarrah Everything.
ben_linus She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide. And when she's up in the air 550,000 cubic feet of helium and a 100,000 of hot air keep her up. And if you could look down on her you'd see a big yellow smiley face on top.
sayid_jarrah Why would you travel in that way?
ben_linus Because I was rich. Because -- it was my dream. And Jennifer thought it would be neat.
sayid_jarrah You "were" rich?
ben_linus I guess I'm thinking of things in the past tense now. How's that for optimism?
sayid_jarrah What did you do to become so rich?
ben_linus I sold my company.
sayid_jarrah What kind of company?
ben_linus Mining.
sayid_jarrah What did you mine?
ben_linus We mined non-metallic minerals. I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties.
sayid_jarrah Give me your hands. Give me your hands!
sayid_jarrah Where is she buried?
ben_linus What?
sayid_jarrah Listen to me. You said you buried your wife. Tell me where.
ben_linus What are you going to...?
sayid_jarrah Where!!
ben_linus In the jungle. By the balloon, in the jungle.
sayid_jarrah How deep? How deep did you dig the grave?
ben_linus I don't -- it was...
sayid_jarrah How deep? How many shovelfuls of earth? Did you use your hands? How long did it take you?!
ben_linus I don't remember.
sayid_jarrah You would remember! You would remember how deep! You would remember every shovelful, every moment! You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside. You would remember if you buried the woman you loved! You would remember -- if it were true!
ben_linus Did you -- did you lose someone? Did you lose someone here on the Island? Did you lose someone, too? What happened to her?
sayid_jarrah It was an accident. It was an accident. The woman responsible thought she was someone else -- someone coming to hurt her -- someone like you!
ben_linus Just, just... This is all a mistake. Slow down here, okay. Hurting me isn't going to bring her back.
sayid_jarrah You know what I lost! Tell me how long!
ben_linus No, no! Help! Help me!
sayid_jarrah Tell me who you are!
dr_jack_shephard Sayid! Sayid!
john_locke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Open it. Open it now, John!
john_locke Jack, this has to happen.
dr_jack_shephard Open that damn door, you understand me! You open it now.
john_locke No.
dr_jack_shephard Now!
ben_linus What do you want me to say? Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it! Just, please.
sayid_jarrah I want you to tell me the truth!
dr_jack_shephard Open the door.
john_locke Let go of me, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Or what? You want to push the button? Open the door.
dr_jack_shephard It's under a minute now, John. You better think fast.
john_locke You wouldn't.
dr_jack_shephard What? I wouldn't what?
john_locke If we don't... You would risk everyone's lives?
dr_jack_shephard You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it's yours now. You're the one who won't risk it, you. Me? I don't think anything's going to happen when we get down to zero.
john_locke Jack!
dr_jack_shephard You want to see what's going to happen? Let's just see what's going to happen.
sayid_jarrah Who are you?!! Who are you?!!
john_locke Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
john_locke Okay, right 15, left...
dr_jack_shephard You think I'm stupid? You open it!
sayid_jarrah He's lying!
dr_jack_shephard Not like this.
ben_linus I'll tell you whatever you want.
sayid_jarrah He's lying! He's lying!
dr_jack_shephard That's enough!
dr_jack_shephard What the hell was that?
sayid_jarrah He is one of them.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? Did he tell you that?
sayid_jarrah No.
dr_jack_shephard Then how do you know?
sayid_jarrah Because I know. He is one of them.
dr_jack_shephard I think that Rousseau thought that about you once, Sayid. If I'm not mistaken she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them.
john_locke He is.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke He is one of them. To Rousseau, we're all Others. I guess it's all relative, huh?
sgt_sam_austen AUSTEN You got a wife, kids?
kelvin_inman I'll take him. It's over. We're pulling out, not going to Baghdad. So your man Saddam gets to stay in power which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ. Guess you're lucky you have a new skill set you can use.
sayid_jarrah What you made me do no human being should ever have to do to another.
kelvin_inman
sayid_jarrah I will never do that again.
kelvin_inman Yeah. Good luck to you, Sayid. Bus fare back to Ramadi. Let's move out.
sayid_jarrah There is a man down in the Hatch. A stranger captured by Rousseau. I beat him. I beat him badly.
charlie_pace Why are you telling me this, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Jack asked me how I knew -- knew for sure that this man was lying. How I knew for sure that he was one of them -- one of the Others. I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him. -- But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack, or even Locke, because both of them have forgotten.
charlie_pace Forgotten? What?
sayid_jarrah That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead. That Claire was taken and kept for days during which god only knows what happened to her. That these people -- these Others -- are merciless, and can take any one of us whenever they choose. So tell me, Charlie, have you forgotten?
