MAN IN BLACK Morning.
JACOB Mornin'.
MAN IN BLACK Mind if I join you?
JACOB Please. Want some fish?
MAN IN BLACK Thank you. I just ate.
JACOB I take it you're here 'cause of the ship.
MAN IN BLACK I am. How did they find the Island?
JACOB You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.
MAN IN BLACK I don't have to ask. You brought them here. Still trying to prove me wrong, aren't you?
JACOB You are wrong.
MAN IN BLACK Am I? They come. They fight. They destroy. They corrupt. It always ends the same.
JACOB It only ends once. Anything that happens before that is just progress.
MAN IN BLACK Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?
JACOB Yes.
MAN IN BLACK One of these days, sooner or later... I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.
JACOB Well, when you do, I'll be right here.
MAN IN BLACK Always nice talking to you, Jacob.
JACOB Nice talking to you, too.
KATE Are you gonna do it?
TOM Uh-uh. You do it.
KATE Fine, I'll do it. But you're gonna be lookout, okay?
TOM Okay.
WOMAN Yeah, I mean, we've been farming the land all the way back to Aines Road.
SHOPKEEPER What you kids got there? Open your bag.
SHOPKEEPER Mhm. Where'd you get this?
KATE I got it over there.
SHOPKEEPER I know you. You're Diane Austen's girl...what's your name?
KATE Katie.
SHOPKEEPER Well Katie, I'm calling your mom, then the cops, because I don't tolerate stealing here, you understand?
MAN No need to do that. I'll pay for it. I hope this is enough. 
SHOPKEEPER Well, as long as somebody pays for it, I guess there's no harm done. But I don't want to see you in here ever again without your parents, you understand me?
KATE Thanks, mister.
JACOB You're welcome. You're not going to steal anymore, are you?
JACOB Be good, Katie. 
CAPTAIN BIRD Welcome aboard, everyone. We will be doing some system checks offshore here before heading out into the open ocean and submerging to our operational running depth. You should be receiving your sedatives and then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.
CAPTAIN BIRD Have a nice rest, and we'll see you on the other side. 
KATE We have to get out of here.
SAWYER Outta here? We're underwater. What the hell are you doing here? How'd you get caught?
KATE I came back to get you.
SAWYER Came back to get me for what?
JULIET Where's Jack?
KATE Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.
SAWYER Why the hell would he do that?
KATE Does it matter? We have to stop him.
SAWYER Sorry, but I'll pass.
KATE Did you hear what I just said?
SAWYER Yeah, I heard you. You just don't get it, Kate. We were happy in Dharmaville 'til y'all showed up. But now that's all over. So we're gonna drink our O.J. and take our chances in the real world. Jack wants to blow up the Island, good for Jack.
JACK Is there anything in there about how we were supposed to move a ten-ton bomb across the Island?
SAYID Actually, it's twenty tons. Fortunately, it seems Faraday never intended freight the device in its entirety.
ELOISE What?
SAYID He left detailed instructions on how to remove the plutonium core...and how to detonate it.
JACK Faraday told me that we needed to wipe out some kind of pocket of energy. Is only part of the bomb going to be enough to do that?
SAYID The core itself is a thermonuclear weapon. It'll be more than enough.
RICHARD Hey, hey, wait. We sealed that thing up twenty years ago, and we put it underground because it was emitting radiation. Does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise?
ELOISE Richard --
RICHARD You're pregnant.
ELOISE Which is exactly why we have to help them see this through.
ELOISE Once the core is removed, then what?
SAYID Then, we have approximately two hours to take it to the Swan site.
JACK Two hours?
SAYID When Faraday returned to the Island, he was very explicit about this timetable.
JACK Well then, we better get moving.
RADZINSKY Who stopped the damn drill!?
CHANG I did.
RADZINSKY Why?
CHANG Because when we passed seventy meters, the drill temp went up sixty degrees, and I didn't want it to melt.
RADZINSKY Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water. So cool it down and turn it on. 
CHANG Stuart, we just evacuated the Island of all nonessential personnel. We're in the midst of a possible insurrection. Do you really think this is the ideal time for your experiments?
RADZINSKY I've been working on this project for six years. Designing a station that'll be able to manipulate electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.
CHANG Have you thought about the consequences of drilling into that pocket? We have no idea what we are gonna --
RADZINSKY If Edison was only worried about the consequences, we'd all still be sitting in the dark. I came to this Island to change the world, Pierre; that's exactly what I intend to do.  Let's get it started! 
LOCKE Take five, everybody! We've still got a ways to go to get to Jacob.
SUN Who's Jacob?
BEN He's in charge of this Island.
SUN You said John was in charge.
BEN No, I said he was the leader, a title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary. But everyone answers to someone, and the leader answers to Jacob.
SUN What's he like?
BEN I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.
LOCKE You've been staring for the last ten minutes, Richard. Is there something you'd like to ask me?
RICHARD Ben told me that he strangled you.
LOCKE That is my recollection, yes.
RICHARD He said he was sure you were dead. That he saw your coffin loaded onto that plane that you came back on. How are you alive?
LOCKE Well, you've been on this Island much longer than I have, Richard. If anyone should have an explanation, I'd think it would be you.
RICHARD I - I have been here a long time, John. And I have seen things on this Island that I could barely describe, but I've never seen someone come back to life.
LOCKE And I've never seen anyone who doesn't age. Doesn't mean it can't happen.
RICHARD I'm this way because of Jacob. And if I had to guess, he's the reason you're not in that coffin anymore.
LOCKE I agree completely, Richard. That's why I'm doing this. So I can thank him. Once I've done that, we're gonna need to deal with the rest of the passengers from the Ajira flight that brought me here.
RICHARD What do you mean, 'deal with them'?
LOCKE You know what I mean.
LOCKE Let's go!
ILANA Untie the crate.
BRAM Why'd we even bring this yahoo?
ILANA Because, we might need him.
BRAM For what? He didn't know the answer to the question.
ILANA That doesn't mean he's not important.
BRAM What, you think he's a candidate?
ILANA He's awake.
BRAM How long you been listening to us?
FRANK Long enough to wonder what the hell I'm a candidate for. Who the hell are you people?
ILANA We're friends.
FRANK So you smack all your friends in the face with a rifle, shove 'em in a boat, and kidnap 'em?
ILANA Only the ones we like.
BRAM Let's go.
FRANK What's in the box?
BRAM Your call.
ILANA Open it.
FRANK Terrific.
MAN Need a pen, son?
JAMES Yeah, thanks.
JACOB Here you go. You can keep it.
JACOB I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.
UNCLE DOUG Come on, Jimmy. We gotta get to the cemetery, okay? What you writin'?
JAMES Nothin'.
DOUG Dear Mr. Sawyer... You don't know who I am, but I know who you are, and what you done. Listen to me, Jimmy. I know you're angry at the man that did this to your momma and daddy. And hell, you got every right to be. But you gotta move on, boy. They're gone, and there ain't nothing you can do to change that. What's done is done. Now promise me you're not going to finish that letter.
JAMES I promise.
DOUG Good. Come on, let's go say goodbye.
SAWYER Let me get this straight. Jack sets off the nuke, which somehow...resets everything. So flight 815 never crashes...lands in L.A. safe and sound, and none of this ever happened.
KATE Sawyer, if Jack does this he could kill everyone on the Island.
SAWYER Yeah, I heard that part.
KATE And you're okay with that?
SAWYER You ain't hearin' me, Kate. I made a choice, and I'm stickin' to it. I decided to leave, and I'm leavin'.
MITCH Alright, here's your sedatives.
SAWYER What the hell did you just do?
JULIET We decided to leave this Island, James, we did. And now we're going back.
SAWYER Are you serious?
JULIET We can't just let those people die. You want out? Or do you want to stay here and whine about it?
SAWYER Unlock the damn cuffs.
CAPTAIN BIRD Galaga to base. System check is complete. We're locked on a departure bearing and ready to leave the Island.
VOICE OVER SPEAKER Roger that, Galaga. Have a safe trip! See you when you return.
JULIET Give me your gun.
SAWYER Appreciate that, captain. Now we need you to surface the sub.
BIRD What? I can't take this sub up--
SAWYER Oh, I think you can.
JULIET Once we're gone, proceed on course. Whatever you do, do not take those people back to the Island. Understand?
BIRD What if Horace tries to contact me, hmm? What am I supposed to say?
SAWYER You ain't home.
JULIET Go.
.
JACK Sayid, is this big enough?
SAYID That'll do.
JACK Are you done with Faraday's journal?
SAYID Take it.
RICHARD Can I ask you a question?
JACK Sure.
RICHARD Over, uh, twenty years ago, a man named John Locke, he walked right into our camp. And he told me that he was going to be our leader. Now I've gone off the Island three times, to visit him. But he never seemed particularly special to me.
JACK You said you had a question.
RICHARD You know him? Locke?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, I know him. And if I were you, I wouldn't give up on him.
LOCKE Why haven't you told him yet?
BEN Told who what?
LOCKE Richard. Why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?
BEN If by plans you mean murdering him, John, I assumed you'd want to keep that a secret.
LOCKE When did that ever stop you?
BEN Well, I starting thinking differently about things when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me if I didn't do everything you said.
LOCKE Whoa, whoa, wait...where did this happen?
BEN In that cavern, beneath the Temple. When we went to see the monster.
LOCKE So you're willing to do whatever I say, no matter what it is?
BEN Yes.
LOCKE Well, then. I guess I won't have to convince you after all.
BEN Convince me to do what?
LOCKE I'm not going to kill Jacob, Ben. You are.
SAYID Paris or Rome?
NADIA No. 
SAYID Florence?
NADIA It doesn't matter, as long as we're together!
SAYID Yes it does! It's our anniversary, we have to find the perfect place.
NADIA Can we settle for finding my sunglasses?
JACOB Excuse me, sir? Could you help me? I'm sorry, I think I'm lost. Are you from Los Angeles?
SAYID What are you looking for?
NADIA I found them!
SAYID Nadia! Nadia?
NADIA Take me home, take me home.
SAYID Time is short, let's go.
RICHARD Alright, stay back.
JACK It's one of the DHARMA houses. I'll go first.
ELOISE Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here. I'll go first. Because if someone in that house is a threat, you might hesitate. But I won't.
RICHARD Alright, okay, Eloise, go on, after you.
ELOISE Once we give you the all clear, then you bring the bomb. We don't want any accidents --
JACK What the hell are you doing?
RICHARD I'm protecting our leader. Get back. She's gonna be angry when she wakes up, but that's a lot better than being dead. She ordered me to help you, we helped you, now you're on your own. I'm taking her out the way we came in.
SAYID After you.
VOICE OVER SPEAKER We are in a code black! Report with your weapons to your security assignment immediately. If you come into contact with a hostile, you are authorized to use deadly force.
JACK How the hell are we going to get out of here?
SAYID We hide in plain sight. 
PHIL You go over there by the gate, and you get... ...so you guys go.
ROGER Hey! HEY! You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid!
SAYID Don't fire that weapon, I'm carrying a nuclear de---
JIN Get in!
JACK Drive!
SAWYER From the looks of the sun, I'd say that's the north shore over there.
KATE The sun's over there, that's gotta be the west coast.
SAWYER Really? You got a compass?
KATE No, do you?
KATE Thank you.
JULIET For what?
KATE For backing me up at the sub.
JULIET No problem.
SAWYER I got no idea where the hell we are!
SAWYER Vincent! Come here! Hey! Hey! How you doin', boy? Haven't seen you since the flamin' arrows three years ago!
JULIET Hey! How'd you survive alone out here?
ROSE Oh, hell no. Bernard!
ROSE They found us.
BERNARD Son of a bitch.
MILES Is that a bomb?!
JACK Try not to move. I need to stop the bleeding.
HURLEY What's going on back there? Is Sayid okay?
JACK Does he look okay?! Just keep your eyes on the damn road!
HURLEY Ah, let's pull over!
MILES And get shot! Just drive!
HURLEY I don't know where we're going.
JACK The Swan site. Head to the Swan.
HURLEY Why do you want to go there? If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we--
JACK Hurley, if you want to save Sayid, take us to the Swan!
HURLEY The Swan it is.
JIN Jack, what's at the Swan?
JACK I think I found a way to get you back to your wife. So hold on.
SAWYER You're telling me you've just been living out here in the jungle for the past three years, by yourselves?
ROSE Uh-huh.
SAWYER Well, I'm sorry y'all got left behind. Didn't you hear me shout out, "Meet at the creek"?
BERNARD You mean with flaming arrows raining down around us, killing everyone we knew? Oh, sure, we heard ya.
SAWYER Well, we spent all sorts of time looking for ya. I had Jin out searching the Island grid by grid.
ROSE Yeah, we know.
SAWYER You know?
ROSE Oh, sure, you guys all joined up with the DHARMA Initiative.
SAWYER Well, damn, I could've brought both y'all in. Why didn't you find a way to tell us you were out here?
ROSE Because we're retired.
SAWYER So y'all been scavenging food and living out in a hut by yourselves.
ROSE People try their whole lives to get themselves a nice, quiet place near the ocean where they can live in peace. And we did it. That's what we made for ourselves.
SAWYER Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but... your condo's about to go ka-blooey.
KATE Jack has a bomb.
ROSE Who cares?
KATE Excuse me?
ROSE It's always something with you people. Now you say Jack's got a bomb. And what, you guys are all gonna try to stop him, right?
JULIET Yeah, that's right.
ROSE We traveled back 30 years in time, and you're still trying to find ways to shoot each other?
JULIET Rose, we just need to know which way the DHARMA Barracks are from here so we can stop Jack, or you're gonna be dead. We all will.
BERNARD So we die. We just care about being together. That's all that matters in the end.
ROSE The Barracks are 5 miles that way.
SAWYER Bernard. 
BERNARD Sawyer.
SAWYER Rose. 
ROSE Thank you.
SAWYER Let's go.
JULIET Bye.
BERNARD You sure you don't want some tea?
JULIET Maybe another time.
LAPIDUS I wish you'd never showed me what was in this damn box. What the hell you gonna do with it anyway?
BRAM We need to show it to somebody.
LAPIDUS What for?
BRAM So they'll know what they're up against.
LAPIUS What exactly are they up against?
BRAM Something a hell of a lot scarier than what's in this box, Frank. Don't worry, though. As long as you're with us, you're fine.
LAPIDUS That'd be reassuring if I knew who you were, "friend".
BRAM We are the good guys.
LAPIDUS In my experience, the people who go out of their way to tell you that the good guys are the bad guys.
ILANA We're here.
BRAM Look at the ash!
ILANA Wait here.
NURSE Как себя чувствуете? Пить хочется? 
NURSE К Вам кто-то пришёл. Я ему объяснила, в каком Вы состоянии... Но он всё равно настоял на том, чтобы увидеться с Вами. У Вас ещё не было посетителей. Вам это пойдёт на пользу. 
JACOB Извини, что не смог прийти раньше 
ILANA Я очень рада тебя видеть 
JACOB I'm here because I need your help. Can you do that? Will you help me, Ilana?
ILANA Yes.
BRAM What happened?
ILANA He isn't there, hasn't been in a long time. Someone else has been using it.  Burn it!
LAPIDUS I'm no tree hugger or anything, but that's a pretty good way to torch the whole jungle, don't you think?
BRAM So what now?
BRAM Well, I guess we know where we're going.
WOMAN Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Call 9-1-1!
JACOB Don't worry, everything's gonna be alright. I'm sorry this happened to you. 
SUN This is our old camp.
LOCKE Home sweet home. Alright, everyone! Richard tells me we should get to where we're going by nightfall. So why don't you all take this opportunity to rest up and catch your breath. Considering what I have planned for you, you're gonna need it. Everything alright?
BEN I was enjoying some alone time.
LOCKE You see what's behind you?
BEN It's a door. How about that?
LOCKE Not just a door, Ben. It's the door to the hatch. Where you and I first met. Do you mind if I ask you a question?
BEN I'm a Pisces.
LOCKE What happened that day at the cabin? When you first took me to meet Jacob?
BEN Well, you clearly already know that I was talking to an empty chair, John. That I was pretending. Which is not to say that I wasn't as surprised as you were when things started flying around the room.
LOCKE But why would go to all the trouble to make something like that up?
BEN I was embarrassed. I didn't want you to know that I had never seen Jacob. So yes, I lied. That's what I do.
LOCKE Alright, then.
BEN Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?
LOCKE Because, despite your loyal service to this Island, you got cancer. You had to watch your own daughter gunned down right in front of you. And your reward for those sacrifices? You were banished. And you did all this in the name of a man you'd never even met. So the question is, Ben, why the hell wouldn't you want to kill Jacob?
SUN 처음 본 그 순간부터 당신을 사랑했어요. 그리고 앞으로 함께 살아갈 미래의 당신도 사랑합니다. 이 반지로 당신에게 서약합니다. 
JIN 난 적어 가지고 왔는데 괜찮겠지? 당신과 내가 평생 함께 한다는 의미로 '영원히 함께 하길'이라고 우리 결혼반지에 새겼어. 이 반지로 당신에게... 서약합니다. 
SUN 이모! 
AUNTIE 이제 결혼도 했으니까 아이는 언제나 가질거니? 
SUN 허니문 베이비가 될지도 모르죠. 
JACOB 두 분 결혼을 축하합니다. 두 분의 사랑은 아주 특별한 것입니다. 절대로 당연하게 생각하시면 안됩니다. 
SUN 누구에요? 
JIN 누군지 몰라도, 한국말은 잘하네. 
JACK How much further?
HURLEY Uhh...we're about five minutes away!
SAYID You can't stop the bleeding.
JACK I need fresh dressings.
MILES Jack! So this bomb is supposed to what, blow us back in time?
JACK We're not going back in time.
MILES Right, because that would be ridiculous!
SAYID I need to modify the bomb. I can make it so it detonates on impact. Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the Incident, or all this will be for nothing.
JACK Why the hell are we stopping?
HURLEY That's why.
LOCKE What is it? Why are we stopping?
RICHARD You'll see.
LOCKE Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard, but what does it have to do with Jacob?
RICHARD It's where he lives.
