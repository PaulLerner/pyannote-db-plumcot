FARADAY Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it? The hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury. Where is it?
RICHARD Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk. Okay? Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.
FARADAY I'm gonna give you three seconds. One...
RICHARD Don't do this.
KATE What's he doing down there? Jack, he's crazy.
JACK Is he? What if this is why we're here? What if this is our one chance to put things back the way they're supposed to be?
JACK No.
KATE What the hell do you think you're doing?!
JACK They shot him! I'm gonna go help.
KATE Yeah, they're gonna shoot you, too. We have to go, Jack. We have to go now.
KATE Jack!
2ND MAN Don't you move!
2ND MAN Don't move.
KATE Hey!
WIDMORE Just who the bloody hell might you be?
WIDMORE Eloise! What happened?
RICHARD This man walked into camp and put a gun to my head, and Eloise... reacted. Where'd you find them?
WIDMORE Crouched in the bushes... like rats.
ELOISE Did you two come here with this man?
JACK Yes.
ELOISE Put them in my tent.
WIDMORE Would you care to tell me, Eloise, why the DHARMA Initiative seems to have declared war on us?
ELOISE These people aren't from the DHARMA Initiative, Charles.
WIDMORE Then where the hell are they from?
VANESSA Richard, he's here.
LOCKE I brought dinner.
RICHARD John?
LOCKE Hello, Richard. It's been a while.
RICHARD It's--it's been, uh, three years. What happened? What--where--where were you?
LOCKE I'll explain on the way.
RICHARD On the way where?
LOCKE It's gonna be night soon. You and I have an errand to run, and we don't have a lot of time.
LOCKE What's wrong?
RICHARD Something different about you.
LOCKE I have a purpose now.
RICHARD What's he doing here?
LOCKE He helped me get back.
SUN Why did Locke say these were his people?
BEN When I left the Island, John stepped in. He's the leader now.
SUN Who's that man he's talking to?
BEN His name is Richard Alpert. He's a kind of... adviser. And he has had that job for a very, very long time.
BEN Sun? What are you...
SUN Were you here in 1977?
RICHARD Excuse me?
SUN These people... Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, Hugo Reyes. They were here with my husband--Jin Kwon. Were you here? Do you remember them? A--any of them?
RICHARD Yes, I was here 30 years ago. And I do. I remember these people. I remember meeting them very clearly, because... I watched them all die.
LOCKE Drink of water?
SUN Do you think it's true? They're all dead?
LOCKE I don't think we went through all this for nothing, Sun.
RICHARD I'm ready, John.
LOCKE You still have that compass I gave you?
RICHARD A little rusty, but she can still find north.
LOCKE Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.
BEN What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people? Afraid I'll stage a coup?
LOCKE I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.
BEN Well, in that case, I'd love to come.
LOCKE Good. Stay here. We'll be back in a couple of hours. I'll see what I can find out. But whatever happens, Sun, you have my word--if there's a way for you and Jin to be together again, if there's a way to save our people... I'll find it.
JACK Take it easy on her!
ERIK Don't talk. Understand?
KATE Are you okay?
JACK Yeah.
KATE You know, before we were caught... you said that we needed to put things back the way they were supposed to be. What did you mean by that?
JACK If we can do what Faraday said... our plane never crashes... Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles. And everyone we lost since we got here... they'd all be alive.
KATE And what about us? We just... go on living our life because we've never met?
JACK All the misery that we've been through... we'd just wipe it clean. Never happened.
KATE It was not all misery.
JACK Enough of it was.
ELOISE The man I shot... what did he need the bomb for?
ELOISE I need you to tell me why he needed the bomb.
JACK I don't think you'd believe me if I did.
ELOISE When I was 17 years old, I took a young man to the bomb. He proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground, then things would work out splendidly. When I asked him how he could be so sure... he said that he was from the future. And then he disappeared, right in front of my bloody eyes. Ten minutes ago, I shot that man in the back. And before he... died... he told me that he... he said he was my son. Explain to me... and you have my word I will believe you. How is this my handwriting if I don't remember writing it?
JACK Because you haven't written it yet. I know this is hard to understand, but... what you just did... it was an accident, and I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.
ELOISE What?
JACK Your son came back here because he had figured out a way to change things. He doesn't have to be dead. You don't have to have killed him. If we do what's written in that journal... none of this will have happened.
ELOISE Does he know what he's talking about?
KATE He thinks he does.
ELOISE All right then, I'll take you to the bomb. Just... one small issue, however. We secured it over 20 years ago underground. But since that time, it appears that someone's built an entire village over it.
JACK The DHARMA Initiative?
ELOISE However... it appears that you two have been passing yourselves off as members, so... I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.
JACK Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that. 
RADZINSKY That woman--where is she now?
SAWYER Call my lawyer.
HORACE Stuart! What the hell are you doing?
RADZINSKY I'm getting answers. Where is she?!
HORACE Hey. Hey! Stop! Damn it, stop. That is an order. I'm still in charge here.
RADZINSKY No, you were in charge, Horace. But if we're gonna protect our people and all the work we're doing here, you don't have the stomach for what happens next.
RADZINSKY Phil.
RADZINSKY Okay, Jim, last chance. You tell me where she is...
RADZINSKY ...or so help me God, I will kill you.
JULIET Hey!
RADZINSKY You ready to talk now?
SAWYER Nope.
RADZINSKY Believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim. So why don't you tell me where your girlfriend took the boy? She bring him to the Hostiles? You know where they are?
JULIET Aah! Stop! Please!
RADZINSKY You want me to stop? Then tell me what I want to know!
JULIET Stuart, please. We have known each other for three years. We are not bad people! We are not here to hurt you!
SAWYER Juliet... don't.  Whatever you tell 'em, they ain't gonna believe you.  It's only gonna get more people hurt.
HORACE What are we doing, man? Beating him is pointless. Okay? He's not gonna talk.
PHIL I can make him talk.
SAWYER Son of a bitch!
HORACE Easy. Easy.
SAWYER You're a dead man, Phil. I'm gonna kill you.
MITCH Mr. Radzinsky? There's still no sign of Miles or Jin. But the recruits from last week... I got their sub's manifest from Amy. There were three last-minute add-ons. They were the two people that shot at you--Shephard and Austen--and one guy we can't track down. He's gotta be a part of this.
RADZINSKY Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?
PHIL He's the fat guy.
HURLEY So what's the rescue plan?
MILES Rescue plan? We're heading to the beach. Why do you think we sent you for food?
HURLEY But they got Sawyer and Juliet.
MILES And there are 30 of them, and they all have guns. The only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.
HURLEY We gotta do something. I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.
MILES Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?
DR. CHANG I could ask you the same question.
HURLEY But we asked you first.
DR. CHANG Your friend Faraday said that you were from the future. I need to know if he was telling the truth.
HURLEY Dude, that's ridiculous.
DR. CHANG What year were you born? What year?
HURLEY Uh... 1931?
DR. CHANG You're 46?
HURLEY Yeah. Yes, I am.
DR. CHANG So you fought in the Korean War?
HURLEY There's... no such thing.
DR. CHANG Who's the President of the United States?
HURLEY All right, dude, we're from the future. Sorry.
DR. CHANG It's true then? You are my son?
MILES Yeah, it's true.
DR. CHANG Your friend--the physicist--he also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the Island. He said there was going to be a massive accident at the Swan. Now is that true?
MILES He's been right about everything so far. If Faraday said get people off the Island... I'd do it.
DR. CHANG Well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.
WIDMORE Tell me something. Why is it that this man looks... familiar to me?
ELOISE Richard... you and Erik are coming with me.
WIDMORE Going with you where?
ELOISE You can untie them. And... would you mind giving us a moment? I'm taking them to the bomb.
WIDMORE What? Are you insane? I'm worried about you. Not in your condition. 
JACK Who is he?
RICHARD The man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore. He and Eloise are... well, let's just say love can be complicated.
ELOISE All right. Let's move out.
RICHARD So, John... you, uh, you ready to tell me where you've been the last three years?
LOCKE You really don't know?
RICHARD Well, I know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel, that you and I were sitting on a log. There was a bright light. There was a loud noise, and then you just... you disappeared.
LOCKE Well, Richard, you're just about to see where I disappeared to. And after we're finished with that, I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.
BEN That's... not how it works, John.
LOCKE Is that true, Richard? Is this gonna be a problem?
RICHARD You just got back, John. There's no reason to rush into--
LOCKE I am the leader now. Right?
RICHARD Yes, John. That's right.
LOCKE Good. Then I would like you to take me to Jacob. Can you do that?
RICHARD Yeah, of course.
LOCKE Fantastic. Let's keep moving. We're almost to the plane.
BEN What plane?
LOCKE It's a Beechcraft--used to smuggle heroin. Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here. All right, Richard, listen very carefully because you're only gonna have about three minutes to get this right.
RICHARD Get what right?
LOCKE A man's about to walk out of the jungle. He's been shot in the leg.
LOCKE You'll need this to get the bullet out.
RICHARD Uh, I'm sorry, John. I'm not--
LOCKE Now just listen. This is the important part. You're gonna need to tell him that he has to bring everyone who left back to the Island. And when he asks how to do that... You tell him he's gonna have to die.
BEN Who is that man, John?
LOCKE Me.
LOCKE Aah!
LOCKE Richard?
LOCKE Richard... What is happening?
RICHARD What's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Okay, here.
RICHARD I need to get the bullet out.
LOCKE How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
RICHARD Because you told me there was, John.
LOCKE No, no. No, I didn't.
RICHARD Well... you will.
BEN This must be quite the out-of-body experience.
LOCKE Something like that.
BEN Your timing was impeccable, John. How did you know when to be here?
LOCKE The Island told me. Didn't it ever tell you things?
BEN No, John. And clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is, or you wouldn't need Richard to show you.
LOCKE You've never seen him.
BEN What?
LOCKE Jacob. You've never seen him, have you?
BEN What just happened? Where did you go?
LOCKE To give Richard his compass back.
RICHARD You want the bullet?
LOCKE Keep it. Everything go all right?
RICHARD Well, you--you seemed pretty convinced, especially when I said you were gonna die. I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.
LOCKE Actually, Richard, it did. We better get back to camp.
DR. CHANG You need to evacuate the Island of all nonessential personnel, and you need to do it...
DR. CHANG What the hell is going on here?
RADZINSKY Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan right now, Chang? We're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.
DR. CHANG We're under imminent threat. If we start drilling, there's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.
RADZINSKY We are drilling and on schedule.
DR. CHANG Horace, you're in charge.
RADZINSKY He's not in charge anymore. This is my decision, and it's been made. We keep working.
SAWYER Put us on the sub.
SAWYER He's right. It ain't safe. Put the women and children on the sub and get 'em the hell out of here. And if you put me and Juliet on the sub with 'em... we'll tell you anything you wanna know. You okay with that, sweetheart?
JULIET Absolutely.
RADZINSKY You want on that sub, Jim?
RADZINSKY Draw me a map. I wanna know exactly where the Hostiles are.
ELOISE You two know how to swim?
KATE Why don't we just go around it?
ELOISE No, dear, we need to go in. We have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.
KATE I'm not going.
JACK What?
KATE I'm gonna go back and find everyone else. I... I can't go any further with you, Jack. Not this time.
JACK Kate, you can't go back there now. They know about us. They... they tried to kill us.
KATE And what are you trying to do? Bye, Jack.
ERIK You're not going anywhere.
JACK No, no, you don't need to do that.
ELOISE We're not in the habit of telling our secrets to strangers, then just letting them saunter off.
KATE You know I don't care about your secrets. I just wanna leave.
JACK Look, just put the gun--
ERIK Step away!
JACK If she wants to leave--
ERIK Hey! I said stop!
JACK --she can leave!
RICHARD What are we doing here, Eloise? That man just killed one of our own people, and you're acting like it doesn't matter.
ELOISE If these people are right about what they're about to do, Richard, it won't matter.
RICHARD And what are they about to do?
SAYID So you're telling me you're going to erase the last three years of our lives?
JACK We can change things, Sayid.
SAYID I don't know if you're aware of this, but I've already changed things. I killed Benjamin Linus, and we're all still here.
KATE It's because you didn't kill him. Sawyer and me took him to the Others so that they could save him.
SAYID Why did you do that?
KATE Why did I do that? Since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs become okay?
JACK The three of us disappeared off that plane and ended up here, ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.
KATE And if you're wrong, then everyone on the Island dies. Do you understand that?
JACK I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it. This is why we're here.  This is our destiny.
KATE Do you know who you sound like? Because he was crazy, too, Jack. You said so yourself.
JACK Well, maybe I was wrong.
KATE No, you were right. I'm going back to find the rest of our people, because if I can't stop you, then maybe they can.
MAN The submarine departs in 30 minutes. All evacuees, please proceed to the dock.
JEANNETTE LEWIS Come now, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE Just stay with me.
LARA This is ridiculous. I can help you.
DR. CHANG No, Lara, you can't. Just go over there.
LARA Why are you so angry? 
DR. CHANG I want you to leave, now! 
HURLEY Why is he yelling at her, dude?
MILES It's the only way he can get her to leave.
HURLEY Sorry, man.
JIN We'd better get going.
MILES Wait! Whoa! Whoa! Wait--wait a second.
MILES It's Jim and Juliet. Why the hell are they... putting them on the sub?
HURLEY Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Sawyer always has a plan, right?
SAWYER We'll buy Microsoft.
JULIET Excuse me?
SAWYER Then we'll bet the Cowboys in the '78 Super Bowl. We're gonna be rich. Look, I'm sorry. I should've listened to you when you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.
JULIET I'm glad you talked me out of it.
MITCH Come on, LaFleur. Get in.
SAWYER Ladies first.
SAWYER Good riddance.
JACK If I don't see you the other side, I won't blame you.
ELOISE Now take a deep breath and follow Richard under.
ELOISE There's an opening in the bottom of the rocks at the far side.
JACK That was a lot further than I thought it was.  Where are we?
RICHARD The tunnels.
JACK You wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?
RICHARD The same way we brought it in.
JACK I assume you don't mean through the pool.
RICHARD It's a 12-foot long, 40,000-pound hydrogen bomb. No, not through the pool.
JACK I didn't think you'd come.
SAYID Well, if this works, you might just save us all. And if it doesn't? At least you'll put us out of our misery.
ELOISE All right. Let's get started.
RICHARD I'll have a tent prepared for you, John. We'll get going first thing in the morning.
LOCKE I thought we could leave right now.
RICHARD Now?
LOCKE I'm eager.
RICHARD We can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us should go to my tent and talk about--
LOCKE Is this everyone?
RICHARD Well, there's another group at the Temple, but--
LOCKE Well, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to everyone here now.
RICHARD Of course. Be my guest.
LOCKE Hello, everyone. My name is John Locke. I've been told that... for some time, you all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob. And yet, oddly enough, it seems that no one has actually seen him. Now I'm sure there are very good reasons why his existence and whereabouts are secret. I just don't know what they are.
LOCKE And to be honest with all of you, if there's a man telling us what to do, I want to know who he is.
SUN This man--Jacob? Can he tell us how to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?
LOCKE Absolutely. Richard has agreed to show us where we need to go. So I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now. And I'd like all of you to come with me.
RICHARD I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.
BEN Why do you think I tried to kill him?
MITCH We're shovin' off in two minutes. Appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.
SAWYER Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.
JULIET What are we gonna do when we get to Ann Arbor?
SAWYER We ain't going to Ann Arbor.
JULIET What do you mean?
SAWYER These guys ain't cops. They got no authority over us back in the real world. So once we dock, wherever we dock... we're free.
JULIET "Real world."  I don't even know what that means anymore.
SAWYER Hey, come here.
SAWYER Whatever happens, I got your back, remember?
JULIET I love you.
SAWYER I love you back.
PHIL Hold on! Don't close the hatch! Horace wants her off the Island, too. We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.  Actually caught her coming back into town. Cuff her over there with the others.
KATE Hey. 
SAWYER Hey.
MAN Clear the bridge. All personnel, lay below on the double.
ENGINEER  We're away. Engineering, take your stations. Boat is clear for sea.
MAN All hands to your stations. Prepare to dive.
MAN Clear the bridge. All hands below.
ENGINEER  Stand by main vents. Diving position.
MAN Dive officer to the com, dive officer to the com.
ENGINEER Stand by on ballast tanks.
MAN Ship is secure for dive, repeat, ship is secure for for dive. Stand by for dive.
ENGINEER Ship to dive, please.
MAN Clear engines two and three. Test two and three.
SAYID Jack.  I'm sure it's occurred to you that this woman's motivation in helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb is only to annihilate the DHARMA Initiative.
JACK Yes, but I still trust her.
SAYID Why?
JACK Because 30 years from now, she's the one who's gonna tell us how to get back to the Island.
SAYID And that makes you trust her?
ELOISE Well... now what?
LOCKE Beautiful day, isn't it?
BEN Yes... so far. Richard had some concerns.
LOCKE Concerns about what?
BEN This pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable. He's expressed... reservations about whether or not you know what the hell you're doing.
LOCKE I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Ben.
BEN I know we've had our differences in the past, John, but I'm here to follow you now. So if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, then I'll do whatever--
LOCKE I'm not interested in being reunited with my people.
BEN What do you mean? You told Sun--
LOCKE I know what I told her, but that's not why we're going to Jacob.
BEN Then why are we going to Jacob?
LOCKE So I can kill him.
