YOUNG BEN Hey Phil.
PHIL Hey.
YOUNG BEN I brought another sandwich for him. Chicken salad this time.
PHIL Yeah, I don't think it's the menu. He's not eating. Save yourself the trouble kid.
YOUNG BEN But Horace told me to.
PHIL Why does he care so much? That guy's a hostile.
YOUNG BEN That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
PHIL Whatever.
YOUNG BEN Brought you a sandwich. And a book. I read it twice. It's good.
SAYID Thank you.
YOUNG BEN Did Richard send you? Richard. He's your leader, right? It's just a camera. They can see, but they can't hear. Four years ago I ran away into the jungle and Richard found me. I said I wanted to leave. That I wanted to join you. So I've been patient. And if you're patient too, I think I can help you.
[Flashback - A man rushes in through a doorway, frantically dropping his bags and shutting the door behind him. He scrambles along hallway into a room, whose door he deadbolts upon entering. He briefly stops to listen at the door. When he hears banging noises coming from outside the room, he rushes to a large wooden cabinet and begins emptying it of its contents. A safe is revealed inside. The banging noises continue as the man enters the combination and opens the safe. Suddenly, the room’s door bursts open and Sayid appears, holding a gun, which he points at the man.
MAN 2 Подожди! Подожди! Подожди, не стреляй! Триста или четыреста тысяч евро. Они все твои. Пожалуйста, пожалуйста. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on, don't shoot! Three or four hundred thousand euros. It's all yours . Please, pleasе. 
BEN How'd it go?
SAYID He tried to bribe me. It didn’t work.
BEN Of course it didn't.
SAYID Where to now?
BEN Nowhere. You're done.
SAYID What do you mean I'm done?
BEN We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends. It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid. 
SAYID So that's it? I killed all those people for you, and now you're just walking away?
BEN You didn't kill them for me, Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations! Mission accomplished! 
SAYID What do I do now?
BEN I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid. 
HORACE Put out your hands. Come on.
SAYID Thank you.
HORACE It's nice to finally hear your voice. I'm Horace.
HORACE Now's the part where you tell me your name. I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle.
RADZINSKY Ask him about the model.
HORACE Radzinsky! I got this. Those handcuffs...are you having some kind of problem with your people? Because either you're in some kind of disagreement, which makes me want to help you, or you're a spy, trying to infiltrate us. So which is it?
HORACE Okay. I'm gonna give you an hour to decide whether you want to talk to me. But if you decide you don’t want to, then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level.
SAWYER I think your bacon's ready.
JULIET Hmm. I forgot.
SAWYER What's on the TV? Ah.
JULIET It's over, isn't it?
SAWYER What's over?
JULIET This. Us. Playing house. All of it. I never actually thought they'd come back.
SAWYER So they're back! Nothing's changed.
JULIET What if Sayid tells them who he is?
SAWYER Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'. Hey. I got this under control.
SAWYER Mornin' H.
HORACE Jim.
SAWYER What's up?
HORACE Juliet.
JULIET Horace.
HORACE I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem.
SAWYER Why, what'd he say?
HORACE Nothing. Which is what worries me. We need to find out why he violated the truce. Why the hell he would come into our territory. I'm just going to have to have Oldham do his thing on him.
SAWYER That psychopath? No way!
HORACE What choice do I have?
SAWYER Just let me have a go at him alone.
HORACE Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man, he is not gonna talk.
SAWYER Oh, he'll talk to me.
PHIL Mr. LaFleur!
SAWYER Take your lunch Phil.
PHIL You going back there alone?
SAWYER Take your lunch, Phil. 
SAWYER How you doin'?
SAYID A twelve-year-old Ben Linus brought me a chicken salad sandwich. How do you think I'm doing?
SAWYER Sweet kid, huh?
SAYID How can you live with him here?
SAWYER 'Cause I ain't got a choice.
SAYID Is that so?
SAWYER Let's see how you feel after three years of livin' in the seventies. Lucky for you, I spent that time gettin' myself into a position to save your ass. I'm sorry, Sayid. 
SAYID What are you doing?!
SAWYER When I tell them I got your confession I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy.
SAYID What confession?
SAWYER We're gonna say you were trying to defect. You're gonna offer some intel on the others in exchange for living with us.
SAYID And why in God's name would I want to do that?
SAWYER What the hell else am I supposed to do with you?
SAYID Let me go!
SAWYER And then what? I can’t just let you go!
SAYID Why not?
SAWYER 'Cause these people trust me! I've built a life here – and a pretty good one. I let you go, all that goes away. So you got yourself a choice, Chief. Either you cooperate and join the party in Dharmaville, or you're on your own.
SAYID Then I guess I'm on my own.
HURLEY Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really bring out the ham.
JACK Thanks, Hurley.
HURLEY So... What's going on with Sayid?
JACK Don't know anything yet.
KATE What do you mean, you don't know anything? I thought you were at Sawyer's last night. What did he tell you?
JACK He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.
HURLEY And you're going to?
KATE I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.
HURLEY Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?
KATE Well, why wouldn't she?
HURLEY 'Cause they're together.
KATE What do you mean, they're together?
HURLEY "Together" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, "together" like you guys were. I thought it was kind of obvious. I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
JACK Hurley.
HURLEY Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles.
KATE Did you know?
JACK Yeah.
KATE Hmm.
ROGER You know what I can't figure out? Is how the hell you got caught. You hostiles are supposed to be the kings of the jungle. And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots? 
SAYID And yet you're the one who mops up after them.
ROGER Yeah, well... We'll see how cute you are once Oldham gets done with you, pal.
ROGER What the hell are you doing here?
YOUNG BEN I was bringing you a sandwich.
ROGER A sandwich?
ROGER You never made me a sandwich in your life.
YOUNG BEN Yeah, well... I-I made one for myself...
ROGER Uh-huh.
YOUNG BEN So... So I just thought that I'd bring you--
ROGER Oh, yeah? You just...
YOUNG BEN Dad, don't!
ROGER Don't you lie to me. What are you doin' down here?
ROGER You made this sandwich for him, didn't you? Hmm?
YOUNG BEN Yes.
ROGER Who told you to do that?
YOUNG BEN Nobody.
ROGER Nobody?
YOUNG BEN I just thought that--
ROGER You "just thought," huh? Go home.
YOUNG BEN 
ROGER Go on. I'll tell you what to think.
SAYID How did you find me?
BEN I looked.
SAYID What do you want, Ben?
BEN John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered.
SAYID Why would anyone kill him?
BEN I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution.
SAYID They're watching him?
BEN A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces.
SAYID And that's why you're here? You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man?
BEN You don't want to?
SAYID What makes you think I want to?
BEN Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid.
SAYID I'm not what you think I am. I don't like killing.
BEN Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you.
SAWYER All right, last chance. You got anything to say?
SAWYER Take him to Oldham.
WOMAN # I can't give you # # anything # # but love # # baby # # that's the only thing # # I've plenty of #]
HORACE Oldham.
HORACE Hey, man. Are we ready?
[# dream a while, scheme a while # # you're sure to find # # happiness # # and I guess-- #]
SAYID  Who is that man?
SAWYER He's our you.
OLDHAM Better put him in the restraints.
OLDHAM Don't worry. They're for your protection. There are side effects to what I'm giving you. Open his mouth.
PHIL Open up.
OLDHAM Don't be afraid. Just turn your mind off. Let it take effect.
OLDHAM It's beyond your control, so fighting it is a poor use of your energies. You see, whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend. You will tell us the truth.
BEN There's somebody--somebody here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
SUN Who?
BEN The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
KATE Is that what this is about? This is insane. You are all crazy.
BEN Sayid, where are you going?
SAYID I don't want any part of this.
SAYID And if I see you again, it'll be extremely unpleasant for us both.
SAYID Ahh.
WOMAN Do you have a menu?
BARTENDER There you go. Sir? Another MacCutcheon?
SAYID Please.
WOMAN What's that run you?
SAYID Excuse me?
ILANA That scotch. What's a glass of that run you?
SAYID Whatever it is, it's worth it.
ILANA I don't understand why someone would pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.
SAYID If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me?
ILANA Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table. I'll have the rib eye, bloody.
BARTENDER Yes, ma'am. Rib eye, bloody.
SAYID Are you a professional?
ILANA A professional what? You think I'm a prostitute? Mm. I'm not a professional anything. I just... Thought you looked sad. I like sad men.
SAYID I'm sorry to hear that.
ILANA So... Other than drinking alone at bars...what do you do? For a living.
SAYID I'm between jobs at the moment.
ILANA So what did you do?
SAYID The only thing I was ever good at.
ILANA Then why did you quit?
SAYID I'm trying to change.
ILANA I know why you're sad now.
SAYID Do you?
ILANA When you are that good at something, there are always going to be people who tempt you into staying the same.
SAYID And how do you know so much about temptation?
ILANA Buy me a glass of that scotch, and I'll tell you.
HORACE Hello there. Hello?
OLDHAM I'm going to ask you a few questions. I want you to relax and answer them truthfully... Not that you'll have any choice about it. What is your name?
SAYID Sayid. Sayid Jarrah.
OLDHAM All right, Sayid. Why were you in handcuffs when we found you?
SAYID Because...because I am a bad man.
OLDHAM Were you running away from your people?
SAYID What people?
OLDHAM The hostiles.
SAYID I am not a hostile.
HORACE Then where did you come from, Sayid?
SAYID I came on a plane.
OLDHAM What plane?
SAYID Ajira flight 3-1-6. And that's how I returned to the island.
OLDHAM "Returned"? You've been here before?
SAYID Oh, yes. The first time, I was on Oceanic flight 8-1-5. It crashed. I was here for a hundred days. Then I left. Ask Sawyer.
OLDHAM Who's "Sawyer"?
RADZINSKY Who cares?! None of this matters. Ask him about the Flame.
HORACE Quiet.
OLDHAM What do you know about our stations here?
SAYID I know the Flame was a communication station. The Pearl was to observe other stations. The Swan was to study electromagnetism. But, of course, that was before the incident--
RADZINSKY The Swan?! How could he know what we were gonna name it? We haven't even built it yet! I told you! He saw the model! You see?! He is a spy!
HORACE Hey!
RADZINSKY I knew it!
HORACE Radzinsky! I'm not gonna tell you again. Cool it.
SAYID You're all going to die, you know.
HORACE What?
SAYID You're going to be killed.
HORACE How exactly would you know this, Sayid?
SAYID Because I am from the future.
OLDHAM Maybe I should've used half a dropper. Oops.
SAYID You... You used exactly enough.
JULIET Bench grinder, lube equipment, drill press over here. Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here. How are you with a flat four engine? You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
KATE No, not really.
JULIET It's okay. Jack told you about us...
KATE No. Hurley, actually.
JULIET It's kind of a relief, actually. I wasn't quite sure how to do it without it sounding like I was telling you to stay away.
KATE It's fine.
HORACE All right... What do we do with him?
RADZINSKY We kill him.
SAWYER Hold on a second. We're not killing anyone, right?
HORACE He violated the truce. What do you think they would do if they caught one of us?
SAWYER Since when did we start acting like them? We're civilized.
HOACE Yes, we are. We have a rule of law. And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself.
RADZINSKY Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind you, this man's seen things? He knows things. There's nothing to talk about. He's a spy.
SAWYER You sure about that, Stu? He was trying to escape from the hostiles. He obviously has problems with his people.
RADZINSKY Yeah, and sharing our secrets are the quickest way for him to solve those problems.
HOACE Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider.
RADZINSKY Consider? I mean, the longer he's among us, the--the more danger we're in.
SAWYER I can talk to him, Horace. I just need more time.
RADZINSKY No, you had your chance, LaFleur!
SAWYER Why are we on your clock, Radzinsky?
RADZINSKY Horace, you've got to call for a vote. Either we make a decision, or I call Ann Arbor...and they make it for us.
AMY Radzinsky's right. Horace, please...
AMY I can't... I can't sleep with one eye open. We have a baby now. We have to think about Ethan. We have to think about all the children here. How are we going to feel safe with this man around? I don't know what he's up to, but we can't keep him here. We have no choice.
HORACE Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All in favor of Radzinsky's solution, raise your hand.
RADZINSKY LaFleur?
HORACE I would really like to say it's unanimous.
ILANA Mmm. Just for the record, I really was just there for dinner.
SAYID Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?
SAYID Mmm.
ILANA I think it's too late for that.
ILANA Take it off.
ILANA You so much as flinch, and you're dead.
SAYID So who are you?
ILANA You asked me earlier if I was a professional. I am a professional. I was hired to bring you to Guam.
SAYID Who hired you?
ILANA The family of Peter Avellino--the man you killed in cold blood last year on a golf course in the Seychelles.
SAYID You're a bounty hunter?
ILANA Doesn't matter what I am. You're going to answer for what you've done.
SAWYER Hit me in the face.
SAYID What?
SAWYER Go on. You owe me one anyway, so make it a good one.
SAWYER Then I want you to take these keys out of my pocket and let yourself out. The guard outside is Phil. He's a dimwit, so I reckon you can get his gun before he even realizes you're out. Just promise me you won't shoot him.
SAYID I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine right here.
SAWYER They're gonna kill you. They just took a vote. Even the new mom wants you dead.
SAYID I'm going to stay here, James.
SAWYER This morning, you were begging me to let you go. Why would you change your--
SAYID Because...when I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island...I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here.
SAWYER To get shot? Then what? You're out of your mind.
SAWYER Hey.
KATE Hi.
SAWYER Why'd you come back?
KATE What?
SAWYER Sayid just filled my ear full of some crap about his damn purpose, and I wanna know... Why'd y'all come back?
KATE Uh...
SAWYER Why, Kate?
KATE I don't know why everyone else came back. I just know why I did.
SAWYER What? What the hell?!
KATE Are you ok?
SAWYER Craig! Grab a wrench, open those valves. Get the hoses going.
MAN Okay.
WOMAN Aah!
SAWYER Erin, grab the fire gear! Bill, go help Craig.
JACK What the hell happened?
SAWYER Three years--no burning buses. Y'all are back for one day... Get on that hose.
SAWYER Man this hose!
MAN Push it out!
SAWYER All security! All security! This is LaFleur! We have a fire! Everyone get to building 15 now!
PHIL Roger that. I'm on my way.
SAYID What happened to your glasses?
YOUNG BEN My dad.
SAYID For bringing me the sandwich? I know. My father was a hard man as well.
YOUNG BEN I really hate it here. If I let you out...will you take me with you, to your people?
SAYID Yes, Ben, I will. That's why I'm here.
TANNOY Attention, passengers. Ajira Airways flight 3-16 to Honolulu and Guam...
SAYID Are you sure we're going to Guam?
ILANA Where else would we be going?
SAYID Can I ask you a favor? Can we get the next plane?
ILANA Why?
SAYID I'm very superstitious when it comes to flying.
ILANA I'll buy you a rabbit's foot at the gift shop. This is the plane we're taking.
ILANA Sorry about the handcuffs, but at least we're in business.
BEN Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
HURLEY What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come!
JACK Hurley, hey, if you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
SAYID Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
ILANA What?
SAYID Are you working for him?
ILANA Who's Benjamin Linus?
SAYID He's a liar, a manipulator...a man who allowed his own daughter to be murdered to save himself... A monster responsible for nothing short of genocide.
ILANA Why would I work for somebody like that?
SAYID I did.
YOUNG BEN Whoa! Aah!
SAYID Hide!
SAYID Jin?
JIN Sayid. What are you doing here? How did you get out?
SAYID Sawyer let me go. They were going to kill me.
JIN What?
PHIL Attention. The prisoner escaped. The hostile is no longer in custody. Be on the lookout. He could be armed.
SAYID They don't know he released me. Please, Jin, I need to keep moving.
JIN Okay. Let me talk to him first. LaFleur, it's Jin here. Come in.
YOUNG BEN Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?
YOUNG BEN Come on. We better go. He called LaFleur.
SAYID You were right about me.
YOUNG BEN What?
SAYID I am a killer.
