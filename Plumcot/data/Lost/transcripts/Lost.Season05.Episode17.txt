dr_jack_shephard What's going on, Kate?
james_ford Doc, we gotta talk.
dr_jack_shephard You wanna talk? Then get in the van. We don't have time--
james_ford I ain't gettin' in the van. I need five minutes, that's all. I'll say what I gotta say, and then you can do whatever the hell you want to. But you're gonna listen. You owe me that much, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Five minutes.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Dr. Shephard? You all right?
dr_jack_shephard The dural sac--I cut it.
dr_jack_shephard Give me some suction.
dr_christian_shephard Calm down. It's all right.
dr_jack_shephard The fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't--
dr_christian_shephard Look at me.
dr_jack_shephard Give me some suction.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Yes, doctor.
dr_christian_shephard Jack... look at me. Count to five.
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about?
dr_christian_shephard I'm talking about you stitching up the sac so this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life. And the only way you're gonna do that is not to be afraid. So close your eyes, count to five, and then fix her, Jack. Or I'll have to fix her for you.
dr_jack_shephard One... two... three... four... five. Sutures.
dr_christian_shephard Hey, kiddo. Girl's in recovery. She's responsive to stimulus below the waist, so... no paralysis.
dr_jack_shephard Good.
dr_christian_shephard Something wrong, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard You embarrassed me.
dr_christian_shephard Did I?
dr_jack_shephard You know, it's bad enough that everybody in this hospital thinks the only reason I got this residency is because you're my father. But then you... you put me in a time-out during my first major procedure, in front of my entire team. Dad, I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to.
dr_christian_shephard Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack?
jacob One of these yours?
dr_jack_shephard Machine got stuck.
jacob I guess it just needed a little push.
james_ford Take a load off, Doc.
dr_jack_shephard No, thanks.
james_ford Sit down, Jack.
james_ford My folks died when I was 8 years old. I ever tell you that?
dr_jack_shephard No.
james_ford Con man took my dad for everything he had. He didn't deal with it very well. He shot my mom, then he blew his own head off. I was hiding under the bed when it happened. I heard the whole thing.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry.
james_ford Yeah. That was a year ago.
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford Right now it's July 1977, which means that happened last year. So I could've hopped on the sub, gone back to the States, walked right in my house and stopped my daddy from killing anybody.
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't you?
james_ford Because, Jack... what's done is done.
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't have to be that way.
james_ford What did you screw up so bad the first time around you're willing to blow up a damn nuke just for a second chance?
dr_jack_shephard That's not what this is about.
james_ford Then what is it about?
dr_jack_shephard Three years ago, Locke told me that all this was happening for a reason, that us being here was our destiny.
james_ford I don't speak "destiny". What I do understand is a man does what he does 'cause he wants something for himself. What do you want, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I had her. I had her, and I lost her.
james_ford Kate? Well, damn, Doc, she's standing right on the other side of those trees. You want her back, just go and ask her.
dr_jack_shephard Nah, it's too late for that. Your five minutes is up.
james_ford Jack... if what you're doin' even works, you and Kate will be strangers, and she'll be in damn handcuffs.
dr_jack_shephard If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
james_ford Well, I guess there's nothing I can say that's gonna change your mind.
dr_jack_shephard No, I guess there's not.
james_ford Who the hell do you think you are?!
james_ford You think you can come here and do whatever the hell you want? I had a life here!
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer listen. You don't get it--
james_ford Will you stop?
james_ford Will you stop?!
dr_jack_shephard No.
dr_jack_shephard Aah!
dr_juliet_burke James! Let him go.
james_ford He wouldn't listen. I had to. He won't stop!
dr_juliet_burke That's because he's right.
james_ford What?!
dr_juliet_burke He's right, James. We have to do this.
james_ford What are you talking about?! You're the one that told me to come back here and stop him! What happened?!
dr_juliet_burke I changed my mind.
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Girls... your dad and I have something we need to talk to you both about.
BLONDE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 SISTER Are we moving again?
BRUNETTE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 SISTER No, stupid. They're getting a divorce.
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Rachel--
young_rachel Well, aren't you?
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Yes. But... we need you both to understand that your father and I... we still love each other. Just because two people love each other, doesn't always mean they're supposed to be together.
BLONDE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 SISTER But what if you are supposed to be together?
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 We're not, honey.
BLONDE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 SISTER But how can you know for sure?
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 We just know.
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 And when you're a grown-up, you'll understand.
BLONDE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 SISTER I don't wanna understand!
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Juliet, wait!
dr_juliet_burke I don't wanna understand!
james_ford Stop! We gotta talk about this!
dr_juliet_burke There's nothing to talk about, James. We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.
james_ford Well, maybe you shoulda told me you had a change of heart before I brought him out in the jungle to kick his ass.
dr_juliet_burke Would that have stopped you?
james_ford No.
dr_juliet_burke Well, then I'm glad you finally got it out of your system.
james_ford Hey! Hey!
dr_juliet_burke You, don't.
james_ford I need you to tell me where all this is coming from. I mean, one minute, you're leading the great sub escape, and now you're on board with blowing up the damn Island? I got a right to know why you changed your mind.
dr_juliet_burke I changed my mind when I saw you look at her. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
james_ford I don't care who I looked at. I'm with you.
dr_juliet_burke And you would stay with me forever if I let you, and that is why I will always love you.
james_ford You don't--
dr_juliet_burke What we had, it was just for a little while, and just because we love each other, it doesn't mean that we're meant to be together. I mean, maybe we were never supposed to be together. So if Jack can make it that--that none of you ever come here, then he should.
james_ford Why you doing this, Juliet?
dr_juliet_burke I... if I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.
dr_pierre_chang Radzinsky!
stuart_radzinsky What is it now?!
dr_pierre_chang The gauss readings has jumped off the charts.
stuart_radzinsky Let me see. This is it! We're on top of the pocket!
dr_pierre_chang If we keep drilling and hit that pocket, all hell is gonna break loose!
phil Radzinsky, are you there? Over. Stuart, come in!
stuart_radzinsky What do you want, Phil?
phil That Hostile that shot the kid? He came back.
stuart_radzinsky What the hell are you talking about?
phil Here at the Barracks. He--he attacked us and then got rescued by some of the other recruits. They stole a van and took off.
stuart_radzinsky Took off where?
phil I don't know, but Roger said that one of them had a bomb.
stuart_radzinsky That Hostile knows about the Swan! Get some men and some guns, and get your asses out here right now! If they're coming here, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
kate_austen Jack? What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Uh... Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.
kate_austen Does it hurt?
dr_jack_shephard Ah, it's okay.
kate_austen Okay.
kate_austen Do you remember when I sewed you up? When we first got here?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Seems like a million years ago.
kate_austen Or 30 years from now.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, why'd you make me promise to never ask about Aaron?
kate_austen Because I was... so angry with you for making me come back here.
dr_jack_shephard Is he why you came back?
kate_austen I came back so he could be where he belongs--with his mother.
dr_jack_shephard If this works, Claire will never come to the island, and they'll always be together, just the way they're meant to be.
kate_austen She was gonna give him up for adoption, Jack.'
dr_jack_shephard Well, you don't know what she would do. And whatever it is, it would be her choice. If you wanna save Claire, this is the only way to do it. But nothing... nothing in my life has ever felt so right. And... I just need you to believe that.
phil Go!
stuart_radzinsky Keep going!
stuart_radzinsky Keep the drill going!
dr_jack_shephard It's about to happen. Are you with me on this?
kate_austen Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Then let's go.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Copy that.
JAIL#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 CLERK One wallet. $227 cash. One ballpoint pen. One fruit roll-up. Sign here.
hugo_reyes You don't understand. This is a big mistake. I killed a bunch of people.
JAIL#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 CLERK You see this? This is a discharge form. You've been cleared. So take your stuff and go.
hugo_reyes Look, dude... there are men with tranquilizer guns hunting me down like an animal. They wanna bring me somewhere against my will.
JAIL#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 CLERK There's a cab stand right out front.
hugo_reyes Oh. Sorry. I didn't see it was taken, dude.
jacob Actually, I'm only going a few blocks if you wanna share.
hugo_reyes Cool. Are you sure?
jacob Come on in.
hugo_reyes You want some? Cherry.
jacob No thanks.
hugo_reyes So what were you in for?
jacob Excuse me?
hugo_reyes Jail. I was there 'cause I killed three people. But I didn't really. I guess they figured it out. What about you?
jacob I wasn't in jail.
hugo_reyes Well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison? In a cab?
jacob I was waitin' for you, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Oh. Then you must be dead.
jacob I'm definitely not dead.
hugo_reyes Well, what do you want from me?
jacob I wanna know why you won't go back to the Island.
hugo_reyes 'Cause I'm cursed.
jacob Is that so?
hugo_reyes Uh-huh. That's why the plane crashed, my friends died--Libby, Charlie. Now they visit me, and I can't make it stop.
jacob Well, what if you weren't cursed? What if you were blessed?
hugo_reyes How do you mean "blessed?"
jacob Well, you get to talk to people you've lost... seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.
hugo_reyes Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful, except for the part where I'm crazy.
jacob I've got some news for you, Hugo, and you're just gonna have to take my word on this. You are not crazy.
hugo_reyes Who are you, dude?
jacob I'm just up here on the corner.
jacob Ajira Airways Flight 316 out of LAX. Leaves in 24 hours. All you have to do is get on that plane. It's your choice, Hugo. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
hugo_reyes Wait! You forgot your guitar.
jacob It's not my guitar.
hugo_reyes Don't worry, dude. Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future... or the past. One of those.
miles_straume I don't think your buddy's gonna make it.
jinsoo_kwon He'll make it.
hugo_reyes Dude, what happened to your face?
dr_jack_shephard Nothin'. We were just up on a ridge where we could look down into the Swan site.
dr_jack_shephard Something just happened down there.
dr_jack_shephard They hit something. It's time for me to go.
sayid_jarrah It's all set to go. Remember, be careful. It's rigged to explode on impact. According to Faraday's plan, you must get the bomb as close as you can to the source of electromagnetism.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, this is gonna work. And it'll save ya.
sayid_jarrah Nothing can save me.
dr_jack_shephard See ya in Los Angeles.
richard_alpert Are you sure you need to do this? If you waited, Jacob would eventually come to you, John.
john_locke I'm tired of waiting. Where is he, Richard?
sunhwa_kwon What happened to the rest of the statue?
ben_linus I don't know. It was like that when I got here.
sunhwa_kwon Do you expect me to believe that?
ben_linus Not really.
john_locke All right, Ben, let's go.
richard_alpert W--what are you doing?
ben_linus John wants me to join him.
richard_alpert You can't bring him in.
john_locke Why not?
richard_alpert Because only our leader can request an audience with Jacob, and there can only be one leader on the Island at a time, John.
john_locke I'm beginning to think you just make these rules up as you go along, Richard. Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a problem, I'm sure Jacob and I can work it out.
richard_alpert Tell him I said hello.
john_locke Will you be able to do this, Ben? I know it won't be easy, but things will change... once he's gone. I promise.
miles_straume Can I ask you something, LaFleur?
james_ford There ain't no more LaFleur, Enos. Go ahead, shoot.
miles_straume Has it occurred to any of you that your buddy's actually gonna cause the thing he says he's trying to prevent? Perhaps that little nuke is the incident? So maybe the best thing to do... is nothing?
miles_straume I'm glad you all thought this through.
dr_juliet_burke What's going on?
jinsoo_kwon It's Phil. That's the road to the Swan.
kate_austen If they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.
james_ford What do you think, Blondie?
dr_juliet_burke Live together, die alone.
stuart_radzinsky Good for you. You got here fast.
phil Any sign of 'em yet?
stuart_radzinsky No, not yet. You got time to set up a perimeter.
dr_pierre_chang You called these men to the site?
phil You, rear ridgeline. You, top ridgeline.
dr_pierre_chang We need to be getting people away from here!
phil You, top of the scaffolding. Go now!
phil There!
stuart_radzinsky Get him!
phil Flank him! Get him now!
stuart_radzinsky Who's this?!
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Uhh!
stuart_radzinsky Aah!
james_ford Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man!
phil Okay, okay.
james_ford Tell 'em to put their guns down.
phil Drop the guns! Drop the guns!
james_ford All right, you can come out now, Doc!
james_ford Hurry up and do your business.
james_ford Turn that damn thing off!
james_ford What's the matter?!
dr_pierre_chang It won't shut down!
james_ford Why not?!
dr_pierre_chang Something's pulling the drill down.
stuart_radzinsky We hit the pocket!
james_ford Hurry up, Doc! What are you waiting for?! Drop it!
james_ford This don't look like LAX.
dr_pierre_chang Aah!
miles_straume Dad!
dr_pierre_chang Aah!
dr_jack_shephard Uhh!
kate_austen Jack!
miles_straume Dad!
miles_straume Get away from here! Get as far away from here as you can!
stuart_radzinsky Get in!
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 What the hell's going on?!
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Get out of here!
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 Come on!
[Radzinsky#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 tries to drive a Jeep away but it is pulled back by the electromagnetism.
stuart_radzinsky Go! Go! Go!
phil Hey, LaFleur!
dr_juliet_burke Aah! Help!
kate_austen Juliet! Ah, come on! Sawyer!
dr_juliet_burke Help!
james_ford Juliet!
kate_austen Sawyer!
dr_juliet_burke Uhh!
james_ford Where do you think you're going, Blondie?
dr_juliet_burke Aah! It hurts! Aah!
james_ford Kate! Help me get those chains off!
james_ford Hold on! You hold on!
dr_juliet_burke I can't. I can't get it off.
james_ford I got you.
kate_austen I can't...
dr_juliet_burke
kate_austen I can't reach them.
james_ford You hold on!
dr_juliet_burke Aah! No!
james_ford Please! I got you.
kate_austen Sawyer!
james_ford Don't you leave me.
dr_juliet_burke It's okay.
james_ford Don't you leave me! You hold on!
dr_juliet_burke I love you.
james_ford No, you don't let go!
dr_juliet_burke I love you, James.
james_ford Don't let go.
dr_juliet_burke I love you so much.
james_ford No! No, don't let go!
james_ford Juliet! No!
richard_alpert Water?
sunhwa_kwon Do you have any alcohol?
richard_alpert No. Sure wish I did.
ilana_verdansky Don't shoot.
richard_alpert It's okay. It's all right.
ilana_verdansky Which one of you is Richardus?
richard_alpert It's Richard, actually.
ilana_verdansky What lies in the shadow of the statue?
richard_alpert Ille qui nos omnes servabit.
ilana_verdansky Richard... I'm Ilana. I have something you need to see. Open it up.
richard_alpert It--it's okay. It's okay. Let them.
[They#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode17 open the crate and tip the contents onto the sand. Richard and Sun peer over the crate to see a body.
richard_alpert Where did you find him?
ilana_verdansky In the cargo hold of the plane we came here on... in a coffin.
sunhwa_kwon I don't understand. If this is Locke... who's in there?
jacob You like it? I did it myself. It takes a very long time when you're making the thread, but, uh... I suppose that's the point, isn't it?
john_locke Hello, Jacob.
jacob Well, you found your loophole.
john_locke Indeed I did. And you have no idea what I've gone through to be here.
ben_linus Have you met before?
john_locke In a manner of speaking. Do what I asked you to, Ben.
jacob Benjamin... whatever he's told you, I want you to understand one thing. You have a choice.
ben_linus What "choice"?
jacob You can do what he asked, or you can go, leave us to discuss our... issues.
ben_linus Oh... so now, after all this time, you've decided to stop ignoring me. Thirty-five years I lived on this island, and all I ever heard was your name over and over. Richard would bring me your instructions--all those slips of paper, all those lists--and I never questioned anything. I did as I was told. But when I dared to ask to see you myself, I was told, "You have to wait. You have to be patient." But when he asked to see you? He gets marched straight up here as if was Moses. So... why him? Hmm? What was it that was so wrong with me? What about me?!
jacob What about you?
ben_linus Oh. Well...
jacob They're... coming.
john_locke What?
john_locke I can't hear you.
jacob They're coming.
james_ford Juliet!
kate_austen Sawyer, get off of there!
kate_austen We have to go right now. We need to go!
kate_austen Get off. It's going down! This thing is gonna go! You have to let it go. You have to go! This thing is going to blow at any second.
james_ford No!
kate_austen Jack! Jack, help me get him off.
dr_juliet_burke Come on! Come on! Come on! Go! Come on! Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
