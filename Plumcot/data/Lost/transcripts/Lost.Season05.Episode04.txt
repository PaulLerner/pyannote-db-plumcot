dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen Oh, you don't have to whisper. When he's out, he's out.
dr_jack_shephard At least one of us can sleep.
kate_austen It's gonna take more than two nights for me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed. What are we gonna do about him? About Aaron.
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
kate_austen I've been thinking a lot about him. Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I didn't.
kate_austen I think we should say he's mine.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen We could say that I was six months pregnant when I was arrested and that I gave birth to him on the Island. No one would ever know.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, no. You don't have to... There's other ways to вo this.
kate_austen After everyone we've lost—Michael, Jin, Sawyer... I can't lose him, too.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer's not dead.
kate_austen No. But he's gone. Good night, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Kate... If we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna protect the people that we left behind, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to convince everyone to lie. If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it. So I'm gonna turn to you first. Are you with me?
kate_austen I have always been with you.
sunhwa_kwon How does it fit?
kate_austen It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.
sunhwa_kwon Looks great on you. Are you sure you want to do this?
kate_austen It was your idea.
aaron Mommy!
kate_austen Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand. I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.
sunhwa_kwon Don't worry about us, Kate. There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on TV. We're going to be just fine here.
kate_austen Sun... I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here. Thank you.
sunhwa_kwon It's what any friend would do.
kate_austen Okay, well, I will be back soon. Okay, you be good for Sun. Okay, honey?
sunhwa_kwon Good luck.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode04 Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon I'll be right back, honey.
dr_juliet_burke Charlotte? Charlotte?
james_ford What the hell's wrong with her? She's been out for 10 minutes.
dr_juliet_burke Stop shouting, James.
miles_straume Hey, man.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel, now would be a good time.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not sure what you mean exactly.
james_ford She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.
dr_juliet_burke Give us some space, would you?
james_ford She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up. He knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it.
dr_juliet_burke James... go away.
dr_juliet_burke Did you know that this would happen?
dr_daniel_faraday I thought... I thought it might. I think it's neurological. Our brains have an internal clock, a sense of time. The flashes... throw the clock off. It's like really bad jet lag.
dr_juliet_burke Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel. You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know. But thank God it's not.
dan_norton Thank you for waiting. Did my assistant offer you something to drink?
kate_austen Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.
dan_norton Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit. So... how can I help you?
kate_austen Uh... Mr. Norton, when you came to my house looking for blood samples from me and my son, I asked you who your client was...
dan_norton And I said I couldn't tell you.
kate_austen Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal. I'll give you the blood samples, but first, I wanna talk to your client. Considering what you're asking for, that's more than reasonable.
dan_norton Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today, and I will be sure to pass along your offer. But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be—no. And the reason, of course, is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals, and we both know it. I have a signed court order compelling you to let us confirm that you're the child's mother. I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it, but my client insists that we... handle the exchange of custody quietly.
kate_austen What do you mean "exchange of custody"?
dan_norton You know exactly what I mean.
kate_austen No, I... Mr. Norton, I just wanna know who is doing this to me.
dan_norton You did this to yourself. Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen. You are going to lose the boy.
john_locke We have to go back to the Orchid.
james_ford Excuse me?
john_locke The Orchid. That's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
james_ford That greenhouse is a long ways away.
john_locke You said you had a Zodiac raft back at the beach. We could take that, cut around the horn of the Island, be at the Orchid in half the time.
james_ford And let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.
john_locke No, not exactly at all, but I know that Ben used it to leave the Island. And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.
james_ford And how you gonna do that?
john_locke This is all happening because they left. I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.
james_ford Bring who back?
john_locke Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.
james_ford The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.
john_locke They're not dead, James.
james_ford Says who?
john_locke That doesn't matter. All that matters is they've gotta come back. I have to make them come back... even if it kills me. Don't you want 'em to come back, James? Don't you want her to come back?
james_ford It doesn't matter what I want.
miles_straume Hey! She's waking up!
dr_daniel_faraday Are you okay?
dr_charlotte_lewis Who are you?
dr_daniel_faraday It's me. It's Daniel.
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel. Oh, my head. What happened?
dr_daniel_faraday There was another flash. You passed out. How do you feel?
dr_charlotte_lewis A bit dizzy, but... I'm fine.
dr_daniel_faraday Good.
miles_straume Hooray. Everything's back to normal. Now what?
james_ford I'll tell you "now what". We're going to the Orchid.
dr_jack_shephard Dilation's almost back to normal.
sayid_jarrah Good. Now take this IV out of my arm, and let's go.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours. You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer in your system.
sayid_jarrah If you sent that man to Hurley's house, we have to leave now.
dr_jack_shephard You need to relax. Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley. Ben is on our side.
sayid_jarrah The only side he's on is his own.
dr_evelyn_ariza Dr. Shephard? I'm Dr. Ariza, director of clinical services. A word with you, please?
dr_jack_shephard I'll be right back.
dr_evelyn_ariza What do you think you are doing here?
dr_jack_shephard I was treating a patient. I apologize. It was an emergency. I know that—
dr_evelyn_ariza You were suspended on charges of substance abuse. Emergency or not, Dr. Shephard, you have no business being here.
dr_jack_shephard I understand, and I take full responsibility for my actions.
dr_evelyn_ariza No, Doctor. The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions, and that makes us liable for them.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me.
dr_jack_shephard Hello?
hugo_reyes Jack? It's me.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hey, did Sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. He did. Hurley, where are—
hugo_reyes Is he okay?
dr_jack_shephard He's fine.
hugo_reyes Awesome.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, where are you?
hugo_reyes Dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in L.A. County lockup. Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said. I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now. Thanks, dude.
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about, Hurley? Wait! Wait—
ben_linus Good. You're here. How's Sayid?
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode04 How you doing today, sir? Got your meds for you.
sayid_jarrah Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode04 Nope. Room 133, right? Got the orders right here. But don't worry. I won't have to give you an injection. Put this right in your IV line.
sayid_jarrah Who are you? Who are you working for?
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode04
sayid_jarrah Okay, talk, talk.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode04 Address — it's in my pocket.
ben_linus Hello, Sayid.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
sayid_jarrah Do we know anyone who lives at 42 Panorama Crest?
dr_jack_shephard That's Kate's address.
kate_austen Hello?
dr_jack_shephard Kate? It's Jack. Are you okay?
kate_austen Yeah. I'm fine.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you right now? Are you at home?
kate_austen Uh... what?
dr_jack_shephard Listen, I'll explain everything once you're out, but you've gotta get Aaron—
kate_austen Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm... Aaron is at a hotel with Sun.
dr_jack_shephard Sun? Sun's in L.A.?
kate_austen Yeah, she's here on business. Listen. Jack, this is really not a good time. I'm so sorry that I even picked up the phone. I'm not—
dr_jack_shephard Kate, do not hang up on me. Please listen. Listen, uh ... will you tell me where you are? I need to see you. Kate, please.
kate_austen I'm downtown. Wilshire and Olive.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. All right. I'm on my way.
dr_jack_shephard She's not at home, but I'm gonna go to her right now.
ben_linus Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
sayid_jarrah Sorry, Ben. I'm not letting you get anywhere near him.
ben_linus You have friends in trouble. Let's get them to safety and save the dirty linen for later.
sayid_jarrah I'll drive.
ben_linus After you get Kate, meet us at the Long Beach Marina, slip 23. And, Jack — hurry. We're running out of time.
james_ford Hey, Locke? What are you gonna say to her?
john_locke Sorry?
james_ford Kate. What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back?
john_locke I haven't figured that out yet.
james_ford Well, let me tell you something. She was pretty excited to hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here.
miles_straume What the hell is that?
john_locke Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.
james_ford Beach is this way. Now you wanna take the scenic route?
dr_daniel_faraday John... do you know when we are?
john_locke We need to keep moving.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. How's your headache?
dr_charlotte_lewis Better. Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh?
dr_daniel_faraday Well, don't worry. Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the Zodiac around the other side of the island and you can rest.
dr_charlotte_lewis You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. I'm fine.
dr_juliet_burke You okay?
miles_straume I'm peachy.
james_ford Shh!
miles_straume Now what?
james_ford Nobody move.
john_locke James!
james_ford I got this.
claire_littleton It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away. Babies know that stuff.
kate_austen Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen. Do you want this baby? Do you want it to be safe and healthy?
kate_austen You're not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours. But I need you to push. Okay?
kate_austen One, two, three... push! Push!
kate_austen Come on, Claire! Push!
claire_littleton Aah!
kate_austen Okay! He's coming!
kate_austen Push! Push! Push! Push!
kate_austen Push! Push! Push! Push!
john_locke James? What happened? Did you see something out here, James?
james_ford Don't matter. It's gone now.
kate_austen You shaved your beard.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Just needed a change.
kate_austen Look, Jack, uh... I don't know why you called, but I can't be dealing with this right now. I...
dr_jack_shephard What's going on?
kate_austen Nothing. Just... can you just go?
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you just tell me?
kate_austen Jack, please, just go.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, please, tell me.
kate_austen Somebody wants Aaron.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen There's a lawyer in there. His clients — they know we're lying. They know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away.
dr_jack_shephard Who's gonna take him away?
dr_jack_shephard What—what are you doing?
kate_austen Look, I gotta go, all right? Get in or don't.
john_locke Hey. You ready to tell me who you saw back there?
james_ford I already told you. It was nothin'.
john_locke You and I both know when we were before the flash, James. So who was it you saw? Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?
james_ford And how is it that you knew when we were, Johnny Boy? That light in the sky — it was from the Hatch, wasn't it?
john_locke The night that Boone died... I went out there and started pounding on it as hard as I could. I was... confused... scared. Babbling like an idiot, asking, why was all this happening to me?
james_ford Did you get an answer?
john_locke Light came on, shot up into the sky. At the time, I thought it meant something.
james_ford Did it?
john_locke No. It was just a light.
james_ford So why'd you turn us around then? Don't you wanna go back there?
john_locke Why would I wanna do that?
james_ford So you could tell yourself to do things different, save yourself a world of pain.
john_locke No, I needed that pain — to get to where I am now.
miles_straume Hey. I just got a nosebleed.
dr_daniel_faraday What? When?
miles_straume Let's just not freak out the others, okay? Just tell me... why—why her? Why me?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know. Uh, I think it might have something to do with duration of exposure. You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.
miles_straume Doesn't make any sense. Those yahoos have been here for months. I've never been here before two weeks ago.
dr_daniel_faraday Are you sure about that?
james_ford Hello?!
dr_juliet_burke The camp's back.
james_ford Finally. Anybody for a DHARMA beer? Hello? Anybody here? Rose? Bernard?
john_locke I wonder how long ago this happened.
james_ford Son of a bitch!
dr_juliet_burke What is it?
john_locke It's Vincent's.
james_ford Yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog? Where's the rest of our people?
dr_daniel_faraday The Zodiac's gone, too.
dr_charlotte_lewis Maybe your people took the boat.
james_ford Why the hell would they do that?
miles_straume To get away from whoever came in those.
dr_charlotte_lewis Where did these come from?
dr_daniel_faraday That's a good question. They're pretty old.
miles_straume Not that old.
james_ford Let me see that. "Adg-eh-ruh"?
dr_juliet_burke Ajira. It's an airline. It's based out of India, but they fly everywhere.
james_ford Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to Vegas tonight.
james_ford Who came in these? Other Others?
dr_juliet_burke Don't look at me.
dr_daniel_faraday My question is, when are they coming back?
john_locke Let's not wait to find out.
miles_straume This plan sounded a hell of a lot better when we were going by motorboat. How far is this place?
john_locke It's around that point. Not more than a couple hours.
miles_straume Oh, joy.
dr_juliet_burke You all right?
james_ford I saw Kate.
dr_juliet_burke What?
james_ford Last night, in the jungle. Before the last flash. She was delivering Claire's baby.
dr_juliet_burke But that was two months ago.
james_ford Time travel's a bitch.
dr_juliet_burke Get down!
james_ford Paddle!
miles_straume I think they want their boat back!
john_locke Move!
miles_straume These your people?!
dr_juliet_burke No! Are they yours?!
james_ford Shut up and keep paddling!
james_ford Little help! Little help!
james_ford Paddle harder! They're getting closer!
james_ford Thank you, Lord!
james_ford I take that back!
john_locke Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore!
dr_jack_shephard Kate, just because the guy told you that he was meeting his client doesn't mean that they're here in L.A. He could've just told you that to—to throw you off.
kate_austen Or they're in that hotel right now.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. And what if they are? What if the person who wants to take Aaron is sitting in that hotel room right now? Then what? Come on. Come with me. We'll—we'll go get Aaron, we'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.
kate_austen All right.
kate_austen Oh my god.
dr_jack_shephard It's Claire's mother.
dr_jack_shephard Wait.
kate_austen What am I waiting for, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Wait. I just... let's just think about this for a minute.
kate_austen She knows.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe she doesn't know.
kate_austen No, but she knows about Aaron, and that's all that matters!
dr_jack_shephard Let me go talk to her.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard If I can just explain to her why we did it — maybe if I can get her to understand why... she'll listen to me. I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it. Hey... Aaron is my family too.
carole_littleton Dr. Shephard?
dr_jack_shephard Hello, Ms. Littleton. Um... may I come in?
carole_littleton Of course.
carole_littleton You look drenched.
dr_jack_shephard No, no. No, I'm fine.
carole_littleton God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral. How did you even know I was here?
dr_jack_shephard Uh... I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton, because I followed your lawyer.
carole_littleton Why would you do that?
dr_jack_shephard I'm — I did it because, um... I understand that you feel the need to do this. But I need you to know that everything that Kate and I have done—it was for Aaron.
carole_littleton Who's... Aaron? I—I'm afraid I'm not following you.
dr_jack_shephard Ms. Littleton, um... what are you doing here in Los Angeles?
dr_jack_shephard Let's go. Drive. Then call Sun and tell her to bring Aaron to the Long Beach Marina. We'll meet her there.
kate_austen What—wh-what are you talking about? What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Kate, we have to go now.
kate_austen I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what just happened!
dr_jack_shephard She doesn't know anything.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard She doesn't know. She still thinks that Claire is dead. She doesn't even know that Aaron exists.
kate_austen But the lawyer—
dr_jack_shephard She sued Oceanic, and she's in town to pick up her settlement.
kate_austen What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawyer happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know. But whoever's trying to take Aaron... it's not her.
kate_austen Then who is it?
ben_linus Can I ask you something? Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue Hugo?
sayid_jarrah I had to make sure Hurley was safe.
ben_linus You can pull in over here.
dan_norton Mr. Linus.
ben_linus Mr. Norton.
dan_norton I looked into it, and they don't have any kind of solid case against Reyes. The M.E. said that the man found outside Santa Rosa was killed before Reyes escaped.
ben_linus That's very good news.
dan_norton We have a prelim hearing in the morning. The judge will never let it get past that, and Reyes will be a free man.
ben_linus Thank you, Dan.
dan_norton Anytime.
sayid_jarrah Who was that?
ben_linus That's my lawyer.
john_locke Aah! Okay!
miles_straume Remind me never to do that again.
dr_daniel_faraday Where are we?
john_locke It's hard to say til it gets light.
dr_juliet_burke We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.
james_ford What conversation was that?
dr_juliet_burke The one before they started shooting at us, where you were about to tell me how it felt to see Kate again.
james_ford I wasn't about to tell you anything.
dr_juliet_burke Why don't you tell me now?
james_ford I was close enough to touch her. If I wanted to, I could've... stood right up and talked to her.
dr_juliet_burke Why didn't you?
james_ford What's done is done... Juliet?
dr_juliet_burke What's wrong?
dr_charlotte_lewis Oi! Come and look at this!
dr_charlotte_lewis It's wreckage. Looks like it just happened.
john_locke Anybody speak French?

kate_austen Jack, why did you call me today?
dr_jack_shephard I told you. I was... I was worried.
kate_austen But why? Why were you worried? Why today?
kate_austen I don't...
dr_jack_shephard Right before I called you, Sayid was attacked. And the guy that did it—your address was in his pocket.
kate_austen Sayid? What's he doing here?
dr_jack_shephard That's not important right now. What matters is that we get you and Aaron someplace safe.
kate_austen Safe from who?
ben_linus Hello, Kate.
dr_jack_shephard It's okay. He's with me.
kate_austen He's with you?
dr_jack_shephard I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but he's here to help us. To help everyone that we left behind. We all need to be together again.
kate_austen It's him.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen It's him. He's the one who's trying to take Aaron.
dr_jack_shephard No. No. You—you don't understand.
ben_linus No, Jack. She's right. It was me. Sorry.
kate_austen Who the hell do you think you are? Why don't you just stay away?! Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
ben_linus Because he's not your son, Kate.
