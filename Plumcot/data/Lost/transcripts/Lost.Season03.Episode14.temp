ANNOUNCER And now, dancing on stage three, the pride of Saint Paul, Corvette!
NIKKI No! That's the money for the orphanage. That means, Mr. LaShade, you're the Cobra.
BILLY DEE Sorry, baby, it's just business.
NIKKI All this time it was you.
BILLY DEE Pretty and smart. What a shame.
NIKKI Razzle-dazzle! Ha!
BILLY DEE Autumn, Crystal, bad news. Corvette was working for the Cobra. But fear not he will pay.
ZUKERMAN And, cut!
BILLY DEE Oh, let me give you a hand. 
NIKKI Oh, thank you. Billy Dee, it was so great working with you.
BILLY DEE Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine; thank you so much.
NIKKI You're sweet.
BILLY DEE Take care.
NIKKI You too.
ZUKERMAN Alright, that's a series wrap for Corvette! Let's hear it for Nikki!
NIKKI Thank you.
ZUKERMAN Brilliant, Nikki. As always. You know, you don't need to die. We can bring you back next season.
NIKKI How?
ZUKERMAN Well, let's say that, uh, Corvette was wearing a bullet-proof vest?
ZUKERMAN Bullet-proof breast!
NIKKI Look, I'm just a guest star, and we all know what happens to guest stars.
ZUKERMAN Now that your work's done here, I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney and heading back to LA.
NIKKI No, I'm not leaving Sydney. I love you.
ZUKERMAN I love you too.
SAWYER Son of a bitch! Alright, come on, let's go one more.
HURLEY You said best out of five.
SAWYER Well, now we're going best of seven.
SAWYER Ah.
HURLEY Uh, you OK?
HURLEY What happened?
NIKKI Pa... lies...
SAWYER The hell's she saying?!
HURLEY I dunno.
SAWYER Let's get her some water! Get help!
SAWYER What are you doing?! Get moving!
HURLEY Dude... Nikki's dead.
SAWYER ... Who the hell's Nikki?
NIKKI Mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.
ZUKERMAN Hm hm! My new chef; he's fantastic. Paulo, come in here.
PAULO Yes, sir?
ZUKERMAN Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan. I'd like you to meet Nikki.
NIKKI The food is amazing.
PAULO You're too kind. The secret is the shaved truffles. Luckily for you, they are in season.
NIKKI You know, you should ask for a raise.
PAULO Excuse me. 
ZUKERMAN He just came to Sydney. Heard I was hiring, and showed up at my office every day until I gave him the job. Apparently, back home, he's the, um, "Wolfgang Puck of Brazil".
NIKKI Wow.
ZUKERMAN Here. Try one of these home-made rolls. Please, please do.
NIKKI Oh, it's... beautiful. Howie, you shouldn't have!
ZUKERMAN I realize, of course, it's not a ring. Not yet. But, uh, when my wife--
NIKKI Paulo..! Paulo!
PAULO He's gone.
NIKKI I would have loved it if you could have figured out a way where I didn't have to eat the same food as him.
PAULO So nobody else knows about this thing?
NIKKI Everything in here is way off the books.
PAULO What?
NIKKI Ashes are evidence, Paulo. We poisoned him; let's not poison ourselves.
NIKKI Razzle-frickin'-dazzle.
CHARLIE What happened?
HURLEY We dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing.
SUN Maybe it was something she ate.
CHARLIE Maybe she was poisoned.
SUN We should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
CHARLIE She's got gunk. Under her fingernails. Where'd you find her?
SAWYER Right here. She stumbled out of the jungle, face-planted, said something like "plywood", and... and, sayonara.
HURLEY Actually, I think she said "power lines."
SAWYER Well, who the hell knows what she said — she was five seconds from dying. Probably seeing a light at the end of the tunnel—
HURLEY "Paulo lies!" That's what she said! "Paulo lies," not "power lines." "Paulo lies."
SAWYER Who the hell's Paulo?
HURLEY Paulo's her... husband, or... boyfriend, or... whatever. They lived down the beach.
SAWYER Well, where the hell is he? 'Cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
PAULO English ex-pat, Howard L. Zuckerman, the creative force behind such hit shows as Exposé, Strike Team Alpha and Dr. Kincaid Esquire, was found dead in his palatial Sydney estate from heart failure.
NIKKI Are you chewing gum?
PAULO Nicotine gum. I quit.
PAULO A toast. To our new life together.
NIKKI Cheers.
SHANNON There's nowhere to sit. No tables, no chairs, nothing. Good call, Boone.
BOONE Do you wanna just grab a chair from the restaurant?
SHANNON No, forget it, let's just leave. You already screwed us out of seats in first class, why would you be able to find them here?
BOONE Hey, can I have this chair please?
PAULO Yeah. Be my guest.
SHANNON Boone, let's just go!
BOONE Thanks anyway.
SHANNON Boone!
BOONE I'm coming, Shannon.
SHANNON If you quit flirting with random guys, maybe you could actually get on the plane.
NIKKI Promise me we'll never end up like them.
PAULO I promise.
AIRPORT PA Paging Captain Stewart, please pick up the courtesy call Captain Stewart.
SHANNON BOONE!!! BOONE!!! BOONE!!!
LOCKE Hey, hey, get away from there! Hey, get back, get down. Get away from there!!!
NIKKI Paulo! Paulo!
ARZT Are we alive? Did we survive? Look at me, am I OK? Am I OK?
BOONE Hey. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen? Hey does anybody have a pen?!
NIKKI Paulo. Paulo, are you OK?
PAULO Yeah. I think so.
NIKKI Baby look at me. Look at me.
NIKKI Where's the bag?
PAULO What?
NIKKI The bag, Paulo, where is it?
SAWYER I'm telling ya, this is the trail.
HURLEY What do you know about tracking?
SAWYER Well I know what a footprint is.
JIN Over here.
HURLEY Wow.
SAWYER I'm guessing that's Paulo.
HURLEY He's just like Nikki, no wound, nothing.
JIN 이 친구 옷이 왜 이래?
HURLEY Yeah I know.
HURLEY Why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree?
SAWYER Maybe he stepped on something.
HURLEY You see something? Sawyer?
SAWYER Nothing.
SAWYER No! Don't.
HURLEY Dude, what are you doing?
SAWYER Two people are dead — you ever think they mighta been poisoned?
HURLEY That's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene.
SAWYER Crime scene? There a forensics hatch I don't know about?
JIN STOP! Monster.
NIKKI How many times do I have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters.
PAULO Maybe it was a dinosaur.
NIKKI Its not Jurassic Park, Paulo, its the South Pacific.
PAULO Then what was it? You saw the trees move.
NIKKI Would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, OK, the coastguard is gonna get here any second, and I really don't think that they're gonna take "hey, you know what, I'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
PAULO OK, OK, OK.
ETHAN Hey. You guys lose your luggage? Yeah I lost mine too. I found some other stuff though, so if you need anything, pants or sweatshirt, I can help you find some that fit. I'm Ethan, by the way.
NIKKI Hi, I'm Nikki, and this is Paulo.
ETHAN Nikki.
PAULO Hi.
ETHAN Paulo.
NIKKI And you are so sweet Ethan, but actually we're not looking for clothes. Yeah, see, Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.
ETHAN Ouch. You might have more luck looking inland.
PAULO In the jungle?
ETHAN The plane split apart when it was over the Island , so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.
ARZT Boone. Boone took the water.
KATE What is going on?
BOONE Someone had to take responsibility for it, it would have never lasted!
JACK Leave him alone! Its been six days, we're all still waiting for someone to come. We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. Now I found water. Fresh water up in the valley. I'll take in a group at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute. Because every man for himself is not gonna work. But if we can't live together, we're gonna die alone.
HURLEY I'm with Jin. It's the Monster.
SAWYER Yeah, because that makes the most sense.
HURLEY It does. Locke said when Eko died, his last words were "You're next." And Nikki and Paulo were with them. He was talking about them.
SAWYER He wasn't saying you're next about them, he was saying you're next as in you're all next.
HURLEY Yeah, that's not really better.
SAWYER Alright, so here's how I see it. We wanna know what happened, we gotta find out whatever we can about these jabronis.
JIN Jabronis?
SAWYER Nina and Pablo.
HURLEY Dude, show some respect. You know their names, its Nikki and Paulo.
SAWYER Whatever, Hugo. Where's their tent? And we better get some shovels.
NIKKI Hey Dr. Arzt.
ARZT Oh hi.
NIKKI You're a scientist, right?
ARZT And an educator, yes.
NIKKI What are you doing with all this stuff?
ARZT Oh, erm well, since we've been on here, I've discovered 20 new species. I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.
ARZT Ah, ah, that is a Latrodectus regina. Very dangerous. They call her the medusa spider. Her pheromones are very strong, one whiff and every male of the species would be here in seconds. Not unlike you I guess.
NIKKI So, you're probably too busy to help me then.
ARZT No, no, not at all, I'm fine, er, I can help you, what can I do ya for?
NIKKI Well I'm trying to find my luggage, and since the plane broke apart over the jungle, I was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.
ARZT Do I, do I know about trajectories? Allow me to draw you a map, madam.
PAULO Are you sure we should be listening to a high school science teacher?
NIKKI Junior high, and yes. What's your problem with Leslie anyway?
PAULO Leslie?
NIKKI Oh ho, you're jealous!
PAULO Of him? Ha, never.
NIKKI Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much, I had to sleep with him to get the map.
PAULO I wouldn't be surprised. You slept with Zuckerman.
NIKKI I did that for us.
PAULO OK I'm sorry, I just, I don't trust that guy. We should have gone to Ethan, he would have helped.
NIKKI Paulo, look.
PAULO Another plane. Looks like its been here a while.
NIKKI Go up there, maybe there's a radio or some—
PAULO Are you insane? If I go up there that thing's gonna fall.
NIKKI You're not gonna fall.
PAULO What? You want me to die? Come on. Let's keep going.
NIKKI What's that?
PAULO OK, let's do it.
PAULO Let's check it out.
NIKKI Wow. So our carry-on bag fell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself? You don't wanna climb up to a plane, but now you wanna climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel. I don't think so.
HURLEY Hey, man, be careful.
SAWYER Why? They don't live here any more.
CHARLIE So Sun checked the food. They were eating the same as us and no one else is sick. Could it be a virus?
HURLEY Dude, Monster. Creepy, they collected bugs.
CHARLIE Ah, I think these were Arzt's. Collected all kinds of creepy crawlies before he... exploded.
HURLEY They must have been friends.
CHARLIE Exposé.
HURLEY Did you just say Exposé?
CHARLIE Yeah.
SAWYER What the hell's Exposé?
HURLEY Only the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like "Baywatch", only better. Its about Autumn and Crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.
SAWYER How'd I miss that one?
HURLEY Check it out, look at the cast list, Nikki Fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in Australia. This must have been her big break.
CHARLIE Well it certainly sounds like it.
HURLEY No way. Mr. LaShade was the Cobra?
CHARLIE Is that supposed to mean something?
HURLEY Dude the Cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons.
HURLEY They had a walkie talkie?
SAWYER Every damn one of those bastards on the other side of the Island had one exactly like this hanging from their belts.
CHARLIE So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?
SAWYER I'll tell ya how. They were working with the Others.
SHANNON What gives you the right?
KATE You have to understand, we thought it was best for everybody.
ARZT I'm sorry, you my mother? Cause she knows what's best for me — other than that, I decide.
NIKKI Hey, what's going on?
SHANNON Kate and her two boyfriends found a case of guns that fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
KATE Look. The case is locked. The key is around Jack's neck, alright. I promise you they're safe.
ARZT You're all out of control. The pigs are walking. Huh, the pigs are walking!
NIKKI So, where did you say you found that case?
NIKKI Its just water, Paulo. Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
PAULO Why me?
NIKKI Well as you had no trouble reminding me, I slept with Howie Zuckerman. So the least you could do is go for a swim, and Kate said they found the case on the bottom.
PAULO Lemme ask you something.
NIKKI What?
PAULO If you didn't need me to find that bag, would we still be together?
NIKKI That bag is worth eight million dollars. Just dive in, Paulo.
NIKKI Well?
PAULO Nothing.
NIKKI There's nothing down there?
PAULO Just dead bodies.
HURLEY OK, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the Others, like how?
SAWYER Like Michael.
CHARLIE If that's the case, then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?
SAWYER Who knows why those people do anything? What matters is they could be out there right now waiting to get us.
HURLEY I dunno, dude. I was with the Others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the Island.
SUN Then who dragged me into the jungle? The Others came into our camp, they grabbed me, put a bag over my head. And if I hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
SAWYER Look, y'all stay here. Lemme see if I can see any sign of 'em. I'll do a perimeter sweep.
HURLEY Where'd you get the gun?
SAWYER Got it off one of them.
HURLEY And when were you gonna let us know?
SAWYER I guess right now.
HURLEY What exactly is a perimeter sweep?
CHARLIE Heyб shouldn't we cover them up?
SUN Yes, of course.
Flashback - 32 days ago. At night, Paulo is on the beach digging through his carry-on bag that he found in the waterfall earlier. He opens and chews some nicotine gum before beginning to bury the Matryoshka doll in the sand.]
LOCKE Nice night.
LOCKE What you doing?
PAULO Nothing.
LOCKE It looks like you're digging a hole. Every man's entitled to his secrets Paulo, but can I give ya a piece of advice?
PAULO Please, John.
LOCKE You should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
PAULO Why is that?
LOCKE Things don't stay buried on this Island. The beach is eroding. Winter's coming, high tide. Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away. See you back at camp.
BEN Who left this open?
JULIET Tom was down here a couple of days ago.
BEN Have him cover it up with the plane.
JULIET That him? Shephard?
BEN Yes.
JULIET He's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.
BEN No, I can convince him to do it.
JULIET How?
BEN Same way I get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and I exploit it.
JULIET So, what? We just grab all three of them, Ford and Austen too?
BEN No, they need to come to us.
JULIET And how do we make that happen?
BEN Michael, of course.
JULIET Are we done here? This place gives me the creeps.
HURLEY Hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to Nikki and Paulo?
DESMOND Aye. Tragic.
HURLEY So, do you know anything?
DESMOND How do you mean?
HURLEY Can you, you know, use your psychic powers?
DESMOND Doesn't work like that. I only see flashes.
HURLEY No offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway.
DESMOND I do know that she was with your mate this morning.
HURLEY My mate?
DESMOND I saw her with your boy Sawyer. The dead girl, Nikki.
HURLEY He said he didn't know her.
DESMOND Then why was she yelling at him?
HURLEY Yelling?
DESMOND Aye.
HURLEY At Sawyer, this morning?
DESMOND Right before she died.
HURLEY Vincent! Dude!
CHARLIE So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting. That doesn't prove anything.
HURLEY Look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is Sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with Nikki.
SUN Sawyer's not a murderer. He went all the way across the Island to help Michael. It is the Others, I know what they can do.
HURLEY OK, you know what, I'll go get Desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw.
CHARLIE Sun. It was me.
SUN What?
CHARLIE It was me who took you, not the Others. I wasn't myself. After Locke hit me. After he humiliated me. Sawyer told me I could get even by helping him steal the guns, we just made it look like, the Others. I didn't mean to hurt you.
CHARLIE Sorry.
LOCKE Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station, there's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody wanna come along?
NIKKI I'll go.
LOCKE Great.
PAULO What?
LOCKE Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes, and bring water.
PAULO You're not serious.
NIKKI What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
NIKKI Hey guys. What are these other TVs for?
LOCKE Sorry?
NIKKI All these TVs. This guy says that there's six stations, 
PAULO The toilet still works.
HURLEY Give me the gun.
SAWYER The hell you talking about?
HURLEY Give it to me.
SAWYER Ain't even loaded.
HURLEY Then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning.
SAWYER Oh I see what this is. Villagers have got themselves some torches.
HURLEY Did you kill them?
SAWYER No. No, I didn't kill them. Yeah, me and Nikki went at it this morning. Cause she wanted a gun.
HURLEY Why didn't you tell us this before?
SAWYER Cause of the dirt under her nails.
HURLEY What?
SAWYER She was digging. And when we found him I saw a fresh mound of dirt. She was burying something. And if you take the time to dig a hole right before you die, then what you're hiding's probably pretty damn good.
SUN So what was it? What did she hide?
SAWYER Go ahead, take 'em. Cause whatever happened to those two, I had nothing to do with it.
NIKKI Did you know Thanksgiving was two weeks ago?
NIKKI We missed it, Paulo, just like we're gonna miss everything.
PAULO They're going to find us. We'll get rescued. You'll see.
NIKKI OK, where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?
PAULO I dunno, I guess, it's how we look at things. Like the bag. I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.
NIKKI How do you figure that?
PAULO Look what it did. It might have torn us apart.
NIKKI Yeah.
PAULO Wait here. I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
NIKKI OK.
NIKKI OK, I know you have them. Give me a gun.
SAWYER I don't have the guns. A-team took 'em all.
NIKKI Right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.
SAWYER Even if I had a gun I wouldn't give it to you. Judging by the fire you're breathing, I got a feeling no good would come of it.
NIKKI Sawyer, give me a gun.
SAWYER I got a better idea, sister. How about you go stick your head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
NIKKI Thanks for nothing.
SAWYER And who the hell are you?!
SAWYER Thanks for nothing.
SUN Charlie told me it was your idea. To kidnap me.
SAWYER You gonna tell Jin?
SUN No.
SAWYER Why not?
SUN Because then we'd have to dig another grave.
SAWYER Why are you giving me these?
SUN Because they're worthless here.
SAWYER See, and I thought I was going to get out of this without a —
HURLEY Nikki and Paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But I know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved Exposé. OK then, goodbye—
SAWYER Wait.
SAWYER Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.
PAULO Come on. You can just tell me.
NIKKI Na-uh, it's a surprise. We're almost there. OK, ready?
PAULO Yeah.
NIKKI I found the diamonds, Paulo.
PAULO What? Where?
NIKKI Right here.
NIKKI Give 'em to me.
PAULO What're you talking about?
NIKKI What am I talking about? What's this? Your nicotine gum. You wanted to stop looking for the bag cause you'd already found it. I know you have them, Paulo, so where are they?!
PAULO Calm down, OK?
PAULO What the hell's that?
PAULO Are you out of your mind?
NIKKI You remember Dr. Arzt's friend. Did it bite you? Does it hurt? He told me why they call it the Medusa Spider. Wanna know why?
PAULO What did you do?
NIKKI Because one look from Medusa will turn anyone to stone, just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you, for about eight hours. It won't kill you, it'll just slow your heart rate down to the point of where even a doctor would have a hard time—
NIKKI —hearing it beat. You won't be able to move a muscle, so I'll be able to do, all sorts of nasty things to you. And since it bit you on your neck, I'd say paralysis will happen fast. I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you. Huh?
NIKKI In a shoe, maybe?
NIKKI I think I know where...
NIKKI Son of a bitch.
PAULO I'm sorry.
NIKKI You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.
PAULO I was... afraid... of losing you. If you found the diamonds, you wouldn't need me any more.
NIKKI Ow, dammit! Oh no! No! No, no.
HURLEY Er, you OK?
HURLEY Hey, hey, what happened?
NIKKI Para...lyzed.
