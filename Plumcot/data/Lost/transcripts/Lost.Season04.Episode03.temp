JACK Did Ben ever mention knowing anyone off the island? You're sure of that?
JULIET No.
MILES Look, this is real simple. Do you know where he is or don't you?
JACK What do you want with him?
MILES I want to locate him.
MILES The people who hired me told me his name’s Benjamin Linus, I don't know anything else. They gave me the picture, that's all they told me.
MILES They told me "find him," and for what they're paying me I don't need to know anything else, do you?
JACK Okay, you want Ben. He's with Locke, and your friend—
MILES Charlotte.
JACK Charlotte. John's got her, too. And we know where they're headed.
MILES Locke’s the guy who killed Naomi. Give me back my gun, Shepherd.
JACK You want your gun back? I want answers.
JACK You don’t trust me, I don't trust you.
MILES You're supposed to be dead. But am I asking a million questions? No. We both have the same problem, this Locke guy.
KATE Even if Locke has your friend, you can’t just waltz in there and grab her. They're armed.
MILES Well how 'bout that? So are we! So why don't we move out?
SAYID You're not going anywhere. Will that helicopter fly?
FRANK It's what she does.
SAYID Then you can take me to your ship.
JACK Sayid, wait a second.
SAYID We did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we?
SAYID Well?
FRANK We burned a lot of fuel coming in, it can't carry much weight. I'll take three of you.
MILES In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took Charlotte prisoner.
SAYID I can bring her back. Safely. And if I do, will you take me to the ship?
FRANK Absolutely. You bring Charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island.
MAN 1 Good morning.
SAYID Good morning.
MAN 1 Long walk to the next hole. Want a ride?
SAYID Thank you, but no. My ball is right here.
MAN 1 You know, you are the first person I have seen out here all morning.
SAYID I believe we are paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy.
MAN 1 That we are.
MAN 1 Is this your first time in the Seychelles? Uh-uh, I'd use the 5-iron.
SAYID I think I'll stick with the 7.
MAN 1 Tell you what. Fifty Euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.
SAYID Let's make it 100.
MAN 1 Eccelente. Amazing, huh? How a wager makes just about anything more fun.
MAN 1 Not bad, not bad. So, what do you do for a living, my friend?
SAYID I do nothing.
MAN 1 Nothing? That doesn't pay for a vacation here.
SAYID I was the recipient of a large settlement.
MAN 1 Corporate merger?
SAYID Actually, a plane crash. Oceanic Airlines flight 8-1-5. I'm Sayid Jarrah, one of the Oceanic Six.
MAN 1 Ah, that's— that's amazing. I remember reading all about it.
SAYID Take your shot, my friend.
SAYID It appears you were right about the 5-iron.
MAN 1 Well, uh, enjoy your round, don't worry about the wager. All in good fun.
SAYID No, you won. Allow me to pay you.
MAN No, it's fine. Thank you, it's—
SAYID I insist, Mr. Avellino.
SAYID Ist frei? 
WOMAN Wohin möchten Sie gehen? 
SAYID "Is it free" was the full extent of my German.
WOMAN What are you looking for?
SAYID I love Europe. Everyone speaks English. I'm looking for Potsdamer Platz.
WOMAN You don't need a map. It's one block down right across the street.
SAYID Thank you.
WOMAN I'm Elsa.
SAYID Sayid.
WAITER Kann ich Ihnen etwas bringen? 
SAYID Could I have an espresso, please.
WAITER Ja, sofort. 
ELSA What sort of business brings you to Berlin?
SAYID I'm a headhunter. A corporate recruiter. What do you do?
ELSA My employer is an economist. He works in emerging markets. Actually, I don't really understand what he does; which doesn't matter, since all I do is shop for him. If this goes off, I'm at his side instantly. Which is wonderful, since he's only in Berlin once or twice a year.
SAYID Which is why you are enjoying a luxuriously long mid-day coffee.
ELSA Yes.
SAYID Danke. 
ELSA Do I... know you from somewhere?
SAYID I'll tell you exactly where you know me from... if you let me take you to dinner.
ELSA Mm... This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight. 800. Well — if you can find it. 
MAN 2 Hello?
SAYID I made contact.
MAN 2 Good.
SAYID Take a look at this.
SAYID Naomi had it with her.
SAYID She was looking for Desmond. Whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it. Maybe Desmond can shed some light on this.
JACK How long would it take to get to the beach and back?
JULIET A couple of hours.
JACK You mind?
JULIET Anything I can do to help.
JACK Sayid, so how are we going to do this?
SAYID You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.
JACK And what kind of mission is that?
SAYID I'm going to make Locke release Charlotte. And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.
JACK As opposed to the way I'd do it.
SAYID The last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
SAYID That's not good diplomacy.
MILES Hey, Jarrah, you think you're going after Charlotte without me?
SAYID Of course not.
MILES Oh. Well, good.
SAYID Is there anything else?
MILES Yeah, give me my gun back.
SAYID We leave in 10 minutes.
SAWYER You ready to give us the name, Gizmo?
LOCKE He's not going to tell you who his spy is on their boat, James.
SAWYER Yeah, why not?
LOCKE Because that's the only thing keeping him alive.
SAWYER Well here's an idea Why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe, send that little piggy to market.
SAWYER And if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef. Now why don’t we do that?
LOCKE Because then we'd have to carry him.
CLAIRE Hey, John, how much further is it? I need to feed Aaron.
LOCKE It should be here, the cabin.
HURLEY Maybe we got turned around. It could be anywhere.
LOCKE No, it was here.
SAWYER Well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?
BEN John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
LOCKE I guess I was mistaken. It doesn't matter, the plan's the same. We keep moving. The Barracks aren't far.
DANIELLE If her team is with Jack's group, they know we're going to the Barracks.
SAWYER Yeah, and Red here was wearing a vest. Which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gun fight.
HURLEY If all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go? I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide. Why do we need to take prisoners?
LOCKE We're keeping her because she’s gonna be valuable.
HURLEY How's she going to be valuable?
CHARLOTTE He means as a hostage, love.
HURLEY Nuh uh, no, that's not what I signed up for.
LOCKE What did you sign up for, Hugo?
HURLEY Look, I'm just saying that if we let her go, they'll look at is as a sign of good faith.
LOCKE They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be.
HURLEY I'm just trying to come up with some kind of compromise—
LOCKE We're beyond compromise. And right now, Hugo, I'm making the decisions. Is that going to be a problem for you?
KATE Kinda sucks, huh?
JACK What's that?
KATE Being told not to come along. Now you know what it feels like to be me.
JACK Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and go anyway?
KATE Touché.
JACK You should go with them, Kate.
KATE Are you serious?
JACK Yeah.
KATE What, don't you trust Sayid?
JACK I don't trust Locke.
KATE So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to Naomi?
JACK Sawyer won't let him.
KATE Got room for one more?
MILES Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.
SAYID Gun's a last resort, Kate.
KATE You give Locke that same speech?
MILES Hey. Let's move out.
FRANK Hey, this guy Sayid — where's he from?
JACK Iraq.
FRANK Iraq? He's just gonna go and work everything out? What was he, a diplomat?
JACK No. No, he was a torturer.
SAYID Naomi, were you close to her?
MILES Nope. Met her on the boat.
SAYID You don't seem particularly affected by her death.
MILES Sure I'm affected. She was hot and I dug her accent.
KATE Nice.
SAYID And this woman, Charlotte. You don't really care about her, do you?
MILES Define care.
SAYID So much for camaraderie.
MILES Yeah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns? Actually, I do care about Locke. Maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half.
SAYID There was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us... or kill us.
MILES And which side did you land on?
SAYID I let you know when I decide. 
ELSA You look fantastic.
ELSA This is why I wanted to take you to the opera.
SAYID If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother?
ELSA You know what? I'm not bringing it. If tonight's the night he calls, so be it.
SAYID I'll carry it. If he does call, I don't want you fired over me. You should tell your employer that there is newer technology.
ELSA Well, I've tried. He's very old-fashioned. You know how bosses can be. Do you have a boss?
SAYID Everyone has a boss, Elsa.
SAYID Come on, we don't want to be late.
ELSA Why are you still here? When we met, you said you would only be in Berlin for one week.
SAYID The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.
ELSA Oh. Right. I was hoping it was because of me.
SAYID Let's go. Strauss awaits.
JACK What's his story?
FRANK Daniel?
JACK Yeah.
FRANK Couldn't tell ya. Half the stuff he says goes way over my head; the other half goes way, way over.
DANIEL Hey, uh, Frank? Could I, uh, sorry to interrupt. May I please use the phone, just for a second?
FRANK For what?
DANIEL I just wanna call Regina on the boat. I figured since we're waiting, I could just, you know, try to—
FRANK What is it, Daniel?
DANIEL I'd just like to do an experiment. Just, uh...
FRANK Sure. You just keep it to that science stuff, alright?
DANIEL Yeah.
FRANK If Minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away.
DANIEL Yeah, thank you.
REGINA Hello?
DANIEL Regina? Hey, hi, it's Dan. Hang on.
DANIEL Can you hear me?
REGINA Yeah.
DANIEL Yeah, hang on.
DANIEL I'm all, yes, I'm all set here, I have a fix. Are you locked in?
REGINA Getting your signal pretty clear.
DANIEL Oh, okay, great, then. OK. Fire the payload.
REGINA Payload away.
FRANK Don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.
REGINA Forty kilometers to beacon. Thirty-five kilometers to beacon. Thirty kilometers to beacon. Twenty-five kilometers to beacon. Twenty kilometers to beacon.
REGINA Fifteen kilometers to beacon. Ten kilometers to beacon.
DANIEL Regina?
REGINA Five kilometers to beacon.
DANIEL Huh.
REGINA Zero.
DANIEL I don't have it.
REGINA That's weird.
DANIEL That is far more than weird.
MILES What's with the swing set? These people have daycare?
KATE You think they're here yet?
SAYID Let's find out.
KATE It's coming from in there.
KATE Hurley, what happened?
HURLEY They left me.
HURLEY Locke's gone off the reservation, man. I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said Walt was the one who told him to kill the other chick, and, and he—
SAYID Walt?
HURLEY Dude, don't ask. I was, like, just trying to argue with him, so he would just like, you know, chill, but—
MILES How about you stop babbling and just tell us what happened to them? Where are they?
HURLEY Who are you?
MILES Where the hell did they go, Tubby?
HURLEY Oh, awesome. The ship sent us another Sawyer.
SAYID Hurley, where did they go?
HURLEY Look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know.
KATE So they all left, all together?
HURLEY Yeah, they were freaked. Locke said the people on the ship were here to rescue Charlotte and then kill us. So... are you?
MILES Not yet.
SAYID Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?
HURLEY Um, Locke said they were gonna go by Ben's house before they took off.
SAYID Why would they go there?
HURLEY For all I know, they could have locked Ben up in a closet too.
MILES Where's Ben's house?
JACK Mind if I ask you a question?
FRANK Shoot.
JACK The Red Sox really win the Series?
FRANK Hey, don't get me started on that, alright? My dad's from the Bronx. I bleed Yankee blue.
JACK I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.
DANIEL Oh. It's the payload! It's finally here.
JACK What is that?
DANIEL It's a rocket.
DANIEL Oh, no, no.
DANIEL Thirty-one minutes.
DANIEL Oh, no. This is not good.
FRANK Your friends are back.
DESMOND Well... look at that. 
SAYID Look for anything that shows where they might have gone. I'll start in here.
KATE Sayid!
LOCKE Don't worry, Kate's fine.
LOCKE Good job, Hugo.
HURLEY Sorry, dude.
DANIELLE Sorry, Sayid, nothing personal.
SAYID Where's Locke?
HURLEY He's talking to that angry Chinese guy.
SAYID I'm not going to hurt you, Hurley.
HURLEY Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break dancing thing you do with your legs. I think I'll hang back here.
BEN Well... I guess they're running out of jail space.
BEN I lost a dollar, you know.
SAYID How did you manage that?
BEN I bet John that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
SAYID What do you know about friendship?
BEN I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
KATE So what, I'm your prisoner?
SAWYER If that sorta thing turns you on.
KATE What are you doing here with Locke?
SAWYER I'm not with him.
KATE Yeah, you are, James.
SAWYER Then what are you doing with Jack?
KATE I went with Jack because I believe he can get us off this island.
SAWYER I guess that's the difference between us.
SAWYER I ain't looking to leave.
KATE Why not?
SAWYER 'Cause, I ain't got nothin' back there for me.
KATE And what's here that's so much better?
SAWYER Why do you want to go back, Kate? Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here. So if you think there's anything waiting for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don’t know how the world works. Look around us, Freckles. We've got roofs over our heads. Electricity, showers, beds.
KATE Yeah, how long, Sawyer? How long do you think we can play house?
SAWYER Why don't we find out? 
LOCKE Iced tea.
LOCKE I thought you might be thirsty.
BEN I'm thirsty.
LOCKE I'm sorry about, um, all the theatrics, but uh, I didn't know how many of you there'd be, or whether you'd be armed. I covered my bases. 
SAYID What have you done with Miles and Kate?
LOCKE Kate's with Sawyer. And Miles is somewhere else. He's fine. All I did was ask him some questions.
SAYID Did he answer any?
LOCKE No.
SAYID Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?
LOCKE Not particularly.
SAYID Then why don't you turn her over to me?
LOCKE Why would I do that?
SAYID I agree that these people are liars and they're certainly not here to rescue us. But if I return safely with Charlotte, they'll take me to their ship. It's our best chance of finding out who they are and what they really want.
LOCKE Well, then, I can save you a lot of trouble, Sayid, because Ben says he's got a spy on the boat.
SAYID Who?
BEN It's a secret.
SAYID Forgive me, but the day I start trusting him is the day I would have sold my soul. Give me Charlotte! Allow me to do things my way. Or war is coming, which we will both be powerless to stop.
LOCKE Why would I give you Charlotte for nothing?
SAYID Oh, I think you misunderstood me. I never expected you to give her to me for nothing. 
ELSA Should we get dressed?
SAYID No.
ELSA Well, we're going to have to get out of this bed at a certain point.
SAYID Why?
ELSA Well, for one thing, because I know that eventually you're going to have to go to that job of yours — you know, the one that you never talk about.
SAYID There's nothing to talk about, it's just a job.
ELSA I know nothing about you. I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, what happened to you. But what about life now, what about you? That's what you do when you're in love, right? You...
SAYID In love?
ELSA Yeah.
SAYID Okay. No more secrets. What do you want to know?
ELSA He's here. My boss. I, um, I have to go.
SAYID Now? Where?
ELSA Hotel Adlon. Where's my dress?
SAYID Elsa? You have to leave Berlin.
ELSA What?
SAYID You can't be here anymore.
ELSA What do you mean? Why would I—
SAYID People will be asking questions soon. About what happened to your employer. And you can't be around to answer them.
ELSA My employer? This... this is about my boss? Who are you?
SAYID This has nothing to do with how—
ELSA The café? You meant to meet me there? You used me to get to my boss. What did you say, "people will ask what happened to him"?
SAYID It's best you don't know.
ELSA You gonna kill him? You're gonna kill him?! Do you even know him?!
SAYID His name is on a list.
ELSA A list?! What list?! You have a list?!
SAYID It's my employer's.
ELSA And who is that?!
SAYID It doesn't matter who he is!
ELSA You just kill people 'cause they're on a list? Innocent people?
SAYID The man you are working for is not an economist.
ELSA You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty, not ten. No, I didn't kill him. He's not going to give up the name now.
ELSA Why should I keep him alive? No. He had no idea. All right, all right. I'll bring him to you. Leave the hotel. I'll meet you at the safe house.
ELSA What do you think you're do—
DESMOND Hey. I'm gonna ask you one last time. Why was Naomi carrying this picture of me?
FRANK Look, man, you gotta understand something. She was senior management. It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together. She stayed on her own.
DESMOND Look, Naomi told me you people were hired by her! So you look me right in the eye and tell me you've never seen or heard of Penelope Widmore.
DESMOND Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth; I'll find someone who will. See, when that takes off, I'm on it.
JULIET He's back.
JACK Where's Kate?
SAYID She decided to stay.
FRANK What happened to Miles?
SAYID I traded him.
FRANK Traded him?
SAYID I promised you Charlotte, here she is.
FRANK You cheated.
SAYID Did I?
FRANK Yes, you did. Lucky for you that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.
CHARLOTTE Hey.
DANIEL You all right?
CHARLOTTE Yeah.
FRANK All right. That gives us room for one more. Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE Go back? With all the fun I'm having here? No, I've got work to do.
FRANK Seat's yours if you want it, Daniel.
DANIEL I... no, thank you. I think I should probably just stay with Charlotte.
FRANK All right.
DANIEL Hey, Frank. Frank? Just one thing. Just be sure that you follow the same exact bearing that we came in on. No matter what. By that, I mean no matter what. Just — just stay on it.
FRANK Roger that.
JACK Be careful.
SAYID I don't have to talk you out of coming.
JACK As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control.
SAYID Wish me luck.
JACK Good luck. Send me a postcard.
SAYID You said we have room for one more?
FRANK Yeah, why?
SAYID We should bring Naomi home.
MAN 2 Take your shirt off.
MAN 2 Is she dead?
SAYID Yes.
MAN 2 Why didn't she kill you?
SAYID She was trying to get information from me.
MAN 2 What sort of information?
SAYID She wanted to know who I worked for. She wanted to know about you.
MAN 2 Of course she did.
BEN Why are you crying? Because it hurts? Or because you were stupid enough to care for her? These people don't deserve our sympathies. Need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?
SAYID You used that to recruit me into killing for you.
BEN Do you want to protect your friends or not, Sayid? I have another name for you.
SAYID But they know I'm after them now.
BEN Good.
