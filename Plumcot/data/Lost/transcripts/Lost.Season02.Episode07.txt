YELLING#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode07 MAN Help! Help! Anybody see my wife? Pam!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We're not there yet. I promise, we're going to get you home soon, okay.
mr_eko Excuse me, would you look after the children? There is something I have to do.
cindy_chandler Uh, okay.
mr_eko Stay with this nice woman. I'll be back in a minute.
donald Ow, my leg, my leg! Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?
libby_smith No, it's not that bad. I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe in Vermont. I was on this run -- going pretty fast -- I was racing this cute ski patrol guy. I went off this mogul, lost my edge and, bam!
libby_smith Snapped my left leg. Now that -- that was bad.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You a doctor?
libby_smith A year of med school before I dropped out. I'm a clinical psychologist. You saved that girl's life -- you a doctor?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No.
goodwin_stanhope Help! Hey, I need some help! There's somebody in the jungle, come on. He's alive!
bernard_nadler Help! Please help me! Help! Help!
goodwin_stanhope We should climb up there -- I'll hold him steady, you pull him...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No, wait. What's your name?!
bernard_nadler Bernard!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You're going to be alright, Bernard. I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you!
bernard_nadler Is he dead? I think he's dead.
goodwin_stanhope We should climb up there.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No. I need you to focus, Bernard! Unbuckle your seatbelt! Now grab the branch next to you!
bernard_nadler I don't think I can do that.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Those seats are going to fall.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Come on, you can do it. Bernard!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Alright, hold on tight, okay! I'm coming up to get you!
libby_smith Does anybody have any water?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You couldn't find any matches?
goodwin_stanhope Dry ones? You can ask around but I couldn't find any. It'll be dark soon, let me get a signal fire started so they can find us.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you, a boy scout?
goodwin_stanhope Grown up version -- I'm in the Peace Corps.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They still have that?
goodwin_stanhope I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What's your name?
goodwin_stanhope Goodwin.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm Ana Lucia.
bernard_nadler I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
mr_eko Yes.
bernard_nadler Were any of them African-American?
mr_eko No.
bernard_nadler Oh, it's my wife -- I can't find her.
mr_eko I will pray for her.
bernard_nadler Where the hell are the rescue planes?
mr_eko I will pray for them, too.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What was that?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Libby, watch the kids.
goodwin_stanhope Over here.
libby_smith It's alright. It'll be okay.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What happened?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No wallets, no cell phone, no keys. Nothing.
ana_lucia_cortez Hey, are you okay?
nathan Look, 3 of the people are missing -- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy, and the German who was helping us with the injured.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Did you see anything?
nathan No, I didn't.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where did they come from? How many there were?
nathan No, I didn't see anything. Who are these people?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I don't know. They're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes. These people were here before us.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We need to get off the beach. We need to find a safer place.
nathan We've got kids and people that are seriously hurt. Where are we going to go? How are we going to move them? And what about the signal fire? How are we going to get rescued if we're off the beach?
goodwin_stanhope Nathan's right.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They have satellites -- the black box -- we don't need a fire for them to find us.
cindy_chandler Yes, we do. Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication; we were turning back. We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction. They don't know where to look.
libby_smith It's Donald, his leg. The infection is getting worse. He'll be the 4th to go.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are we supposed to do about that?
libby_smith Would you like some chicken? You haven't said a word in a week. Why aren't you talking? Hey, it wasn't your fault, you know. You were just defending yourself.
goodwin_stanhope That'll work.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Eh, I heard a pig or something out there. Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow. What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where were you?
nathan I had to go to the bathroom.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We have a system for that. We go in pairs.
nathan Yeah, sorry.
UNKNOWN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode07 VOICE Behind you! Behind you!
emma Help us, please!
libby_smith The kids! They took the kids!
libby_smith They took Jim! and Eli! Nancy's gone! They're gone!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Which way did they go? Which way did they go?!! Wake up! Wake up!! Who are you? Talk to me. Wake up!
goodwin_stanhope She's dead. She's dead.
goodwin_stanhope What are you doing? Is that a knife?
goodwin_stanhope What is that?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA It's a list.
libby_smith A list of what?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA 9 -- of us.
ana_lucia_cortez Nothing? They drag 9 people into the jungle -- the kids -- and there's no sign of them? Now's not a good time to talk? What needs to happen to make you say something?!
nathan Hey, calm down, let's figure this out.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Calm down? Let's figure this out? Here are the names of every single person they took -- all 9 of them -- what they were wearing -- what they look like -- one of them had a list of us.
nathan They could have gotten our names from the people they already took.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Nobody knew anybody's names the first night.
nathan Maybe they're watching us?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You were gone for 2 hours yesterday.
nathan What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where were you?
nathan I was going to the bathroom.
goodwin_stanhope Hey, stop! We're all scared. Let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything.
bernard_nadler He's right. Why would they try to infiltrate us -- that's crazy.
libby_smith Well, whoever they are they know we are here. We need to leave this beach.
ana_lucia_cortez You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
goodwin_stanhope I think it's time we let it go out.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA 5 minutes.
bernard_nadler We've been walking for 3 days straight, Ana.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA And you're still here. 5 minutes.
nathan You know what? You want to keep walking, go ahead -- fresh water -- rock wall at our backs -- lots of fruit trees -- right here looks pretty good to me.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Fine, okay. This'll work.
libby_smith Hey.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hey.
libby_smith Back at the beach -- the night they came back -- you said that Nathan was gone for 2 hours? That he was missing? Creeps me out, Ana. Do you really think it's possible that one of us is one of them?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
bernard_nadler Are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this?
nathan Oh yeah, give me another stick.
bernard_nadler Oh, hey, Ana.
bernard_nadler Ana?!
nathan What are you doing?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You and I are going to have little talk, Nathan.
nathan You, let me out of here right now. You let me out. You let me out!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA He wasn't on the plane.
bernard_nadler What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We were in the air for 2 hours -- I didn't see him once -- not once.
goodwin_stanhope It's a big plane, Ana, just because you didn't...
cindy_chandler No, I didn't see him either. I'm pretty good with faces, you know, with the passengers, and I did not see him.
goodwin_stanhope You're not all serious.
libby_smith He never talks about himself, Nathan. Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
bernard_nadler No, if he really were one of them why would he still be here?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
nathan Will you let me out, Ana?
ana_lucia_cortez You got a problem with this?
nathan What are you doing? Let me out.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are you from, Nathan?
nathan Canada.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What were you doing in Australia?
nathan Company retreat.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where are they?
nathan What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA The rest of your retreat -- where are they?
nathan They weren't on the plane. I stayed a couple extra days to sight-see.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA How come nobody saw you on the plane, Nathan?
nathan I was in the lavatory.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA For 2 hours?
nathan I don't remember seeing you on the plane, Ana Lucia.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA That's because you weren't on it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where are the kids, Nathan? Where are the kids? Not talking to me anymore? What's that behind you? Get up! I said get up!
ana_lucia_cortez Who gave him food?
cindy_chandler What happened?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'm trying to find out what they did to us. And you're taking care of him?
bernard_nadler I didn't do anything. And what if you're wrong, Ana? We don't even know if there is a spy.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one -- his -- Nathan's.
libby_smith Well, they haven't come since you put him in there.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Who did it?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You?
goodwin_stanhope I'm worried about you, Ana. You've had him down there 4 days.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
goodwin_stanhope Do you have any kids, Ana?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No.
goodwin_stanhope We should let him go. We're not savages.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already. That's tomorrow.
goodwin_stanhope Grab the rope. I'll pull you up. Ana Lucia's -- I think we all think that she's going to hurt you. Now, you need to get away from here. There's some fruit in there, now just go.
nathan Which way's the beach?
goodwin_stanhope That way, maybe 5 miles.
goodwin_stanhope Morning.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Morning.
cindy_chandler Ana Lucia, he's gone!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What?
cindy_chandler He's gone. Nathan's gone.
bernard_nadler Ana, what are you going to do?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They found us, it's time to move.
cindy_chandler What is it?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I don't know -- some sort of bunker.
libby_smith Do you think it's theirs?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you doing?
libby_smith What is this place?
goodwin_stanhope It looks like some sort of storage facility.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hey, come over here.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What was that? Get it.
bernard_nadler What else in here?
libby_smith It's a glass eye.
bernard_nadler Look at this. It's a radio.
bernard_nadler Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?
goodwin_stanhope The hills are blocking it. If we want a signal we need to get to higher ground. I'll do it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I'll go with you.
goodwin_stanhope Nah, you should stay here, Ana -- get this place set up as a shelter.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We can all get it set up. We can make it back in a couple of hours, let's go.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Why do you think they're doing this?
goodwin_stanhope Why do I think who's doing what?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
goodwin_stanhope Maybe they're not attacking us.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then -- no real harm done.
goodwin_stanhope Good point.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
goodwin_stanhope That first night they took the strongest of us -- our quiet friend -- three other guys. They're all athletic, tough, threats.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They didn't take you.
goodwin_stanhope Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed. Want to take a break?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Yeah, that's a good idea.
goodwin_stanhope Can I have the knife?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Thank you. Where do you think they got it? I mean, they don't even wear shoes. How'd they get an army knife?
goodwin_stanhope Sorry?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA The knife -- it's U.S. military. Here I'll show you. You see the tang stamp? This knife's probably 20 years old. You don't see these anymore, yet here it is, on this Island. Weird, huh? Can I ask you something?
goodwin_stanhope Sure, Ana.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash -- how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
goodwin_stanhope I heard him shouting from the beach.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA From the beach?
goodwin_stanhope Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Did he see you out there? Is that why you pretended to be one of us? You ran out of the jungle 10 minutes after the crash, you weren't wet. You were never even in the ocean. Where are they -- your friends? Nathan -- what did you-
goodwin_stanhope If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane, I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Did you kill him?
goodwin_stanhope Nathan was not a good person. That's why he wasn't on the list.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What about the kids? Did you kill them, too?
goodwin_stanhope Children are fine. They're better off now.
cindy_chandler Where's Goodwin?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We're safe here now.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Why are you wasting your time with that thing? There's no signal.
bernard_nadler I only turn it on a couple minutes a day. It really doesn't...
boone_carlyle Hello. Hello, anybody out there? Mayday. Mayday.
bernard_nadler Is there someone there?
boone_carlyle Hello! Hello!
cindy_chandler Who is that? Oh my god!
boone_carlyle Can you hear me?
bernard_nadler Repeat your transmission, please.
boone_carlyle Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815! Please copy!
bernard_nadler We're the survivors of flight 815.
bernard_nadler No, wait a minute. What are you doing?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA It's them. It's them. They're trying to draw us out -- trying to find us.
bernard_nadler No, he said 815; he said flight 815.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
bernard_nadler What if there really are other survivors out there?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA There are no survivors. This is our life now. Get used to it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you looking at?
mr_eko Going to be okay.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What, you're talking now?
mr_eko It's been 40 days.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
mr_eko You waited 40 days to cry.
cindy_chandler Libby.
cindy_chandler Turn him over.
libby_smith Is he alive? Get Ana Lucia, quick!
mr_eko Who are you? Where are you from?
jinsoo_kwon
bernard_nadler He doesn't even speak English.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA That doesn't mean anything.
cindy_chandler Ana, we found him in the water.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA He has a broken hand cuff on his wrist.
mr_eko I'm not sure that he's a threat.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA He's running!
jinsoo_kwon Michael, Sawyer!
james_ford Jin!
jinsoo_kwon Others! Others! Others!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hit me.
mr_eko Hit you?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You think they're okay? Let's find out. Hit me.
michael_dawson What was that?!
