TRUCK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 DRIVER Been on the road a while, huh?
kate_austen How long's it gonna take?
TRUCK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 DRIVER Well your fan belt's shot. Take two days, maybe three.
kate_austen Three days for a fan belt?
TRUCK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 DRIVER Welcome to Iowa. Name's Johnny.
kate_austen I'm Lucy.
cassidy_phillips They're all 18-carat gold.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Come on, those don't look real. I'm not buying them.
johnny If you need a lift into town, I'm finished up here in an hour.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Call the cops!
cassidy_phillips Ah fine, whatever! Your loss.
johnny Hey, there a problem buddy?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Yeah, yeah, there's a problem. I'm getting scammed here, that's a problem.
cassidy_phillips Look, I'm sorry.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 What'ya think, I'm an idiot?
cassidy_phillips Hey man if you don't wanna buy 'em you don't have to buy 'em.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Those are fake necklaces, and you're a rip-off artist.
cassidy_phillips They're real.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Call the cops.
cassidy_phillips If you don't want 'em, I'll sell 'em to somebody else...
kate_austen Hey, lemme see those. My father owns a jewelery store, I think I can spot a fake. How much?
cassidy_phillips Sixty bucks.
kate_austen I'll take the one on the end.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode15 Whatever.
cassidy_phillips Thanks.
kate_austen Yeah. Can I get my money back?
cassidy_phillips Hey! Why'd you help me?
kate_austen Just one girl watching another girl's back I guess.
cassidy_phillips Or, you're stranded here, and for some reason you didn't want that guy calling the cops.
cassidy_phillips I'll give ya a ride into town, you buy me a drink.
kate_austen What?
john_locke Kate.
kate_austen John! What are you doing? Did they capture you?
john_locke Yes, but, only temporarily. I came to say goodbye.
kate_austen Goodbye?
john_locke I'm leaving with them.
kate_austen The hell is going on, I mean, what are they doing to you, are you brainwashed? Where did Jack go?
john_locke Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate. He's gonna have to stay behind like you.
kate_austen You can't trust them. If they told you that they're going to take you home, they're lying—
john_locke I don't want to go home, Kate. I want you to know, I made a strong case for you. I told them that you were a good person. Reliable, smart, honest. And then they told me who you were and what you had done. Let's just say forgiveness isn't one of their strong suits. Good luck.
kate_austen John, where are you going?
john_locke Coming out!
kate_austen Hey, just... Where is Jack, and where is Sayid, have you seen Rousseau?
kate_austen John, please, what's happened to you?
john_locke I'm sorry, Kate.
james_ford The hell's wrong with you?
federal_agent Don't look at me and pretend we're not talking. I'm not supposed to be here.
james_ford Good, then scram.
federal_agent Dude, you need to know that... there's been some chatter. After Paulo and Nikki and everything. Well, tomorrow there's gonna to be a vote.
james_ford A vote for what?
federal_agent To decide whether or not to banish you.
james_ford Banish me?! Where?!
federal_agent Well, there's debate about that, but the consensus was half a mile down the beach.
james_ford Consensus?
federal_agent I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it. To, like, make amends.
james_ford I don't do amends.
federal_agent Might wanna ask yourself, about all the good stuff that comes from being a part of this... society. I mean you can't even feed yourself. You use our latrine, drink the water that Steve brings every morning to the trough—
james_ford Er...
federal_agent What?
james_ford You know how for three days, ten hours and fifteen minutes I ain't allowed to use nicknames?
federal_agent Yeah?
james_ford Well, you, Sir Hugo, are rotund, annoying, and you're ruining my damned view. How's that for amends?
federal_agent You're making a big mistake, dude.
james_ford Banish me...
cassidy_phillips How 'bout you tell me your name?
kate_austen It's Lucy.
cassidy_phillips And what's your real name? Next time somebody asks you, don't think about it.
kate_austen I didn't thi--
cassidy_phillips Not even for a second.
cassidy_phillips So, why Lucy?
kate_austen She's a saint. Memorized them all in Sunday school so I figured they're probably still all rattling around my brain.
cassidy_phillips What makes a girl who went to Sunday school scared of cops?
kate_austen A few months ago, I killed my stepfather, and escaped from the Marshal who arrested me for it.
cassidy_phillips Why?
kate_austen Cause he was a bad guy.
cassidy_phillips So, the hell are you doing in Iowa?
kate_austen I wanna talk to my mother.
cassidy_phillips You're gonna have a real hard time doing that. Because if you did what you just said you did, then the Feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.
kate_austen I'll figure something out.
cassidy_phillips Oh you will, huh?
kate_austen What, you wanna help me?
cassidy_phillips Absolutely.
kate_austen Why?
cassidy_phillips I fell in love with the wrong guy. And then I gave him my life savings. He conned me, and embarrassed me. He was a bad guy. So, I'll help you get the meeting with your Mom, Lucy, because one of us deserves something good.
james_ford I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.
james_ford Oh, oh, what the... shoo! Come here, come on...
james_ford Alright, let's do it.
federal_agent Do what?
james_ford I'm ready to do it. Make amends. Change the vote. I don't wanna be banished, OK? You happy?
federal_agent Dude you stink. What is that, fish?
james_ford No.
federal_agent Did you try to gut one yourself? How have you not learned that by now? I mean we've been here like, three months.
james_ford Can we just do this?
federal_agent Do what?
james_ford Make nice!
federal_agent Apologize for calling me all those names.
james_ford I'm really sorry I called you rotund.
federal_agent Really?
james_ford Ah God, you're worse than a girl. Come on, let's, spread the love.
dr_juliet_burke What the hell am I doing here?
kate_austen Why don't you tell me.
dr_juliet_burke I dunno.
kate_austen Well, I dunno either, so why don't you let go of my wrist.
kate_austen So what the hell happened?
dr_juliet_burke I was making a cup of tea. Canister came in through the window.
kate_austen So what did you do to piss em off?
dr_juliet_burke You're wasting your time. The knife is too big, you need something smaller, a safety pin or..
kate_austen We're going back.
dr_juliet_burke What? They did this to us, why would we go back?
kate_austen You say "they" like you didn't lock me in a cage and watch me break rocks all day. We're going back to your village because... my friends were probably gassed just like us. And your people are gone anyway. I saw them all pack up and leave.
dr_juliet_burke What?
kate_austen Locke came in and said goodbye. They were taking off, going somewhere else.
dr_juliet_burke Going, going where?
kate_austen He didn't... exactly tell me. Welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hell's going on.
federal_agent AGENT Go go go!
marshal_edward_mars MARS On the ground!
marshal_edward_mars Get down! On the ground! Let me see those hands. Let me see those hands! Long time no see, Austen.
marshal_edward_mars Who the hell are you?
cassidy_phillips I'm just selling Bibles!
cassidy_phillips Hi. They questioned for half an hour. He confiscated my case. He was asking me about selling Bibles and... ah, it's a good thing I know how to lie.
kate_austen Yeah, now we know what we're up against, right?
cassidy_phillips Yeah, now we know that there were six guys waiting to take you down, Lucy.
kate_austen Yeah, it's OK, I'll figure it out.
cassidy_phillips Figure it out? That Marshal, I don't know what you did to him, but if he ever gets his hands on you, it is going to be you or him.
kate_austen Look, if you've changed your mind. If you don't wanna help me, I get it.
cassidy_phillips No, I do wanna help you, but if I'm lying to federal agents, Lucy, so that you can have a chat with your Mom, then I at least need to know that there's a pretty good reason.
kate_austen He, uh, used to get drunk, and beat up my Mom. So I blew up his house. I made it look like an accident. A gas leak. Took out an insurance policy on the house, for her. Set her up for life. And then she gave me up. Chose him over me. So the reason I need to talk to her is, someone I love, someone who's supposed to care about me, betrayed me. And I wanna know why!
cassidy_phillips Well, then let's go find out.
dr_juliet_burke What are you doing?
kate_austen Whoever dragged us out here left a trail, it'll lead us back to where we came from. Let's go.
dr_juliet_burke It's gonna rain. Don't you think we should wait 'til morning?
kate_austen No.
kate_austen Why?
dr_juliet_burke Why what?
kate_austen Why would they handcuff you to me and then drag us all the way out into the jungle?
dr_juliet_burke Ben has a thing for mind games.
kate_austen That why he left you behind?
dr_juliet_burke Do we really have to talk?
kate_austen Nope.
kate_austen Come on, if the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.
dr_juliet_burke I hope you're not dragging me all the way back there with you for him.
kate_austen Excuse me?!
dr_juliet_burke I hope you're not going back for Jack. Because I was standing right there, when he told you not to come back. And now that you've ruined his chance to get off the Island--
kate_austen You done? I SAID ARE YOU DONE?!
kate_austen I... I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to...
dr_juliet_burke What the hell is that?!
kate_austen Get up.
dr_juliet_burke You dislocated my shoulder!
kate_austen GET, UP!
kate_austen Quick, in here! Come on. Get in. Come on, get down, get down.
dr_juliet_burke What the hell?
kate_austen Shh... up.
dr_juliet_burke Are we safe?
kate_austen You tell me.
james_ford I ain't kissing no damn baby.
federal_agent Claire's, like, really influential. If she votes for you to stay, you're home free dude.
james_ford Well, why wouldn't she vote for me? It's not like I ever done anything bad to her.
federal_agent Nah, but you never did anything good for her either. And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?
james_ford Wel,l I know how he is. He... cries loud and he smells.
federal_agent You see, that's what I'm talking about. You're sarcastic, people don't like that.
james_ford Alright. So I go over. Do what?
federal_agent Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies. You should go over there, say something nice. Call her Claire. And give her this I know you can do it, dude.
james_ford Hey, Claire.
claire_littleton Hey.
james_ford Hey there, little baby ... Aaron.
claire_littleton Is, er, is there anything I can do for you?
james_ford No. I just came by to say, your baby's... he's not as wrinkly as he was a couple weeks ago.
claire_littleton Yeah, I, I guess he's not. Thanks!
james_ford Oh, and er, this is for you.
claire_littleton Thank you.
james_ford I don't like, blankets. Well, goodnight.
claire_littleton Goodnight.
dr_juliet_burke Do you think it's gone? Are we safe?
kate_austen Are you serious? You've never seen that?
dr_juliet_burke Oh, if you don't believe me, you can always pull my other shoulder out of its socket.
kate_austen I was, I wasn't trying to...
dr_juliet_burke Don't flatter yourself. This is the fourth time it's been dislocated.
dr_juliet_burke Give me your hand.
kate_austen Why?
dr_juliet_burke Cause I want you to pop it back in.
kate_austen No, I'm not gonna...
dr_juliet_burke You're gonna. Right now it feels like there's broken glass under my skin, and if it weren't for you, I would be on my way home right now.
kate_austen Jack told me not to come back to protect me. Because he didn't want me to get hurt.
dr_juliet_burke Is that what you think?
kate_austen Yeah that's what I think.
dr_juliet_burke We have cameras on the cages, Kate. All of them. He saw you, you and Sawyer. The reason Jack told you not to come back, wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt, it was because you broke his heart. So, grab my wrist, push up and twist!
james_ford Why do we gotta be out here so damn early?
desmond_hume You asked me to help you catch a boar. Well, this is when they break cover to eat.
james_ford Looks like they picked a day to sleep in.
desmond_hume So what's your angle, brother?
james_ford My angle?
desmond_hume Well, you... haven't spoken three words to me and then, suddenly you want to be my hunting partner.
james_ford My angle, is that I got hearts and minds to change. And politics is all about bribes. Since money don't mean squat on this Island, I gotta give the people something they like. And people like meat...
desmond_hume Shh.
kate_austen How's your shoulder?
dr_juliet_burke Awesome.
kate_austen Then let's get going.
cassidy_phillips Thank you.
diane_janssen You're welcome sweetheart.
cassidy_phillips Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
diane_janssen No worries.
cassidy_phillips I'm such an idiot.
diane_janssen It happens all the time, sweetheart.
diane_janssen Uh, thank you.
kate_austen Hi, Mom.
diane_janssen What are you doing here, Katherine?
kate_austen You look good.
diane_janssen I asked you what you are doing here.
kate_austen I wanna know why you told them what I did to Wayne.
diane_janssen I thought maybe you came 'cause you wanted to say you were sorry.
kate_austen I'm not sorry. He hit you, he treated you like a dog, and you...
diane_janssen You can't help who you love, Katherine. And for good or bad, I loved him. And you burnt him alive. You turned on the gas, and you lit a match. You murdered him in cold blood!
kate_austen I did it for you.
diane_janssen No. What you did, you did for yourself. I have to go back to work. Because you are my daughter, I'm not going to tell the two men sitting at the table who've been following me for the last month that you are here. But I swear to God, Katie, if I ever see you again, the first thing I will do is yell for help. Goodbye.
kate_austen Did he say that to you?
dr_juliet_burke Sorry?
kate_austen That I broke his heart.
dr_juliet_burke He didn't have to.
kate_austen You don't know anything about him.
dr_juliet_burke I know where he was born. I know what his parents did for a living. I know that he was married. And who he was married to. I know why he got a divorce. I know how his father died. I know his height, his weight, his birthday, and his blood type. What do you know about him, Kate?
kate_austen Let's go.
kate_austen Run, run, run.
kate_austen Get up, run, run, come on.
kate_austen Stop.
dr_juliet_burke Wait, what are you doing?
kate_austen I know what happens when you step through those things...
dr_juliet_burke They're off. Kate! We can—
kate_austen We'll go alongside—
dr_juliet_burke We don't need to, we can go—
kate_austen ...Go around...
dr_juliet_burke ...They're off...... dammit.
dr_juliet_burke You're gonna wanna be over here.
dr_juliet_burke Kate, come on!
dr_juliet_burke Alright. We don't know what it is, but we know it doesn't like our fences...
kate_austen You had a key.
dr_juliet_burke They left me behind too, they gassed me! I know that you don't care, but the people I spent the last three years of my life with, they just left me! I thought that maybe, maybe if I could make you think that we were in it together. Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.
james_ford Ahaha.
charlie_pace Mmm. Ah, its delicious.
james_ford Just a little DHARMA-A1 and paprika. I hope you'll remember this little barbecue at your meeting later.
charlie_pace Oh what meeting?
james_ford Hurley told me about the vote.
charlie_pace Vote? Since when did anyone around here vote?
james_ford You son of a bitch. There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.
federal_agent But, wasn't it nice, being nice.
james_ford You tricked me into being decent. That's gotta be the lamest con in the history of cons.
federal_agent Wasn't a con, dude. If you're gonna be our temporary leader, you need to do some damage control.
james_ford Leader? The hell are you smokin'?
federal_agent Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid. You're all we got. And Paulo and Nikki dying, we all looked to you. Then again, you totally tried to steal the diamonds, but we wanted to look to you. Look around, you made everyone happy. Just for today, they can eat boar, laugh and forget that they're totally screwed. And you did that for 'em, dude. You.
james_ford Well, what if I don't wanna be the leader?
federal_agent Yeah well, I don't think Jack wanted it either. Sucks for you, dude.
dr_juliet_burke Sayid's in one of those backyards down there. I'll go get him. You should get Jack.
kate_austen Jack, Jack, hey, wake up, its me.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
kate_austen They all left.
dr_jack_shephard What? What?
kate_austen Because of me. I'm so sorry. I should have listened to you. I never— I wanted to come back to help you. But you didn't need me to. And now because of me you can't go.
kate_austen I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
dr_jack_shephard They just, left? Even, even Juliet?
kate_austen No, they left her too.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
kate_austen You know her better than I do. Now what?
dr_jack_shephard Now, now we go back.
kate_austen Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
cassidy_phillips You got it.
kate_austen So, this guy who ripped ya off. You gonna give me his name? Tell me where I can find him? You almost got arrested for me Cassidy, I wanna help you.
cassidy_phillips I'm pregnant.
kate_austen Oh.
cassidy_phillips It's his, the baby's his. And I still love him.
kate_austen So call the cops, have him locked up.
cassidy_phillips Will you ever forgive your Mom for calling the cops?
kate_austen No, no I won't.
cassidy_phillips Thanks, Lucy.
kate_austen My name's Kate.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
dr_jack_shephard You OK?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah. You?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
sayid_jarrah Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid.
sayid_jarrah I've checked all the house, everyone's gone, no weapons, no trail...
kate_austen Hey.
sayid_jarrah ...it's like 50 people disappeared into thin air.
dr_jack_shephard We should take what we can find and head out while we still got light.
sayid_jarrah She is not coming with us.
dr_jack_shephard Yes, she is.
sayid_jarrah Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because they left her behind too.
