hugo_reyes Hold on a second, you want what now?
hugo_reyes You want to make snowballs?
michael_dawson He wants you to hold the bamboo tighter... I think.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
michael_dawson Hey.
dr_jack_shephard How's it coming?
michael_dawson It's coming.
dr_jack_shephard As long as nobody sabotages this one, as well, huh?
michael_dawson I've got people standing guard 24-7. Nobody gets near this with or without intent to burn. Hey, listen, I was thinking, chances of a passing ship spotting this raft out there are pretty slim. We could use something to send out a distress call to any ships that might be close, like an SOS.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, well, look I'll ask Sayid, but even if he can make something like that he's not going to have anything to power it with.
hugo_reyes Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick has batteries?
sayid_jarrah Absolutely not.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not asking you to go. I'll do it.
sayid_jarrah No, you won't.
hugo_reyes Dude, we just trying to-
sayid_jarrah Do you really think she would give up something she needs for survival to a total stranger?
dr_jack_shephard All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her. That's it.
sayid_jarrah I was brought unconscious to her camp. When I escaped I was disoriented. I don't know how to find her.
hugo_reyes Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, look, you've got her maps and her papers. Now you thought that they were pointing to something.
sayid_jarrah Well, I was wrong.
dr_jack_shephard Well, maybe they're pointing to her?
sayid_jarrah Look! I don't even know what these papers mean. For all I know they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind - song lyrics mixed with equations. If this map is pointing to her, then you should know she resides here, in this area. She gave it a name Territoire Fonce, Shannon translated it. It means dark territory. Does that sound like a place you'd like to visit?
dr_jack_shephard So, you won't help?
sayid_jarrah I didn't say that. I'll build a distress beacon, but I suggest you find another power source. There must be something in the cockpit.
dr_jack_shephard We're not going in the cockpit.
carmen_reyes What are you doing in there?
hugo_reyes Uno momento, Mama, just checking something out.
carmen_reyes I hope you're not watching those g-string mujeres again.
hugo_reyes Look, mom, we've talked about this. You want me living here -- you've got to respect my privacy. And no, I'm not.
carmen_reyes Look at you. It's Saturday night. A grown up man sitting at home watching TV. You should go out, try to find yourself a nice woman.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I'll get right on that.
carmen_reyes At least try eating better. You're gaining weight again.
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 JO -- with mega number 42. And that makes tonight's mega-lotto-jackpot 4 8 15 16 23 With the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share, in a near record jackpot.
lotto_girl OFFICIAL That's right Mary-Jo because this is the 16th week without a winner.
hugo_reyes Hi. You awake?
sayid_jarrah I was just wondering that myself.
hugo_reyes So, that French lady, she wrote this stuff, right?
sayid_jarrah Hurley, it's the middle of the night. What do you want?
hugo_reyes Nothing. Couldn't sleep, then I got curious. You and Shannon, you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff and I was wondering what, you know, you guys figured out about this stuff.
sayid_jarrah What stuff?
hugo_reyes I don't know. Look, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times - got any idea what it means?
sayid_jarrah I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.
hugo_reyes Coordinates, yeah. When you first found her, the French chick, you said you saw a wire or something on the beach? And you followed it, and it led you to her?
sayid_jarrah No, it led me to a trap she set.
hugo_reyes Her place is probably close, right?
sayid_jarrah Why are you suddenly so interested in Rousseau?
hugo_reyes I'm not -- just, you know, making conversation, dude. Sorry if it's a bad time. Goodnight.
hugo_reyes Yeah, you.
reporter #1 How'd you come up with the winning numbers, any significance?
hugo_reyes Oh, they just, uh, sort of came to me.
reporter #2 Why don't you introduce your family.
hugo_reyes Oh yeah, okay, um, this -- this patch of beauty is my mom, Carmen. Come here, mom. And this is my brother, Diego and his wife, Lisa.
diego Woo! We're rich!
hugo_reyes Nice, dude. Ignore him, he's an idiot. And, uh, oh, you've got to know this guy. This is the greatest guy I know, my, my, my grandpa Tito. He's worked 3 jobs for -- how long has it been now?
grandpa_tito 52 years.
hugo_reyes 52 years. 70 years old, and the closest thing he's had to a vacation is when they put a pacemaker in him 4 years ago. So the first thing I'm going to do with the money is, uh, finally give him the rest that he's earned. That's really what it's all about for me, to be able to do things for the people I care about, because I really put my family through a lot recently, and, um, well, this way I can make it up to them. You know, maybe even buy my mom a new house. And uh, maybe after my grandpa comes back from his cruise we can, you know -- do some things that we always wanted to do. Grandpa?
charlie_pace Hey, man.
hugo_reyes What, I'm not doing anything.
charlie_pace What?
hugo_reyes What?
charlie_pace I'm just saying good morning.
hugo_reyes Oh, right. Morning. Sorry, I was just, uh...
charlie_pace You going somewhere?
hugo_reyes Me? No. Well, yeah. Just thought I might take a walk. Uh, maybe scope out some new fishing area.
charlie_pace Oh, hang on, I'll come with.
hugo_reyes That's okay.
charlie_pace No, I could use a little bit of the fresh wide open.
hugo_reyes Dude, I could really use some alone time right now.
charlie_pace Sure.
hugo_reyes I'm a big guy, I get dehydrated easy.
charlie_pace Yeah. Yeah, okay.
john_locke Claire, you got a second?
claire_littleton Uh, yeah, sure.
john_locke I was wondering if you were free to help me with a little project.
claire_littleton Me?
john_locke Yeah. I'm building something and I could use an extra pair of hands.
claire_littleton I'm nearly nine months pregnant, I can barely waddle on the beach.
john_locke Could you hold a saw?
claire_littleton Um, yeah.
john_locke Can you move your hand back and forth, like this?
claire_littleton Possibly.
john_locke You're perfect. Come on.
claire_littleton Okay. So, what exactly are we building?
sayid_jarrah Where is it?
dr_jack_shephard Where's what?
sayid_jarrah The map. I told you, it won't help you find her.
dr_jack_shephard Whoa, slow down. I don't have the map.
sayid_jarrah What makes this worse is that you don't even do your own dirty work. You get Hurley to do it for you.
dr_jack_shephard Wait a minute -- Hurley?
sayid_jarrah He was in my tent last night, quizzing me about Rousseau, about numbers she wrote -- how I came to find her. You don't know anything about this, do you?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie, you seen Hurley?
charlie_pace A couple of hours ago, he was setting out for a walk. Acting like a loon, I might say.
sayid_jarrah My god, he's going after her.
shannon_rutherford When are you going to be back?
sayid_jarrah If we can catch up to him, before nightfall. Why? You worried about me?
shannon_rutherford So what if I am?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, you ready?
sayid_jarrah I'll be fine.
carmen_reyes You turn that noise down.
hugo_reyes Uh, sorry.
carmen_reyes Where are you taking me? You know very well I don't like surprises.
hugo_reyes You're going to like this one, ma. I mean, after everything you've been through? Like grandpa -- And then at the funeral, Father Aguillar getting struck by lightening? Man, that was a freak storm. And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that . . . waitress?
carmen_reyes Don't mention that whore to me.
hugo_reyes I'm just saying you deserve something good to happen. You know, ever since I won the lottery it's like we've had nothing but bad luck. Like, I don't know, like the money's cursed or something.
carmen_reyes That's blasphemy. You know very well we're Catholic. We don't believe in curses.
hugo_reyes Jeez, ma, I'm just talking. Okay, we're almost there. Here, put this on.
carmen_reyes Why do I have to wear this?
hugo_reyes Give me your hand. Careful.
carmen_reyes No, no, you be careful.
hugo_reyes You're stepping down.
carmen_reyes I can't see anything.
hugo_reyes Okay, now take off your blindfold. And get a look at your new dream house.
carmen_reyes Ow, my ankle!
hugo_reyes I said take off your blindfold.
carmen_reyes Why did you make me put that in the first place?! Hugo, do I smell smoke?
hugo_reyes Oh, crap. Hang on mom, I've got to call 911.
carmen_reyes You tell them I broke my ankle.
COP#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 Drop the phone, move away from the vehicle!
hugo_reyes Oh, no, no, no. It's the house.
COP#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 Do it, now! Turn around.
hugo_reyes No such thing as curses, huh, ma?
COP#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
hugo_reyes Yo! French chick!
ken_halperin HALPERIN I would think you'd be happy. Every one of your stocks is up. Your interest in orange futures skyrocketed after those tropical storms hit Florida. And, you are now the majority shareholder for a box company in Tustin.
hugo_reyes A box company?
ken_halperin Mmhmm. They make boxes, lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me, your sneaker factory in Canada . . .
hugo_reyes I have a sneaker factory in Canada?
ken_halperin Well, not any more. It was destroyed in a fire last month.
hugo_reyes Of course it was.
ken_halperin You might have read about it -- eight something people died. But, the good news is we over-insured it. It's going to yield you a windfall of cash. And, when we add in the generous settlement from the LAPD for your false arrest you've almost doubled your net worth in a few short months. I still can't imagine how the police mistook you for a drug dealer.
hugo_reyes Bad luck.
ken_halperin Hugo, you are not the first lottery winner to believe the money's brought them nothing but trouble. It's all in your head.
hugo_reyes What, you don't believe in jinxes? You know, curses?
ken_halperin I'm an accountant, I believe in numbers. Hey, where'd you get them, anyway?
hugo_reyes What?
ken_halperin The winning numbers. What'd you use, somebody's birthday, phone number?
hugo_reyes No, it's nothing, it's something that I . . .
ken_halperin What?
hugo_reyes That's it. It's not the money, it's the numbers. The numbers are cursed. Dude, don't look at me like that, I'm not crazy. This is real.
ken_halperin Come on, Hugo, listen to yourself. "The numbers are cursed." You know there is no such thing as a-
james_ford You want to hit that a little harder?
michael_dawson I'm sorry. Is my building a raft to get us rescued bothering you?
james_ford At the moment, yeah.
walt_lloyd Why aren't you helping?
james_ford I am helping, Short Round. I'm keeping watch for arsonists.
michael_dawson Walt's got a point. You could pitch in, seeing as how you already bought your ticket.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 밤새도록 묶어놨는데!
michael_dawson Hey, did you tie this like I told you?! If you tied this like I told you the thing would still be together! What's the matter with you man?! What is your problem?!
sunhwa_kwon He's never going to speak to me again.
kate_austen He just needs time.
sunhwa_kwon I humiliated him. When the raft sails, do you think he's going to leave with them?
kate_austen I don't know.
sayid_jarrah Don't move!
hugo_reyes Hey, what are you guys...
sayid_jarrah I said do not move. You're standing on a pressure trigger. If you take your weight off it, it will release that.
hugo_reyes Oh, man.
sayid_jarrah We need to find something to replace his weight with the trigger.
charlie_pace Replace his weight? How are we going to do that?
hugo_reyes Hey!
sayid_jarrah Don't move!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, everybody, just calm down.
hugo_reyes Can I drop the wire?
charlie_pace Maybe if I find a rock or something?
sayid_jarrah A big one.
hugo_reyes I'm dropping the wire.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, no!
hugo_reyes I can make it.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, don't move!
charlie_pace No!
hugo_reyes I can get out of the way, I'm spry.
charlie_pace Oi!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, stay put.
charlie_pace Oi! No, wait!
dr_jack_shephard No, Hurley, Hurley! Don't even...
charlie_pace Hurley, what the bloody hell's wrong with you?!
hugo_reyes Nothing.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing out here, man?
hugo_reyes I came to get a battery.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, seriously, what's going on?
hugo_reyes Nada. You guys coming?
sayid_jarrah You all want to go? Fine. But perhaps I should take the lead.
charlie_pace Excellent notion.
hugo_reyes Lenny. His name is Lenny, or Leonard.
nurse But you don't know his last name.
hugo_reyes Look, I just need to talk to him for five minutes.
nurse I'm sorry, but if you can't tell me the patient's name, sir, I can't very well look it up.
hugo_reyes How many Leonards are here? Can't you just type in Leonard? I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me.
nurse Our records are private, sir. If any . . .
hugo_reyes Dude! Do not do that right now! Leave the bulb for another time, man! five minutes! All I need is five minutes!
dr_curtis CURTIS Hugo?
hugo_reyes Oh, hey, Doc.
dr_curtis CURTIS It's good to see you. What are you doing back here?
hugo_reyes Uh...
dr_curtis CURTIS I don't remember you and Leonard being that close, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well, we hung.
dr_curtis CURTIS I'll leave you gentleman to it then. Good luck, Hugo.
leonard
hugo_reyes Hi, Lenny. Remember me? Hugo. Hurley. Well I was just, you know, in the neighborhood, and uh -- look, Lenny, I've got to know, what do the numbers mean?
leonard 4 8 15 16 23 42. 4 8 15 16 23 42 . . .
hugo_reyes C'mon, Lenny, give me something. Anything. Where'd you get the numbers? Is that why you're here, Lenny? Is it because of the numbers? Did they do something to you? Because I think they did something to me. I think they turned me into a jinx -- bad news to everyone around me. And when I tell people I think I'm the cause they, they, they look at me like I'm nuts. They don't believe me. But I know, ever since I won the lottery with those numbers.
leonard You used those numbers to play the lottery?
hugo_reyes Uh, -- yeah.
leonard Well, you shouldn't have done that. You've opened the box!
hugo_reyes I what?
leonard Ah, you shouldn't have used those numbers!
hugo_reyes Why not?
leonard It doesn't stop! You've got to get away from those numbers! You've got to get far, far away!
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 All right, hey, hold on. Lenny, Lenny. Calm down. Lenny.
leonard Do you hear me?!? No, don't you understand?!? You've got to get away from it or it won't stop!
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 Try and calm down.
hugo_reyes Wait a second, I need some answers.
ORDERLY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode18 Sir, you need to step away.
hugo_reyes Those numbers, where'd you get them?
leonard Sam Toomey! He heard them!
hugo_reyes Who's Sam Toomey?!?
leonard He heard them in Kalgoorlie! It's a town where he used to work!
hugo_reyes It's a town where?!
leonard In Australia! Oh, God!
sayid_jarrah It stops here. It goes into the ground. This poses somewhat of a problem.
charlie_pace Guys? You should come see this.
hugo_reyes Whoa.
dr_jack_shephard You never mentioned anything about a bridge.
sayid_jarrah I never saw this before.
dr_jack_shephard There's no way she could have built this all by herself.
sayid_jarrah No, but her team could have.
charlie_pace Or Ethan's team.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, what are you doing?
hugo_reyes Relax, I'm just going to check it out. You guys should stay here.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, get back here!
hugo_reyes Dudes, chill.
dr_jack_shephard Charlie.
charlie_pace Hey, if he can do it...
dr_jack_shephard Charlie!
hugo_reyes Dude, you okay?
charlie_pace I'm okay. Woo!
dr_jack_shephard Alright, you two stay put right there! We're going to find a way around and we'll meet you there!
hugo_reyes Nah, screw that! You guys stay! There's a path right here, Charlie and me-
charlie_pace Hurley, will you shut up and listen to Jack?!? He said stay put! You're acting like a bloody lunatic!
martha_toomey If this weren't the middle of nowhere, I'd say you were lost.
hugo_reyes Hi, is this Sam Toomey's house?
martha_toomey It is. I'm his wife.
hugo_reyes Is he around, because I'd kind of like to talk to him.
martha_toomey I'd like that, too. But Sam's been dead for four years.
hugo_reyes Your husband worked with a guy I know, Leonard Sims.
martha_toomey That's right, they served together in the U.S. Navy. How is Leonard? Still in the service?
hugo_reyes Uh, he's, um, retired. Anyway, he told me about Sam hearing something.
martha_toomey You're talking about the numbers.
hugo_reyes Yes, the numbers, exactly. Do you know anything about them?
martha_toomey Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific. Boring job. Sam hated it, nothing to do but listen to static night after night. Until one night, about 16 years ago, there's something in the static, a voice comes through, a voice repeating those numbers over and over again. A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar, must have been big as a pony, and it's filled to the rim with beans. Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar, within 10.
hugo_reyes Sam used the numbers?
martha_toomey Yep, the answer was exact. To the bean. Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close. So we won the money. On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway, hits us head on. Lost my leg that night.
hugo_reyes What about Sam?
martha_toomey Barely a scratch. Most people would consider themselves lucky, but not him. He was never the same after that. He started keeping a record. Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us, he believed it was all because he used those numbers. He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop.
hugo_reyes Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop?
martha_toomey Yep. He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. What is it you're looking for Mr. Reyes?
hugo_reyes I used them, the numbers, to win the lottery. And now I think I'm under the same curse.
martha_toomey Curse? There's no curse.
hugo_reyes But you just told me...
martha_toomey You think I'd still have my leg if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans?! You think that floods wouldn't have happened?! That homes wouldn't have burned down?! That people wouldn't have died?!
hugo_reyes Well, yeah.
martha_toomey You make your own luck, Mr. Reyes. Don't blame it on the damn numbers. You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist.
claire_littleton It's a trap, right? For catching animals?
john_locke Pass me that cup please.
claire_littleton Ugh, what's this gunk?
john_locke Glue.
claire_littleton Where'd you find glue?
john_locke I made it out of rendered animal fat.
claire_littleton You made glue? Wow. Then you should have one of those shows where you fix up houses for people.
john_locke I don't think so.
claire_littleton Thanks, for this -- giving me something to do. I'm tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there.
john_locke How's that coming? Your memory?
claire_littleton Bits and pieces here and there. Nothing that makes any real sense.
john_locke Well, maybe I can help. I'm good at putting bits and pieces together.
dr_jack_shephard What?
sayid_jarrah This is familiar, this area. We're close.
dr_jack_shephard How do you know? I thought she lived underground?
sayid_jarrah Jack!
charlie_pace What the hell was that?
dr_jack_shephard Hell of a security system. Somebody trips a wire and the whole place blows up?
sayid_jarrah There's nothing here.
dr_jack_shephard Batteries?
sayid_jarrah Nothing.
dr_jack_shephard I don't get it.
sayid_jarrah She knew. She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others. So she abandoned this place, booby-trapped it, and moved on.
dr_jack_shephard Moved on where?
hugo_reyes Jack! Sayid!
charlie_pace Do you even know where we're going?
hugo_reyes The blast sounded like it came from this way. I think.
charlie_pace You don't know.
hugo_reyes Dude, what do you want from me?
charlie_pace What do I want? I want to know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere? And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries. One minute you're happy-go-lucky, good time Hurley and the next you're Colonel-bloody-Kurtz. It just doesn't make any sense. It's not you.
hugo_reyes Dude, you don't know me.
charlie_pace Well, all this time on the Island, you've told me nothing about yourself.
hugo_reyes We've all got personal stuff, dude.
charlie_pace Don't change the subject. We're lost out here. Jack and Sayid could be hurt, if not blown to bits, all because you're acting like some bloody nutter.
hugo_reyes I am not crazy. I've got my reasons for every-
charlie_pace I think I have a right to know.
hugo_reyes Okay, alright, you want to know?
charlie_pace Yep.
hugo_reyes About a year ago...
hugo_reyes Is someone shooting at us?
hugo_reyes You must be the French chick.
danielle_rousseau Who are you?
hugo_reyes Hurley. I, uh -- Sayid? That guy you tortured, he...
danielle_rousseau You were on the plane.
hugo_reyes Look, I came here to find -- oh, easy, easy, easy. I'm just getting your notes. Please, tell me why you wrote this. What do these numbers mean? Please.
danielle_rousseau I don't know.
hugo_reyes What? You don't know? Okay, that thing in the woods, maybe it's a monster, maybe it's a pissed off giraffe, I don't know! The fact that no one is even looking for us, yeah, that's weird, but I just go along with it because I'm along for the ride, good old fun time Hurley! Well guess what? Now, I want some friggin' answers!
danielle_rousseau Our ship picked up a transmission -- a voice repeating those numbers. We changed course to investigate. After we shipwrecked my team continued to search for the transmission source. It was weeks before we found the radio tower.
hugo_reyes There's a radio tower on this Island?
danielle_rousseau Yes, up by the Black Rock. Some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers while we waited for rescue. But then the sickness came. When my team was gone, I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission.
hugo_reyes The distress signal we heard?
danielle_rousseau Yes.
hugo_reyes But the numbers -- did you ever find out anything about them? Do you know where they got their power?
danielle_rousseau Power?
hugo_reyes They bring bad stuff to everyone around you. They're cursed. You know that, right? The numbers, they're cursed.
danielle_rousseau The numbers are what brought me here. As it appears they brought you. Since that time I've lost everything, everyone I cared about. So yes, I suppose you're right. They are cursed.
hugo_reyes Thank you. Thank you. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to agree with me. Thank you. Oh god, thank you.
dr_jack_shephard We need to find Hurley and Charlie and get out of this jungle. I just hate that we're going home empty handed.
charlie_pace Hey, hey, someone shot at us, Hurley and me. We were looking for you when...
sayid_jarrah Rousseau.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Hurley?
charlie_pace I don't know. He was right behind me and then he just, he just wasn't.
sayid_jarrah I'll go and find him.
dr_jack_shephard No, no. We'll all go.
hugo_reyes Go where?
charlie_pace Hurley, what the hell happened to you?
hugo_reyes Need a battery? She says, hey.
john_locke You think of a name yet?
claire_littleton Huh?
john_locke For the baby.
claire_littleton Haven't really thought about it. I was going to give it away, you know, for adoption.
john_locke That must have been a difficult decision.
claire_littleton Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now. It's my birthday today.
john_locke Why haven't you told anyone?
claire_littleton I'm pregnant, single, and on an Island in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't really matter that it's my birthday, does it?
john_locke I guess not. At least your birthdays will be close together, you and your baby, and that's good luck.
claire_littleton Yeah, you think?
john_locke Yeah, I do.
claire_littleton You believe in that? Luck?
john_locke I believe in a lot of things. That should do it.
claire_littleton Okay, I give up. What is it?
claire_littleton It's a cradle.
john_locke Happy birthday, Claire.
claire_littleton Thank you.
charlie_pace I know food's scarce, but your shirt?
hugo_reyes When you find a laundromat, let me know.
charlie_pace Back in the jungle before we became target practice you were going to tell me what inspired this little quest.
hugo_reyes I think the plane crash might have been my fault.
charlie_pace Don't be daft, how could you possibly...
hugo_reyes Hey, before we came here a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around.
charlie_pace What do you mean, like bad luck?
hugo_reyes Yeah, that's -- that would be kind of a mellow way of describing it.
charlie_pace Hurley, bad things happen, planes crash, people die.
hugo_reyes Dude, you gotta let me finish.
charlie_pace You think you're the only person with baggage? You know what I was doing when the plane went down? I was snorting heroin in the toilet. I was such a junkie I couldn't even take a plane ride with out having a fix. I suppose that was your fault, as well? -- So how about it?
hugo_reyes What?
charlie_pace I just told you the biggest secret of my life. I thought you'd want to reciprocate.
hugo_reyes Okay. Back home I'm worth 156 million dollars.
charlie_pace Fine. Don't tell me.
hugo_reyes Dude.
charlie_pace I bare my soul, and all I get is bloody jokes!
