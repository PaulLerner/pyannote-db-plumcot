VOICE Over here. Jack!
LOCKE Where's Jack? We need the doctor.
VOICE He's right there. Right there.
CHARLIE What happened?
VOICE Jack!
LOCKE Doctor!
CHARLIE Claire?
MICHAEL Is she alive?
WALT What happened?
CHARLIE Is she alright?
JACK Where did you find her?
LOCKE About a mile north. We were looking for the dog.
JACK Was she conscious?
LOCKE She collapsed in my arms.
CHARLIE Did she say anything?
HURLEY Charlie, man! Is she injured?
WALT Is she alright?
JACK Everybody needs to back off, okay? Just give her some air. . Claire, can you hear me? Wake up now. Hey, Claire, Claire. Wake up now. . Hey.
JACK Claire? It's okay. It's okay.
CHARLIE Claire. You're safe.
CLAIRE Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you people?!
CLAIRE I don't understand. I don't know any Ethan. I don't remember. I don't remember any of you. I don't remember any of this.
CHARLIE What do you remember?
CLAIRE Um, I was on a plane flying to LA from Sydney.
JACK Claire, we were all on that plane. It crashed here -- on this Island. That was almost a month ago.
CLAIRE No, I'm, I'm due.
JACK Your baby's fine. He's kicking, everything's normal. Okay?
CLAIRE Well, if it's been almost a month then why hasn't somebody come to get us?
JIN 도대체 무슨 일이 일어나는 거지? 
SUN 저도 모르겠어요. 
JIN 저 여자… 괜찮을까? 
SUN 제 생각엔 괜찮은 것 같아요. 
JIN 애기는? 
SUN 애기도 무사하겠죠. 
BOONE You think she escaped?
LOCKE You were right beside me, Boone, you know as much as I do.
BOONE Well, where did she come from? I mean, we were out pretty deep. Nothing's out there. She didn't say anything at all about Ethan?
LOCKE Apparently she doesn't even remember Ethan.
BOONE The guy pretends to be one of us -- he drags her through the jungle for almost two weeks -- she doesn't remember him?
LOCKE Apparently.
BOONE You think he's around?
LOCKE I sure hope not.
CHARLIE Claire, here's your journal. It might help. And this is where you sleep. It's quite cozy, isn't it? When he -- Ethan -- when he took you away, he took me, too. The others came after us. They got me back, but you, you were gone.
CLAIRE Who is he, Ethan?
CHARLIE Ethan? Ethan's the bad guy.
CLAIRE So, we were together when...
CHARLIE Yeah.
CLAIRE Why did he leave you?
CHARLIE Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning. You've had enough for one day.
CLAIRE Ah, I won't be sleeping.
CHARLIE Oh, lucky for me. I'm not much of a sleeper myself. Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.
CLAIRE We're friends?
CHARLIE Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.
TOMMY How's that feel, mate?
CHARLIE Sodding fantastic.
TOMMY Good, 'cause, uh, we're almost out.
CHARLIE But we're not out yet. Carpe Diem, my friend.
TOMMY Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.
CHARLIE Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.
TOMMY Well, is it Latin for I've got a pile of money so we can score vast quantities of illicit substances?
CHARLIE No.
TOMMY I suppose you ought to clean up then. It's time to put you to work.
TOMMY Miss Lucy Heatherton, 22, and right in oh so many wonderful ways. Just graduated from Oxford, lives in Knightsbridge with her dear old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton who, my friend, is bloody loaded.
CHARLIE How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me, Tommy.
TOMMY Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace of the legendary rock band Drive Shaft?
CHARLIE Absolutely.
CHARLIE Seriously, ladies. I demand you stop buying me more drinks. I'm a man of high moral standing. Your obvious plans to take me home and ravish me will not work, saucy sirens. I believe in monogamy. I will not be shared like a common curry.
LUCY Are we that obvious?
CHARLIE Dreadfully. Call yourself ladies? Jane Austen would be ashamed. I personally...
SAYID The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant. Are we supposed to believe that she escaped from him?
CHARLIE What are you getting at?
SAYID Ethan infiltrated us. Whoever he is and wherever he comes from, he's intelligent. Who's to say he didn't even send Claire?
CHARLIE You're off your head, mate! That-
JACK Charlie, calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid.
SAYID Then tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia and such a selective brand of it?
JACK Okay, it's rare. But she's been through a major trauma. It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.
LOCKE And the chances of that memory returning?
JACK I don't know.
CHARLIE You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want. I'm actually going to go spend some time with her. I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.
CHARLIE Oi, Jin. You heading back to the caves? 안녕?
JIN 안녕.
CHARLIE Safety in numbers, right? Of course, you have no idea what I'm talking about. How nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn. It's quite beautiful, really. You take care of your wife. Everything else is someone else's problem. No need to be involved in the decision-making process. No tree-shaking behemoths, French transmissions, just sweet, bloody ignorance. You don't know how lucky you are, you know. Must be nice. You wake up and...
CHARLIE What?
ETHAN Charlie, I want her back.
CHARLIE What? I...
ETHAN I want you to bring her back.
CHARLIE What did you do to her? What did you do?!
ETHAN You bring her here. If you don't, I'm going to kill one of them. And then, if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow, I'll kill another, and another, and another. One every day. And Charlie, I'll kill you last.
CHARLIE What do we do? We go out and we bloody kill him!
LOCKE Calm down, Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset and...
CHARLIE Forget the others. He's out there right now, Locke.
JACK I think he's right. The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire, and what, we just wait for that to happen? We tracked him once before, we can track him again.
LOCKE You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out. He bested you physically. He hung you from a tree. Running into the jungle unarmed is not going to get the job done.
CHARLIE So what does get it done?
LOCKE We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat. We post some sentries here and back at the caves.
JACK Tell a select few? He does what he says he going to do and that blood's on our hands.
LOCKE Okay, Jack, we tell everyone. But, you want to protect them, you need to start thinking defense.
JACK We move everybody off the beach, back up into the caves.
LOCKE What if Ethan isn't alone? What if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep to the slaughter in a confined space where they can roll in and take us all in one fell swoop.
JACK Okay, John. Obviously, you have a plan. So, let's hear it.
SUN 도대체 무슨 일이 있었냐구요? 
JIN 무슨 일이 있었냐구? 내가 어떻게 알아? 
SUN 아니 다른 사람들은 어떻게 이해를-- 
JIN 다른 사람들? 내가 다른 사람들 때문에 이렇게 된건데. 
CLAIRE The others are avoiding me.
CHARLIE Sorry?
CLAIRE No one will talk to me. You know, it just feels like something is going on.
CHARLIE Anything coming back?
CLAIRE After the crash, no. Some of this stuff's probably better forgotten anyway. 
CHARLIE Well, I don't know about you, but the rest of us have been having a wonderful time. We even built a golf course.
CLAIRE You're sure there's nothing going on?
CHARLIE Absolutely.
CLAIRE Okay.
LUCY You're quite enamored with yourself, aren't you?
CHARLIE Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date and you want to appear demure, but, you know, if you want to invite me back for sex don't say tea, say sex.
LUCY Do you want tea, or not?
CHARLIE I'd love some.
LUCY Brilliant.
CHARLIE So where is the old man?
LUCY I don't know. I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.
CHARLIE Oh, yeah? Do you two get on?
LUCY Dad's quite cool, actually. He was rather proud when I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.
LUCY It was Winston Churchill's. Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire. Hey, you should meet him.
CHARLIE Winston? No thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.
LUCY My father. He's coming back tomorrow. You should come round for dinner.
CHARLIE I'd love to.
LUCY Excellent.
KATE You look hungry. 
JACK Thanks.
KATE Locke told us what happened. Why do you think he wants her back?
JACK I don't know.
KATE Maybe it's time you use that key you've been wearing around your neck. There are 4 nine millimeters in the Marshal's case and-
JACK Uh-uh. No. I hand them out, someone hears something out in the jungle and gets scared, the chances of us shooting each other are much higher than of us shooting him.
KATE We're beyond sharpening knives here, Jack.
JACK I am not putting guns in untrained hands.
LOCKE Trip it!
SAYID Not bad.
LOCKE 4 of these around the perimeter will do the job.
SAYID I have fires prepared at 20 meter intervals.
LOCKE Excellent.
SAYID Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty. I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.
BOONE I'll take a shift.
SAYID Okay.
LOCKE Absolutely, we're counting on you, Boone.
CHARLIE Maybe we should move her.
JACK She's safer here.
CHARLIE What about the mountain? There could be another cave?
JACK She's safer here, Charlie.
CHARLIE Nobody's safe!
JACK Hey.
CHARLIE It's my fault he took her. I was responsible. I should have taken care of her. I should...
JACK Charlie, nothing's going to happen to her, okay?
CHARLIE Yeah, okay.
FRANK Well, Charlie, I think my lovely daughter would agree that you're the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.
CHARLIE My condolences, sir.
FRANK I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you, but I was in a band once myself, you know.
CHARLIE Oh.
LUCY They were called the Protestant Reformation.
FRANK Yes. Ouch. Dreadful, huh?
CHARLIE You gave it up then?
FRANK Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way. Her mom, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying, but I was wanting to be more practical, responsible, I guess. You know, a man has to provide, take care of his family. A man has to think about the future.
LUCY And, of course, your band was bloody awful.
FRANK Yes, there was that, too. Small detail. So, are you working on a new album, Charlie?
CHARLIE We're in a bit of a hiatus right now. Liam, my brother, just had a daughter. So, you know, we're taking some time off. Quite a lot of time off, actually. It's been a year since we were together. I'm thinking of doing a solo project. Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch and there's been some problems with royalties. The fact of the matter is, sir, uh, I think that Drive Shaft might be dead.
TOMMY You took a sodding what?!
CHARLIE A job, Tom.
TOMMY A job doing what?
CHARLIE Selling copiers.
TOMMY You took a job selling copiers?
CHARLIE I like her.
TOMMY She's a moose.
CHARLIE Don't say that.
TOMMY Are you off your bleeding chump, man? I've been getting you off on my skag for over a week now on spec. Spec means speculation.
CHARLIE Yes, I know what speculation means.
TOMMY In this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan and steal something of value which I can, in turn, sell. And by the time the poor helpless bird realizes it's missing it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace could be responsible for such larceny, and the bloody party continues.
CHARLIE Look, I -- I don't think Liam's coming back. I have to think about my future.
TOMMY Your future?
CHARLIE Yeah.
TOMMY Really?
CHARLIE Yes.
TOMMY When do you start this job?
CHARLIE Monday.
TOMMY Today's Friday, isn't it? After a weekend without a fix, Monday should be bloody wonderful. Let's see how the future treats you then, hey, Charlie.
LOCKE Over here -- through the tree line -- something tripped the alarm.
SAYID I think we found another missing castaway.
BOONE What happened?
SAYID Is he alive?
BOONE Oh, god.
SAYID How did he get past us?
HURLEY I thought those guys had a full on perimeter set up?
KATE Locke said it didn't matter -- he came in from the water.
HURLEY You sure it wasn't an accident? I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something.
KATE His neck was broken, both his arms, all the bones in his fingers.
HURLEY Yeah, okay. Got it.
SAWYER So, Steve drew the short straw.
HURLEY Dude, that was Scott.
HURLEY Scott Jackson worked for an internet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize two week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. Sorry, I kept calling you Steve, man. Um, amen, I guess. I...
SEVERAL PEOPLE Amen.
HURLEY I don't know how to end these.
CLAIRE Hi. Why is everyone staring at me?
SHANNON I'm not staring at you.
CLAIRE What's your name?
SHANNON Shannon.
CLAIRE Shannon, you're staring.
SHANNON You mean nobody's told you?
CLAIRE Told me what?
CLAIRE Why? Why did you lie to me?!
CHARLIE Okay, look...
CLAIRE Yeah, what else didn't you tell me?
CHARLIE I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything you could do.
CLAIRE Nothing I could do? Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie? I'm already in the dark.
CHARLIE Sorry. I just wanted to take care of you.
CLAIRE I can take care of myself.
LUCY Look at you. Charlie Pace, respectable businessman.
CHARLIE You didn't have to buy me this suit, Lucy.
LUCY Mmhm. And what did you intend on wearing for your first day of work?
CHARLIE I have shirts... with buttons.
LUCY You okay?
CHARLIE Yeah, just a bit nervous.
LUCY Don't be. Dad's put the fix in. He's already demanded they buy two copiers to boost your confidence.
LUCY Have you memorized the manual?
CHARLIE Backwards and forwards.
LUCY Say something impressive.
CHARLIE Uh, the Heatherton C815 copy center's leading scan offerings combine the benefits of document capture with instant delivery anywhere, anytime.
LUCY Anywhere?
CHARLIE Anytime, baby.
LUCY You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine. You're going to do great. I believe in you. Oh, almost forgot, wait here.
CHARLIE Okay. 
LUCY Alright, now, I know you'll protest, but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these. 
CHARLIE Oh, Lucy.
LUCY You're welcome.
CHARLIE Okay, well. I'm going to be late -- the bus.
LUCY The bus? Are you daft? I'm driving you.
CHARLIE Oh, no, Lucy. I'd rather you didn't.
LUCY No argument. Have everything you need?
CHARLIE Yeah.
LUCY Then let's get you to work.
JACK John, want to take a walk?
JACK What do you think happens after the sun sets tonight?
LOCKE Oh, if we don't bring Claire to him? Rhetorical, Jack. Same thing happens tonight as happened last night.
JACK You think you can track him?
LOCKE Well, I'm sorry?
JACK We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie. Do you think you can pick up the trail?
LOCKE Maybe, but I wouldn't.
JACK Wouldn't?
LOCKE Jack, I'm not a cold man. I feel for the loss of one of our own, but nothing fundamental is changed. Wherever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf. He has the advantage. To him we're nothing more than a bunch of scared idiots with sharp sticks.
JACK What if I told you I had a way to get the advantage back?
LOCKE Then I would ask what way might that be, Jack?
LOCKE Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.
JACK I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these?
CHARLIE Are you insane?
JACK It's the best chance we have, Charlie.
CHARLIE No bloody way!
SAYID If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him. And the only way do that is by giving him what he wants.
CHARLIE You have no idea what you're talking about. This guy, he will kill all of you. You can't protect her...
CLAIRE Charlie, I can talk for myself.
CHARLIE Claire, they want to use you as bait.
CLAIRE I don't remember Ethan. I don't remember what he did to me. But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else, I have to do that.
CHARLIE I'm coming with you. You said there were 4 guns.
LOCKE You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?
JACK Alright, we should do this. Let's figure out a game plan. Alright, Sayid, you're the soldier. Locke, you're the hunter. . .
CHARLIE Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C815 using one your technical manuals.
LOCKE Charlie's right.
JACK About what?
LOCKE We have 4 guns, we should have 4 men.
SAWYER Help? Moi?
JACK You know how to handle a gun, or not?
SAWYER Well, I know at least one polar bear that seems to think so. Where'd you get the hardware, Hoss?
KATE I want to come.
JACK Sorry, we're out of guns. And no one goes out there unarmed.
SAWYER How much ammo you got?
JACK 100 rounds give or take.
SAWYER All 9's, right? 9 millimeters -- the guns?
JACK Yeah, why?
SAWYER Because, if the lady wants to come... Lifted this off the Marshal back in the old days. Remember him, don't you? Surly guy, kind of square of jaw, carries a Sig 9.
JACK Yeah, I remember you shot him. And missed.
SAWYER Yeah, well, bygones. And hell, 5 guns are better than 4.
SAYID He'll be surrounded at 5 points. Everyone will be in visual contact with you. Make sure you stay in the area I've shown you. And remember, guns are a measure of the last resort. We want him alive.
LOCKE Over here! Over here! Jack's got him! Hold your fire. Don't shoot. We want him alive. Claire! You alright?
SAWYER Over here!
SAYID Hey, hold your fire!
SAWYER Easy.
SAWYER Winner by a knockout. Nice one, Doc. Now, maybe somebody can tell me just who or what this son-of-bitch is! Uh, uh, uh, jungle boy. Not even for one second.
JACK Charlie?!
JACK Why did you do it, Charlie?
CHARLIE Because he deserved to die.
JACK He could have told us where he came from, what he wanted with Claire, why he...
CHARLIE Do you really think he would have told us anything, Jack? I wasn't going to let that animal anywhere near her again. Ever.
CHARLIE Lucy, I'm sorry. I've been having some problems. If I could just explain...
LUCY Leave, Charlie.
CHARLIE Lucy, I made a mistake.
LUCY You made a mistake? My father's sales manager comes here to my house to return a cigarette case that the EMTs pulled from your suit pocket at the bloody hospital, and it still smells of your sick.
CHARLIE I didn't mean to.
LUCY Oh, you meant to, Charlie. You meant to from the start. You're a liar! I believed you and you lied! I thought you wanted to -- you said -- you selfish bastard!
CHARLIE Lucy, if I can just explain.
LUCY Tell me one thing, and don't you dare lie to me. I get why you pretended to like me. I understand why you stole, because you're a junkie. But I don't understand why you took the job. Why did you take the job, Charlie?
CHARLIE I guess I -- I wanted to be respectable. I wanted you to think that I could take care of you.
LUCY You'll never take care of anyone.
CLAIRE I remember peanut butter. Why do I remember peanut butter?
CHARLIE It was imaginary peanut butter, actually.
CLAIRE I don't know what happened to me. I'm scared. I want to trust you. Goodnight, Charlie.
CHARLIE Goodnight, Claire.
