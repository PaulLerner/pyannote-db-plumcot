lennon Light it!
hugo_reyes Guess we're not getting outta here huh?
lennon This isn't to keep you in, it's to keep him out.
hugo_reyes Him? Who?
ben_linus What are you?
john_locke Wh.. I'm not a what Ben, I'm a who.
ben_linus You're the monster.
john_locke Let's not resort to name calling.
ben_linus You used me... you couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.
john_locke I didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.
ben_linus I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.
john_locke I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you, choked the life outta him Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the Island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave. The only one, who realized how pitiful the life he'd left behind actually was.
ben_linus What do you want?
john_locke Well that's the great irony here Ben because, I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home.
hugo_reyes Goodbye dude, If you ever wanna talk, I'm around.
hugo_reyes What?
miles_straume Nothing.
kate_austen Hey.
james_ford Where are we?
kate_austen We're in a temple.
james_ford We got caught by the others again?
kate_austen Yeah, only, this time they're protecting us, I think.
james_ford Course they are.
kate_austen You alright?
james_ford Ah...
kate_austen I'm so sorry.
kate_austen You know what you said back at the hatch, he's just tryin'a help us.
james_ford I ain't gonna kill Jack, he deserves to suffer on this rock just like the rest of us.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah... I know...I ... do you think I knew this was gonna happen? I scheduled it so soon because I wanna get it over with. I don't know mom, he's not here so I can't tell you what to tell them other than we can't have the service without him. Yeah - I will call you if I hear anything.
john_locke What did you lose?
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
john_locke Well, they lost one of my bags, what about you?
dr_jack_shephard You wouldn't believe me if I told ya.
john_locke Hah, try me.
dr_jack_shephard They lost my father.
john_locke I'm sorry?
dr_jack_shephard He died in Australia a couple days ago, and um, I flew down to get him.
john_locke My condolences.
john_locke Yo.
dr_jack_shephard Coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he's somewhere in transit which is their way of saying, they have no idea where the hell he is.
john_locke Well, how could they know.
dr_jack_shephard They're the one's that checked him in, I mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.
john_locke No I'm not talking about the coffin, I mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.
john_locke Either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard Some kinda salesman?
john_locke Yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.
dr_jack_shephard Hope you find your knives.
john_locke Yeah, thanks.
dr_jack_shephard Mind if I ask what happened to ya? I'm sorry, I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon, I didn't mean to...
john_locke Oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.
dr_jack_shephard Nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call. - It's on the house.
john_locke Well thanks - Jack Shephard, I'm John - John Locke.
dr_jack_shephard It's nice to meet ya John.
john_locke Nice to meet you too.
john_locke Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard You're welcome.
frank_lapidus What the hell is that?
richard_alpert Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
frank_lapidus I'm seein' it - But I'm still not believin' it.
john_locke Hello Richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.
richard_alpert ... you?
john_locke Me.
john_locke I am very disappointed ... in all of you.
lennon You Shephard?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
lennon We need to speak to you privately.
dr_jack_shephard If you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.
lennon I don't think you're understanding me here, I'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or I'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.
dr_jack_shephard Is that right.
hugo_reyes Jack!
lennon Oh my god.
dr_jack_shephard Wha...
sayid_jarrah What happened?
