CLAIRE Hey, hey it's okay, sweetie. Shhh. Hey, sweetie, it's alright. John, John, wake up.
LOCKE What? Claire, what?
CLAIRE He's burning up, and he's got a rash, and -- and I need to find Jack.
LOCKE He's, uh, he's on shift at the hatch.
CLAIRE Okay.
LOCKE No, no, Claire, wait. Claire, wait.
CLAIRE I can't, John.
LOCKE No, no, no, you're not walking through the jungle in the middle of the night. I'll go get Jack. I'll send him right back here.
CLAIRE Okay.
LOCKE Don't worry.
LOCKE Jack.
JACK What's going on?
LOCKE Baby's got a fever.
JACK A fever?
LOCKE Claire was coming here.
LOCKE He asleep?
JACK Not a sound all night. I'll get back here as soon as I can.
CLAIRE Shhh. Hey, hey, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay. Mommy's just going to cool you down, okay. Okay? Shhh, it's okay. Jack.
CLAIRE What are you doing here? You stay away from us.
DANIELLE He's infected, isn't he?
CLAIRE What?
DANIELLE Your child, he's sick.
CLAIRE Please get away. You get away from us!!
DANIELLE You don't remember, do you?
KATE Hey, get back! Get away from her! What do you think you're doing here? What are you doing here?! Just get out of our camp.
KATE What happened? What did she say?
CLAIRE She said there's something wrong with him.
CLAIRE It's just not like him. He always sleeps through the night. And this rash... I mean, there's something wrong.
JACK Babies get sick, Claire.
CLAIRE Okay, well, the fever and cough?
JACK It's perfectly normal.
CLAIRE He hasn't been eating at all.
JACK Claire, he's okay. It's probably roseola. It's a -- a typical virus that's common in children his age, and the rash is a sign of it.
CLAIRE Okay, what's if it's not? What if he caught something really bad -- like some kind of infection?
JACK Infection? Where did you get that idea?
KATE Rousseau was here.
JACK What did she say to you?
CLAIRE She said she knew he was sick, okay? That he's infected.
JACK Claire, there is no infection. We've been on this island for 2 months and no one's gotten sick. Rousseau's crazy. We're going to let the fever just run its course. It's going to be fine, okay, trust me. I'm going to get back to the hatch. I'll come back in a couple of hours and check on him again, okay?
CLAIRE Okay.
JACK Okay?
CLAIRE Yeah.
KATE Hey, I'm sure that if there was something wrong Jack would know.
KATE Are you sure about this? We don't really know her.
CLAIRE I think she can help me.
LIBBY Hey.
HURLEY Hey, guys.
CLAIRE So, you're a shrink, right?
LIBBY I'm a clinical psychologist, but "shrink" works, too.
CLAIRE Can you help people remember things?
LIBBY I guess it depends on what you need to remember.
CLAIRE So, it was our second week on the island, I was out in the jungle and I thought I was having the baby. Charlie was with me, and there was this man, Ethan. We thought he was one of us from the plane but he wasn't. So, he took me. He took both of us. And, I don't remember. I don't remember anything.
KATE When Jack and I found Charlie he was hanging from a tree -- by his neck.
CLAIRE I have no idea what happened and now I'm seeing these flashes of things and -- you know, I have amnesia. There's 2 weeks missing from my life.
LIBBY Claire, I don't think you have amnesia. You know, sometimes when something terrible happens to us there's a little switch in your head that flicks on to protect us from having to deal with it. Maybe your memories aren't gone. Maybe you're just blocking them.
CLAIRE Then I need you to unblock them because my baby's sick and they did something to him.
JACK Do you have to go to the bathroom?
GALE No.
JACK Well, just let us know when you do.
GALE Yeah, I'll look forward to that.
LOCKE I thought you might like something to read.
GALE Dostoevsky. You don't have any Stephen King?
LOCKE The library's a little outdated.
GALE Right. Well, thanks.
JACK What's with the book?
LOCKE Just something to pass the time. Did you know that Hemingway was jealous of Dostoevsky?
JACK No, John, I, I didn't know that.
LOCKE He wanted to be the world's greatest writer, but convinced himself that he could never get out from under Dostoevsky's shadow. Kind of sad, really. What are we doing, Jack?
JACK What are we doing?
LOCKE We can't hide him down here forever. Changing shifts around is going to get people asking questions. I just want to know what the long term plan is.
JACK Well, John, let me ask you this we don't have a long term plan for the button but we keep pushing it, don't we? Look, until we know who he is -- whether or not he's telling the truth -- we have to keep doing what we're doing. If you've got a better idea let's hear it.
GALE Why don't you let me go?
LIBBY We're away from all the noises of the camp. Just breathe. Let your whole body relax, good. Listen to the waves. Good, in and out slowly. Good. Keep your eyes closed. Very relaxed, Claire. Just keep breathing. Now, I want you to visualize yourself when you were pregnant. Keep listening to my voice. Think about what you see.
VOICE When was your last check-up, Claire?
CLAIRE I haven't been in a while. I've been busy, you know. I'm going to Los Angeles.
VOICE Really?
CLAIRE Yeah.
VOICE Traveling in your third trimester -- that's not usually recommended.
CLAIRE Well, there's a family there. I'm, uh, giving the baby up for adoption.
VOICE Oh, of course, I understand. The sedative I gave you was very mild. I know these exams can be very stressful.
VOICE I'm going to give you a shot now, Claire. A little medicine for your baby. Don't worry. You're just going to feel a little pinch.
LIBBY It's okay, you're alright. It's okay. It's okay.
CLAIRE It was Ethan. I saw Ethan. I saw him. It was Ethan.
LIBBY Claire, Claire, it's okay.
CLAIRE No, it's not!
LIBBY You're alright.
CLAIRE No, I'm not alright! It was Ethan!
KATE What happened?
LIBBY I don't know.
KATE What did you do?!
LIBBY Nothing, she just...
CLAIRE Do it again. Do it again!!
LIBBY No, Claire. You were screaming...
CLAIRE I remembered, okay. I saw Ethan. He was there and he was giving me an exam.
LIBBY Claire, what you saw could be combining experiences of what happened before the crash to the night you were having dreams here on the island.
CLAIRE No, I know this was real. I was drugged. He did something to me.
KATE Claire, you need to calm down, alright. It's not good for Aaron.
CLAIRE You know what -- Aaron is sick, okay. I need to find that place. That room -- it's real. It's real. And, hey, there's medicine there for the baby. I need to find it. I need to find it. Kate, please help me find it.
EKO Hello?
GALE What's the... 
EKO Hello? Hello?
LOCKE Howdy.
EKO Hello, John. You are alone?
LOCKE Not anymore.
GALE How many of you are...
JACK Shut -- up.
EKO I was hoping to borrow a saw.
LOCKE Absolutely, right this way.
KATE I need a gun. And you don't get to ask why.
SAWYER Well, Thelma, seeing as I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.
KATE No, you don't.
SAWYER Yes, I do -- watch. Why?
KATE Just give me a gun, Sawyer.
SAWYER Check it out -- I found a new pair of glasses damn near my prescription. Do you like 'em?
KATE Alright, I'm going into the jungle to track down Rousseau.
SAWYER The French chick? What for?
KATE Claire thinks she knows where there might be some medicine. The baby's sick.
SAWYER Well, hell, I got medicines.
KATE She thinks he's really sick -- as in quarantine sick.
SAWYER What do you think?
KATE I think she's a little too worried, but she's going after Rousseau with or without me.
SAWYER No boys allowed, huh? Alright, what do you want -- 9 millimeter or rifle?
SUN I don't think this is a good idea. Maybe you should listen to Jack.
CLAIRE What if Jack's wrong, okay? Jack said the fever would break and it hasn't. He's getting worse.
SUN Just because it hasn't broken yet...
CLAIRE Well, how long am I supposed to wait, Sun?
SUN A mother should not leave her child.
CLAIRE I'm sorry, are you a mother?
SUN No, I'm not. -- Claire, are you sure you want to do this?
CLAIRE What did you say?
SUN Are you sure you want to do this?
CLAIRE Do you have to put that in my tummy? It really, really hurts.
ETHAN I know. I wish there was another way. But the baby needs it, Claire. Okay?
CLAIRE Okay.
ETHAN There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
CLAIRE No.
ETHAN And now, because you've been such a good girl, I think it's time for a surprise.
ETHAN Claire, this way. Here we go. Over here.
CLAIRE What is this place?
ETHAN It's for your baby, Claire.
CLAIRE Uh, it's amazing. What happened to Charlie?
ETHAN Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far enough away from camp, I let him go back.
CLAIRE Oh. So, where did it all come from?
ETHAN Well, I'd love to explain everything to you, Claire, but I'm afraid it would be a little overwhelming right now.
ETHAN Go ahead, turn it on.
VOICE Ethan.
ETHAN Wait here, I'll be right back.
CLAIRE Okay.
VOICE What the hell happened? You were supposed to make the list and then bring her in. Was I unclear?
ETHAN It's not my fault. They knew I wasn't on the plane. They had a manifest.
MR. FRIENDLY What am I supposed to tell him? You know what he's going to do when he finds out. Damn it, Ethan.
SUN Claire? Claire, are you alright?
CLAIRE I, um...
KATE Ready to go?
CLAIRE Aaron, sweetheart, shhhh. Mommy's got to go now, sweetheart. Don't cry. Don't cry. I'll be back really soon and I'm going to make you feel all better, okay. I promise. Thanks.
SUN Okay.
KATE You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah.
CLAIRE You're sure this is her trail?
KATE We started at the exact spot where we chased her off the beach.
CLAIRE So, what do you know about Rousseau?
KATE Not much.
CLAIRE You spent all that time with her when you went out to the Black Rock. You must have talked about something.
KATE Just about her ship crashing here -- her and her research team getting stranded.
CLAIRE What happened to them?
KATE They died.
CLAIRE How?
KATE Uhm, tracks are gone -- trail ends here.
CLAIRE Kate, how did they die?
KATE She killed them.
CLAIRE What? Why, why would...
DANIELLE Because they were infected. You believe me now, don't you?
CLAIRE I want you to take me back there.
DANIELLE Back?
CLAIRE To where I scratched you.
KATE Claire.
CLAIRE No, okay, she knows I remember! Hey, I remember a lot of it now. I remember the room, the medicine, a teenage girl. Okay, so don't lie to me and make out you don't know what I'm talking about. My baby is sick and you're going to take me back there to get what he needs. Right now!
DANIELLE It's not far from here.
EKO Jack, may I have a word with you?
JACK Sure.
EKO Who is he?
JACK What?
EKO The man that you are keeping in the hatch.
JACK Did Locke tell you?
EKO Locke did not tell me anything. Who is he? I wish to speak to him.
JACK Speak to him about what?
EKO I wish to speak to him alone. Can you arrange this?
JACK Why should I do that?
EKO Because you wish to keep this a secret.
CLAIRE Why are we stopping here?
DANIELLE This is where you scratched me.
CLAIRE But there's nothing here.
DANIELLE Where do we go next?
CLAIRE Why are you asking me that? You need to tell me where to go.
DANIELLE Where is this room?!
CLAIRE How can you be saying that? Okay, you grabbed me, that's why I scratched you -- because you were taking me back to them!
DANIELLE Is that what you think? You said you remembered! That's why I brought you here! You lied! 
KATE Hey, get your hands off of her!
DANIELLE Go ahead, please. Do it.
KATE Claire! Claire!
ETHAN How's it coming?
CLAIRE One down, one to go.
ETHAN Now all we need is a little foot to put it on, huh? Tell you what, what do you say we sneak out of here and take a walk?
CLAIRE Okay.
ETHAN Whoa . I'm sorry this is the first time I've managed to get you out. My friends are afraid you'll run away. Whoa! Whoa. Don't tell on me, okay?
CLAIRE Okay.
ETHAN Whoa, easy now. Alright, easy.
ETHAN Okay, here, this will help.
CLAIRE Thanks Ew.
ETHAN What?
CLAIRE That's really sour.
ETHAN Is it? I hadn't noticed.
CLAIRE Bah. -- Oh, hey, it's kicking!
ETHAN May I?
CLAIRE Yeah.
ETHAN Claire, can I tell you a secret?
CLAIRE Yeah.
ETHAN I'm going to miss you. I wish -- I wish you didn't have to go.
CLAIRE Maybe I don't have to go?
ETHAN We've been through this, Claire. There's not enough vaccine for you and the baby.
CLAIRE Well, I'm not, I'm not sick.
ETHAN Thank God. And once you've delivered you can go back to your friends and hopefully you'll stay that way.
CLAIRE What if I want to see the baby?
ETHAN Hey, nobody's going to take him from you unless that's what you want. You have a choice. We're good people, Claire. We're a good family. But if you're going to trust us with your child I want you to be sure. Okay?
CLAIRE Sure.
KATE There you are. Where are you going?
CLAIRE I know this is it.
KATE Claire!
DANIELLE Leave her alone.
KATE Excuse me?!
DANIELLE Let her look.
KATE Look for what? Claire! Claire!
KATE Flashlights. The lights, I'm going to see if I can turn the power on. You okay?
CLAIRE This way.
DANIELLE What is this place?
CLAIRE It's where they were going to keep him.
YOUNG GIRL Wake up.
CLAIRE Who are you?
YOUNG GIRL Shhh. He'll hear you. Look, you have to get out of here.
CLAIRE Huh?
YOUNG GIRL You have to get out of here, now.
CLAIRE What? No, no, no, I can't leave.
YOUNG GIRL Yes, you can.
CLAIRE I can't leave. No. What are you doing?
YOUNG GIRL Don't scream. They're going to do it tonight.
CLAIRE Do what?
YOUNG GIRL Shhhh.
CLAIRE What are you talking about?
YOUNG GIRL You're going to die. They're going to cut him out of you! I can get you back to your camp, but we have to leave. Now!
CLAIRE No, no, no, hey, you're lying. You're lying, okay. I'm sure about this, okay.
YOUNG GIRL Shhhh.
CLAIRE Get Ethan, I want to talk to Ethan. Ethan wouldn't hurt me. Ethan wouldn't...
YOUNG GIRL You'll thank me for this one day.
CLAIRE It's here. The medicine's here.
CLAIRE Help me. Help! Kate, come here, I need some help! Help me open this.
KATE What is it?
CLAIRE It's in here. The vaccine's in here.
KATE Okay, 1-2-3.
CLAIRE It was in here. The vaccine was in here! Okay, where is it? Where is it? Where it is? The vaccine was in here! Where is it?! You were bringing me back here -- where is it?! You know where it is, don't you?! Tell me! Tell me where it is! Tell me!
CLAIRE Ethan. Ethan. Ethan? Ethan, I'm sure. Ethan? Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan! I'm sure. I want you to take the baby. Ethan?
CLAIRE Who are -- who are you?
ETHAN Claire!
CLAIRE Yeah! I'm here!!
ETHAN I can hear you, where are you?!
DANIELLE Quiet.
CLAIRE I'm here, Ethan!
DANIELLE Be quiet.
CLAIRE I have to -- I have to give him to them.
ETHAN Claire!
CLAIRE I have to give him to them so he'll be safe, okay. Help! I'm here! Ethan!!
CLAIRE You weren't trying to take me back, were you? You were trying to save me.
DANIELLE I carried you on my back to your camp. I left you where they would find you.
CLAIRE I'm sorry. Where are you going?
DANIELLE You're not the only one who didn't find what they were looking for.
DANIELLE This is as far as I go.
CLAIRE Your baby -- was it a girl?
DANIELLE Yes.
CLAIRE What was her name?
DANIELLE Alex -- Alexandra.
CLAIRE I remember a girl -- a girl with blue eyes. She helped me. She saved me, just like you did. She wasn't like the others. She was -- good.
DANIELLE I'm sorry that you didn't find what you were looking for. And I hope you're baby's not infected. But if it is, I hope you know what must be done. 
LOCKE Back for more tools?
JACK He knows, John.
LOCKE Well, there you go.
JACK Just be careful what you say to him. He's smart and curious. Just give us a shout when you're done.
LOCKE If the alarm goes off, don't tell him what it's for.
EKO What is it for?
EKO Hello. I am Mr. Eko.
GALE Henry Gale.
EKO Do you mind if I sit, Henry?
GALE Okay.
EKO How long have you been in here?
GALE 2 days.
EKO Are they treating you well?
GALE Treating me well? I'm a prisoner. And I don't know why, or for what, or...
EKO You are a prisoner because they are being careful. They are being careful because they believe you are lying.
GALE Why would I lie? They think I'm one of these others -- other what?
EKO Please, stop talking, Henry. The first night I spent on this island I was dragged into the jungle by 2 men. They never spoke a word to me, nor I to them. I killed these men -- smashed in their head with a stone, felt their blood on my arms. I need you to know how sorry I am for this. I need you to know that I am back on the righteous path now. And that I regret my actions. I ask you for your forgiveness.
GALE Why are you telling me this?
EKO Because I needed to tell someone.
JACK He looks good -- fever's broken, the rash is even starting to fade.
CLAIRE Thank you so much.
JACK I didn't do anything. I'll check back in a couple hours, okay? 
CLAIRE Look, Mommy made this for you when you were still inside her tummy. You know, I wanted them to take you. But now I know -- I know that we're supposed to be together, you and me. We're supposed to take care of each other, okay. -- You're mine and I love you. I love you so much.
GALE No cheeseburgers, huh?
LOCKE No cheeseburgers. Bon appetit.
GALE Is that true -- what you said about Hemingway?
LOCKE You have good ears.
GALE You have thin doors.
LOCKE You read Hemingway?
GALE Sure, guy ran with the bulls, fought in the Spanish Civil War, stuff I can wrap my brain around. This, I can't get through 5 pages of .
LOCKE Well, Dostoevsky had his virtues, too. He was a genius, for one. Bullfighting isn't everything.
GALE So, which one are you?
LOCKE I'm sorry?
GALE Are you the genius, or are you the guy who always feels like he's living in the shadow of a genius?
LOCKE I was -- I was never very much into literary analysis.
GALE I just don't understand why you let the doctor call the shots.
LOCKE No one calls the shots. Jack and I make decisions together.
GALE Right, okay. -- My mistake.
