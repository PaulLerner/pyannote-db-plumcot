MAN Police, open the door.
KATE Um. Everything's alright in here.
MAN Ma'am, we have reason to believe that someone extremely dangerous is in the motel. We're conducting a room-to-room search.
KATE I'm alone, officer.
MAN The person could be holding you at gunpoint, forcing you to say that. Please open the door.
KATE I don't think I should.
MAN Then you have three seconds before I break this door down. One... two...
KEVIN Hey. Wanna get it on?
KATE Hell yeah! 
KATE Hey.
SAWYER Hey yourself.
KATE What are you doing?
SAWYER Throwin' rocks.
KATE Thought you had to pull the lever.
SAWYER I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.
KATE Get me one.
SAWYER Psh. What, you trying to keep me feeling productive?
JACK You took these blood tests, made all the notations? How old are the x-rays?
JULIET A week.
JACK The tumor on your spine is borderline inoperable. And at the rate it's growing, that borderline goes away in about one week.
BEN Oh.
JACK The OR we were in, is that fully equipped?
JULIET Yes.
JACK Anesthesia? Sterile?
JULIET Yes.
JACK You needed to be in surgery yesterday.
BEN Alright, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. I'm ready.
JACK No, I think you misunderstood me. I didn't say I was gonna do it. I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die. You think I believe you people? You think I trust you? That I'm just going to do the surgery, and HOPE that you let me go?!
JULIET Jack!
JACK No, don't!
BEN Well, Jack. I'm very disappointed in your decision.
JACK Well, Ben. At least you won't have to be disappointed for very long.
KATE You shouldn't have come here.
KEVIN Yeah, you're right. I've made a huge mistake, and I'm just full of regret right now.
KATE Seriously. It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.
KEVIN It's bad luck to see the bride in her dress before the wedding. You, my friend, are naked.
KEVIN Have you tried it on?
KATE I had to hold my breath to get the claspy things to clasp. So, I'm waiting for the very last minute.
KEVIN Well, it's about twelve hours, right? Might wanna get clasping.
KEVIN Hey. I know its... it's been fast. But this is right. I know it's real. And I love you, Monica.
KATE I love you too, Kevin.
PICKETT Time for work. 
KATE What about him? 
PICKETT He's got the day off.
KATE Well, if he's not working, neither am I.
PICKETT Oh, you're not, huh?
SAWYER Go, Freckles. Man wants to give me a day off? Let him give me a day off.
KATE No Sawyer, we're a team. You break the rocks, I haul 'em.
PICKETT Alright. Fine.
PICKETT Lord knows I wouldn't want to break up the team.
NIKKI What happened to him?
LOCKE Must have been an animal. Maybe one of the bears.
NIKKI Are we gonna carry him back?
LOCKE No. We're gonna bury him here.
DESMOND Are we?
LOCKE The people back in camp... there's just been a few too many funerals lately. Nobody needs to see him like this. I'll slip back to the beach and get a couple of shovels.
SAYID I'll come with you.
LOCKE No I'll be back in an hour.
SAYID It's not safe to go alone, John!
LOCKE I appreciate your concern.
SAYID So, what killed Eko?
LOCKE Folks back at the beach call it "the Monster". I don't really have a name for it. You don't believe in monsters?
SAYID I believe in what I can see. But obviously you have. So, why don't you tell me what you think it is?
LOCKE Might be what brought us here.
SAYID So, you think that this Monster decided that Eko was meant to die?
LOCKE I believe that Eko died for a reason. I just don't know what it is yet.
SAYID That's why you lied? We're not headed back to the camp, are we, John?
LOCKE Sure we are. Just need to take a little detour first. 
PICKETT Where is she?! Someone's on the grid. I want him on the ground , her, too . If he moves, you shoot him!
PICKETT Yeah, they're here. The doctor get out again? You sure? Well, does he know? How the hell did she get over here?!
ALEX Come on! Get up! Go!
PICKETT Alex! Alex!
PICKETT What the hell do you think you're doing?
ALEX What, you gonna shoot me?
PICKETT You know you're not supposed to be here. So let's just calm down...
ALEX What did you do to him, Danny?! Where is he?! I wanna talk to Ben.
PICKETT Sure, that sounds like a great idea. So why don't we just lower our little sling-
ALEX WHERE IS HE?! Tell me!
ALEX Get off of me!
PICKETT Get her out of here. Get her OUT of here!
ALEX Let me go! Listen, whatever they say, don't believe them! They're gonna kill your boyfriend just like they killed mine!
PICKETT I don't understand. It's supposed to be two weeks.
JULIET Our schedule's been moved up.
PICKETT That's an order?
JULIET It's coming from him.
PICKETT It's stupid.
JULIET It's not my call. It's the way it is, Danny.
PICKETT Alright.
JULIET I would like you to put this on, and come with me. Please. 
KATE You think I'm going to put a hood over my head because you said please?
JULIET No Kate. I think you're going to put a hood over your head because the man standing behind me, the one who's burning a hole in my back? That man is going to kill Sawyer. But if you put this on, and you come with me, there's something you can do for us that will save his life.
KATE Come in?
SUZANNE Oh, sweetheart. You're beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
KATE How is it out there?
SUZANNE There are a lot of excited policemen. Don't worry, I've asked them not to shoot their guns in there when you say "I do."
KATE You know, mother-in-laws aren't supposed to be so nice.
SUZANNE Monica, I have something for you.
KATE Suzanne, you shouldn't have.
SUZANNE My mother gave that to me on my wedding day. She told me one day I'd give it to my daughter. But, since I have four boys... here.
KATE It's perfect. 
PRIEST You know, Kevin's been coming to the church here since he's been about yea high. When I first met you Monica, I was struck by your honesty and devotion to Kevin. When I asked him what he loved most about you, he said "What you see, is what you get." That being said, you've got the rings, vowed your vows, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
JULIET Step.
JULIET I'll give you two some privacy. 
JACK Hey. You Ok?
KATE Yeah. You?
JACK Yeah, I'm great. Where are they keeping you?
KATE Outside. In a cage.
JACK Sawyer?
KATE He's in a cage, too. They're making us work.
JACK Work? On what?
KATE I dunno what it is, but it's big. We're hauling rocks, and...
JACK Hey. Did they hurt you?
JACK Kate, hey. Hey. It's gonna be alright.
KATE Jack. You have to do it. This thing that they told you, this operation.
KATE She said that if you do it that...
JACK What did they do to you?
KATE Jack...
JACK What did they do to you?
KATE Nothing!
JACK How did they get you to ask me?! What did they offer you?!
KATE Jack, please! Nothing!
JACK Then what are you doing here?!
KATE They're gonna kill Sawyer! I'm sorry!
KATE I'm so sorry! But she said that if you do it, and you do it soon, they'll let us go!
JACK And you believe them?
KATE I have to. Jack? Please...
JACK We're done here.
KATE Jack!
JACK Hey! We're done in here!
KATE Jack! I'm sorry! 
BEN Get her out of there.
KATE Jack! Jack! Please!
KATE Hey, you.
KEVIN Hey! What's for dinner, gorgeous?
KATE It's taco night.
KEVIN You're making tacos?
KATE Yes, and you'd better like em.
KEVIN Or what?
KATE Or no dessert. I'm leaving now, I'll be home soon.
KEVIN Love you.
KATE I love you, too.
MARSHAL Agent Mars.
KATE It's me.
MARSHAL Well, I'm glad. I realized this morning that it was the Feast of the Assumption and I was feeling bad. How many holy days have come and gone since you last called? I thought you and I were friends?
KATE I don't want to run anymore.
MARSHAL What's his name? Does he know who you are?
KATE Edward, please. I know you don't want to spend the rest of your life chasing me. Please, I love this guy. Just let me go.
MARSHAL I'll tell you what. If you can really stay put? Really settle down? Then I'll stop chasing you. But you and I both know that's not gonna happen.
JULIET Sawyer. You really care about him, huh?
KATE Where is he?
JULIET I'm sorry you weren't able to help us, Kate.
JULIET Danny...
JULIET Danny! 
PICKETT Right. Sorry, Jules. You got anything you wanna say to your girl? You best say it tonight.
SAWYER And how was your day, honey?
LOCKE When the hatch exploded, your prayer stick fell out of a tree right on top of me. So, Sayid and I came out to get it, because it didn't seem right to bury you without it. I'd like to think you died for a reason, Mr. Eko. I just hope that it's not too long before we find out what the heck it might be.
LOCKE Rest in peace, Mr. Eko. Thank you for helping me find my...
KATE I saw Jack. They brought me in to see him. They want him to do surgery on Ben.
SAWYER Who the hell is Ben?
KATE Henry. The guy who brought us in. He's sick. And they say that if he does it, they're gonna let us all go.
SAWYER And you and me are what, bait?
KATE Something like that.
SAWYER At least the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.
KATE I told him he had to.
SAWYER Why the hell would you do something so stupid?!
KATE To save your life!
SAWYER My life don't need saving!
KATE You want to die?! Because that's what's going to happen! Pickett is just waiting for his chance! I've seen him look at you!
SAWYER Dammit, Freckles, stay put.
KATE And you know what he's going to do! So don't pretend like you don't care!
SAWYER Get down, Freckles, we've already been through this.
KATE Shut up, James.
KATE You don't want Jack to save your life? Then you're gonna save your own. We're getting out of here now. 
SAWYER Stop it, dammit, Kate!
KATE Go! Get out of here, run!
SAWYER You're out of your cage. Why don't you run, Kate?! Because me? I ain't running, 'cause there ain't no place to go.
KATE What are you talking about?
SAWYER We ain't on our island. We're on another island, like Alcatraz, couple miles off shore. So unless you're a mermaid, or you got a boat, there ain't no point.
KATE When were you planning on telling me this?
SAWYER Never.
KATE Why not?! Why wouldn't you?!
SAWYER 'Cause I wanted you to believe we had a damn chance.
SAWYER What was that for?
KATE I don't know. I don't know.
KEVIN Very nice. OK, now it's your turn. Look under your placemat.
KATE What did you do?
KEVIN Just look.
KATE What is it?
KEVIN You know that honeymoon I've been promising you for 6 months? You are holding in your hand two tickets to Costa Rica. You got your passport ready, baby? Hey. What's wrong?
KATE Nothing. I just love you so much.
KEVIN C'mere. 
SAWYER Lemme ask you something, Freckles. When Blockhead was beating on me, and you said "I love you." That was just... to get him to stop, right?
SAWYER I love you, too.
JACK Who is this? Hello? Hello!
FEMALE VOICE Try... the door.
BEN If it helps, I was surprised, too.
BEN If I were a betting man, I would have picked her and you.
JACK Shut up.
BEN Well. I suppose this would be the proverbial nail in my coffin, wouldn't it.
JACK Tomorrow.
BEN Sorry?
JACK Tomorrow morning. First thing. And everything I mentioned before. The instruments. The anesthesia. And someone who can hold a damn clamp.
BEN Yes. Of course.
JACK I'll get it out, your tumor. And I'll keep you alive. But I need your word. I need what you promised me before. I need to get the hell off this island.
BEN Done.
KATE Whatcha workin' on?
KEVIN Just finishing some IRs, and that fugitive recovery in Tampa. Being a cop is just endless paperwork. Thank you, sweetie.
KATE What if I told you I was a fugitive? What if I told you I was on the run for blowing up my father, and it was only a matter of time before you found out?
KEVIN This isn't funny.
KATE It's not a joke. I almost had a baby, Kevin. Me, a baby! I can't do this! Taco night?! I don't do taco night!
KEVIN Ok, calm down, Monica...
KATE My name's not Monica! I love you. But I can't stay. 
KEVIN Whoah, hey...
KATE Kev...
KEVIN Something's wrong with me.
KATE I drugged you.
KEVIN You what?
KATE I had to. Otherwise they will think you knew. People are going to be asking a lot of questions and I didn't want you to lose your job.
KEVIN Wait... 
KATE No, Ke--
JACK This is going to be a very tricky procedure. If I tell you to do something, I need you to do it then and there, no questions asked.
JULIET You may find this very hard to believe, but I've always been very good at just following orders.
JACK Is that a yes?
JULIET Yes.
JACK Good. Let's go.
BEN Do you get nervous? Before you do surgery?
JACK I used to. Not anymore, no.
BEN Whatever happens, everything will be very different, won't it?
JACK No doubt about it.
BEN Juliet. Did Alex ask about me?
JULIET No. We took her home last night. I don't know where she is now.
BEN Well, see you on the other side. I'm ready.
JACK I need you to count down from twenty.
BEN 20, 19... 
JACK Scalpel.
PICKETT Let's go. 
JASON Ben's just gone into surgery.
PICKETT Ben just put his life in the hands of one of them! Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.
KATE Sawyer.
PICKETT Well, well, well. Look who got out of her cage. You shoulda run when you had the chance. Let's go, James.
KATE Don't, please! You don't have to do this. 
PICKETT He's coming with me, and there's nothing you can do about it! Step away!
JACK Hand me another hemostat. Swab again. 
JULIET What happened? Is he Ok?
IVAN His blood pressure's dropping. Should he be bleeding like that?
JACK Nope, no, he shouldn't.
JACK Back away from the table.
JULIET Jack...
JACK Back away from the table! Now!
JACK Can you hear me in there?
TOM Yeah.
JACK Good. I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac. Now, if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead. Now get in here, and bring that walkie-talkie!
PICKETT Step away!
PICKETT You let go, or I do her too!
PICKETT Let go!
KATE Don't you let go! Don't you think about it, Sawyer, you fight! No! Sawyer, NO!!
KATE No, NO!! Sawyer, PLEASE! You get your hands off of him!
PICKETT Get on your knees! 
KATE Please!! I'll do anything you want!
PICKETT I want you to watch!
SAWYER Close your eyes, Freckles.
KATE Stand up!
SAWYER Close your eyes!
KATE NO! NO! NO!
PICKETT This is for Colleen. You son-of-a-bitch!
TOM Danny, you there? Pick it up. Pick it up, Danny. Pick it up, dammit!
PICKETT I'm here, WHAT?!
TOM Are you anywhere near the cages?
PICKETT Yeah, you could say that.
TOM Give your walkie to Kate.
PICKETT Now why the hell would I do that?
TOM Because if you don't, the doctor's gonna let Ben die!
PICKETT What are you talkin' about? What's that beeping?
TOM Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny! Do it. Just do it now!
PICKETT Let go of her.
KATE Jack? Jack!
JACK Kate? You have about an hour headstart before they come after you.
KATE Where are you? Where are you?
JACK You remember what I told you on the beach? The day of the crash. You remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up? DO YOU REMEMBER IT?!
KATE YES! Yes, I remember!
JACK When you get safe, you radio me, and you tell that story.
KATE Jack, please.
JACK If I don't get a call from you in the next hour, I'm going to know something went wrong, and HE DIES!
KATE I can't leave without you!
JACK Yes, you are. Go!
KATE Jack! I can't!
JACK Go, now!
KATE I can't!
JACK Kate, dammit, RUN!
