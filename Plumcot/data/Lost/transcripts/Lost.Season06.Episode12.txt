dr_pierre_chang In a world of conflict and strife, there is but one fact we all can agree upon... everybody loves Hugo.
dr_pierre_chang Born to humble surroundings, Hugo Reyes has always been a beacon of light for all who cross his path.
dr_pierre_chang Hugo's lifelong love affair with chicken led him to acquire and then expand the Mr. Cluck's chain into a worldwide phenomenon.
dr_pierre_chang The exponential growth of Hugo's success was startling. But financial success wasn't the end. It was the beginning. Hugo and giving became synonymous.
dr_pierre_chang Parks, playgrounds, hospitals, the Mr. Cluck's House for Children... the philanthropy was unparalleled.
dr_pierre_chang Which brings us to this evening and the opening of the Hugo Reyes Palentology Wing at the Golden State Natural History Museum. A lasting beacon of culture that bears the name of one of our city's greatest benefactors.
dr_pierre_chang Ladies and gentlemen, our man of the year... Hugo Reyes!
hugo_reyes Pretty cool trophy, huh?
carmen_reyes Mmm hmm, Hugo...
hugo_reyes Oh, you know we got the Human Fund next Saturday night... can you make it?
carmen_reyes Another trophy... everybody loves Hugo... you know who doesn't? Women.
hugo_reyes Ma!
carmen_reyes You need a woman in your life. Especially one who has not nursed you.
hugo_reyes That's disgusting. And I'm too busy to meet someone...
carmen_reyes You're not too busy. You're too scared!
hugo_reyes I'm not scared!
carmen_reyes Good, because you have a date tomorrow.
hugo_reyes I do?
carmen_reyes Grandpa Tito's neighbor's daughter. Rosalita. She agreed to lunch with you.
hugo_reyes What's she like?
carmen_reyes Willing to meet you.
hugo_reyes Ma--
carmen_reyes You're going! She's gonna love you! And if she doesn't... we will find someone who does!
hugo_reyes A lot of crazy stuff's been happening... I kind of wish I could talk to you about it in person. A lot of people come to talk to me after they've... you know... gone. It would be nice if you did too.
ilana_verdansky Hugo!
ilana_verdansky You ready to go? Once I'm back, we're leaving.
hugo_reyes Where are you going?
ilana_verdansky The Black Rock. If we're going to destroy that plane, we'll need dynamite.
hugo_reyes You sure that's the right move?
ilana_verdansky No. But it's the only move we have.
hugo_reyes Well... you're the expert.
ilana_verdansky Whose grave is this?
hugo_reyes Her name was Libby. She was in the tail section of the plane. We were gonna have our first date. It was gonna be, like... a picnic. But then she was murdered.
ilana_verdansky I'm sorry.
hugo_reyes Yeah, me too...
michael_dawson Hey!
hugo_reyes What are you doing here?
michael_dawson I'm here to stop you from getting everyone killed.
michael_dawson You gonna say something?
hugo_reyes Why should I trust you? You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.
michael_dawson That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you going across that island to blow up that plane. People are gonna die. A lot of people, and it's gonna be your fault.
hugo_reyes What?
michael_dawson Because people are listening to you now, Hurley.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley!
dr_jack_shephard Who are you talking to?
hugo_reyes Um... no one.
dr_jack_shephard Come on. We're leaving.
waiter Can I get you some more homemade tortilla chips?
hugo_reyes Sure. Whatever...
hugo_reyes Uh... can you leave those? I'm meeting someone. She's running late.
waiter Right. Chips are on the way.
libby_smith Hugo?
hugo_reyes Uh... hi. Nice to meet you.
hugo_reyes Wow! Uh... I wasn't expecting someone like you.
libby_smith Uh... I'm sorry?
hugo_reyes You know, someone so... pretty. Please, have a seat.
hugo_reyes You don't look like a Rosalita...
libby_smith Oh, uh... my name isn't Rosalita. It's Libby.
hugo_reyes So... you're not my blind date?
libby_smith No, I... I just saw you from across the room.
hugo_reyes Well... how did you know my name?
libby_smith Well, if I tell you, you're gonna think I'm crazy.
hugo_reyes No I won't.
libby_smith Hugo, do you believe that two people can be connected? Like soulmates?
hugo_reyes I guess...
libby_smith You don't remember me, do you?
hugo_reyes Should I?
dr_douglas_brooks What are you doing, Elizabeth? Are you bothering this man?
libby_smith No! No, he... he's an old friend.
hugo_reyes Actually, we just... wait, what? What's going on?
dr_douglas_brooks I apologize for the intrusion.
dr_douglas_brooks Come on.
libby_smith No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just--
hugo_reyes Doctor?
dr_douglas_brooks I'm sorry, she just wandered off.
hugo_reyes Wandered off from where?
libby_smith Everything that I said, Hugo... I meant it.
dr_douglas_brooks Forgive us.
ilana_verdansky Alright, let's go. We have to make it to the outriggers and across the channel to Hydra Island before nightfall.
richard_alpert Do you have the dynamite?
ilana_verdansky Four sticks. Enough to destroy the cockpit and all the instruments. That plane'll never fly.
hugo_reyes Um... I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable.
ilana_verdansky You have to trust me. I've been training my whole life for this.
hugo_reyes To blow stuff up?
ilana_verdansky To protect you!
hugo_reyes Yeah, but how's blowing up the plane protecting us?
ilana_verdansky With that plane gone, that thing won't be able to leave the island.
hugo_reyes Yeah... well neither will we. And then we'll be stuck here with it and it will be angry at us.
ilana_verdansky Jacob said Richard will know what to do. And Richard said to blow up the plane, correct?
richard_alpert Yes.
hugo_reyes Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me. I mean... what if Richard's wrong?
ilana_verdansky Hugo, I'm looking out for your best interests! All of you! Nothing is more important than this! That thing is evil! And God help us if it ever leaves this island! Because if it--
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 ...about six feet off the ground.
james_ford That gonna be a spear?
john_locke I'm not sure what it's gonna be yet, James. When the time is right, it'll tell me.
james_ford You talk to wood now?
kate_austen Sawyer...
james_ford What?
john_locke Something I can do for you two?
james_ford Is there something you can do? How about anything? Those bastards on the other island grabbed Jin and we're just sittin' here twiddlin' our damn thumbs, doin' nothin' about it!
john_locke There's a difference between doing nothing and waiting.
kate_austen So what are we waiting for?
john_locke You were only able to come back to this island because you all did it together. If we're gonna get on that plane and leave, it has to happen the same way. We're waiting for your friends to get here, Kate. Hugo... Sun... Jack. That's the only way we're ever getting off this... Godforsaken rock.
kate_austen Well, I don't see that happening.
john_locke Well, let's just hope you're wrong.
james_ford Where have you been?
sayid_jarrah Can I speak to you in private?
john_locke Absolutely.
john_locke Everything go alright?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
john_locke Did Widmore see you?
sayid_jarrah No, but his people did.
john_locke And you let them live?
sayid_jarrah I didn't see the point of killing them when I had what I came for.
john_locke So you found what they were hiding in the submarine?
sayid_jarrah I most certainly did.
ben_linus Now what?
richard_alpert We get more dynamite. Or else she died for nothing.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe she died to show us to stay the hell away from dynamite.
richard_alpert Well Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.
dr_jack_shephard Richard, I promised Sun that I'd get her off this island.
richard_alpert Well Jack, I... I wish you hadn't done that. If it makes you feel any better, you can blame it on me.
hugo_reyes I think Richard's right. It's the only choice we've got. Trust me, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
richard_alpert Good. Let's get moving.
CASHIER#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 38! Number 38!
CASHIER#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 Mr. Reyes! What an honor!
hugo_reyes Give me a bucket. Family size.
CASHIER#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 Of course. Right away, sir.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 41! Number 41!
hugo_reyes What?
desmond_hume I'm sorry. Have I seen you before?
hugo_reyes I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial. You want a Cluckateer key chain?
desmond_hume No, it's not that. Were you on Oceanic flight 815? About a week ago... from Sydney.
hugo_reyes Uh... yeah.
desmond_hume So was I.
hugo_reyes Wow, what a coincidence...
desmond_hume Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order?
hugo_reyes Be my guest...
desmond_hume Ooh... that is a lot of chicken!
hugo_reyes I eat when I'm depressed!
desmond_hume Ah! So what's her name?
hugo_reyes I met a girl on a blind date the other night.
desmond_hume And you didn't... it didn't go how you hoped?
hugo_reyes Mmm, she's totally awesome... except for one thing. She's crazy!
desmond_hume Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother...
hugo_reyes No, this one actually lives in the loony bin. I mean, I saw the van. She's full on nuts. I mean, she started sane... but then, she told me that we already knew each other. And that, I'd remember!
desmond_hume Tell me something...did you believe her when she said she knew you?
hugo_reyes Yeah. Kinda...
desmond_hume Now, I say go with your gut. You know, maybe you should... you should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from before you give up on her.
CASHIER#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode12 42! Order 42!
desmond_hume Ah! That's me, brother. Well, uh... it was nice bumpin' into ya.
john_locke Hello.
desmond_hume Hello.
john_locke I'm sorry Sayid tied you up but he was afraid you would run before we had a chance to talk.
desmond_hume I don't blame him. Although, as I explained to him before he left... I have nowhere to run to, brother.
john_locke Well, if that's not the best argument against captivity that I've ever heard, I don't know what is.
john_locke Would you mind if I asked you a couple of questions, Desmond?
desmond_hume Not at all.
john_locke Why did Charles Widmore bring you back to the island?
desmond_hume Considering I was kidnapped, you'd have to ask him.
sayid_jarrah They had him under armed guard.
desmond_hume He threw me into a wood shack and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism.
john_locke If you don't mind my asking, Desmond... how could you be sure what it was that he blasted you with?
desmond_hume Experience.
john_locke Do you know who I am?
desmond_hume Of course. You're John Locke.
john_locke Head back to camp. I'll be back soon.
sayid_jarrah Where are you going?
john_locke Desmond and I need to take a walk.
john_locke There's something I'd like to show you.
ben_linus Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
ben_linus Ilana. There she was - handpicked by Jacob, trained to come and protect you candidates, no sooner does she tell you who you are, then she blows up. The Island was done with her. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us.
richard_alpert All right everyone, this might take a few minutes. I don't want anyone but me handling that dynamite, so I'm gonna go it alone. Where's Hugo?
dr_jack_shephard I thought he was up front with you
hugo_reyes Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go!
richard_alpert Why the hell did you do that?!
hugo_reyes I'm protecting us.
richard_alpert What the hell were you thinking?!
dr_jack_shephard Calm down.
richard_alpert Now what-what are we supposed to do now?
dr_jack_shephard That's it. That's enough.
richard_alpert We're dead. We're all dead.
miles_straume A warning might have been nice there, Hugo.
hugo_reyes I did say "Run."
miles_straume Why'd you do that?
hugo_reyes Michael told me to.
miles_straume Who?
hugo_reyes Michael. He's one of the people who come back and yell at me after they die. He told me I had to stop everyone from blowing up the plane. So...no dynamite, no more blowing up.
miles_straume That happen a lot? Dead people yelling at you?
hugo_reyes It happens enough.
miles_straume And you just listen to whatever they say?
hugo_reyes Dead people are more reliable than alive people.
dr_douglas_brooks How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?
hugo_reyes Want to ask you about that girl the other day. Libby? I was wondering if maybe I could see her.
dr_douglas_brooks I don't think that's a good idea. She's not well.
hugo_reyes Clearly, she's well enough for, like, a fajita field trip.
dr_douglas_brooks Well, that's my mistake. I misjudged her condition.
hugo_reyes Her condition?
dr_douglas_brooks She has issues with reality.
hugo_reyes What do you mean?
dr_douglas_brooks I just think it probably wouldn't be a good idea for you to see her right now. It'll only confuse her.
hugo_reyes You said "probably", which means you might make an exception.
dr_douglas_brooks Well, perhaps for family.
hugo_reyes Or a generous donor?
dr_douglas_brooks I'm sorry.
hugo_reyes The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in. What do you think 100K might buy?
libby_smith You remembered?
hugo_reyes No. I'm sorry.
libby_smith Then why are you here?
hugo_reyes Where is it you think you know me from?
libby_smith Um, I'm not sure. I...I know it won't make sense.
hugo_reyes Try me.
libby_smith A few days ago, I was watching TV, and one of your commercials came on. And the moment that I saw you, it was like I was hit over the hand. All these memories came washing back...of my life...only...it was...another life.
hugo_reyes What kind of memories?
libby_smith There was a plane crash...and uh...I was on an island.
hugo_reyes And I was there?
libby_smith Think so. We...knew each other. We...liked each other. And then when I got here, it was almost like I'd been here before. And for some reason, Hugo, I have a memory of you being here, too.
hugo_reyes Um... This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital.
libby_smith Yeah, I know. But I can't get you out of my brain. That's why the other night when I saw you, I had to talk to you, because if you remembered me...
hugo_reyes I wish I could, Libby. But...I can't. I'm sorry.
libby_smith It's okay. It's okay. I'm crazy.
hugo_reyes Yeah, probably, but...we all got something, right? I mean, it takes a lot of guts to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them from some bizarro alternate universe. I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl.
libby_smith You're doing fine.
hugo_reyes Hey, can you ever like, like...get outta here? On day pass or...
libby_smith Yeah, I'm here voluntarily.
hugo_reyes Well...would you like to do something?
libby_smith You mean...a date?
hugo_reyes Uh...yeah.
libby_smith I'd love that.
john_locke Remind me, Desmond - how long were you down in that hatch, pushing that button?
desmond_hume Three years.
john_locke And here you are, back for more. If I didn't know better, I'd say this island has it in for you.
desmond_hume Do you know better?
john_locke Excuse me?
desmond_hume Well, there's nothing special about me, brother. This island has it in for all of us.
john_locke Yes, it does.
desmond_hume What?
desmond_hume Who's that?
john_locke Just ignore him.
desmond_hume Do you know that boy?
john_locke I said ignore him!
dr_jack_shephard Where you going?
richard_alpert Ben, back at the DHARMA barracks - there's still grenades there? Explosives?
ben_linus Yes, I think so.
richard_alpert Then that's where we're going.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe we should talk about this a minute.
richard_alpert Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know what we need to do, if you know how we stop that thing from leaving the Island without blowing that plane up, then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.
hugo_reyes I know what we need to do.
richard_alpert Really? What's that?
hugo_reyes We have to go talk to Locke.
ben_linus Are you trying to get us killed?
hugo_reyes It's not my idea. It's his. Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.
richard_alpert Jacob's here right now?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
richard_alpert Ask him what the island is.
hugo_reyes What?
richard_alpert A while back, Jacob told me what the Island was, and if he's really standing here right next to me, then just ask him.
hugo_reyes I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard. You either come with me or you can keep trying to blow stuff up. Your call, dude.
richard_alpert He's lying. Jacob isn't telling us what to do. Because Jacob never tells us what to do. I'm going to make this simple. If that thing leaves the island, that's it. I-it's over.
miles_straume What's over?
richard_alpert Everything. I'm destroying that plane and I can use all the help I can get. Who's coming with me?
ben_linus I am.
miles_straume I saw that thing in action, man. It doesn't want to talk. Sorry.
richard_alpert Anyone else?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, Richard. If Jacob says we go talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke. I'm going with Hugo.
hugo_reyes Really?
richard_alpert Don't get in our way.
dr_jack_shephard All right, Hurley. Let's go talk to Locke.
frank_lapidus Probably.
hugo_reyes So what do you think we should...say to Locke when we get there? I mean, how do you break the ice with a smoke monster?
dr_jack_shephard I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me he's going to do most of the talking.
hugo_reyes Or he could just kill us all.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. He could.
hugo_reyes I didn't see Jacob back there. I just said it because I wanted everyone to listen to me.
dr_jack_shephard I know.
hugo_reyes Then why'd you come with me?
dr_jack_shephard Ever since Juliet died - ever since I got her killed - all I've wanted was to fix it. But I can't. I can't ever fix it. You've no idea how hard it is for me to sit back and listen to other people tell me what I should do...but I think maybe that's the point...maybe I'm supposed to let go.
hugo_reyes Unless you letting go gets us killed. Going to see Locke was my idea, not Jacob's.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, you asked me to trust you. This is me trusting you.
hugo_reyes It's a good thing you do, dude, because I have no idea where I'm going.
hugo_reyes Wait. It's cool, I think I know what these things are.
frank_lapidus Oh yeah? What the hell are they?
hugo_reyes Wait here.
hugo_reyes Hey, you around? Michael?
hugo_reyes You're stuck on the Island aren't you?
michael_dawson 'Cause of what I did.
hugo_reyes And...there're others out here like you, aren't there? That's what the whispers are?
michael_dawson Yeah. We're the ones who can't move on.
hugo_reyes Do you know where Locke is?
michael_dawson There.
hugo_reyes Thanks. Is...is there anything I can do to...help you?
michael_dawson Don't get yourself killed.
hugo_reyes Okay.
michael_dawson And Hurley, if you ever do see Libby again, tell her I'm very sorry.
hugo_reyes I'll be sure and do that, dude.
hugo_reyes I got like, six different kinds of cheeses. I don't even know what they are, but the lady at the store said they were good, so...figured you'd like cheese because...everybody likes cheese.
hugo_reyes Something wrong?
libby_smith No, not wrong, just...off.
hugo_reyes Have you been here before?
libby_smith No. It's just being here with you...feels so familiar. It's like a date we never had. Wow I sound completely insane, don't I?
hugo_reyes No...not completely.
libby_smith Why do you even want to be with me?
hugo_reyes Why do you want to be with me?
libby_smith What?
hugo_reyes C'mon. Look at me.
libby_smith I wanna be with you because I like you.
hugo_reyes Yeah but, you like me because...well...you're...delusional.
libby_smith What? What's wrong?
hugo_reyes Whoa, dude.
libby_smith What?
hugo_reyes I...I think I'm remembering stuff.
libby_smith You are? You mean I'm not crazy?
hugo_reyes No, I don't think you are.
john_locke We're here.
desmond_hume What is it?
john_locke It's a well.
john_locke Let me guess. You're wondering how deep it is?
desmond_hume You read my mind.
john_locke You have any idea how old this well is, Desmond?
desmond_hume Very old?
john_locke That's exactly right, very old. So old in fact, that the people who dug this well did it completely by hand. God knows how long it took 'em.
desmond_hume That seems like a lot of work just to get some water.
john_locke Oh, they weren't looking for water. They were looking for answers. A long time ago places like the one we're standing at right now made compass needles spin. And the people holding the compasses needed to know why, so they dug.
desmond_hume Did they find what they were looking for?
john_locke No, they didn't. The reason I wanted you to see this, Desmond, is because Charles Widmore is not interested in answers, he's only interested in power. And he brought you back to the Island so that you could help him find what he's looking for. After all, this isn't the only well.
desmond_hume And that's the reason you wanted me to see this?
john_locke Why aren't you afraid?
desmond_hume Excuse me?
john_locke You're out here, middle of the jungle, with me, not a person on earth even knows you're here. Why aren't you afraid?
desmond_hume What is the point in being afraid?
desmond_hume Aah!
sayid_jarrah How's our friend?
john_locke You don't have to worry about him any more.
james_ford Where you been?
john_locke I went for a walk, James.
james_ford Well, now that you've stretched your legs, maybe you can--
james_ford Son of a bitch.
hugo_reyes Ummm...hey.
john_locke Hello, Hugo.
hugo_reyes I don't know who you are, dude, or what you want, but we have to talk to you.
john_locke We?
hugo_reyes There are other people with me. The thing is...you got weapons and we got weapons, and I don't want anyone to get hurt...or killed. So, we're not gonna do anything. I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either.
john_locke You have my word.
hugo_reyes Okay guys, come on out.
john_locke Hello, Jack.
ben_linus Hello there. You wating for someone in particular?
desmond_hume Excuse me?
ben_linus Well, I noticed you've been parked here a while watching the kids, and well, it is a school. Do you have a child who goes here?
desmond_hume No. No. I was um, uh, I just moved to the neighborhood, and um, and, uh, I'm looking for a school for my son.
ben_linus What's your son's name?
desmond_hume Charlie.
ben_linus Well, as a teacher here I can vouch for it completely. It's a wonderful school.
desmond_hume That's great to hear, thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you.
ben_linus Have a good day.
ben_linus Call 911, do it now! Mr. Locke? Oh, my God. Don't, don't move. We're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Can you hear me?
