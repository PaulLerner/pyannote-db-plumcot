SAYID I brought you a present for helping me with the translations. I didn't have a chance to get it gift-wrapped, so -- . I found these in the wreckage and I have no use for them personally.
SHANNON They are actually my size. Well, half a size off, but, I swear this place is actually making my feel swell.
SAYID Another mysterious force of the Island revealed.
HURLEY Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude.
BOONE Yeah.
HURLEY You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday, right?
BOONE What about it?
HURLEY That's cool, except, how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week, dude.
BOONE It's not like they're domesticated animals.
HURLEY Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough?
BOONE We're hunting, alright?
HURLEY I hope so, because people need food, man -- solid food. This isn't a game, man.
BOONE I can't believe you ran down that last ball. And then you hit it for a winner.
NICOLE Lucky shot.
BOONE Yeah, I wish it was luck. Is that my phone? Yeah, hello.
SHANNON Boone, it's me.
BOONE Shannon?
SHANNON Yeah...
BOONE What's the matter?
SHANNON Um, things aren't so good.
BOONE Where are you?
SHANNON Get out of here! Get the hell away from me!
BOONE Shannon? Shannon?
SHANNON Just stay out of here! Get the hell away from me!
BOONE Shannon, what's going on? Alright, Shannon, just hang on, just tell me where you are. I'll come get you.
SHANNON Sydney.
BOONE Sydney?
SHANNON Australia.
BOONE Stay away from my sister.
SAYID For a moment you seemed to be giving me an order.
BOONE It's just a friendly suggestion.
SAYID A suggestion?
BOONE Yes, and if I were you I'd listen.
SAYID What if I don't?
LOCKE Boone! Found some fresh tracks down by the stream.
BOONE See you later.
SAYID You know where to find me.
LOCKE You need to put aside your differences with Sayid.
BOONE He's hitting on Shannon.
LOCKE He's very competent. We don't want to make an enemy of him. We're going to want him on our side.
BOONE John, people are talking about what we're doing out here every day, especially since we never come back with anything.
LOCKE You mean boar.
BOONE Yeah.
LOCKE Plenty of fruit and fish to go around. What we're doing here is far more important. Right now, this is our priority.
HURLEY So, Jack?
JACK So, Hurley?
HURLEY Something kind of important I'd want to ask you about. Um, anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential, right?
JACK Yeah.
HURLEY The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great.
JACK What's the matter?
HURLEY Well, it's kind of like, uh, my stomach. I've been having some, um, major digestive issues.
JACK What have you been eating?
HURLEY You know, the usual - bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut. Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they might be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied.
JACK Well, it might help if you had a little bit more protein in your diet.
HURLEY Dude, what can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein.
JACK You can eat fish. Jin's been catching a lot of them.
HURLEY No way, man. That guy has it in for me.
JACK Oh, come on, man.
HURLEY I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like right after we, you know, got here, um, the thing with the spikes?
JACK Sea urchin.
HURLEY Yeah. And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge.
JACK You're not eating those, are you?
HURLEY Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me.
KATE I can see you there, you know.
JACK I wasn't hiding, just didn't want to disrupt you from doing whatever it is you're doing.
KATE It's not like it's a secret.
JACK Hard to tell with you sometimes.
JACK Huh, gross little, grayish-yellow things.
KATE Passion fruit seeds.
JACK What are they for?
KATE I'll show you. If you want to see?
JACK Yeah.
KATE Follow me.
JACK Please tell me you found a coffee bar.
KATE Not quite.
JACK When did you do all this?
KATE I didn't. It was all Sun. I just wandered into this place the other day when I was out picking fruit.
JACK This is is beautiful. It's great. 
KATE She planted some herbs and some low growing stuff here. And then she started a grove over there.
JACK Smart. With the boar running out we're going to need as much food as we can possibly get.
KATE Maybe it's not running out.
JACK What do you mean?
KATE Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore.
JACK Why would he do that?
KATE A lot of mouths to feed. If the boar's thinning out then why should he feed everyone else at his own expense?
BOONE That glass isn't breaking and the door's sealed shut. I think it's cement. What is that?
LOCKE Hmmm?
BOONE The stuff in the bowl - what is that?
LOCKE It's for later.
BOONE So, not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing. I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.
LOCKE Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.
BOONE We're not going to stare at this for 4 months, are we? How are we going to open it?
LOCKE Well, that's what we have to figure out. That's why we're sitting here. I mean, how do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch, no discernible way of opening it?
BRYAN Yeah?
BOONE I'm looking for Shannon.
BRYAN Who are you?
BOONE I'm her brother.
SHANNON Boone?
BOONE What's going on?
SHANNON What are you doing here?
BOONE 15 hours. I just spent 15 hours on a plane -- happy to see you, glad you're here -- something like that might work.
SHANNON Listen, this really isn't the best time. Bryan and I were just on our way out to meet some friends. Why don't you give me a call tomorrow? Please?
BOONE Okay. Enjoy your friends. 
HURLEY Jin! Yo, Jin! Alto. Listen, I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing. But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business with my own tools. 
JIN 난 아마추어랑 안 놀아요. 그러니까 저리 가세요. (I have no time for amateurs. Just stay out of my way.)
HURLEY You just said something mean, didn't you?
BOONE You know, we're going to have to tell them.
LOCKE Tell them what?
BOONE What we found. You know, they're not going to keep believing that we're coming out here hunting. We never go back...
LOCKE They're not ready. They won't understand it.
BOONE I don't think I understand it.
LOCKE That's the problem.
BOONE Look, at least I've got to tell Shannon.
LOCKE Why?
BOONE What do mean, why? Because she's my sister.
LOCKE Why do you care about her so much?
BOONE You don't know her, man. She's smart, she's special in a lot of ways.
LOCKE Fair enough.
BOONE She's been asking me about this. I can't keep lying to her.
LOCKE You mean you can't keep lying to her, or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her?
BOONE Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret.
LOCKE You're sure?
BOONE Yes, I'm sure.
LOCKE No, I mean, are you sure you want to do this?
BOONE I've got to get her off my back. She keeps asking me about this, she keeps asking me about you, about the whole thing.
LOCKE You're sure you've thought through the ramifications?
BOONE Yes.
LOCKE So be it.
BOONE Locke, what is this? Do you hear me? Untie me right now.
LOCKE Or what?
BOONE I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay? I promise.
LOCKE I'm doing this, Boone, because it's time for you to let go of some things. Because it's what's best for you. And, I promise, you're going to thank me for this later.
BOONE Hey, I don't think this is best for me What is that?!
LOCKE An untreated wound, out here, is going to get infected.
BOONE You're not going to just leave me here!
LOCKE Whether you stay is up to you. The camp is 4 miles due west.
BOONE Which way is west?
LOCKE You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation.
BOONE Locke!
BOONE Help, help!
MALCOLM I'm sorry, Mr. Carlyle, but I'm afraid I can't help you. Unfortunately, sir, we'll need a little more to go on.
BOONE I don't understand this, I'm reporting a crime.
SAWYER I'm sitting in this... little bar, minding my own business. And this guy...
BOONE Look, this is a cycle with her, okay. My sister just happens to be attracted to the wrong kind of guy.
SAWYER I just gave it back to him. Hey, yo, croc hunter, how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story, huh?! Just what kind of...
MALCOLM Now, if that were her mate, see, then I could help you. Let's finish taking down the rest of your information. You were saying she's your sister, then why is her name Rutherford, and yours Carlyle? Is she married?
BOONE She was married. She's not married anymore, and that has nothing to do with this. Rutherford is her father's name. Our parents got married when I was 10, she was 8.
MALCOLM So she's your step-sister?
BOONE That's right.
MALCOLM No blood relation.
BOONE Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlyle? She owns the largest wedding business in the United States. I'm the COO of the wedding clothing subsidiary.
MALCOLM Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? Cost $2000 new. It's only been worn once.
BOONE I just want someone to go pay this guy a visit, that's all.
MALCOLM Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of any physical evidence or a direct complaint from, uh...
BOONE Shannon.
MALCOLM Shannon. We can't just go barging into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police, not the dating police.
BOONE Bryan, we need to talk.
BRYAN Yeah?
BOONE I'm not going to waste your time, and I'm not going to waste mine. I want you to break up with my sister.
BRYAN What?
BOONE I want you to end it. Today. Right now.
BRYAN Oh, bugger off, mate.
BOONE What you don't understand, Bryan, is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave. Go to her house when she's not there, pack your stuff, and never have contact with her again. Understood?
BRYAN So you flew all the way over here to bribe me.
BOONE I'm going to give you 25,000 US dollars.
BRYAN I love her.
BOONE How much?
BRYAN My love for her -- is worth closer to 50,000.
KATE I can't believe we've been here for over 3 weeks. I was on my way to Bali. I travel a lot. I was looking forward to exploring the Island. Somehow I ended up on a flight to LA, instead. Guess that falls under the category -- be careful what you wish for. You understood me. You did, didn't you, you just understood what I said? You speak English?
SUN Please, don't tell anyone.
HURLEY Damn it!
JIN 이거, 내 고기니까 먹지 마. (Don’t eat my fish!)
HURLEY You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish, I'm out of here.
HURLEY Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
JIN 무슨 일이에요? (What did you do?)
HURLEY I stepped in a friggin' urchin! Ow, you understand me?! Do you understand infection, gangrene, amputation?! 
HURLEY Ow, aw, ow! You've got to do something for me.
JIN 이걸 빼야 되겠네. 촉수를 빼야 돼요. (Just pull out the spines -- pull them out.)
HURLEY You're going to have to pee on my foot, man. It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV. Ow, arrgh, no just pee on it man. 
JIN (No -- you idiot -- that isn’t going to do anything! That’s for jellyfish stings!)
HURLEY You need to pee, pee on it. Pee on my foot. I'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee! Pee on it! Pee on- 
LOCKE Hi.
SAYID I didn't hear you.
LOCKE Sorry. Sneakier than I give myself credit for.
SAYID What are you doing out here?
LOCKE We were hunting. Boone thought I should take the afternoon off.
SAYID Boone -- is hunting?
LOCKE The boy's eager to learn.
SAYID You think he'll catch anything?
LOCKE Nope. What are you doing out here, Sayid?
SAYID Orienteering. I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps, but...
LOCKE There's nothing to make.
SAYID Exactly.
LOCKE Well, you made a compass. I haven't seen one of those since I was a Webelos.
SAYID What's a Webelos?
LOCKE It's half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.
SAYID And what does a Webelos do?
LOCKE Gets badges, mostly. Ties knots, identifies birds. I wasn't the most popular kid. I'll leave you to it. Maybe this will help your cause.
SAYID Don't you need this?
LOCKE Not anymore.
SHANNON Somebody help me!
BOONE Who's that?!
SHANNON Boone!
BOONE Shannon! I'm tied up!
SHANNON What?!
BOONE Can you get over here?!
SHANNON I'm tied up, too!
SHANNON Boone!
BOONE Hold on Shannon, I'm coming!
SHANNON Boone! It's getting closer! Somebody help me! Boone!
SHANNON Please, help!
SHANNON Boone!
SHANNON Boone, help me! Hurry, please!
BOONE I'm trying.
SHANNON Please hurry.
BOONE Go. Come on. In here, in here.
SAYID Let me ask you something -- which way do you think North is?
JACK Sorry?
SAYID North? Which way is it?
JACK Uh, okay. The sun's going to set over there, so that makes that West. That'd be North. Yeah.
SAYID Correct. That's where North should be. Yet that is North.
JACK I'm not...
SAYID A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of 2 or 3 degrees, but not this.
JACK What are you saying?
SAYID I'm saying this compass is obviously defective.
JACK Where'd you get it?
SAYID Locke gave it to me this afternoon.
JACK Locke? Where'd you see Locke?
SAYID About a mile East of here, walking through the jungle. At least I think it's East.
SHANNON What did you do to him?
BOONE What did I do to who?
SHANNON Locke. What did you do to that psycho to piss him off?
BOONE I didn't do anything to him.
SHANNON What? He just did it because he was bored? Look, I know you guys are...
BOONE Let's go back to camp.
SHANNON You were supposed to come later.
BOONE Do you have any bags? Anything you want to take?
SHANNON You should go back.
BOONE No, Shannon. We're getting out of this country. Is there anything you want to bring with you? What's the matter with you?
BRYAN Aw, look at this.
BOONE Let's go, please. C'mon. We can go.
BRYAN Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you -- what's what?
BOONE You set me up. This whole thing was a set up.
BRYAN She's just getting what she's owed.
BOONE What'd you say?
BRYAN She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died, kept all her father's money for herself. A sweet mum you got there.
BOONE This isn't the first time, is it? Oh, you've done this before, you little bitch.
BRYAN That's enough.
BOONE Don't touch me you low life piece of-
SHANNON Bryan, get off of him! Get off of him! Get off!!
JACK Any ships?
LOCKE Not yet. But I'm -- patient.
JACK Mind if I join you? It's been awhile since you and I talked, John.
LOCKE Well, you're a busy man.
JACK So are you. Where's Boone?
LOCKE I haven't seen him today.
JACK Yeah? You two have been attached at the hip all week.
LOCKE Well, let me just check my hip... Nope, no Boone.
JACK How's the boar hunting going?
LOCKE Between you and me?
JACK Always.
LOCKE I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley. They're smart animals, and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment.
JACK You mean us?
LOCKE The most dangerous predator of all.
KATE Does anybody else know?
SUN Only Michael.
KATE But not your husband?
SUN Please, I...
KATE Don't worry. I can keep a secret.
SUN I took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know -- it's complicated.
KATE So why don't you tell him now?
SUN I can't.
KATE Why?
SUN Because I love him.
KATE I don't...
SUN Have you never lied to a man you've loved?
HURLEY You sure you don't speak English? Cuz there's a rumor that you do. -- Your wife's hot.
HURLEY Oh, I get it, this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? I eat this you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips and past the gums, yada yada, oh god.
CHARLIE Cheers.
JACK You need a hand?
CHARLIE Yeah, yeah, I'd love one.
JACK Haven't seen you around the caves lately.
CHARLIE I needed a change of scenery.
JACK How are you doing, Charlie?
CHARLIE How am I doing? With week 2 of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
JACK I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal. What do you think his story is?
CHARLIE Who? Locke? The guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin. That was my first impression, anyway. And then he saved my life.
JACK So you trust him?
CHARLIE Trust him? No offense, mate, but if there's one person on this Island I would put my absolute faith in to save us all it would be John Locke.
WALT C'mon, you want the ball? Go get the ball. Go get the ball. Good boy.
HURLEY Dude, did you find your own bag? That's awesome, man.
MICHAEL Yeah.
WALT Come on, Vincent, over here.
HURLEY Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again.
MICHAEL Got some papaya there, huh?
HURLEY Yeah. Yippee.
MICHAEL Hey, you mind if I, uh...?
HURLEY Knock yourself out. You want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin. Oh hey, thanks. Dude, has this thing already been cleaned? Are you kidding me?
SUN 밥 먹었어요?
JIN 아니, 아직 안 먹었어. 손 씻어야 겠어. 손이 더러워졌어.
JACK They look happy.
KATE Happy?
JACK Put out your hand. You'll like it, I swear.
KATE Gross little grayish-yellow thingies?
JACK Oh, no, no, no, these are slimy little bluish-black thingies.
KATE Guava seeds.
JACK What's a garden without guava?
SHANNON Are you sure we're going in the right direction?
BOONE If you don't want to follow me, don't.
SHANNON I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the nut case who brought us out here. You and Locke weren't hunting, were you? You were doing something else.
BOONE Haven't we been over this before?
SHANNON You're a horrible liar, Boone.
BOONE We weren't doing anything.
SHANNON Why are you keeping secrets for this guy?
BOONE Do you know who this guy is? He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on.
SHANNON What is that supposed to mean?
BOONE It means he's smart.
SHANNON He tied us up, Boone. Why?
BOONE We found something.
SHANNON What?
BOONE While we were out looking for Claire we found this -- this piece of metal buried in the jungle. We've been excavating it. That's what we've been doing.
SHANNON A piece of metal?
BOONE A hatch, buried in the dirt.
SHANNON Like a door?
BOONE Yes, Shannon, that's what a hatch is.
SHANNON Where does it go?
BOONE I don't know. But I told him I wanted to tell you, and that's when he did this.
BOONE C'mon.
BOONE No, Shannon!
BOONE Shannon! Shannon!
BOONE What do you want?
SHANNON Bryan took the money. He's gone.
BOONE So the player got played. It's poetic, don't you think?
SHANNON I knew you'd bring the money. I knew you would.
BOONE You're drunk.
SHANNON You want to know why?
BOONE I guess it doesn't matter, does it? Because you're going to tell me anyway.
SHANNON Because you're in love with me.
BOONE What?
SHANNON You brought the money because you're in love with me.
BOONE You show up here plastered...
SHANNON You've always been in love with me.
BOONE You've always been a self-centered little bitch, but now you're delusional.
SHANNON I've always known it.
BOONE You're sick.
SHANNON No.
BOONE Stop.
SHANNON It's okay.
SHANNON Boone?
BOONE What?
SHANNON When we get back to LA you should just tell your mom that you rescued me -- again, just like you always do. And then we'll just go back.
BOONE To what?
SHANNON To what it was.
BOONE Like it's all up to you.
SHANNON Get dressed.
BOONE Shannon!
BOONE No... Shannon? Shannon? Shan?
BOONE It killed her!
LOCKE You made it back.
BOONE That thing killed my sister. It's your fault. You drug her out there.
LOCKE Your sister?
BOONE Don't play dumb with me.
LOCKE Calm down.
BOONE She died in my arms.
LOCKE Why is there no blood on you?
BOONE What the hell just happened to me out there?
LOCKE I don't know. I don't know, you tell me. But your sister, Shannon... 
BOONE She was dead.
LOCKE Is that what it made you see?
BOONE What made me see? That stuff you put on my head -- you drugged me.
LOCKE I gave you an experience that I believe was vital to your survival on this Island.
BOONE It wasn't real?
LOCKE It was only as real as you made it.
BOONE I saw her -- I saw her die.
LOCKE How did you feel? When she died?
BOONE I felt -- I felt -- I felt relieved. I felt relieved.
LOCKE Yes. Time to let go. Follow me.
