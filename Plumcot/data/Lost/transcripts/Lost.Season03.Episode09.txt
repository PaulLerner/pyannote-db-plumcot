james_ford Show me the way to go home/I'm tired and I want to go to bed/I had a little drink about an hour ago/And it went straight to my head.
kate_austen Stop.
james_ford What, you want a turn steering?
kate_austen We have to go back.
james_ford What the hell are you talking about?
kate_austen Turn the boat around, Sawyer. I mean it.
james_ford Have you lost your mind? We just got away.
kate_austen Just do it.
james_ford You give me one good reason to turn around!
kate_austen Because we can't leave Jack behind!
james_ford Yes we can, Freckles, because that's what he asked us to do. You think about it -- if we go back there -- what do you think Captain Bunny Killer's going to do if he catches us?
karl_martin Kill you. God loves you as he loves Jacob.
james_ford Okay, thanks for the input. Sorry, kiddo, Jack's on his own.
tom_friendly Time to get up. We're moving you.
dr_jack_shephard Moving me where?
tom_friendly Some place else, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Why? So this is it, huh?
tom_friendly It?
dr_jack_shephard You just helped me save his life. If you're going to kill me, at least show me the respect of not calling it "moving."
tom_friendly Now, why would we kill you?
dr_jack_shephard Because you're done with me.
tom_friendly What kind of people do you think we are, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, I don't know, Tom -- the kind of people that would take a pregnant woman -- that would hang Charlie from a tree -- would drag our people out of the jungle -- would kidnap children. That's the kind of people I think you are.
tom_friendly You see this glass house you're living in, Jack? How about I get you some stones? Let's do this the easy way -- what do you say?
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
thai_man BOY Doctor Jack! Hey, Doctor Jack! Doctor Jack, want soda? Doctor Jack.
thai_man BOY
dr_jack_shephard You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right?
thai_man BOY Doctor Jack.
dr_jack_shephard You're welcome.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you. Thank you very much.
achara You're not from around here are you?
dr_jack_shephard No, no I'm not. I'm Jack.
achara Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.
dr_jack_shephard Achara. Achara.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet grilled these for me. Who's that woman?
tom_friendly That'd be the sheriff.
dr_jack_shephard You have a sheriff?
tom_friendly Not literally, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Why are you moving Juliet into my room?
tom_friendly Because she's in trouble, Jack. Now don't try anything stupid. Stay put in this cage, okay?
dr_jack_shephard You say that like you're not watching me from the camera right there.
tom_friendly Oh, right. Ben told me you got into the surveillance room. Let me ask you something. You risk your neck to cut them loose, and they run away and don't ever look back...
dr_jack_shephard Thanks for the sandwich.
james_ford Never thought I'd be glad to get back to this rock again.
kate_austen What are you doing?
james_ford What does it look like? I'm heading into shore.
kate_austen Why? If we just keep going we can circle round. Sooner or later we'll get to camp. We can tell Locke and Sayid what happened --
james_ford Oh, we will, huh? You got a map you ain't showing me, Magellan? We've got no food, no water -- and I can't steer in the dark.
kate_austen Then I'll steer.
james_ford No, you'll come ashore; we'll make camp. You want to contribute -- you can build a campfire while I carry the kid. Glad we agree.
james_ford Sure you ain't hungry?
kate_austen No, James, I ain't hungry.
karl_martin You shouldn't fight.
james_ford When the hell did you wake up?
karl_martin You shouldn't fight because you're lucky to be alive.
james_ford Golly, I think he's got a point.
kate_austen That island we were on -- is that where your people live?
karl_martin Just where we work.
kate_austen Work on what?
karl_martin Projects.
james_ford Well, sure, like the steal-the-kid-off-the-raft project. That was a humdinger.
kate_austen So, you don't actually live on that island?
karl_martin Nope.
kate_austen Do you live here on this island?
karl_martin Yes, ma'am.
kate_austen And what did you do with the people that you took - the kids?
karl_martin We give them a better life.
kate_austen Better than what?
karl_martin Better than yours. There's not going to be any moon tonight. It'll be dark. Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard at night and think up names for the constellations. You can't see it yet, but right there will be Ursa Theodorus - the Teddy Bear.
james_ford You have backyards?
karl_martin Yeah.
james_ford Well, ain't that quaint.
dr_jack_shephard I thought you were locked up.
dr_juliet_burke They let me out to examine Ben. His vitals are low and he has a fever. I took this about 10 minutes ago. It's of his stitches. They're infected aren't they?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
dr_juliet_burke Will you come look at them?
dr_jack_shephard No.
dr_juliet_burke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard No.
dr_juliet_burke I'm not asking you for them, or him. I'm asking you as a personal favor to me.
dr_jack_shephard You want me to help him again?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Are you sure about that, Juliet?
dr_juliet_burke Yes, I'm sure.
dr_jack_shephard And this is because he said that he would let you go home.
dr_juliet_burke No. No. It's because I'm in trouble.
dr_jack_shephard Trouble for --
dr_juliet_burke I just killed someone. It's why they put me in your room.
dr_jack_shephard Who?
dr_juliet_burke It's complicated.
dr_jack_shephard Well, then, let me simplify it for you. I'm not going to help him. And I'm not going to help you.
chet Okay, special Thai dish for you. You try. Very brave. Very brave.
achara My brother likes you.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'm a very likable guy.
achara So, Jack, tell me something.
dr_jack_shephard Shoot.
achara Why is it you don't know how to fly a kite?
dr_jack_shephard Just never learned, I guess.
achara That's very sad.
dr_jack_shephard Well, my dad worked a lot and wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway. I mean, we never really --
achara Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
achara I have no interest in your father.
dr_jack_shephard Well, that's a relief because I'm pretty tired of talking about him.
achara Some things are personal. So, you're in Phuket to find yourself.
dr_jack_shephard Why would you say that?
achara You are an American.
thai_man MAN
achara
thai_man MAN
achara
achara I have a gift.
dr_jack_shephard Must be one hell of a gift.
isabel Oh, I was just reading your tattoos. The 5 and the stars are very cute. But the Chinese I find a bit ironic.
dr_jack_shephard You find what ironic?
isabel What it says. You do know what it says?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I know what it says.
isabel Are you sure? Chinese is a very complicated language. It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation.
dr_jack_shephard I know what it says.
isabel Alright, then. Jack, my name is Isabel. If you'll come with me, I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions.
isabel Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.
isabel Please, have a seat, Jack. As you may have gathered, we don't live on this little island. In fact, most of us don't really like even coming here. There's been an incident that I'm investigating and I need to ask you some questions. So, I was hoping you might help me clear up a few of the inconsistencies. Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom. But you said that in the midst of a surgical procedure Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.
tom_friendly Yeah, that's right.
isabel That true, Jack? Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben? The question's simple. Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I was lying. I would have done anything to get my friends out. And turning you people against each other was my best chance of creating chaos.
isabel Why are you lying for her, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I'd like to go back to my cage now.
dr_jack_shephard Who's there?
achara Who do you think?
dr_jack_shephard What time is it?
achara It's late.
dr_jack_shephard Mmm, salty.
achara I went for a swim in the ocean.
dr_jack_shephard Washing the day off of you, huh?
achara Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No. I mean, it might be nice -- after a month of you coming and going whenever you want -- to find out something about you.
achara There are things that happen here that you could never understand.
dr_jack_shephard Like your gift?
achara Yes, like my gift. Are you having fun with me, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, yeah.
achara Then stop ask questions. Let's have fun.
dr_jack_shephard What?!!!
cindy_chandler Hey, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Do I -- do I know you? 815, you were the stewardess.
cindy_chandler Cindy.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing here -- with them? I thought you were taken -- you were -- you were captured.
cindy_chandler They're not, um -- it's not that simple.
dr_jack_shephard What are they doing here, right now? What are you doing here?!!
cindy_chandler We're here to watch, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Watch what?
cindy_chandler What is it, sweetheart?
cindy_chandler She wants to know how Ana Lucia's doing.
dr_jack_shephard Are you serious?
cindy_chandler What?
dr_jack_shephard If you've got something to watch, Cindy, go watch it!! Go!!
kate_austen Sawyer. Sawyer, wake up. He's gone. Karl's gone.
james_ford Where? Hold up.
james_ford I got it.
kate_austen No, let me talk to him.
james_ford I got it -- boys only.
karl_martin Ow!! What the hell was that for?!
james_ford So you'd cowboy up. Crying in the jungle -- I thought you people were supposed to be tough.
karl_martin I am tough.
james_ford Sure you are, Bobby. Bobby, the Brady Bunch?
karl_martin What the hell's the Brady Bunch?
james_ford Okay, anyway look, Karl -- I've been with a lot of girls -- some of them worth the trouble, some not. Every now and again there's one -- one you name dumb stars with. So this girl, Sally Slingshot --
karl_martin Alex.
james_ford Yeah. Do you love her?
karl_martin More than anything.
james_ford Then go back to wherever the hell your yards are and get her back.
karl_martin If I get caught -- they'll kill me this time.
james_ford Well, at least it'll be worth it.
alex_rousseau I want to ask you something. They're not watching anymore so you can tell me the truth.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
alex_rousseau Ben -- why'd you save his life? All this time -- after all he did to you and your people you should hate him. But you still fixed him up, even after your friends got away. Why?
dr_jack_shephard You're his daughter.
alex_rousseau Answer the question.
dr_jack_shephard I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine. Where's Juliet?
alex_rousseau She's with the rest of them. They're going to read her verdict.
dr_jack_shephard Her verdict?
alex_rousseau And we all know what it's going to be. We're pretty strict about killing one of our own. Eye for an eye.
dr_jack_shephard Who did she kill?
alex_rousseau The man who was going to murder your friends. No wonder you're so worried about her. If it wasn't for you she never would have done it. That was 3 questions. Your turn, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I saved your father because I said I would. Hey, hey! Is he still in charge?
alex_rousseau What?
dr_jack_shephard Ben, your father, is he still in charge? Will that woman, Isabel, do what he says?
alex_rousseau Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Get me out of this cage.
dr_jack_shephard I wouldn't do that!
ben_linus The cavalry has arrived, at last.
dr_jack_shephard I'd be more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon.
ben_linus We had an excellent surgeon, Jack. His name was Ethan.
dr_jack_shephard You've got a very serious infection, Ben. That infected tissue needs to be reincised, debrided; and you need to be closely monitored from here on out. There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications. You might not walk again.
ben_linus Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.
dr_jack_shephard Well, then it's too bad you're stuck with me.
ben_linus Am I?
dr_jack_shephard You need a doctor, Ben -- someone to stay with you -- bring you back to good health.
ben_linus And, here we go again. I've already given you a ticket off this island, Jack. What's it going to cost me this time?
dr_jack_shephard Right now, your people are in a room deciding whether or not to execute Juliet. You're going to stop it.
ben_linus Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack. It doesn't matter what she's done. No matter what you think -- she's one of us.
dr_jack_shephard Do we have a deal or not?
ben_linus Does Isabel have a walkie?
alex_rousseau They're already in the meeting.
ben_linus Then get me something to write on.
achara You followed me.
dr_jack_shephard What is all this?
achara This is where I work. And you shouldn't be here.
dr_jack_shephard This is, uh, a tattoo parlor. That was your big secret? The envelopes? Your gift?
achara I am not a tattoo artist. I am able to see who people are. My work is not decoration; it is definition. And this, this is my gift.
dr_jack_shephard So you see who people are?
achara Yes, and I mark them.
dr_jack_shephard So tell me who I am.
achara No.
dr_jack_shephard Why not?
achara You are an outsider.
dr_jack_shephard So you can sleep with me?
achara I'm not allowed.
dr_jack_shephard Do you see who I am, Achara?
achara Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Who am I?
achara You are a leader, a great man. But this, this makes you lonely, and frightened, and angry.
dr_jack_shephard Now, put it on me. Put it on me.
achara No. This, this is against my people.
achara There will be consequences, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard There always are.
alex_rousseau No, you shouldn't be here. Just stand back. Don't say anything.
tom_friendly Alex. Jack! What the hell did you bring him here for?!!
isabel Let him go, Tom. What's going on, Alex?
alex_rousseau This is from Ben.
isabel Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence. Execution is off the table. He says the rules don't apply. He has, however, ordered her to be marked.
dr_jack_shephard Where you going?!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, I know you. I'm Achara's friend from -- Chet, from the restaurant. Let go of me, man.
chet You will get off our beach!! You will leave this country!! Do you understand me?!
dr_juliet_burke I heard you only liked them grilled.
dr_jack_shephard I miss the toothpicks, too. Let me see.
dr_juliet_burke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard They mark you? Let me see it?
dr_jack_shephard Break a branch off that aloe plant over there...
dr_juliet_burke It's okay, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Please, please do it. Turn around.
dr_juliet_burke Why did you help me?
dr_jack_shephard He told you he was going to let you go home. He told me the same thing. We're going to make sure he keeps his word.
dr_juliet_burke And how are we going to do that?
dr_jack_shephard Together.
dr_juliet_burke They'll be coming for you in a few minutes. All of them. Your friends know where we are so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live.
dr_jack_shephard Go where?
dr_juliet_burke Well, Ben calls it home.
kate_austen Where's Karl?
james_ford I let him go.
kate_austen You what?!
james_ford I let him go.
kate_austen He could have led us back to where they live.
james_ford What, you think I cut him loose because I'm so damn sensitive? The kid's a target! Ben ain't never going to stop looking for him so as long--
kate_austen All Ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible.
james_ford Let's get back to camp. Well, are you coming, or not?
kate_austen Should I walk beside you, or ten paces behind you? You've gotten so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore.
james_ford Don't take it out on me because you feel guilty.
kate_austen I don't feel guilty.
james_ford The hell you don't.
kate_austen We had to leave Jack behind. I didn't have a choice.
james_ford I'm not talking about leaving Jack behind. I'm talking about you and me. I know you did it because you thought I was a dead man. So don't beat yourself up because the Doc's left behind.
kate_austen I'm not beating myself up.
james_ford Of course you're not. So, now that we got that out of the way, let's go.
isabel "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us." Your tattoos -- that's what they say.
dr_jack_shephard That's what they say. It's not what they mean.
