dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
dr_jack_shephard Welcome back.
john_locke I know you...
dr_jack_shephard We were on the same flight back from Sydney. I met you in the baggage claim office, you had lost your knives. I'm Jack Shephard.
john_locke What happened?
dr_jack_shephard You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery.
john_locke Am I... am I alright?
dr_jack_shephard Your dural sac ruptured, but I think I got everything back where it belongs.
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke, while I was operating I got a look at the initial injury to your spine, the one that put you in a wheelchair. And... I was hoping you could tell me how that happened.
john_locke Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because I think you're a candidate.
john_locke A candidate for what?
dr_jack_shephard A new procedure. A surgery we're developing. And if it works it could restore feeling to your legs. In fact, you may even walk again. If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke, I think that... that I could fix you.
john_locke No. Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard Now, there's minimal risk, and the benefit--
john_locke I said no, doctor.
helen_norwood John?
helen_norwood Oh John, this is the first time they let me see you. Are you okay?
john_locke I'm fine.
helen_norwood Are you his doctor?
dr_jack_shephard Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.
helen_norwood Thank you.
helen_norwood Thank you. Thank you for saving him. Thank you.
sayid_jarrah Welcome to Hydra Island. At least you didn't have to paddle.
seamus Get in.
james_ford Uh-uh. No way I'm getting back in those cages.
seamus Well I've got the gun, so you--
james_ford Not anymore, doughboy.
charles_widmore Drop the gun! Put the gun down or I'll kill her!
james_ford You ain't gonna kill anybody. Otherwise you wouldn't be throwin' us in a cage.
charles_widmore I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it. As are Reyes and the Kwons. Kate Austen? She's not. It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies.
kate_austen Don't listen to him.
charles_widmore You may not believe it, but I'm doing this for your own good.
james_ford You're right. I don't believe it.
charles_widmore Is the fence live yet?
paul They're saying about an hour...
charles_widmore We haven't got an hour! Tell them to work faster! He's coming...
dr_jack_shephard Hello?
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me? Hello?
bernard_nadler Oh!
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. There was no one out front and I heard the drill... do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?
bernard_nadler Well, you can find him right here. And, if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard.
dr_jack_shephard Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard Um, I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian, and I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files.
bernard_nadler And which patient would that be?
dr_jack_shephard His name's John Locke, and our records said that you had done some emergency oral surgery on him about three years back.
bernard_nadler And what are you looking for exactly?
dr_jack_shephard I want to know how he was hurt.
bernard_nadler Do you mind if I ask you why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Um... he and I met about a week ago. We were on the same flight back from Australia--
bernard_nadler Oceanic 815.
bernard_nadler I sat across the aisle from you. If memory serves, you were flirting with my wife, Rose, while I was in the bathroom. It's pretty weird, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
bernard_nadler Well, then maybe you're on to something here, hmm? Now, I can't break patient confidentiality and tell you something I shouldn't... but I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke, there was another man in the same accident with him.
dr_jack_shephard That was three years ago... you just remember that?
bernard_nadler Of course I do, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Anthony Cooper...
bernard_nadler Good luck, doc. I hope you find what you're looking for.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
sayid_jarrah There was a mortar attack. Widmore's people fired on us. Locke saved you.
dr_jack_shephard What about the rest of your group? What happened to them?
sayid_jarrah The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle. It's just the three of us now.
dr_jack_shephard Why did he bring me here?
john_locke Because your friends got themselves captured. And now we're going to have to rescue them.
dr_jack_shephard Rescue them from what?
john_locke Widmore has them in a cage about half a mile inland.
dr_jack_shephard Why would he--
john_locke You know, I would ask him, except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer. But I can't imagine that his intentions are good. If we move right now, we can break your people out, run for the plane, and be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him.
dr_jack_shephard They're not my people. And I'm not leaving the Island.
john_locke Well Jack, I'm hoping you still change your mind about that. But your friends do want to leave. And since they just ran away from me, on my own boat, I'm gonna need your help convincing them that they can trust me.
dr_jack_shephard Why should I trust you?
john_locke Because I could kill you, Jack. Right here. Right now. And I could kill every single one of your friends. And there's not a thing that you could do to stop me. But instead of killing you, I saved your life. And now I want to save them too. So will you help me?
james_ford Feel like we're running in circles? Back in these cages... except last time the gun was to my head.
kate_austen He wouldn't have killed me, James.
james_ford That cave I told you about... where all the names were written... your name was there too. But it was crossed out. He doesn't need you, Kate.
jinsoo_kwon So she's with your mother?
sunhwa_kwon Yes. You saw her pictures? How?
jinsoo_kwon Widmore's people found your camera on the plane. He showed me the pictures. Our daughter... she's so beautiful.
sunhwa_kwon I have your ring.
frank_lapidus Uh-oh...
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 What happened?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 Somebody shut it down? What's going on?
paul Somebody killed the power.
seamus Get a team to that generator now!
hugo_reyes And we're dead...
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 Go, go, go.
seamus Ahh!
kate_austen I think I can reach the keys!
hugo_reyes Hurry! When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us!
frank_lapidus Well, I ain't waitin'!
kate_austen Uh, damn it!
kate_austen What are you doing here?
dr_jack_shephard I'm with him. Come on.
dr_jack_shephard How much further to the plane?
frank_lapidus Say about a quarter mile. Just over that ridge.
kate_austen So you're coming with us now?
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to take you to the plane but I'm not getting on it. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm... I'm not meant to go.
james_ford Thanks for comin' back for us, doc. Appreciate it.
dr_jack_shephard No, it's okay! Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators.
james_ford Great. The more the merrier.
sayid_jarrah We need to go. Locke's waiting.
nurse Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, no. No I'm not. But--
nurse May I ask the nature of the visit?
dr_jack_shephard Um...
helen_norwood Dr. Shephard?
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
helen_norwood What are you doing here?
dr_jack_shephard Um... I'm here to see Anthony Cooper. Do you know him? Is that why you're here too?
helen_norwood What do you want with Anthony?
dr_jack_shephard I want to talk to him about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke.
helen_norwood Uh... Dr. Shephard... just go.
dr_jack_shephard Look, all I want to do is help him.
helen_norwood I know. John told me about the operation. He doesn't want it.
dr_jack_shephard Why doesn't he want it?
helen_norwood Please Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone. You saved John's life. Why can't that be enough?
dr_jack_shephard Because it's not.
helen_norwood Hi.
helen_norwood This is Anthony Cooper. He's John's father.
wheeler Hey! Stop! Stop right there!
frank_lapidus Alrighty... let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly.
james_ford Son of a bitch!
sayid_jarrah His neck's been broken.
john_locke That's because I broke it. If it's any consolation, Widmore knew that I would kill these men.
james_ford What are you talkin' about?
john_locke They were only guarding the plane for show. If Charles had really wanted to keep me from actually getting on board he wouldn't have moved his little fences.
hugo_reyes Well... wait, now he wants us to leave the Island?
john_locke No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place at the same time... a nice confined space we have no hope of getting out of... and then he wants to kill us.
james_ford Kill us with what?
john_locke With this.
john_locke Four bricks of C-4. I found them in one of the overheard compartments, wired to the electrical system of the plane. If we would've turned it on... boom.
jinsoo_kwon So what now?
john_locke We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane. It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island, I think we have to take the submarine.
james_ford Well that's what I've been saying all along.
hugo_reyes Dude, wait... he's not supposed to leave the island. I mean, Alpert said that--
james_ford Screw Alpert. He ain't here.
james_ford That's twice you've saved our asses. Guess I was wrong about you.
john_locke Thank you, James.
john_locke That submarine is gonna be heavily defended. We're gonna need everyone.
dr_jack_shephard I'll help you but, like I said, I'm not going with you.
john_locke Fair enough. Let's go.
claire_littleton Hey... I'm sorry I--
john_locke It's alright, Claire. I understand why you went with them.
james_ford Hey doc, listen up... you don't wanna leave this island, that's your own damn business. But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. I don't trust that thing one bit, so here's what I need you to do... once we get to the dock, you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.
dr_jack_shephard How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there.
james_ford Just get it in the water, I'll take care of the rest.
john_locke
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 CT test to Trauma 3. CT test to Trauma 3.
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke, are you awake?
john_locke Push the button.
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
john_locke I wish you had believed me.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 Excuse me?
dr_jack_shephard Miss Littleton.
claire_littleton Dr. Shepard. I--I was just looking for you. The, um, the lawyer told me you were here.
claire_littleton Um, c-can we talk?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. Yes.
claire_littleton Oh, no. I'm okay.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, I had to run out of the will-reading the other day, but I did have an emergency, and...
claire_littleton Oh, no worries. Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me. Never even met this man.
claire_littleton Anyway, the, uh, lawyer gave me this. She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come, but that my father especially wanted me to have this.
claire_littleton Do you know why or what it's suppose to mean?
dr_jack_shephard I have no idea; but, then... I--I didn't know about you either.
claire_littleton Our father, uh... you mind, you mind if I ask how he died?
dr_jack_shephard He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney. He drank himself to death. I flew down to bring his body back... but then, uh... the airline lost it.
claire_littleton I just flew in from Sydney a few days ago.
dr_jack_shephard When?
claire_littleton Uh, last Wednesday?
dr_jack_shephard Oceanic Flight 815?
claire_littleton Uh, yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Do you mind if I have a look at that?
claire_littleton Uh, sure, go ahead.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. I--I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this.
claire_littleton Yeah, me, too. Well, um. It was nice seeing you again. Thanks for trying to help.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you staying?
claire_littleton Uh, just down the road...motel.
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you come stay with me?
claire_littleton Stay with you? I mean, we're...we're strangers.
dr_jack_shephard No, we're not strangers. We're...we're family.
james_ford Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock, doesn't mean they ain't on the sub. We’re goin' in hard. Got it? Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun--you're with me. The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us. You think you two can get our backs?
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely.
james_ford All right. Let's go home.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode14 After engine room, power the bilges. After engine room, power the bilges, please.
james_ford Where's the damn captain?
james_ford Put your damn hands up.
frank_lapidus Nothin' personal.
james_ford Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up?
frank_lapidus I got it.
kate_austen Let's go.
john_locke You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm sure.
john_locke Whoever told you, you needed to stay had no idea what he was talking about.
dr_jack_shephard John Locke told me I needed to stay.
kate_austen What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Kate?!
kate_austen Ahh.
sayid_jarrah Claire, let's go now!
james_ford What's going on up there? What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Widmore's people shot her. Hurley, I need a first aid kit.
james_ford Who else is up there?
sayid_jarrah Claire.
james_ford Claire!
john_locke James!
james_ford Lapidus, if you can hear me...DIVE! DIVE!
frank_lapidus Let's go!
claire_littleton Hey! Wait! Wait!
john_locke Claire! Claire! Wait!
dr_jack_shephard What the hell are you doing?
james_ford What we came here to do...leaving.
john_locke It's alright. It's alright.
claire_littleton No! They're leaving us.
john_locke No trust me. You don't want to be on that sub.
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
kate_austen Claire? Where's Claire?
dr_jack_shephard She's still up there.
kate_austen No, we can't leave without her...we can't...
dr_jack_shephard "Kate..." or "Okay".
james_ford Is she gonna be okay?
hugo_reyes Jack, can't find first-aid kit, dude.
dr_jack_shephard Jin--my pack. There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure. It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be alright.
jinsoo_kwon Here. Can you help her?
dr_jack_shephard I think the bullet went straight through...
james_ford What?
hugo_reyes Dude, where did that come from?
dr_jack_shephard Locke. We did exactly what he wanted.
dr_jack_shephard We have to get to the surface.
james_ford What the hell?
dr_jack_shephard We have to get to the surface now!
jinsoo_kwon Lapidus, take us up.
frank_lapidus We're divin'!
jinsoo_kwon Just do it!
frank_lapidus You heard him. Up!
hugo_reyes Dude how'd that get on the sub?
dr_jack_shephard Locke put it in my pack.
jinsoo_kwon Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us?
james_ford Damn right he did, that's why I shut his ass out.
dr_jack_shephard He wanted you to shut him out. Any idea how that thing works? Can we turn it off?
sayid_jarrah This watch is jury-rigged to the battery. The battery detonates the explosives.
james_ford How much time till we're up, Frank?
frank_lapidus At least 5 minutes.
james_ford We ain't got 5 minutes. What's it gonna be Sayid?
sayid_jarrah These wires--they're leads from the watch. If we disconnect them from the battery, technically speaking, the bomb should be inert.
james_ford Technically?
sayid_jarrah Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously; and, I'm not sure...
james_ford Step aside.
dr_jack_shephard Wait! Wait!
james_ford What the hell are you doin', doc?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing's gonna happen.
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard Don't pull those wires out. We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen.
james_ford If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.
dr_jack_shephard No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.
hugo_reyes Uh...what?
dr_jack_shephard This is what he wanted. This is what he's been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all in the same place, at the same time--a nice, enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out of.
jinsoo_kwon I don't understand.
dr_jack_shephard Locke said that he can't leave the island without us. I think that he can't leave the island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill anyone of us whenever he wanted. So, what if he hasn't because he's...he's not allowed to. What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
james_ford Stay out of my way, doc.
dr_jack_shephard Now if he wanted that thing to blow up, why would he put a timer in it? Why not just throw it inside?
james_ford I don't care.
dr_jack_shephard Nothing is gonna happen.
james_ford It's not your decision to make.
dr_jack_shephard He can't kill us!
james_ford I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!
dr_jack_shephard James. We are going to be okay. Just have to trust me.
james_ford Sorry, doc, I don't.
sayid_jarrah Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island, half mile south from the camp we just left. Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead, which means you're going to need him. Do you understand me?
dr_jack_shephard Why are you telling me this?
sayid_jarrah Because it's going to be you, Jack.
hugo_reyes Sayid!
frank_lapidus Ah, hell!
dr_jack_shephard Are you okay?
hugo_reyes What happened? Did Sayid just...?
sunhwa_kwon Help!
jinsoo_kwon Wait! Hold on. I'll get you out...Sawyer! I need help!
james_ford Jin!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! Hurley! You gotta take Kate out of here.
hugo_reyes What about everybody else?
dr_jack_shephard I'll take care of them!
hugo_reyes I have to go after Sayid!
dr_jack_shephard There is no Sayid! Listen to me. Take this tank and buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole is, okay? Hurley, you can do this, okay?
hugo_reyes Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Go!
sunhwa_kwon 너무 아파!
james_ford Doc! Push.
jinsoo_kwon On three.
all@ One... two... three...
jinsoo_kwon Sawyer! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer! Sawyer!
sunhwa_kwon Jin... Go!
jinsoo_kwon No.
sunhwa_kwon Save yourself.
jinsoo_kwon I'm going to get you out of here. Go. Go. I'll get her free.
dr_jack_shephard No, we can do this!
jinsoo_kwon Just go! Save Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard Jin take this. I can get him out without it.
jinsoo_kwon No, you can't Jack. Just go! Go.
jinsoo_kwon Ahh...Uhhh
sunhwa_kwon Jin. You have to go.
jinsoo_kwon No. I can do this.
sunhwa_kwon No. No, you can't. Please go.
jinsoo_kwon I won't leave you.
jinsoo_kwon I'm gonna get you out of here.
sunhwa_kwon Go... Please! Go.
jinsoo_kwon 당신하고 같이 있을게. 다시는 떠나지 않을거야. I love you, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon I love you.
orderly Is somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke
john_locke Yes, my fiancée, Helen. She's, um... ...probably stuck in traffic... Hey, I'll take it from here. I'm pretty good at this.
orderly Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
john_locke Thank you. See ya.
dr_jack_shephard Mr. Locke. I'm glad I caught ya. I hadn't have a chance to say goodbye yet.
john_locke Well, goodbye..and thanks again, Dr. Shepherd.
dr_jack_shephard I went to see your father.
john_locke W-what?
dr_jack_shephard When you didn't want the surgery, I felt like I had to understand why...and, uh, I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair, that maybe...
john_locke I was in a plane crash. I had my-my private pilot's license for a week, and, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger. He was terrified of flying. But, I looked him right in the eye--I told him that he could trust me. And we barely got off the ground. I still don't re--I don't remember what I did wrong, but it was my fault. It was my fault. This man, who I loved more than anything, will never walk, or talk or...
dr_jack_shephard You know, the first time you and I met, uh, back at the--at the airport...you told me that my father was gone, and, uh, it hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right. Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.
john_locke Uh, no, no, he's not.
dr_jack_shephard Yes, he--he is, and you can punish yourself as much as you want and that's never gonna bring him back. What happened, happened...and...you can let it go.
john_locke What makes you think letting go is so easy?
dr_jack_shephard It's not. In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself. And, that's why I was hoping that…maybe you could go first.
john_locke Goodbye, Dr. Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard I can help you, John...I wish you believed me.
kate_austen Jack...I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you.
hugo_reyes Is he okay?
dr_jack_shephard He got hit in the head pretty hard, but he's breathing.
kate_austen What about Jin and Sun?
john_locke It sunk.
claire_littleton What, the submarine? But, they-they were all on it, everyone... What? Th-they're all dead?
john_locke Not all of them.
claire_littleton Wait. W-where are you going?
john_locke To finish what I started.
