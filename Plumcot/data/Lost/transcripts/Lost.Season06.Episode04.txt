john_locke Oh, come on...
helen_norwood John?
helen_norwood Are you okay?
john_locke Yeah... I'm fine.
helen_norwood Come on, let's... let's get you inside.
john_locke Okay.
helen_norwood Well how long will that take?
helen_norwood The wedding is in October. Look, I'm just gonna have to call you back. Yeah.
helen_norwood I am so sick of caterers... and bands and... picking fabrics for chair backs. What do you say we just get my parents and your dad and do it shotgun style in Vegas?
john_locke No, you deserve better than that, Helen. We can do this. I know we can.
john_locke I like... this one.
helen_norwood That one?
john_locke I meant this one.
helen_norwood You are a very sweet man.
john_locke I know.
helen_norwood So? How was the conference?
john_locke Boring.
helen_norwood Who's uh... who's Dr. Jack Shephard?
john_locke Oh. I met him at lost luggage when I went to fill out the forms. He... he lost something too.
helen_norwood He's a spinal surgeon?
john_locke Yeah. Nice guy. He offered me a free consult.
helen_norwood You should call him.
john_locke Aw, he was just bein' polite, Helen.
helen_norwood So what? I mean... what are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon? I mean, who knows? Maybe it's destiny.
john_locke Maybe it is.
john_locke Alright, Richard. Time to talk.
randy Welcome back, Colonel. Wow. You got a nice tan in Australia. Did you miss us?
john_locke Sure I did, Randy.
randy So? How was the conference, John?
john_locke It was okay. I didn't really learn anything.
randy No?
john_locke But um... I made some good contacts, though.
randy Really? That's interesting. See uh... Ken Fisher called and said you had to cancel your lunch with him.
john_locke Right, right... I was a little under the weather that day. Probably jet lag.
randy Really? 'Cause then the seminar people called and said you hadn't picked up your credentials. I did some checking... and it seems you didn't attend a single event. Since we sent you to Sydney on the company's dime... where the hell were you?
john_locke Look, Randy... I'm really sorry. Why don't we just call it my vacation week?
randy I thought you wanted that vacation week in October. You know, for your wedding.
john_locke Please, Randy... look, I know I shouldn't have lied. But where I was... it's personal. And I... and I really don't want to talk about it.
randy Okay, John. Hey... you're fired.
john_locke Thirsty?
john_locke Richard, I'm sorry I hit you in the throat and dragged you off the beach but I had to do something.
richard_alpert What do you want?
john_locke What I've always wanted. For you to come with me.
richard_alpert Why do you look like John Locke?
john_locke I knew he'd get me access to Jacob. Because John's a candidate. Or at least he was a candidate...
richard_alpert What do you mean? What do you mean a candidate?
john_locke Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
richard_alpert Any of what?
john_locke Oh, Richard... I'm sorry. You mean, you've been doing everything he told you all this time and he never said why?
john_locke I would never have done that to you. I would never have kept you in the dark.
richard_alpert And what would you have done?
john_locke I would have treated you with respect. Come with me... and I promise I will tell you everything.
richard_alpert No.
john_locke Are you sure about that, Richard? Because people seldom get a second chance...
richard_alpert I'm not going anywhere with you.
john_locke Alright, I'll--
richard_alpert What?
john_locke I'll be seeing you, Richard. Sooner than you think.
ben_linus Am I interrupting?
ilana_verdansky Tell me what happened to them.
ben_linus Alright. But there's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me...
ilana_verdansky Try me.
ben_linus John Locke killed them.
ilana_verdansky All by himself?
ben_linus Yes. He turned into a pillar of black smoke and killed them right before my eyes.
ilana_verdansky Did he kill Jacob as well?
ben_linus Yes...
ilana_verdansky Then where's his body?
ben_linus Locke kicked him into the fire and he burned away.
ben_linus Locke... do you know why he carried Richard into the jungle?
ilana_verdansky He's recruiting.
john_locke Hello, James.
james_ford I thought you were dead.
john_locke I am.
james_ford Here's to being dead.
john_locke You're taking this extremely well.
james_ford Taking what extremely well?
john_locke That I'm here.
james_ford I don't give a damn if you're dead. Or time travellin' or... the ghost of Christmas past. All I care about is this whiskey. So bottoms up! Get the hell out of my house.
john_locke This isn't your house, James.
james_ford The hell it ain't...
john_locke No. You just lived here for awhile. This was never your house.
james_ford Who are you? 'Cause you sure as hell ain't John Locke.
john_locke What makes you say that?
james_ford 'Cause Locke was scared. Even when he was pretendin' he wasn't. But you? You ain't scared.
john_locke What if I told you I was the person who could answer the most important question in the world?
james_ford And what question is that?
john_locke Why are you on this island?
james_ford I'm on this island because my plane crashed. Because my raft blew up. Because the helicopter I was on was ridin' one too heavy.
john_locke That's not why you're here. And if you come with me, I can prove it.
james_ford Well, I guess I better put some pants on.
john_locke Okay! Okay!
john_locke Come on!
hugo_reyes Dude! Dude! What are you doin'?
john_locke What am I doin'? What the hell are you doin'? Did you ever park a car in your life? You're practically in my spot!
hugo_reyes I'm sorry...
john_locke Yeah...
hugo_reyes But... you know, there's a handicapped spot right over here.
john_locke Yeah? Yeah, okay... but I don't have to park there! I can park anywhere I want! You need to stay inside the lines!
hugo_reyes I'm really sorry. They were supposed to reserve a spot for me, so... you know, I just... parked here.
john_locke I haven't seen you before. Do you work here?
hugo_reyes Actually, I own the company.
hugo_reyes Hugo Reyes.
john_locke John Locke.
hugo_reyes Cool. What do you do here, John?
john_locke Actually... nothing. My boss just fired me.
hugo_reyes Oh? Who's your boss?
john_locke His name is Randy. But uh--
hugo_reyes Randy Nations?
john_locke Yeah.
hugo_reyes Yeah... that guy is a huge douche. Want me to talk to him for you?
john_locke No. That's okay...
hugo_reyes Tell you what, John. I own a temp agency too...
hugo_reyes Call this number and tell them that Hugo said to hook you up with a new job, pronto.
hugo_reyes And chin up. Things are gonna work out.
frank_lapidus He's gettin' pretty ripe!
ilana_verdansky Where is everybody?
sunhwa_kwon They left. They said they were going to the temple.
ilana_verdansky Right now, that's the safest place on the island. We should go there too.
sunhwa_kwon Are you alright?
ilana_verdansky I'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here!
sunhwa_kwon What makes you think that I'm going with you?
ilana_verdansky Because... you want to find Jin.
sunhwa_kwon What do you know about my husband?
ilana_verdansky I know that if he's on the island... and if he's alive... then he'll be at the temple. Let's get moving!
sunhwa_kwon What about John? We need to bury him.
john_locke What were you doing alone in that house, James?
james_ford Drinkin'.
john_locke Where are the rest of your friends?
james_ford Some temple somewhere...
john_locke Why aren't you with 'em?
james_ford You know what? How 'bout we just don't talk?
john_locke You got it.
james_ford Who the hell's that?
john_locke You can see him?
james_ford The kid? Hell yeah I can see him.
john_locke Hey!
teenage_boy You know the rules. You can't kill him.
john_locke Don't tell me what I can't do...
john_locke Don't tell me what I can't do!
james_ford Locke! Locke! Look, whoever you are, you got about twenty seconds and then I'm outta here!
richard_alpert Where is he?
james_ford What the hell are you doin' here?
richard_alpert Where is he?
james_ford Locke? He ran off into the jungle after some kid.
richard_alpert We need to go! Now!
james_ford Go where?
richard_alpert To the temple! Let's go! Let's go!
james_ford You know what? I've been to the temple and I think I'm stickin' with Locke.
richard_alpert That man is not John Locke!
james_ford I know.
richard_alpert Then why are you with him?
james_ford Because he's got answers. He says he knows why I'm on this island. Unless you wanna tell me why I'm here, Richard...
richard_alpert Don't be naive! He's not gonna tell you anthing, he's gonna kill you!
james_ford If he wanted to kill me he could have done it a dozen times already...
richard_alpert You don't understand what you're dealing with! He doesn't just want you dead, he wants everyone dead! Everyone you care about! All of 'em! And he won't stop--
john_locke Who were you talking to?
james_ford Nobody. You ever catch up to the kid?
john_locke What kid?
james_ford Right... let's get on with it, shall we?
john_locke Yes, James. Let's get on with it.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
john_locke Excuse me?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
john_locke What uh... I don't know what that has to do with--
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Just say whatever comes to mind.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Would you describe yourself as a people person?
john_locke May I speak to your supervisor?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Of course. I'll go get her.
rose_nadler Good morning, mister... Locke?
john_locke Yeah.
rose_nadler I'm Rose Nadler, the office supervisor. What can I do for you?
john_locke Uh... what you can do, Mrs. Nadler, is spare me the questions about what kind of animal I am and hopefully place me in a job.
rose_nadler Absolutely. What kind of placement are you looking for?
john_locke Well, I see here that you have a listing for a site coordinator...
rose_nadler Construction site coordinator. Uh... I'm not sure that's a good match.
john_locke Well, if experience is the issue, I have--
rose_nadler Experience isn't the issue.
john_locke Look... Mr. Reyes told me if I came down here I would be taken care of.
rose_nadler And Mr. Reyes is my boss, so if he said that, I can make it happen for you. If you want to work construction, you got it.
john_locke Thank you.
rose_nadler I'm not finished. I will send you down there tomorrow and then, the day after, you will be back in my office. Look, Mr. Locke... let's try to be a little more realistic.
john_locke And what do you know about realistic?
rose_nadler I have cancer. Terminal cancer.
john_locke I'm sorry...
rose_nadler When the doctors first told me, I had a hard time accepting it. But eventually... I got past the denial part. And I got back to living whatever life I've got left. So, how about we find you a job you can do?
james_ford Do you read?
john_locke Excuse me?
james_ford Books. Do you read books?
john_locke Sure. Who doesn't?
james_ford My favorite's Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men. You know that one?
john_locke Nope. A little after my time...
james_ford It's about these two guys, George and Lennie. Lennie's kinda slow... causin' George problems... so George walks him into the woods and tells him to look out yonder and picture the pretty little house they're gonna live in some day. Then he shoots Lennie in the back of the head.
john_locke Well that doesn't sound like a happy ending.
james_ford It ain't.
john_locke What's on your mind, James?
james_ford I'm wonderin' what would happen to you if I put a bullet in your head.
john_locke Why don't we find out?
james_ford What are you?
john_locke What I am is trapped. And I've been trapped for so long that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before I was trapped, I was a man, James. Just like you.
james_ford I'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
john_locke You can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... to feel pain, anger, fear... to experience betrayal. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. So if you wanna shoot me, shoot me. But you're so close, James. It would be such a shame to turn back now.
ben_linus Why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?
ilana_verdansky Because the people there need to see the face of what they're up against.
ben_linus And whats to stop what they're up against from changing his face?
ilana_verdansky He can't; not anymore. Hes stuck this way.
ilana_verdansky Does anyone want to say anything?
ilana_verdansky Didn't any of you know him?
ben_linus Alright, I knew him. John Locke was a...a believer, he was a man of faith, he was... a much better man than I will ever be. And I'm very sorry I murdered him.
frank_lapidus Weirdest damn funeral I've ever been to.
WOMEN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Hello, Dr. Shephard's office?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Hello? Can I help you?
john_locke No, no you can't.
helen_norwood Who was that on the phone?
john_locke No one.
helen_norwood No one? John, I just heard you talking on the phone.
john_locke I was uh, I was calling Dr. Shephard.
helen_norwood Good for you. When are you going to see him?
john_locke I'm not going to see him.
helen_norwood Well, uh, I don't understand, why wouldn't you-
john_locke I got fired, Helen.
helen_norwood Coming!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Ma'am, Oceanic courier. Delivering your lost luggage. Sign here to accept the delivery.
helen_norwood Thanks.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Okay, thanks.
helen_norwood Okay, John. Talk to me. How did you get fired?
john_locke I lied to Randy, I didn't go to the conferences in Sydney.
helen_norwood What?
john_locke Open the case, Helen.
helen_norwood What are these for?
john_locke My walkabout.
helen_norwood Your, your what?
john_locke My walkabout. An adventure in the outback. Man against nature. But they wouldn't let me go. And I sat there yelling at them. Shouting at them that they couldn't tell me what I can't do. But they were right. I'm sick of imagining of what my life could be out of this chair, Helen. What it would be like to walk down the isle with you because its not gonna happen. So if you need me to see more doctors, have more consults, if you need me to get out of this chair, I don't blame you. But I don't want you to spend your life waiting for a miracle because there is no such thing.
helen_norwood There are miracles, John. And the only thing I was ever waiting for was you.
james_ford Nice view. Now what?
john_locke Now we go down.
james_ford Down where?
john_locke Down there.
james_ford No offense, but you already died. So this is great that this isn't a big deal for you. But if you think I'm climbing down there first, your off your damn mind.
john_locke It's no problem, I'll go first.
john_locke Coming, James?!
john_locke James!
james_ford Locke!
john_locke Hold on, come on. Come on, I got you, come on. Come on. Come on.
james_ford What is this place?
james_ford What the hell's that all about?
john_locke Inside joke.
james_ford So this is what you wanted me to see? A hole in the cliff; with some rocks on a scale; that's why I'm here?
john_locke No.
john_locke That's why you're here.
john_locke That, James, is why you're all here.
john_locke Alright, speed it up, all the way. No cheating, come on now. Come on, all the way, you can catch up. Bring it in, bring it in, all the way. Good job. Good job.
john_locke Alright, everyone, please open your textbooks to chapter four. Today, we are going to talk about... the Human reproductive system.
john_locke Do you know where the- Excuse me, can you tell me where the teacher's lounge is?
school_kid Yeah, its over there.
john_locke Thank you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode04 Alright, I know I sound like a broken record, but how many times do we have to go over this? If you have the last cup of coffee, you remove the filter and throw it away. Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.
john_locke Actually, I was just hoping for some Earl Grey.
ben_linus Tea? Now there's a gentleman drink. I don't believe we met.
ben_linus Ben Linus, European History.
john_locke John Locke, Substitute.
ben_linus Well, welcome.
james_ford Who wrote all this?
john_locke His name was Jacob.
james_ford Was Jacob?
john_locke He died yesterday.
james_ford You don't seem to upset about it?
john_locke I'm not.
james_ford Why are all the names crossed out?
john_locke There not all crossed out.
james_ford "Shephard". That Jack Shephard?
john_locke He's not the only one.
james_ford Reyes. That's Hugo, right?
james_ford What's the eight about?
john_locke Jacob had a thing for numbers. Sixteen, Jarrah.
john_locke Forty-Two, Kwon; I don't know if it's Sun or if it's Jin.
john_locke Here, four, Locke. I think we both know him.
john_locke Last but not least, number 15, Ford.
john_locke That would be you.
james_ford Why would he write my name on this wall? I never even met the guy.
john_locke Oh no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.
john_locke At some point in your life, James, probably when you were young and miserable and vulnerable. He came to you, he manipulated you, pulled your strings like you were a puppet. And as a result, choices you thought were made, were never really choices at all. He was pushing you, James. Pushing you... to the Island.
james_ford Why the hell would he do that?
john_locke Because, you're a candidate.
james_ford Candidate for what?
john_locke He thought he was the protector of this place. And you, James, have been nominated to take that job.
james_ford And what does that mean?
john_locke It means you have three choices. First, you can do nothing and see how all this plays out. And possibly, your name will get crossed out.
john_locke Second option. You can accept the job. Become the new Jacob. And protect the Island.
james_ford Protect it from what?
john_locke From nothing, James. That's the joke, there is nothing to protect it from, its just a damn Island. And it will be perfectly fine without Jacob or you, or any of the other people; whose lives he wasted.
james_ford You said there were three choices?
john_locke The third choice, James, is that we just go. We just get the hell off this Island. We never look back.
james_ford How do we do that?
john_locke Together. So what do you say, James? Are you ready to go home?
james_ford Hell yes.
