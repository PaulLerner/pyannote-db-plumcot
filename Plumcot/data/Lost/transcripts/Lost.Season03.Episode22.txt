KID#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Mom! Mom! Mom!
MOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Help!!!
KID#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Mom!
dr_jack_shephard You have everything you need?
sayid_jarrah No, but I made the best out of what we have.
dr_jack_shephard Bernard and Jin?
sayid_jarrah They're both excellent shots... and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. Jack, no matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving; keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. I understand.
sayid_jarrah And good luck.
dr_jack_shephard You too.
rose_nadler If I told you that I'd help you with your SOS sign, would you change your mind?
bernard_nadler No ma'am.
rose_nadler Then I want you to say it again.
bernard_nadler Rose—
rose_nadler Say it, Bernard.
bernard_nadler I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.
rose_nadler And don't you forget it.
hugo_reyes Charlie's gonna be fine.
claire_littleton Yeah. 'Course he is.
jinsoo_kwon 잭 옆에서 떨어지지 말고, 피곤하면 꼭 쉬어라.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨... 왜 이러는 거에요?
jinsoo_kwon Because...we have to go home.
dr_jack_shephard All right. Let's do it.
naomi_dorrit Jack. Can I ask you a question?
dr_jack_shephard Sure.
naomi_dorrit What did you do for a living before you became Moses?
dr_jack_shephard I was a doctor.
naomi_dorrit Right, course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.
naomi_dorrit Is she OK?
dr_jack_shephard Why wouldn't she be?
naomi_dorrit Because none of your people trusts her. No offense.
dr_juliet_burke You know what, why don't you catch up to me when you're done.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet...
dr_juliet_burke It's fine.
naomi_dorrit So, I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat.
dr_jack_shephard OK. Show me.
naomi_dorrit It's actually simple. You turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep, and say hello.
dr_jack_shephard And that's it?
naomi_dorrit That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption's jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah?
dr_jack_shephard Hopefully.
bonnie Who are you?
greta Look, if you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you.
charlie_pace I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it?
greta Hey! Take it easy.
bonnie Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here, huh? How did you find out about this station?
charlie_pace Juliet told us. She's one of us now. In case you haven't heard.
greta Stop. We gotta call Ben.
charlie_pace Oh yeah. Let's call Ben.
bonnie Come on.
desmond_hume You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch...
desmond_hume ... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown.
bonnie Come in. Come in, Ben.
ben_linus Hello?
bonnie Ben, it's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me, Ben?
ben_linus Why are you breaking radio silence?
bonnie One of them's down here.
ben_linus I'm sorry, what?!
bonnie We have him tied up, but he's here. One of them swam down here.
ben_linus Who? Which one?
bonnie He won't tell us.
charlie_pace It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!
ben_linus How did... how does he know about the station?
bonnie He said Juliet told them.
ben_linus All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help. Mikhail, you need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.
mikhail_bakunin You told us The Looking Glass was inoperable. Flooded.
ben_linus I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now.
mikhail_bakunin I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass, what else did she tell them?
ben_linus Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?
ryan_pryce Your walkies all off?
tom_friendly Yes, sir.
ryan_pryce Did you get a good look?
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 OTHER The tents are marked with white coral, three of 'em. Juliet did her job.
ryan_pryce All right, let's do this.
FEMALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 OTHER It's empty!
ryan_pryce Get away from the tent!
ryan_pryce It's a trap! Move!
bernard_nadler Please, God.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 OTHER Tree line!
ryan_pryce I got your man! Drop your weapons!
ryan_pryce I got your man!
ryan_pryce It's over!
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 OTHER Don't. Finger off the trigger.
[Miles#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 away, the main group watch the smoke rise from the beach.
rose_nadler There were supposed to be THREE explosions.
kate_austen It didn't work.
TANNOY#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Doctor Leon to surgery, Doctor Leon to surgery.
DOCTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 There you go. Good as new.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
DOCTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 The news people are waiting for you outside. You being a hero and all.
dr_jack_shephard Right. The woman, how is she?
DOCTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 She's been stabilized. Thank god you were on that bridge.
dr_jack_shephard Right.
DOCTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Sorry, no visitors in ER.
dr_jack_shephard It's OK. She... we used to be married.
DOCTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Come on in.
sarah_shephard What happened?
dr_jack_shephard We saw... a car accident.
sarah_shephard Are you OK?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
sarah_shephard Are you drinking again?
dr_jack_shephard No.
sarah_shephard Are you, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No. Why did you come down here, Sarah?
sarah_shephard Erm, I'm still your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at two o'clock in the morning?
dr_jack_shephard You think maybe you could give me a lift home?
sarah_shephard I don't think that would be appropriate.
dr_jack_shephard Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah.
sarah_shephard Goodbye, Jack.
sunhwa_kwon Why were there only two explosions?
dr_jack_shephard Maybe they didn't have to blow the third tent.
rose_nadler But those gunshots, what was that all...
dr_jack_shephard He's OK, Rose.
sunhwa_kwon Do you believe that?
dr_jack_shephard Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them. And Sayid's with your husbands, they're gonna be fine and they're gonna be a couple of hours behind us.
sunhwa_kwon Then we should wait for them here. You go on...
dr_jack_shephard No. No one gets left behind.
rose_nadler If you say live together die alone to me, Jack, I'm gonna punch you in your face.
dr_jack_shephard Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. But we have a plan. And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be OK, everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, OK?
sunhwa_kwon It's OK, let's go.
bonnie I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?
charlie_pace I'm here, to turn off your jamming equipment. It's in there, next to the flashing yellow light.
greta How do you know about that?
charlie_pace I know because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off.
bonnie You are, huh?
charlie_pace Most definitely am.
bonnie So what's the code?
charlie_pace What?
bonnie Oh Charlie, if you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment, you're gonna need the code. And only three people know it. Me, her and Ben.
charlie_pace Well, guess I won't need the code. Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. I just turn off your little jammer and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends.
bonnie But if this station floods, what happens to you?
charlie_pace I die.
ben_linus What?
tom_friendly They're all dead. Diane, Ivan, all of 'em, dead. And Shephard and his people, they're all gone.
ben_linus Gone, gone where?
tom_friendly I dunno. Did you hear me? They killed seven of our—
ryan_pryce Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news.
ben_linus What good news?
tom_friendly We caught three of 'em. The one's who stayed behind to blow up the tents. Ben, they knew we were coming.
ben_linus It was Juliet. She betrayed us.
tom_friendly What?
ben_linus Just figure out where she is, Tom.
ryan_pryce Get up.
ryan_pryce OK, junior, where the hell did—
tom_friendly They're not talking.
ben_linus Who do you have?
tom_friendly Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.
ben_linus Shoot Kwon.
tom_friendly What?
ben_linus If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now.
jinsoo_kwon 지옥에나 떨어져라.
ryan_pryce I dunno what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely.
bernard_nadler No, wait. No.
jinsoo_kwon No. No talk.
bernard_nadler No, please.
tom_friendly You talk to me, nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people are.
sayid_jarrah He's lying, he's going to kill us all any—
ryan_pryce Where are they?
ryan_pryce Sayonara.
bernard_nadler A radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower.
tom_friendly Why in the hell are they going there?
bernard_nadler A woman... parachuted here. She has a satellite phone and they're gonna call her ship.
ben_linus Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?
ryan_pryce You heard him. How'd you know?
bernard_nadler A kid... told us. He came in a canoe, and he warned us.
tom_friendly What kid?
bernard_nadler Karl. He said his name was Karl.
tom_friendly You heard that, Ben? Ben?!
ben_linus I heard.
tom_friendly What do you want us to do, kill 'em?
ben_linus No. Not yet.
richard_alpert We're going to the radio tower?
ben_linus Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned.
richard_alpert Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own.
ben_linus Oh really? And why not?
richard_alpert Because people are asking questions, Ben. About leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumor that everyone that went down to the beach is dead.
ben_linus They're not all dead.
alex_rousseau Where are you going?
ben_linus Hello, Alex.
alex_rousseau I asked where you were going.
ben_linus Well, I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends.
alex_rousseau I'm coming with you.
ben_linus All right.
alex_rousseau What?
ben_linus I said all right. In fact, I think it's a good idea. I mean, you do want to see Karl again, don't you? Get your pack, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
richard_alpert There's 40 of them. And you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the Island. What do you think is gonna happen when you get there?
ben_linus I'm going to talk them out of it.
kate_austen Something's wrong.
james_ford Lots of things are wrong, Kate.
kate_austen Jin, Bernard and Sayid... they should have caught up to us by now. I want to go back to make sure they're all right.
james_ford 'Course you do.
kate_austen What's that supposed to mean?
james_ford It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for.
kate_austen What's the matter with you?
james_ford Nothing.
kate_austen Nothing?
james_ford I'm fine.
kate_austen Why don't you just tell me what happened?
james_ford What you do that for?
kate_austen To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Locke, it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me Kate?
kate_austen You know. They sent Juliet to check out Sun, but she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant too.
james_ford Well, let's hope you're not.
dr_jack_shephard The light's still red?
charlie_pace Des. Des!
desmond_hume Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?
charlie_pace Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, Des, hide, hide, there's people in there! Quick, hide hide hide. Go go go! Hide hide hide.
bonnie Who's he talking to?
charlie_pace I feel like standing... stupid people...
bonnie Who are you talking to?
charlie_pace I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just singing. You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody!
bonnie Shut up.
charlie_pace Right, OK, you got it.
bonnie Come on.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR Can I help you?
dr_jack_shephard Just checking her chart.
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill, Rob. The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet.
dr_jack_shephard Jack Shephard.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Dr. Shephard, the hero? Twice over.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL You all right? After last night, I'm surprised that you'd even want to come in. Talk about right place right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there.
dr_jack_shephard If she was lucky, she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging upon her spinal cord. I'd like to operate first thing in the morning.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL You want to operate?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL I'm sorry, Jack, but this isn't your patient. And we are well aware of the issues; Gary Nadler's doing the surgery at 6 a.m..
dr_jack_shephard With all due respect, Doctor Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Jack. Last night you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a burning car, then you went back for her. I think you've done enough.
dr_jack_shephard I want to do the surgery.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Look. Everything's under control. She'll be fine. Go home, have a drink. You deserve it.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL The chart, please, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard You call me. I wanna know what happens.
REPORTER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 This morning .. ... bridge was shut down for several hours in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured, an unidentified 40-year-old woman and her son...
REPORTER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 ...Fortunately for the two of them, Dr. Jack Shephard, who was at the scene of the crash, pulled both victims from the burning wreckage and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived. The victims were later transported to Saint Sebastian Hospital. Further details of their conditions have not yet been....
james_ford I'm going back.
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford I'm going back to the beach.
dr_jack_shephard No way. We keep moving.
james_ford I ain't asking permission.
james_ford Look, you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it. And you sure as hell don't need me.
dr_jack_shephard What do you think you're gonna get done, alone and unarmed?
kate_austen He won't be alone, I'll go with him.
james_ford No!
kate_austen Twenty minutes ago you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden you're telling Jack that I'm—
james_ford I didn't wanna go with you.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.
dr_juliet_burke I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet, you don't have to do that.
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.
james_ford Let's do this.
dr_jack_shephard Don't do anything stupid.
dr_juliet_burke I won't if you won't.
dr_juliet_burke Don't wait up.
charlie_pace
bonnie AH!! I told you to shut up!!!
charlie_pace You know when you get a tune stuck in your head? This song just started coming to me, it's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge.
bonnie Get the speargun!
greta What, why?
bonnie 'Cause I want it to hurt.
greta No, Ben said—
bonnie You don't want to get it, I will.
greta Bonnie.
charlie_pace Oi, oi, oi, no! I'll, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up.
bonnie Mikhail?
mikhail_bakunin I thought you two were on assignment in Canada?
greta He made us promise not to tell anyone.
charlie_pace Hello again.
mikhail_bakunin Where is the other one?
bonnie What?
mikhail_bakunin This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here.
bonnie He's alone.
mikhail_bakunin Are you sure about that?
charlie_pace Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't? Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the Island.
mikhail_bakunin What? Is that true?
greta That's Ben.
mikhail_bakunin I'll get it.
ben_linus You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island.
mikhail_bakunin The Island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?
ben_linus Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this.
mikhail_bakunin Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?
ben_linus Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here.
mikhail_bakunin So why not trust me?
ben_linus I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize.
ben_linus Mikhail, are you still there?
mikhail_bakunin Yes.
ben_linus I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too.
mikhail_bakunin How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me?
ben_linus Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead.
james_ford So, when you pulled us out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for anyway?
dr_juliet_burke We were building a runway.
james_ford Runway, for what?
dr_juliet_burke The aliens.
dr_juliet_burke I don't know what for, do you think they told me everything?
james_ford Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet?
dr_juliet_burke No. Are you?
james_ford How far away are these guns?
dr_juliet_burke There aren't any guns.
james_ford What?
dr_juliet_burke I lied.
james_ford You lied?
dr_juliet_burke It was the only way he'd let us go back.
james_ford So why are you going back?
dr_juliet_burke Karma. Why are you going back, James?
hugo_reyes Hey! Hey guys, wait up!
james_ford What the hell do you want?
hugo_reyes I'm coming with you guys.
james_ford Uh-uh, no way. Not a chance.
hugo_reyes Come on, I can help. They're my friends, too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?
james_ford For God's sake, Hugo, look at you. You're just gonna get in the way. You want to get us killed? Come on.
ben_linus If we head North, we should get to 'em before they reach the tower.
alex_rousseau Why did you let me come?
ben_linus I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex.
alex_rousseau You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.
ben_linus I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.
alex_rousseau Ben. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave?
ben_linus Because I can't, Alex.

john_locke Walt!
walt_lloyd Now get up, John.
john_locke He shot me and I can't... move my legs.
walt_lloyd You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John.
john_locke Why?
walt_lloyd Because... you have work to do.
dr_jack_shephard You OK?
kate_austen Yeah, I just... got a rock in my shoe.
dr_jack_shephard He didn't mean it, you know.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.
kate_austen He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?
dr_jack_shephard He was trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.
kate_austen Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer? He'd never do it for you.
dr_jack_shephard Because I love you.

DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Can I help you?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, I, er... Actually, I came, er... Is the funeral over?
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing. Nobody showed up.
dr_jack_shephard Nobody? You sure?
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Just you. My deepest condolences. Friend or family?
dr_jack_shephard Neither.
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Would you like me to open it up?
dr_jack_shephard No... no.
DIRECTOR#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Take your time.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it.
dr_jack_shephard Danielle. How much further?
danielle_rousseau About an hour.
dr_jack_shephard The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?
danielle_rousseau The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.
dr_jack_shephard What?
danielle_rousseau There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.
ben_linus Hello, Jack. We need to talk.
greta What did Ben say?
bonnie Can we kill him?
mikhail_bakunin Is it possible to turn this equipment off?
bonnie What?
mikhail_bakunin The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?
greta Sure. Ben gave us the code.
mikhail_bakunin You are the only ones who have it?
bonnie Yeah. Why?
mikhail_bakunin What would happen if this station were to be flooded?
greta Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.
mikhail_bakunin Then why do you need to be here?
bonnie Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.
mikhail_bakunin And you never asked why?
bonnie No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.
mikhail_bakunin She makes an excellent point.
bonnie No, please.
mikhail_bakunin I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.
desmond_hume Hey!
charlie_pace No, Des, no, don't! We need her.
ben_linus Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...
dr_jack_shephard Don't talk to him! What do you want?
ben_linus Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.
dr_jack_shephard For what?
ben_linus Jack, you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.
dr_jack_shephard He alone?
kate_austen There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.
dr_jack_shephard Five minutes.
PHARMACIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.
dr_jack_shephard Ah, that's a mistake. I, uh, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?
PHARMACIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 I did check it again, Dr. Shephard, and that was the third refill, so there's nothing I can do.
dr_jack_shephard Fine. I've got another prescription right here.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Hey, I know you. You're the hero.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not a hero.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?
dr_jack_shephard Here it is, here. Oxycodone.
PHARMACIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.
dr_jack_shephard That's not me, that's Dr. Christian Shephard, I'm Dr. Jack Shephard, he's my father.
PHARMACIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.
dr_jack_shephard He's out of town right now.
PHARMACIST#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 Well, I'm sure somebody in the office—
dr_jack_shephard Don't bother.
ben_linus Have a seat.
ben_linus Not so long ago, Jack, I made a decision, that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day. I'm telling you this because... history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.
dr_jack_shephard Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say, you're gonna... you're gonna kill all my people.
ben_linus No Jack, you are.
dr_jack_shephard And how am I going to do that, Ben?
ben_linus The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.
dr_jack_shephard She's not, huh?
ben_linus No, she's not.
dr_jack_shephard Then who is she?
ben_linus She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, I almost forgot, you're the... you're the good guys.
ben_linus Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not going anywhere.
ben_linus May I have my walkie back?
dr_jack_shephard What?
ben_linus There's something you need to hear. Please.
ben_linus Thank you. Tom, are you there?
tom_friendly Yeah, I'm here.
ben_linus Your plan killed seven of my people, but the ones that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.
sayid_jarrah Jack, don't give him anything!
bernard_nadler Leave him alone!
ryan_pryce I said shut up!!
dr_jack_shephard And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?
ben_linus Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.
tom_friendly Got it.
ryan_pryce I said don't move!!
ben_linus Bring me the phone, Jack.
sayid_jarrah Don't negotiate with him—
tom_friendly Gag him.
jinsoo_kwon No!
ben_linus Forty seconds.
dr_jack_shephard No. I'm getting them all off the Island. ALL OF THEM!
ben_linus Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's 20 seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard No.
ben_linus Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
dr_jack_shephard No.
ben_linus I'm not bluffing!
dr_jack_shephard I WON'T DO IT!!!
ben_linus Five. Four. Three...
dr_jack_shephard No.
ben_linus I'm so sorry, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Tom. Are you there?
tom_friendly Yeah, Jack, I hear you.
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get 'em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill you.
charlie_pace What's the code?
bonnie Go away.
charlie_pace Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?
desmond_hume She's not gonna tell you, brother.
charlie_pace Yeah she's gonna tell me.
desmond_hume What makes you say that?
charlie_pace Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?
bonnie Five, four, five...
charlie_pace What?
bonnie Eight, seven, sev-...
charlie_pace Is that the code?
bonnie Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...
charlie_pace Start again.
bonnie Six, one.
charlie_pace Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again. Start again.
bonnie "Good Vibrations."
charlie_pace What?
bonnie Beach Boys. "Good Vibrations." On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.
dr_jack_shephard Tie him up. He's coming with us.
alex_rousseau What?
ben_linus Alex. This is your mother.
danielle_rousseau I'll help you tie him up.
kate_austen What happened? What'd he say?
dr_jack_shephard It's not important right now. Just, get everything together—
kate_austen Jack. Your knuckles. Here.
kate_austen What happened?
dr_jack_shephard He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid that we would keep moving.
kate_austen So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?
dr_jack_shephard Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know... that he failed. And then I'll kill him.
ryan_pryce It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.
tom_friendly Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean, look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.
james_ford All they got left is three guys and four guns.
dr_juliet_burke And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.
james_ford So we'll wait 'til night.
dr_juliet_burke That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed. If you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go, I can try—
james_ford Shh! You hear that?
MALE#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode22 OTHER RYAN!
hugo_reyes Woo!
james_ford Stay in the bus, Hugo.
dr_juliet_burke Stay right there, Tom.
tom_friendly OK. I give up.
james_ford That's for taking the kid off the raft.
hugo_reyes Dude, it was over, he surrendered.
james_ford I didn't believe him.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?
dr_jack_shephard I was just, uh... I was just checking the, uh, the Arland charts. Just wanted to... just wanted to see how the operation went.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL I left three messages on your voicemail, you didn't get them?
dr_jack_shephard My phone's broken.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Let's go to my office, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard For what?
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL We need to have a talk. Come on.
dr_jack_shephard You know, I know that you're... you're new around here, so you don't know much about—
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office—
dr_jack_shephard If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Will you excuse us, please?
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL Mrs. Arlene, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.
dr_jack_shephard That's... that's great.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw a man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?
dr_jack_shephard Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL How much have you had to drink today, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me! Don't you look at me like that. Don't you... pity me.
dr_rob_hamill HAMILL I'm trying to help you.
dr_jack_shephard YOU CAN'T HELP ME!
hugo_reyes Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...
dr_jack_shephard Hurley?
hugo_reyes Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Where are you, what's going on?
hugo_reyes Dude. I'm back at the beach.
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer. I, I saved them.
dr_jack_shephard They're OK, Juliet and—
hugo_reyes Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all—
dr_jack_shephard What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!
hugo_reyes Yeah, dude, I told you, I saved 'em all.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I got ya, we'll stay put until you, like, phone home.
claire_littleton What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?
hugo_reyes Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.
charlie_pace Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?
desmond_hume Aye. There's plenty.
charlie_pace Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."
desmond_hume All right, mate.
charlie_pace Hey, Des.
desmond_hume Aye?
charlie_pace You get any flashes?
desmond_hume No, nothing.
charlie_pace Meet you back here then.
desmond_hume Aye.
charlie_pace So much for fate.

dr_jack_shephard The mistake was listening to you.
ben_linus This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.
naomi_dorrit I've got it, I've got a signal!!!

dr_jack_shephard Old habits.
kate_austen You look terrible.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
kate_austen Why did you call me, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.
kate_austen Why would I go to the funeral?
dr_jack_shephard I've been flying a lot.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, that golden pass that they gave us—I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I... fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney. And then I... I get off, and I... have a drink, and then I fly home.
kate_austen Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on board. Every little bump we hit, or turbulence, I mean, I... I actually close my eyes, and I pray that I can get back.
kate_austen This is not gonna change.
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm sick of lying! We made a mistake.
