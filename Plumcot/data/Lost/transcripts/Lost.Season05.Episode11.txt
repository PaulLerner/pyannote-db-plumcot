phil Hello Jin? Are you there?
phil Jin?! Can you hear me?
jinsoo_kwon Hello?
phil Jin? It's -- it's Phil, man. Where have you been? The hostile escaped. We're searching the east grid.
jinsoo_kwon He's headed north.
phil [on walkie How the hell do you know that?
jinsoo_kwon Because he attacked me.
phil What? Where are you?
phil Jin?! You still there?
phil Jin!
ben_linus Please help.
horace_goodspeed Okay, everybody, listen up.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Put it over there.
horace_goodspeed We don't know yet if another attack is coming. So everybody needs to be ready for your security assignments. Make sure you're in contact with your team leaders. LaFleur's got search parties out, but the hostile's got a good jump on us. We're pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion in order to escape.
hugo_reyes Uh...is he talking about Sayid?
dr_jack_shephard He was locked up. How would he start the fire?
horace_goodspeed Who are you?
dr_jack_shephard Jack Shephard. I'm...I'm new.
horace_goodspeed Well, Jack, the way he started the fire is he had help, okay? Somebody torched that van, and then that somebody let him out of his cell. And since the security cameras didn't pick up any hostiles crossing the perimeter, that means it was one of us.
horace_goodspeed Baxter, I want a full report on cleanup A.S.A.P.
BAXTER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 You got it Horace.
roger_linus Hey, you.
roger_linus Yeah, you.
roger_linus You're in the motor pool, right?
kate_austen Uh, yeah.
roger_linus Do you mind running that winch for me?
roger_linus You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
roger_linus Okay, no worries. Just throw this lever. When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.
kate_austen All right.
roger_linus See? Simple. Don't do it till I'm ready. All right, crank her up.
kate_austen Okay.
roger_linus So they just stuck you in the motor pool when you got here?
kate_austen Yeah, pretty much.
roger_linus Yeah, same thing happened to me. Wait, hold. Hold it right there. That's good. Right there. That's good. I guess they couldn't sucker anybody into getting on that sub if they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors.
kate_austen Well, ya gotta start somewhere.
roger_linus What's your name?
kate_austen I'm Kate.
roger_linus Welcome aboard, Kate. I'm Roger. Roger Linus.
kate_austen It's nice to meet you, Roger.
roger_linus That's my kid. That's my kid!
kate_austen Hi, handsome. Did you have a good sleep? Yeah, that's my boy. Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away. Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket save it for a rainy day.
kate_austen Hi.
cassidy_phillips Oh, my God!
kate_austen Hi, Cassidy.
cassidy_phillips Oh, my God! I saw you on the news! I told all my friends, "I know that woman!" Hi!
kate_austen This is Aaron.
cassidy_phillips Hi, Aaron.
kate_austen Say hi.
cassidy_phillips You survived a plane crash. It's amazing. I never thought I'd see you again. What are you doing here?
kate_austen Sawyer sent me.
cassidy_phillips Sawyer. So that son of a bitch is still alive?
kate_austen He was when I left.
cassidy_phillips And he asked you to come here and give me an envelope full of money?
kate_austen Well, he -- he told me where to find you, and...said to take care of Clementine...his daughter?
cassidy_phillips Well, she's asleep in her crib right now. Want me to wake her up?
kate_austen I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you. I could've sent it, and I probably should have.
cassidy_phillips Why did you tell me all this? Why'd you trust me?
kate_austen Because I thought your daughter had a right to know that her father cared.
cassidy_phillips Why didn't he come back with the rest of you?
kate_austen The helicopter that we were on was running out of gas, so he jumped so that we could make it to the boat.
cassidy_phillips What a coward.
kate_austen He was trying to do the right thing.
cassidy_phillips He was trying to get away from you. I told him he had a daughter. He never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her. So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero because he told you to come here and help us? Hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?
kate_austen They gave us a settlement after the crash, and I didn't need it all--
cassidy_phillips You don't have to explain it, Kate. You got the same look on your face I did when he ditched me. All I have for you is sympathy. Is it his?
kate_austen What?
cassidy_phillips Your son. Is it Sawyer's?
kate_austen No. No, I was pregnant before I met him.
cassidy_phillips That's not your baby, is it? Kate, you just told me that you and your friends cooked a story for the whole world about what happened on that island. So you tell me the truth about that? Why are you lying to me about him?
kate_austen Because I have to.
kate_austen What happened?
james_ford What the hell are you doing here?
kate_austen That was Ben. That kid who was shot was Ben. Was it Sayid? Did he shoot him?
james_ford Here's what you need to do, Kate--Keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions. 'Cause putting any attention on yourself is the last thing I need right now. Now scram. I don't want you around here.
kate_austen I just wanna know what's going on.
horace_goodspeed LaFleur. What... What, uh... What's she doing here?
james_ford This is, uh...
kate_austen I'm Kate.
james_ford Kate. She's new over at the motor pool. I was seeing if she saw anything suspicious, but she didn't, so...you can run along, thanks.
horace_goodspeed Have you checked out the hostile's cell yet?
james_ford I was a little busy trying to keep the town from burnin' down, Horace.
horace_goodspeed Okay. Well, then let's do it.
horace_goodspeed He didn't break out. Somebody let him out.
james_ford These are janitor's keys.
horace_goodspeed We've only got three janitors. There's Roger, Willie and, uh, that new guy. I just met him. His name's Jack.
james_ford Yeah. I just brought him in from the sub. I'll go talk to him. Miles, you wanna come with me?
miles_straume Yeah, sure, boss.
james_ford All right,I want you to find Jack and Hurley and Kate as quick as you can. Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.
miles_straume What for?
james_ford 'Cause I don't want 'em talking to anybody else. Things are starting to spin out of control here.
miles_straume All right, I got it.
james_ford All right, go.
roger_linus Who did this? Do you know who did this to my son?
james_ford Not yet, but we're working on it. How's he doing?
roger_linus I don't know. Juliet told me to wait out here.
james_ford Let me see if I can get an update for ya.
roger_linus Thanks, Jim.
james_ford Roger?
roger_linus Yeah?
james_ford You happen to have your keys with you?
roger_linus Yeah. Why? What do you need? I must've left them at...at the house.
james_ford It's all right. Don't you worry about it.
dr_juliet_burke More gauze.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Here's some gauze.
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, right here. Yeah. If we can't stop the hemorrhaging, we're gonna have to pack the whole tract.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Okay.
james_ford Where's the doctor?
dr_juliet_burke At the Looking Glass station til Friday.
james_ford How is he doing?
dr_juliet_burke Not well. Hold on. He's still bleeding in there somewher, and I can't fix it.
james_ford It's all right.
dr_juliet_burke No, it's not all right. Someone needs to get in there who can find the damage that bullet did and fix it. He needs a real surgeon.
dr_jack_shephard You're telling us we're under house arrest?
miles_straume No, you're all free to leave whenever you want...but I'll shoot you in the leg.
dr_jack_shephard And whose idea was this?
miles_straume Who do you think?
kate_austen Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.
miles_straume What the hell are you doing, Tubby?
hugo_reyes Checking to see if I'm disappearing.
miles_straume What?
hugo_reyes "Back to the Future", man. We came back in time to the island and changed stuff. So if little Ben dies, he'll never grow up to be big Ben, who's the one who made us come back here in the first place. Which means we can't be here. And therefore, dude? We don't exist.
miles_straume You're an idiot.
hugo_reyes Am I?
miles_straume Yeah. It doesn't work like that. You can't change anything. Your maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus. That is what always happened. It's just...we never experienced how it all turns out.
hugo_reyes This is really confusing.
miles_straume Yeah, well, get used to it. But the good news is that Linus didn't die, so that means the kid can't either. He'll be fine.
kate_austen Didn't look like he was gonna be fine. What if you're wrong?
miles_straume Well, if I'm wrong, then I guess we all stop existing, and none of it matters anyway then, does it?
james_ford Doc, I need you to come with me.
dr_jack_shephard Come with you where?
james_ford Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and we ain't gone none to put back in him. So we need you to show us where he sprung a leak.
dr_jack_shephard No.
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm not coming with you.
james_ford If you don't come with me, Jack, that kid's gonna die.
dr_jack_shephard Then he dies.
kate_austen What are you doing?
dr_jack_shephard Making some sandwiches. I figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now.
kate_austen He's just a boy, Jack. You can't just let him die.
dr_jack_shephard You heard Miles. We can't change what's already happened. This has nothing to do with me.
kate_austen Unless you're the one who's supposed to save him.
dr_jack_shephard 30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man...that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery. And then you're gonna come in and you're gonna beg me to operate on him because he's threatening to murder Sawyer. I've already done this once. I've already saved Benjamin Linus, and I did it for you, Kate. I don't need to do it again.
kate_austen This is our fault. We brought Sayid back. We caused this.
dr_jack_shephard You know, when we were here before, I spent all of my time trying to fix things. But...did you ever think that maybe the island just wants to fix things itself? And maybe I was just...getting' in the way?
kate_austen You know, I don't like the new you. I liked the old you, who wouldn't just sit around and wait for things to happen.
dr_jack_shephard You didn't like the old me, Kate.
miles_straume Hey! Where are you going?
dr_juliet_burke Just try to relax. You're okay.
NURSE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 I'm sorry. Juliet? One of the new people is here. She heard Ben needed blood. Says she's a universal donor.
dr_juliet_burke This might hurt for a second. Good. Very brave. So James told me that Jack wouldn't help, but he didn't say why.
kate_austen If I understood why Jack does what he does, I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.
dr_juliet_burke Off island, did something happen with you two?
kate_austen We were engaged. Does that count?
roger_linus What's going on?
dr_juliet_burke Roger, I asked you to wait outside.
roger_linus No, what's going on with my kid?
dr_juliet_burke Kate is giving us some fresh blood so we can transfuse Ben.
roger_linus Well, I'm not waitin' outside.
kate_austen You know, he could stay with me, and you could check on Ben, and--and Roger here could keep me company, make sure I don't pass out.
dr_juliet_burke Okay. Roger, have a seat.
roger_linus Thanks.
kate_austen Sure.
roger_linus He stole my keys.
kate_austen Sorry?
roger_linus LaFleur asked me where my keys were. That bastard doesn't ask any questions he doesn't know the answers to...which means my son stole my keys so he could bust that animal out of jail.
kate_austen Why--why would he do that?
roger_linus Because of me. You got kids?
kate_austen No.
roger_linus I thought I was gonna be the greatest father ever. You know? I guess it didn't work out that way.
kate_austen What about his mother? Is she still around?
roger_linus No, she's dead. She died the day he was born.
kate_austen I'm sorry.
roger_linus Yeah, me, too. I tried to do what I thought she'd want me to do, but...I guess a boy just needs his mother.
roger_linus What's going on?
dr_juliet_burke He's going into hypoxic shock.
roger_linus What does that mean?! What's the matter with him?!
dr_juliet_burke He needs more oxygen. Roger, get out of here!
roger_linus What?
dr_juliet_burke Get him out of here!
roger_linus Wait! What--what is--wait a minute.
dr_juliet_burke Please, Roger. Just wait outside.
hugo_reyes Let me get this straight.
hugo_reyes All this already happened.
miles_straume Yes.
hugo_reyes So this conversation we're having right now...we already had it.
miles_straume Yes!
hugo_reyes Then what am I gonna say next?
miles_straume I don't know.
hugo_reyes Ha! Then your theory is wrong!
miles_straume For the thousandth time, you dingbat, the conversation already happened, but not for you and me. For you and me, it's happening right now.
hugo_reyes Okay, answer me this. If all this already happened to me, then...why don't I remember any of it?
miles_straume Because once Ben turned that wheel, time isn't a straight line for us anymore. Our experiences in the past and the future occurred before these experiences right now.
hugo_reyes Say that again.
miles_straume Shoot me. Please. Please!
hugo_reyes Aha! I can't shoot you. Because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come back to the island on the freighter 30 years from now.
miles_straume I can die because I've already come to the island on the freighter. Any of us can die because this is our present.
hugo_reyes But you said Ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up and become the leader of the Others.
miles_straume Because this is his past.
hugo_reyes But when we first captured Ben, and Sayid, like, tortured him, then why wouldn't he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?
miles_straume Huh. I hadn't thought of that.
hugo_reyes Huh.
roger_linus How is he?
dr_juliet_burke He's stable.
roger_linus Is he gonna be okay?
dr_juliet_burke He's got some fresh blood running through him, which is a good thing. Roger, I need you to go out to the medical station. There are some supplies there that we don't have here .
roger_linus Okay. Hey, I just wanna say, I-I... I wanna say thanks. I know that you're doing everything you can... to save him, and...all right, I'm--I'm gonna go, okay?
kate_austen Is he any better?
dr_juliet_burke He's stable now. But I can't, um... I can't fix it.
kate_austen What about the sub? I mean, can we take him somewhere?
dr_juliet_burke No. It's gone. It won't be back for a couple of months.
kate_austen But he can't die, right?
dr_juliet_burke He is going to die. He is in a medical situation that is not resolveable.
kate_austen Okay, well, we can't just sit here and do nothing. I mean, there's got to be someone who can help him. We have an entire c... What?
dr_juliet_burke Maybe there's something they can do.
kate_austen They?
dr_juliet_burke The Others.
dr_juliet_burke You got him?
kate_austen Yeah. Ready? Okay.
dr_juliet_burke All right. One, two, three, go.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, let's go.
dr_juliet_burke I'm coming with you.
kate_austen No, no, no, no. If something goes wrong or we get caught, it doesn't matter for me, but you've got a whole life here. And besides, if Sawyer knew that I got you involved in this, he'd kill me.
dr_juliet_burke How are you gonna manage?
kate_austen I'll manage, don't worry.
dr_juliet_burke Kate. Sawyer's gonna find out Ben's gone, and when he does, I have to tell him what happened. But I'll give you as much of a head start as I can. Good luck.
ben_linus There's someone...someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
sunhwa_kwon Who?
ben_linus The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
kate_austen Is that what this is about? You knew about this.
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I was o--
kate_austen And that is why you were pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?!
dr_jack_shephard I wasn't pretending anything.
kate_austen This is insane. You guys are crazy.
dr_jack_shephard Kate--
kate_austen Jack, don't!
aaron Mommy, I'm thirsty.
aaron I need some milk.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Price check on 2. Price check on 2.
kate_austen Do you want chocolate milk or regular milk?
aaron Juice box.
kate_austen You don't want milk anymore?
aaron Juice box.
kate_austen Um...excuse me. Where are your juice boxes?
EMPLOYEE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Aisle 5.
kate_austen Thank you very much. Aaron? Um, excuse me. Have you seen my son?
EMPLOYEE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 I'm sorry?
kate_austen A little 3-year-old blond? Aaron? Aaron? Aaron?! Aaron! Excuse me. I've lost my son. He's 3. He's a little blond boy.
MANAGER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Don't worry, ma'am. I'll make an announcement. No, no, no. You have to seal off the store. You... Aaron? Hey!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Hey, is this your mommy? Honey, is this your mommy?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 I found him in the fruit section. I--he looked lost, I was getting eading to make an announcement.
kate_austen Thank you. Thank you very much.
kate_austen It's okay, honey. Mommy's got you. Mommy's got you.
ben_linus Um... tell my...
kate_austen Try not to talk, okay?
ben_linus Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.
kate_austen I know you gotta stop me...but I can't just let that kid die.
james_ford Damn it, Freckles. I ain't here to stop you. I'm here to help you.
CLEMENTINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Hi, Auntie Kate!
kate_austen Hi, Clementine. Is your mommy home?
CLEMENTINE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Sure. I'll go get her.
kate_austen Okay.
cassidy_phillips They're going back? To the island? Why in God's name would they wanna do that?
kate_austen I don't know. Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave.
cassidy_phillips Well, Jack sounds like a piece of work. You look exhausted. Drink this. Turl up on my bed. Take a nap. I'll watch your fella.
kate_austen I lost him.
cassidy_phillips What?
kate_austen I don't know what happened. We were in the supermarket, and I turned around for one second, and he was gone. And, you know, the crazy thing is, is that... as scared as I was...I wasn't surprised. All I could think was, it's about time. Why would I feel that way? I mean, why would I expect him to be taken?
cassidy_phillips Because you took him, Kate.
kate_austen No, I...Claire was gone. I mean, she left him. I had to take him. He needed me.
cassidy_phillips You needed him. Sawyer broke your heart. How else were you supposed to fix it?
james_ford Figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself?
kate_austen Well, the line's just right over there, right? The Others are on the other side.
james_ford Well, they ain't right on the other side. We better get movin'.
kate_austen Hey. Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me?
james_ford When I found out Ben was gone, and Juliet told me what you were up to, I asked that exact damn question. Why are you helping Ben? And she said...no matter what he's gonna grow up to be, it's wrong to let a kid die. So...that's why I'm doing this. I'm doing it for her.
dr_juliet_burke Where's Jack?
miles_straume Uh he--he's in the shower. I think.
hugo_reyes Is he in trouble?
dr_juliet_burke I just need to talk to him. You two mind giving us some privacy?
miles_straume Hey, ask me more questions about time travel.
dr_juliet_burke I needed you.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry?
dr_juliet_burke That kid was bleeding out. You're a surgeon, and I needed you.
dr_jack_shephard That kid is Ben.
dr_juliet_burke That's not Ben yet. He's just a kid.
dr_jack_shephard Juliet, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
dr_juliet_burke I'm not asking for your help, Jack. You made it pretty clear you weren't interested. It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.
dr_jack_shephard What?
dr_juliet_burke She's trying to save him, and I sent James after her to help, because they actually care.
dr_jack_shephard I came back here because I care, Juliet. I came back here because I was trying to save you.
dr_juliet_burke We didn't need saving. We've been fine for three years. You came back here for you. At least do me the courtesy of telling me why.
dr_jack_shephard I came back...because I was supposed to.
dr_juliet_burke Supposed to do what?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know yet.
dr_juliet_burke Well, you'd better figure it out.
kate_austen You know, I can take him for a while.
james_ford Sure you can.
kate_austen You know, his father said that you think Ben broke Sayid out.
james_ford Kid'll do almost anything if he's pissed off enough at his folks.
kate_austen Is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter?
james_ford Did you?
kate_austen Of course I did.
james_ford What's she like?
kate_austen Clementine?
james_ford Yeah, Clementine.
kate_austen Oh, she's beautiful. Looks just like you when she smiles. She's growing up fast. Already has a little attitude.
james_ford I bet you and Cassidy had a lot to talk about.
kate_austen She had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper.
james_ford Yeah, what's that?
kate_austen She thought you were worried about what would happen if you didn't.
james_ford You and me would've never worked out, Kate. I wasn't any more fit to be your boyfriend than I am to be that little girl's father.
kate_austen You seem to be doing all right with Juliet.
james_ford Yeah. I've done a lot of growing up the past three years.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Hands up!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Do not move. I said don't move. This is a violation of the truce. You're over the line.
james_ford We know. This kid's been shot. That's both of our problems. So unless you want to go to war, you're gonna take us to Richard Alpert, and you're gonna do it now.
kate_austen Mrs. Littleton. I'm Kate Austen.
carole_littleton I know who you are. Come in.
kate_austen Thank you.
carole_littleton Your friend, Dr. Shephard came here last night, going on and on about some person named Aaron. When I asked him who that was, he ran out of here like the room was on fire.
kate_austen He's your grandson. And your daughter, Claire...is alive.
carole_littleton What are you talking about? Claire died in the plane crash.
kate_austen No, she survived. When we crashed, your daughter was eight months pregnant, and...she's the one who gave birth on the island, not me. We lied. There were other survivors, too. We just left them behind.
carole_littleton Why? Why would you leave her there?
kate_austen Because she disappeared, and she left the baby behind. We looked everywhere, but...that's when I started taking care of Aaron. And when we were rescued, we didn't--we had to decide what to do with him. And I knew that she had wanted him to be adopted, but I couldn't. I had to protect him, so I said he was mine.
carole_littleton Why did you lie? Why didn't you come to me in the first place?
kate_austen Because I needed him. I'm sorry. You're gonna see that he's so sweet and kind and good.
carole_littleton Where is he?
kate_austen Um, I checked in two doors down. He's asleep. I know that this is a lot for you to handle. But...when you're ready, he's waiting for you. I told him that you're his grandmother. That you'll take care of him while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.
carole_littleton Where are you going?
kate_austen I'm going back to find your daughter.
kate_austen Bye-bye, baby.
james_ford Don't worry. We got 'em right where we want 'em.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Shut up and keep moving'.
james_ford What's it look like I'm doing?
richard_alpert Hello there, James.
james_ford Where the hell did you come from?
richard_alpert You asked my people to bring you to me. Here I am. Is that Benjamin Linus?
james_ford You two know each other?
richard_alpert What happened to him?
kate_austen He was shot.
richard_alpert And who might you be?
james_ford She's with me.
richard_alpert And why are you here?
kate_austen 'Cause we need you to save his life. Can you?
richard_alpert If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.
kate_austen What do you mean by that?
richard_alpert What I mean is that, he'll forget this ever happened, and that...his innocence will be gone. He will always be one of us. You still want me to take him?
kate_austen Yes.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode11 Richard... You shouldn't do this without asking Ellie. And if Charles finds out--
richard_alpert Let him find out. I don't answer to either of them
kate_austen Wh-where are you taking him?
james_ford Come on.
john_locke Hello, Ben. Welcome back to the land of the living.
