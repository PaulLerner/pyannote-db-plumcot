ilana_verdansky Where's Jarrah?
ben_linus I'm fine. Thank you.
ilana_verdansky Where is he?
ben_linus Considering that he just killed Dogen, I don't think he's going to be joining us.
sunhwa_kwon Who's Dogen?
miles_straume The guy in charge at the Temple.
ben_linus Sayid killed the interpreter too.
ilana_verdansky Are you sure?
ben_linus He was standing over their dead bodies holding a bloody dagger, so yeah, I'm pretty sure.
sunhwa_kwon You said we would be safe at the Temple!
ilana_verdansky That's what I was told...
ben_linus Well, what about the beach?
ilana_verdansky What beach?
ben_linus Where we buried Locke. Where they lived. At least we'll have the water at our backs and it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea?
ilana_verdansky No. The beach it is.
sunhwa_kwon That way!
ilana_verdansky Move.
ben_linus It was on this island that everything changed. That everything finally became clear. Elba... is where Napoleon faced his greatest test. Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate. What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power. Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of Emperor... but without any power it was meaningless. He might just as well have been dead.
ben_linus Alright. Remember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you.
ben_linus Principal Reynolds, good morning.
principal_donald_reynolds Walk with me.
principal_donald_reynolds Linus, there's been a slight schedule shift. I'm going to need you to supervise detention after school today.
ben_linus What?
principal_donald_reynolds In fact, all week. Cutbacks, budget crises, events above your pay grade... needless to say, some of us have to pull double duty.
ben_linus But we have history club today, those kids need me.
principal_donald_reynolds There are five students in history club, Linus. They'll live.
ben_linus Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?
principal_donald_reynolds Spare me. The club isn't for them, it's for you. It makes you feel needed. Unfortunately, for now, you're needed. In detention. Thanks for your understanding, Linus.
ben_linus It's Dr. Linus, actually.
dr_leslie_arzt Oh, for the love of... it's ruined! It's ruined! Oh...
ben_linus What's the problem, Leslie?
dr_leslie_arzt Well, formaldehyde. Formaldehyde's the problem. You know what gets out formaldehyde? Nothing. Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons I wouldn't have to pay for incompetent students with another trip to Marshall's.
ben_linus Budget cutbacks...
dr_leslie_arzt How hard would it be for Reynolds to spread out a little of the love to the sciences? I mean, I'm dealing with lab equipment in there from the 1950's. Now why is that?
ben_linus Principal Reynolds is an administrator. He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what the public school system is about.
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah... summers off in exchange for a crap pension. I'm happy to remind him.
ben_linus No. Taking care of the kids, that's what's important.
dr_leslie_arzt Okay, you just keep dreamin'...
ben_linus Well, I know you've given up but I refuse to.
john_locke Maybe you should be the principal.
dr_leslie_arzt So says the substitute...
ben_linus What do you mean I should be the principal?
john_locke Just sounds like you care about this place. And if the man in charge doesn't, then maybe it's time for a change.
ben_linus I appreciate the sentiment, but who's going to listen to me?
john_locke I'm listenin'.
miles_straume How about you tell me what that thing back there was?
ben_linus That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue.
ilana_verdansky And Jacob, right? It killed Jacob too.
ben_linus Yeah, of course, and Jacob--
ilana_verdansky Of course.
ilana_verdansky You're Miles, right? Miles Straume? You communicate with the dead?
miles_straume Not technically. I... I can tell you how someone died, pick up their last thoughts before they check out, but... I need to be near their body.
ilana_verdansky This is what's left of Jacob's body.
ilana_verdansky So tell me, Miles... how did he die?
miles_straume Linus killed him.
ben_linus What? That's not true!
ilana_verdansky Are you sure?
miles_straume He was standing over Jacob's body with a bloody dagger, so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.
ilana_verdansky Thank you.
ilana_verdansky Jacob was the closest thing I ever had to a father.
miles_straume Uh-oh.
ilana_verdansky I'm gonna look for some tools and get to work on some shelter. The rest of you see what food's left. Maybe get a fire going.
miles_straume Yeah, a fire will fix everything...
ben_linus Is there anything you'd like me to do?
ben_linus You know, that psychic is totally unreliable. Miles actually tried to blackmail me once.
frank_lapidus You make friends easy, don't you?
ben_linus I made you one of the turkey meals, with the cranberry sauce that you like.
roger_linus It ain't one of them... lean deals is it?
ben_linus No, dad... it's organic. I'm trying to keep you healthy.
roger_linus Well, it's a little too late for that. How was work?
ben_linus I have a doctorate in modern European history, and yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention...
roger_linus Detention, huh?
ben_linus And the worst of it is, as I look out at those ingrates that I'm tasked with watching, I can't help thinking that maybe I'm more a loser than any of them.
roger_linus This isn't the life I wanted for you, Ben. I wanted so much more.
ben_linus I know.
roger_linus That's why I signed up for that damn Dharma Initiative and took you to the island, and... they were decent people. Smarter than I'll ever be. Imagine how different our lives would have been if we'd stayed.
ben_linus Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after...
roger_linus No, I'm serious, Ben! Who knows what you would have become?
ben_linus Now, does that feel better?
roger_linus Ah, yes. Thank you.
ben_linus Alex?
alex_rousseau Dr. Linus. Where were you today? We had to cancel history club.
ben_linus Oh, I'm so sorry, I should've put a note on the door. The club meetings have to be postponed, I'm in detention all week.
alex_rousseau Oh yeah? What did you do?
ben_linus Principal Reynolds needs me to cover, so...
alex_rousseau AP test this Friday. I was kind of... counting on the tutoring.
ben_linus Alright, how about this? Tomorrow morning, 7 A.M. in the library. And you bring the coffee.
alex_rousseau Thanks. God, you're the best, Dr. Linus.
ben_linus My pleasure, Alex.
alex_rousseau Okay.
ben_linus See you.
sunhwa_kwon Excuse me... how long are we going to stay here?
ilana_verdansky I told you. I don't know yet.
sunhwa_kwon I need to find my husband.
ilana_verdansky Trust me, if anyone wants to find him, it's me. But I don't know where to look.
sunhwa_kwon Why do you want to find Jin?
ilana_verdansky Because your last name is Kwon. So is his. And I don't know whether I'm supposed to protect you, him, or both of you.
sunhwa_kwon Protect us? What are you talking about?
ilana_verdansky You're candidates. To replace Jacob.
sunhwa_kwon Replace him? To do what?
ilana_verdansky If you're the one selected, I imagine you'll find out.
sunhwa_kwon Wait... you said candidates. How many are there?
ilana_verdansky Six. There are only six left.
hugo_reyes Cheese curds...
dr_jack_shephard Hurley. Come on, wake up.
dr_jack_shephard Come on, let's go. We can make the Temple by nightfall.
hugo_reyes I'm hungry. Let's eat breakfast first.
dr_jack_shephard No, we can eat on the way.
hugo_reyes What's the rush? You know, maybe we should... take our time.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
hugo_reyes Because.
dr_jack_shephard I'm leavin', Hurley. You comin' or not?
hugo_reyes Uh-uh, dude. It's this way.
dr_jack_shephard No, we came this way.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but that was a mistake. This is faster. Trust me, it's just around here. It's a short cut.
dr_jack_shephard No, it's not.
richard_alpert You're both wrong.
richard_alpert The Temple's that way.
dr_jack_shephard Where did you come from?
richard_alpert You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
dr_jack_shephard Try me.
richard_alpert Not yet. But if you wanna go to the Temple, it's this way.
hugo_reyes Dude, do you trust that guy?
dr_jack_shephard At least he's not stallin'.
frank_lapidus When you're finished in the library, give me a hand gettin' some more firewood.
ben_linus Just lookin' for something useful...
ben_linus God... the things people will bring on a trip...
ben_linus Oceanic... I remember that plane breakin' in half like it was yesterday.
frank_lapidus You sound nostalgic.
ben_linus Maybe I am.
frank_lapidus You know, I was supposed to be flyin' it. Oceanic 815.
ben_linus And why didn't you?
frank_lapidus I overslept.
ben_linus Come on...
frank_lapidus Can you believe it? Imagine how different my life would be had that alarm gone off.
ben_linus How different would it have been? The island still got you in the end. Didn't it?
ilana_verdansky Walk.
ben_linus Okay, wait, you don't have to--
ilana_verdansky Stop! On the ground! Face down!
ben_linus What are you doing? Look, if this is about what Miles said--
ilana_verdansky Pick it up!
ben_linus What?
ilana_verdansky Pick it up and start digging!
ben_linus Digging what?
ilana_verdansky A grave.
ben_linus For who?
ilana_verdansky You murdered Jacob. It's for you.
ben_linus Now, you know this. I know you do.
alex_rousseau Expanded Lord Cornwallis' powers as governor general.
ben_linus Very good. Now, moving on to the Charter Act of 1813. At the time of the Charter, the East India Trading Company's power extended to all of India, except for...
alex_rousseau Uh... I don't know!
ben_linus It's okay, it's okay. It's just a test.
alex_rousseau Just a test? Ha... it's only my entire life, Dr. Linus.
ben_linus Alex, I think you're being a bit over-dramatic.
alex_rousseau Am I? My mom works two jobs just to pay our rent. How am I gonna pay for college? Let alone Yale? Assuming I can even get in...
ben_linus You're one of the brightest students I've ever had. I don't worry about your future at all.
alex_rousseau Really?
ben_linus Really. Now, what can I do to help? I'll write you a great letter of recommendation, I'll--
alex_rousseau No, I need someone who went there. Unfortunately, the only one I know is that pervert Principal Reynolds.
ben_linus Excuse me? Pervert?
alex_rousseau Forget I said that. I was just angry.
ben_linus Alex... has Principal Reynolds... done something to you?
alex_rousseau What? Ew! No... I swear... it's not that.
ben_linus Then what is it?
alex_rousseau Dr. Linus, if I tell you, will you promise to keep it between us?
ben_linus Of course, I promise.
alex_rousseau Okay.
alex_rousseau So, I was in the nurse's office a few months ago... I had a stomach ache and I just went in to find a cot and I fell asleep... when I woke up, after school, in the other room Principal Reynolds was there. And the nurse... well, I guess she forgot I was in there. They were... you know... doing it! In the room right next to me! Where they give kids hearing tests! Isn't that totally gross?
ben_linus Totally.
alex_rousseau Dr. Linus, you're not gonna say something, are you?
ben_linus No. No, a promise is a promise. Well... shall we return to the high seas?
alex_rousseau Yeah. Sure.
miles_straume Not exactly tearing it up on the digging front, are you?
ben_linus I'm not in a big hurry.
miles_straume Brought you some grub. Hope you like green bean and banana 'cause it's all we got.
ben_linus I'm not really hungry.
miles_straume Suit yourself.
ben_linus Miles... do you remember once you asked me for 3.2 million dollars? Do you still want it?
miles_straume What are you gonna do? You gonna write me a check on this banana leaf?
ben_linus I can get off this island. And when I do, I have a vast network of people and resources that will get you that money. All you have to do is cut me loose.
miles_straume Why would I need your money when there are a couple of jabronies under there named Nikki and Paulo who got buried alive with eight million dollars in diamonds on top of them?
ben_linus I can't believe you're just gonna stand by and watch this happen. Ilana's gonna murder me for killing Jacob, a man who didn't even care about being killed!
miles_straume No, he cared.
ben_linus Excuse me?
miles_straume Right up until the second the knife went through his heart, he was hoping he was wrong about you. I guess he wasn't.
ilana_verdansky Dig!
hugo_reyes So... you're not time-traveling?
richard_alpert No.
hugo_reyes But... you look the same as you did thirty years ago. How's that possible?
richard_alpert It's not easy to explain.
hugo_reyes Is this, like, a Terminator thing? Are you a cyborg?
richard_alpert No, I'm not a cyborg.
hugo_reyes Vampire?
richard_alpert Jacob gave me a gift.
dr_jack_shephard Jacob? What do you know about him?
richard_alpert I know he's dead.
hugo_reyes I thought you said we were going to the Temple, dude.
richard_alpert I lied.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
richard_alpert Because everyone at the Temple is dead.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean they're all dead? What happened?
richard_alpert I'm not sure what happened. But I just came from there, and... there's no survivors.
dr_jack_shephard What about our friends? Sayid? Kate?
richard_alpert I hope they weren't there. Maybe they made it out alive. All I know is, whatever you're looking for at the Temple, it's not there.
dr_jack_shephard You didn't want to go back there. Did you know about this?
hugo_reyes Jacob kind of, sort of, hinted at it...
richard_alpert You spoke to Jacob?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
richard_alpert Well, whatever he said... don't believe him.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you goin'?
richard_alpert There's something I need to do.
dr_jack_shephard To do what?
richard_alpert Die.
ben_linus Do you have a minute?
dr_leslie_arzt Yes. I guess. Might as well give them all F's. Tell me, how hard is it to learn the difference between a genus and species? What do you want?
ben_linus You're pretty good with computers aren't you?
dr_leslie_arzt Something tells me you wouldn't be standing here if you didn't already know that I was.
ben_linus Could you...hypothetically...access someone's email account without their knowledge?
dr_leslie_arzt I...yeah, it depends on the account.
ben_linus Say a faculty account. Hypothetically
dr_leslie_arzt Whose?
ben_linus Nurse Kondraki.
dr_leslie_arzt Kim? Why, you got the hots for her?
ben_linus No, I'm just...curious about some of her correspondence.
dr_leslie_arzt With whom?
dr_leslie_arzt Okay, that's fine. I didn't come to see you, you came to see me. I don't have time to play twenty questions. Now either you can tell me what it is you're doing, or you can let me finish grading my papers in peace.
ben_linus All right. I have reason to believe that she might be engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with principal Reynolds.
dr_leslie_arzt You're making a play! You're going after the big job, aren't you?
ben_linus Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?
dr_leslie_arzt I want a good spot. I want Lamour's spot in the main parking lot, the one next to the maple tree. Not under the maple tree, next to the maple tree. That way I get the shade from the maple tree, but not all that tree crap all over the hood of my car. I want aprons. I want lots of aprons, and I want lab equipment in here that was built in this decade, is that a deal?
ben_linus Deal.
dr_leslie_arzt You know, you really had me fooled with that sweater vest. Linus you're a real killer!
dr_jack_shephard Been here before?
richard_alpert Yes. And in all the time I've spend on this island, today is the first time I've ever come back.
hugo_reyes Jack? Dude where are you?
dr_jack_shephard I'm in here.
hugo_reyes Do not open that, there's dynamite in there, it's mega unstable.
richard_alpert I know.
hugo_reyes So did Doctor Arzt. And I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later.
hugo_reyes Dude it's time to go.
dr_jack_shephard No, not yet.
hugo_reyes He's opening up a crate of dynamite, and he said he wanted to kill himself.
richard_alpert I can't kill myself.
hugo_reyes What?
richard_alpert Even if I wanted to, trust me, I do. I can't kill myself. Which is why I want you to do it for me.
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about?
richard_alpert What I'm talking about Jack is that...Jacob touched me, and when Jacob touches you... well it's considered a gift... except it's not a gift at all. It's a curse.
hugo_reyes Dude, seriously! Let's go now!
dr_jack_shephard Why do you want to die?
richard_alpert I devoted my life, longer than you can possibly imagine, in service of a man who told me that everything was happening for a reason, that he had a plan, plan that I was a part of, when the time was right that he'd share it with me, and now that man's gone so...why do I want to die? Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose. Now if I light this myself it won't work, but you can light it for me Jack. I made the fuse long enough so you'll have time to get out.
hugo_reyes Jack! Please tell me you're not actually considering this?
dr_jack_shephard If he wants to die, there's nothing we're going to do to stop him.
richard_alpert Thank you.
dr_jack_shephard Now, let's talk.
hugo_reyes Jack! Dude we gotta go, the guy's crazy, and I know crazy!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley go ahead, we'll be all right.
hugo_reyes Dude you're gonna blow up!
dr_jack_shephard I've got to talk to him Hurley, just go.
hugo_reyes No, I'm not going without you.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, I'll be fine.
hugo_reyes If you change your mind, I'll be like a mile away.
richard_alpert You should go with him Jack.
dr_jack_shephard No, Richard, no I shouldn't.
richard_alpert You're gonna die.
dr_jack_shephard Actually I don't think either one of us is gonna die.
richard_alpert What makes you think that?
dr_jack_shephard I just came from a lighthouse...where my name was etched in wood on a dial...I turned a mirror that somehow reflected the image of the house I grew up in. Jacob's lighthouse. He got Hurley to bring me out there because he wanted me to see what was reflected in that mirror. For some reason he wanted me to know that he had been watching me ever since I was a kid.
richard_alpert Why?
dr_jack_shephard I have no idea why. But I'm willing to bet you that if Jacob went to that trouble, that he brought me to this island for a reason, and it's not blow up sitting here with you right now.
richard_alpert That's a pretty big risk you're taking Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
richard_alpert What if you're wrong?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not.
dr_jack_shephard Wanna try another stick?
richard_alpert All right Jack. You seem to have all the answers. Now what?
dr_jack_shephard We go back to where we started.
john_locke Hello Ben.
ben_linus What are you doing here?
john_locke Visiting. What are you doing?
ben_linus I'm digging my own grave.
john_locke Why?
ben_linus Because you talked me into killing Jacob. You see that woman over there eating a mango? She's his bodyguard and she knows what I did. So now you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me.
john_locke I don't want you to die Ben. In fact I went back to the statue to get you, but you'd already gone.
ben_linus Get me? For what?
john_locke I'm gathering a group to leave this place for good. But once we're gone, someone's going to need to be in charge of the island.
ben_linus Me?
john_locke I can't think of a better man for the job.
ben_linus Well it doesn't seem very likely does it, under the circumstances. How am I going to get away from...
john_locke Come to the other island, to the Hydra station. That's where we'll be.
ben_linus She'll come after me.
john_locke 200 yards inland there's a tree in a clearing with a rifle leaning up against it. If you go now you'll get there first, and you'll have the drop on her. But don't hesitate - she won't. See you soon, Ben.
ilana_verdansky Hey!
principal_donald_reynolds Come in. Linus, I don't have time to listen to you complain about detention.
ben_linus That's not why I'm here, I want you to read something.
principal_donald_reynolds Well if this is some attempt to revive your little club...
ben_linus Those are thirty emails that cover a three-month period. It's pretty lascivious stuff, which would be fine if it was private, but they seem to describe acts that took place on school property. Acts which, morality aside, I think the school board would frown on, not to mention your wife.
principal_donald_reynolds What do you want?
ben_linus Your job. You're going to resign. For, I don't know - personal reasons, health - your call. But with your resignation you're going to recommmend the school board hire me as your replacement. And the irony of all this is that they hold you in such esteem that I'll get the job. So, do we have an understanding?
principal_donald_reynolds Linus, may I read you an email? "Dear principal Reynolds, I would appreciate it if you would write a letter of recommendation to Yale on my behalf. It would mean the world to me. Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau." It's a funny thing about recommendations Linus, they work both ways. So, I put the ball back in your court. You can execute your little Machiavellian manoeuvres, go for my job, sit at my desk, but alas there will be an unfortunate side effect. I will torch Miss Rousseau and her future. Is my job, my power, that important to you? So, what'll it be, Dr. Linus?
ben_linus Drop it! Put the gun down!
ilana_verdansky What are you waiting for?
ben_linus I want to explain.
ilana_verdansky Explain what?
ben_linus I want to explain that I know what you're feeling.
ilana_verdansky You have no idea what I'm feeling.
ben_linus I watched my daughter Alex die in front of me. And it was my fault. I had a chance to save her. But I chose the island over her. All in the name of Jacob. I sacrificed everything for him. And he didn't even care. Yeah I stabbed him, I was... so angry...confused...I was terrified that I was about to lose the only thing that had ever mattered to me - my power. But the thing that really mattered was already gone. I'm sorry that I killed Jacob. I am, and I do not expect you to forgive me because...I can never forgive myself.
ilana_verdansky Then what do you want?
ben_linus Just let me leave.
ilana_verdansky Where will you go?
ben_linus To Locke.
ilana_verdansky Why?
ben_linus Because he's the only one that'll have me.
ilana_verdansky I'll have you.
alex_rousseau Dr Linus.
ben_linus Hello Alex.
alex_rousseau I was just coming by to thank principal Reynolds. He wrote me the most incredible letter of recommendation.
ben_linus Wow, wonderful.
alex_rousseau Did you have something to do with it? I mean, I thought he might say some nice things but he really went all out.
ben_linus No, it wasn't me Alex. But I always say you're a a great student, obviously I wasn't the only one who noticed.
alex_rousseau Thanks, D--
principal_donald_reynolds Linus, what the hell are you doing in my office?
ben_linus Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week, per your request.
principal_donald_reynolds Just put it on the desk.
ben_linus So will I see you in history club?
alex_rousseau You mean when it's back on?
ben_linus Oh no, we've got our old slot back. Principal Reynolds found someone to cover for detention. Isn't that right?
principal_donald_reynolds Yes, that's right.
ben_linus Well then, see you at four.
alex_rousseau Bye.
dr_leslie_arzt Hey, did you do it?
ben_linus No.
dr_leslie_arzt No? No! Wait...what about my parking space?
ben_linus You can have mine.
ben_linus Do you need a hand?
sunhwa_kwon Please help me with the tarp.
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode07 AT PERISCOPE Sir, there are people on the beach. Should we stop?
charles_widmore No, proceed as planned.
CREWMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode07 AT PERISCOPE Yes sir, Mr. Widmore.
