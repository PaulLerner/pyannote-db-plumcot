MARSHAL Don't trust her. She's dangerous.
JACK You should try not to move, man.
MARSHAL Have to find her. Have to bring her back.
JACK Yeah, you keep saying that. And every time I ask you who you have to bring back you pass out on me again. Since your fever's running pretty high, I'm guessing you have no idea who you're talking about.
MARSHAL My cuffs, my handcuffs. Where are my cuffs?
JACK What?
MARSHAL My jacket pocket.
JACK I don't...
MARSHAL Jacket pocket.
JACK Okay.
MARSHAL Dangerous. She's dangerous.
BOONE It's getting dark.
SAWYER Then pick up the pace.
BOONE Hick.
SAWYER Little louder?
SAYID We should make camp.
SHANNON What, here?
SAYID Yes, here.
SAWYER I'm not stopping. You all have a nice cookout.
SAYID Excellent, walk through the jungle in the dark.
SAWYER Oooo, afraid the trees are going to get us?
SAYID No, what is knocking down the trees will get you.
SAWYER Well, if you're so worried about me, how about you give me the clip back?
KATE Put the gun back in your pants, Sawyer. Sayid's right, if you keep walking you're not going to make it to the beach.
SAWYER Yeah, why's that?
KATE Trust me.
SAYID This is Australia . This is us .
SAWYER Nice stick.
SAYID Two days ago we take off from Sydney. We fly along the same north east route every commercial airliner bound for Los Angeles does. Now the pilot, he said he lost communication with the ground, correct?
KATE Yeah, 6 hours in. He turned around and headed for Fiji.
SAYID So, we changed course. Regrettably, no one knew we changed course. The turbulence hit. We know the rest. 
KATE The pilot said we were over a thousand miles off course.
CHARLIE Yeah, but, they'll find us. They have satellites in space that can take pictures of your license plate.
SAYID If only we were all wearing license plates.
CHARLIE Well, aren't you the pessimist.
SAYID Basic photography - point and shoot. Satellites can shoot, but they must be told where to point.
CHARLIE Oh. Bollocks.
SAWYER Okay, really enjoyed the puppet show. Fantastic. But we're stuck in the middle of damn nowhere. How about we talk about that other thing? You know that transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio? The French chick that said, "They're all dead." The transmission's been on a loop for … how long was it, Freckles?
KATE 16 years.
SAWYER Right. Let's talk about that.
BOONE Well, we have to tell the others when we get back.
SHANNON Tell them what, exactly?
BOONE What we heard.
SHANNON You didn't hear anything. I'm not a stupid translator.
SAYID No one's going to tell them anything. To relay what we heard without fully understanding it will cause a panic. If we tell them what we know we take away their hope. And hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.
KATE So we lie.
HURLEY Was it a dinosaur?
JACK It wasn't a dinosaur.
HURLEY You say you didn't see it.
JACK I didn't.
HURLEY So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
JACK Because dinosaurs are extinct.
HURLEY Oh. Yeah. So what's his story? He looks kind of... dying.
JACK He's not going to die.
HURLEY He's yellow, man.
JACK His wound is infected, but the antibiotics will fight it off.
HURLEY What if they don't?
JACK Then his body will shut down one piece at a time. His abdomen goes rigid, then...
HURLEY He looks like he's in pain.
JACK Yeah.
HURLEY What's this? Uh, dude? Uh... What do you think she did?
JACK It's none of my business.
HURLEY She looks pretty hard core.
JACK Hurley... 
SAYID What are you doing?
BOONE Standing guard. You heard what they said is out there.
SAWYER You took my gun off me, boy?
SHANNON Please, you've never even held a gun. He doesn't believe in guns. He's goes on marches.
BOONE I don't go on marches.
SAYID Give it back to me.
SAWYER Yeah, give it to Al Jazeera, he'll protect us.
CHARLIE Al Jazeera is a network.
BOONE I'll keep the damn gun.
SHANNON We should give it to her. 
CHARLIE Yeah, Kate should hold the gun.
SAYID Fine with me. Well?
RAY Good morning.
KATE Morning.
RAY You were sleeping in my sheep pen.
KATE Sorry.
RAY How'd you get here?
KATE I walked.
RAY You walked?
KATE Yeah.
RAY From where?
KATE Town.
RAY Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
KATE Maybe that's why I was so exhausted.
RAY What's your name?
KATE Annie.
RAY You hungry, Annie?
RAY So you want to tell me why you're trespassing on my property?
KATE I ran out of money.
RAY You're an American.
KATE Canadian. I graduated from college and figured I'd see the world. Australia was top of my list so I hopped a flight to Melbourne but I don't know anybody here so I figured I'd walk for awhile, you know.
RAY Melbourne's 100 kilometers from here.
KATE I like walking.
RAY And you just happened to wonder onto my farm.
KATE I like farms, too.
RAY Do you know how to work one?
KATE Yeah.
RAY My wife died 8 months ago Wednesday. She left me with too many chores and a hell of a mortgage. If you help me with the first one, I'll give you a fair wage and a place to stay.
KATE Deal.
RAY No. I'm a lefty.
HURLEY Dude, dude, they're back.
SAYID As you and the others know, we hiked up the mountain in an attempt to help the rescue team locate us. The transceiver failed to pick up a signal. We weren't able to send out a call for help. But we're not giving up. If we gather electronic equipment - your cell phones, laptops - I can boost the signal and we can try again, but that may take some time. So for now, we should begin rationing our remaining food. If it rains, we should set up tarps to collect water. I need to organize 3 separate groups. Each group should have a leader. One group for water - I'll organize that. Who's going to organize electronics? You? Rationing food? Okay. And I believe a third group should concern themselves with the construction of...
KATE Hi.
JACK Hey.
KATE I, um, I need to tell you something.
JACK Okay, sure.
KATE We couldn't send out a signal because there was another signal blocking it. The other signal - we heard it. It was a distress call from a French woman. She said that the others were dead - something had killed them all. She was alone on the Island. It's been playing for 16 years, Jack. I wanted to tell you.
JACK Anything else?
KATE How is he - the man with the shrapnel in his side?
JACK It's touch-and-go.
KATE He wake up?
JACK No, just for a few seconds during the surgery.
KATE He say anything?
JACK No.
HURLEY So what'd she say?
JACK She didn't say anything.
HURLEY But you told her you knew?
JACK I don't know anything.
HURLEY Well, you kind of know she's in that mug shot. And that we found those handcuffs. And that guy keeps mumbling "she's dangerous, she's dangerous" over and over.
JACK It's not my business. Not my problem.
HURLEY Yeah, you're right. We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better.
JACK He's not getting better if we don't get some stronger antibiotics.
HURLEY That stuff I got from the luggage...
JACK It's for ear infections and foot fungus.
HURLEY We went through everything, man.
JACK What about that luggage in the overhead compartments?
HURLEY That's inside the plane.
JACK Yeah?
HURLEY But, the bodies are in there, and they're all... dead.
JACK Look, I'll handle it. Why don't you keep an eye on him...?
HURLEY Great. Yeah - love to - on it.
SAWYER Boo.
JACK What are you doing in here?
SAWYER Trick or treat, same as you.
JACK You're looting.
SAWYER Aww, you say potato...
JACK What's in the bag?
SAWYER Booze, smokes, couple of Playboys. What's in yours?
JACK Medicine.
SAWYER Well, that about sums it up, don't it?
JACK Do you do this back home, too - steal from the dead?
SAWYER Brother, you've to got wake up and smell the bull crap here, rescue ain't comin'. You're just wasting your time. You're trying to save a guy who last time I checked had a piece of metal the size of my head sticking out of his bread basket. Let me ask you something? How many of those pills are you going to use to fix him up?
JACK As many as it takes.
SAWYER Yeah? How many you got? You're just not looking at the big picture, Doc. You're still back in civilization.
JACK Yeah? And where are you?
SAWYER Me? I'm in the wild.
CHARLIE Whoa, hey, I got it. I got it.
CLAIRE Thanks.
CHARLIE Well, look on the bright side. Whoever's this was is probably better off than we are. I got it.
SUN 여기… 당신 가방 찾은 것 같아요! 
JIN 그래? 보자. 아니야. 
SUN 그럼 계속 찾아볼게요. 
JIN 잠깐, 이리 와 봐. 니 모습 좀 봤니? 니 옷하고 얼굴이 너무 더러워 보여. 빨리 씻어라. 자기야. 사랑해. 
CHARLIE So, how's the baby?
CLAIRE It's okay, I think.
CHARLIE Good. So, your husband. Was he on the flight?
CLAIRE Oh, no. I'm not married.
CHARLIE Oh.
CLAIRE I know - how modern of me.
CHARLIE Well, who needs men, right? Bloody useless.
CLAIRE So, you guys hiked all the way up that mountain for nothing, huh?
KATE Hey, sorry.
HURLEY I was going to get some more water.
KATE We haven't met. I'm Kate.
HURLEY Hi, Kate.
KATE Hi.
HURLEY Hurley.
KATE I was just looking for Jack and I thought he might be in there.
HURLEY Yeah, no. Uh, he went to go get some medicine... over there.
KATE Where? In the fuselage?
HURLEY What? Yeah, in the uh, uh, you know? I've got to get that water. 
RAY The bank would have given you a heck of a toaster if you had kept that in a savings account.
KATE What do I need a toaster for?
RAY You're hiding your wages in a tin can, Annie. I mean, I would have held on to it for you.
KATE I got trust issues.
RAY Weren't you going to say goodbye?
KATE Wrote you a note.
RAY You've been here almost 3 months, Annie. And every time I ask you about yourself, you get that look in your eye. Yeah, that one. So, I mind my own business. I figured maybe you got off on the wrong side of a bad relationship. Maybe you ran. I always knew you'd leave here someday. I guess I hoped it wouldn't be in the middle of the night.
KATE I'm sorry.
RAY Yeah, so am I.
RAY Hey, Annie, why don't you just stay one more night, eh? I'll drive you to the train station first thing in the morning. I promise.
KATE Okay.
RAY I get it, you know. Everyone deserves a fresh start.
Jack Damn it. Damn it.
JACK Just breathe. Come on, come on, look, look at me, look. What did you do?
KATE I was just checking to if he was... he jumped on me. He grabbed me. Is he... okay?
JACK He's not responding to antibiotics, he's bleeding internally, his fever's pushing 104. And his abdomen's rigid. He needs water.
KATE So, what are you going to do about it?
JACK About what?
KATE About him.
JACK I told you, he needs water.
KATE Will he suffer?
JACK What?
KATE Will it be quick?
JACK No. It won't be quick. 2, 3, maybe 4 days.
KATE And he'll feel it?
JACK Yeah, he'll feel it.
KATE Can't you put him out of his misery?
JACK I saw your mug shot, Kate. I am not a murderer.
RAY Do they listen to Patsy Cline in Canada?
KATE They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.
RAY You hungry?
KATE I'll eat on the train.
RAY You sure? There's a little place up here that makes a mean burger.
KATE What are you looking for, Ray?
RAY What?
KATE How long have you known?
RAY Couple of days. I saw your picture in the post office. I guess they knew you were Down Under.
KATE Why?
RAY The reward's 23,000 dollars. I told you when I met you, I've got a hell of a mortgage. If it makes you feel any better, it was a hard decision, Annie.
KATE My name's not Annie.
MICHAEL Hey, who was that guy you were hanging out with?
WALT What guy?
MICHAEL The bald guy.
WALT Oh, Mr. Locke?
MICHAEL Mr. Locke got any kids?
WALT He didn't say.
MICHAEL Yeah, what did he say?
WALT I don't know.
MICHAEL What do you mean you don't know. What did he say?
WALT Some of it's secret.
MICHAEL Did he tell you not to tell me?
WALT No.
MICHAEL Then what's the secret?
WALT Mr. Locke said a miracle happened to him.
MICHAEL Yeah, well, a miracle happened to all of us, Walt. We survived a plane crash. Look, I don't want you hanging around with him anymore.
WALT Why not? He's my friend.
MICHAEL Hey, I'm your friend, too.
WALT If you were my friend, you'd find Vincent.
MICHAEL Walt, look, I haven't given up on your dog. I'm going to do everything I can to find him.
WALT No you won't.
MICHAEL Yeah, Walt, I will.
WALT You don't care about Vincent.
MICHAEL I'm going to get your dog back as soon as it stops raining. Hey listen to me, I'm going to get your dog back. 
MICHAEL Yeah, soon as it stops raining - good, nice. I'm going to find your dog... yeah, I'm just going to go walking through the haunted damn jungle looking for your... Vincent?
MICHAEL Vincent? That you buddy?
MICHAEL Oh. Something was chasing me so, uh.. I don't hear it now. But you should probably head back. Uh, I didn't see anything, you know, if you're worried about it... I didn't see anything.
CHARLIE What are you making?
LOCKE Whistle.
CHARLIE I used some tribal flutes once in a recording session. I'm in a band.
SHANNON I wish he would just die already.
BOONE Real humane, Shannon.
SAYID Anything I can do to help?
JACK No, I'm good, thanks.
SAYID The others are getting upset. They want to know what's going on inside the tent.
JACK Trying to save his life.
SAYID Rumor has it you can't.
SAWYER Need a light?
SAWYER Came by to thank you. You going to ask what for?
KATE What for?
SAWYER For taking that gun away from me.
KATE I didn't take it away from you.
SAWYER It's sticking out of your denims, ain't it? I sure wouldn't want to be the one with that gun right now. Because everyone sitting out there listening to that poor boy scream all night knows what's got to be done. Only one that can do it is the one with that gun. Don't act so surprised. I heard you tell the hero the same thing. Hell, there's only one bullet left - be damned near poetic.
MARSHAL Listen to me.
JACK No, you need to keep quiet.
MARSHAL Listen to me, no matter what she does - no matter how she makes you feel, don't you trust a word that she says. She will do anything to get away.
JACK What did she do?
MARSHAL I want to talk to her.
JACK Tell me what she did.
MARSHAL I want to talk to her, alone. She got to you, too, huh?
MARSHAL Hey, Kate.
MARSHAL What was it?
KATE What?
MARSHAL The favor.
KATE I don't know what you're talking about.
MARSHAL The last thing I heard before the crash - you wanted a favor.
KATE I have one favor to ask.
MARSHAL Really? This ought to be good.
MARSHAL Well?
KATE I wanted you to make sure that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.
MARSHAL What—the guy who ratted you out?
KATE He had a hell of a mortgage.
MARSHAL You really are one of a kind. You know, you would have got away if you hadn't saved him.
KATE In case you hadn't noticed, I did get away.
MARSHAL You don't look free to me. Kate, I'm going to die, right?
KATE Yeah.
MARSHAL So, are you going to do it, or what?
HURLEY Yo, so, where's the fugitive?
JACK In the tent.
HURLEY You let her in there alone?
JACK What's she going to do? She's 120 pounds soaking wet.
HURLEY Yeah, but she's got that gun.
JACK What?
HURLEY She's strapped, man. I saw it in her... in her... in her... in her...
JACK Kate?!
JACK What did you do?
SAWYER What you couldn't. Look, I get where you're coming from being a doctor and all, but he wanted it. Hell, he asked me. So, I don't like it any more than you do, but something had to be done.
HURLEY Oh, no way. Guys?
JACK You shot him in the chest?
SAWYER I was aiming for his heart.
JACK You missed.
HURLEY Man, is he still breathing?
JACK You perforated his lung. It'll take hours to bleed out.
SAWYER So what is—I only had one bullet.
JACK Get out. Get out!
HURLEY Oh boy.
SAWYER Damn it!
LOCKE I found your son's dog.
MICHAEL What?
LOCKE Vincent-I tethered him to a tree just over there. I know that Walt lost his mom. I thought that you should be the one to bring his dog back to him.
MICHAEL Hey, thanks.
LOCKE Welcome.
KATE I want to tell you what I did - why he was after me.
JACK I don't want to know. It doesn't matter, Kate, who we were - what we did before this, before the crash. It doesn't really... 3 days ago we all died. We should all be able to start over.
KATE Okay.
JACK Okay.
