helen_norwood So, what did I do to deserve this?
john_locke What, can't a fella take his girl out for a picnic lunch just because?
helen_norwood Fella?
john_locke That's right, fella.
helen_norwood Where are you taking me?
john_locke I'm not telling, so just quit asking.
helen_norwood Can I be of any help?
john_locke You just read your obituaries and drink your coffee and I'll take care of the everything.
helen_norwood Don't knock the obits -- the nicest part of the paper. No one ever says anything mean about people once they're dead.
john_locke Mmm, and here I am thinking the funnies are the nicest part of the paper.
helen_norwood John? John, what's your father's name?
john_locke Why?
helen_norwood Is it Anthony -- Anthony Cooper?
john_locke Yes, that's right.
helen_norwood He's dead.
dr_jack_shephard Draw it again -- the map to your balloon.
ben_linus I was joking. I was making a joke. There's nothing out there besides my balloon. I was just frustrated. It was a stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.
john_locke It's too late anyway. She's already long gone, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard So, what's done is done?
john_locke That's right.
dr_jack_shephard Put him back in the armory.
ben_linus Why do you let him talk to you like that? Hey, wait, I...
john_locke Shut up!
ben_linus John, I'm sorry. John?
ana_lucia_cortez Maybe he's wrong. We should search the other side of the cliff.
sayid_jarrah We've been searching for 3 hours. This balloon does not exist. Charlie!
ana_lucia_cortez Then why did he draw the map?
sayid_jarrah You told him you would protect him whether we found this balloon or not. You've given him 2 more days to talk -- to figure how to escape. We're done. Charlie!!
charlie_pace Over here! This way! Sayid!
charlie_pace He said he buried her, right? His wife?
ana_lucia_cortez Why isn't it raining here?
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, you seen Ana Lucia?
hugo_reyes She took off into the jungle with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.
dr_jack_shephard Yesterday -- they say anything about where they were going?
hugo_reyes Well, that would, like, assume that anyone actually tells me anything. Maybe if I were in the loop I could be more helpful.
dr_jack_shephard There is no loop, Hurley.
claire_littleton Excuse me, Jack. He's been really hot and fussy. Do you mind having a look at him?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, sure, sure.
hugo_reyes Loop, dude, loop.
claire_littleton So, the fever's completely gone?
dr_jack_shephard Completely.
claire_littleton You're not just saying that, right? You seem a bit distracted.
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm fine. And so is Aaron.
claire_littleton Thanks.
libby_smith Doctor still in? I was grabbing for mussels in the tide pool -- pissed off a sea urchin.
dr_jack_shephard Well, it doesn't look infected. A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.
libby_smith Yeah, right, Neosporin. I think the current rate of exchange is 10 loads of laundry for a tube.
dr_jack_shephard Right.
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode17 VOICE 20 minutes to lockdown.
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode17 VOICE ... 17 minutes to lockdown.
ben_linus What was that? John, what's the matter?
helen_norwood You sure you want to do this? We could just go on that picnic, you know.
john_locke Soon, I promise.
helen_norwood Hey, maybe he left you his kidney?
father_chuck CHUCK For we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will live with the Lord forever.
father_chuck CHUCK We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to you, but we shall never be separated. And now we are united with Christ as we go toward him. Amen.
father_chuck CHUCK Do you wish to say anything, John?
john_locke I forgive you.
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode17 VOICE ... please proceed... protocol... please proceed...
ben_linus John? Hey, you out there? What's that noise? John? What's going on? Talk to me.
john_locke Will you be quiet!
ben_linus Tell me what's happening, what the hell is...
john_locke Will you shut up!!
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode17 VOICE 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
ben_linus Maybe you should get Jack?
john_locke I said, shut up!!!
LOUDSPEAKER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode17 VOICE 2, 1.
ben_linus What happened?
hugo_reyes I bet 4 papayas.
james_ford You can't bet; I just bet. You can either call or raise or lay 'em down, Muttonchops.
kate_austen Don't look at me.
dr_jack_shephard Lay 'em down, Hurley. He's got you beat.
hugo_reyes Dude, I got a killer hand, here.
dr_jack_shephard No, you don't.
hugo_reyes But you don't even know...
dr_jack_shephard You've a baby straight. He's got the flush.
kate_austen What about me? What do I got?
dr_jack_shephard Hard to say, but you're just playing for the fun of it.
kate_austen Well, fun's not bad. You should try it sometime.
dr_jack_shephard Don't call him, Hurley.
james_ford Hey, Amarillo Slim -- you think because you watch poker on TV you can tussle with the big boys?
dr_jack_shephard I've got to head back to the Hatch.
james_ford Hatch ain't going nowhere, Doc. How about you put your mangoes where your mouth is?
dr_jack_shephard I guess I could play a hand or two.
ben_linus Hey, what's going on?
ben_linus Are you still out there? John? John?
john_locke I'm here.
ben_linus What were those noises?! What's wrong?! Did something...
john_locke Nothing is wrong!
noor_abed_jaseem So what's the verdict, Mr. Locke?
john_locke The seismic bolting is all first rate; there's no visible mold, no dry rot. It'll all be in my report, but I think you and your husband got a pretty nice house.
noor_abed_jaseem If I had a husband I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.
john_locke If you'll just sign this invoice.
anthony_cooper Hello, son.
john_locke What do you want?
anthony_cooper Look, John, I know what I did to you was wrong.
john_locke You stole my kidney.
anthony_cooper I was dying.
john_locke You could've asked me. You could have just asked me. What do you want from me?
anthony_cooper I killed myself off because there are 2 men out there who were going to beat me to it.
john_locke What'd you do, steal their livers?
anthony_cooper No, I took them for 700,000 dollars -- retirement con. I put the money in a safe deposit box, but these 2 guys may be sitting on the bank to see if I show my face -- which is why I need you to go in there and get it for me.
john_locke You think I'm stupid?
anthony_cooper I want you to take 200 grand of it. It won't make up for what I did to you, but it's the best I can do. I'll be at the Flightline motel -- it's out by the airport -- until tomorrow afternoon. Then I'm gone, money or no money. And, John, if I don't see you again? I'll understand.
john_locke We're locked in.
ben_linus What?
john_locke These blast doors came down. The whole living area is sealed off. I can't get out.
ben_linus Did you try to pry...
john_locke Yeah, but I couldn't -- maybe, maybe if the 2 of us.
ben_linus You want me to help you?
john_locke Yeah.
ben_linus And if I do help you get these doors up then you're just going to lock me back in here, aren't you?
john_locke That's right.
ben_linus Then I'm going to need your word, John. I'm going to need your word that you won't let your people do anything to me.
john_locke Well, if you're who you say you are then what are you worried about?
ben_linus Things have happened to them -- things that I have nothing to do with. But they've got no one to blame except for me. So I'm going to need your word that you'll protect me, no matter what.
john_locke Who are you?
ben_linus My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. And I crashed on this island just like you.
john_locke Alright, you have my word.
hugo_reyes Dude, you got me.
kate_austen I'm out.
james_ford Think you're in my head, Doc?
dr_jack_shephard You've still got 3 papayas -- call or fold.
james_ford Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand. Pocket queens makes me the set.
dr_jack_shephard King's wired.
hugo_reyes Whoa, dude.
dr_jack_shephard But at least I'm not in your head. Well, I guess that's it.
james_ford What do you mean, "it"?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, you're busted. I got it all. It wouldn't really be fair for you to go pick more mangoes.
james_ford Oh, I've got a hell of lot more than mangoes. You want to play real stakes, name 'em?
dr_jack_shephard It's a pile of fruit, man.
james_ford And I want it back.
kate_austen Should I go and get a ruler?
james_ford Fun time's over, Mongo. Why don't you go hit the buffet?
hugo_reyes But, I want to...
kate_austen Come on, Hurley. Let's go leave these boys to their sandbox.
james_ford One more hand, Doc. What's it going to take?
dr_jack_shephard The medicine you stole from the armory, all of it.
john_locke Let's go. Harder.
ben_linus I'm losing it.
john_locke The tool box. Get the tool box -- that'll hold it.
ben_linus You sure?
john_locke Get it! Come on, put it under.
ben_linus John, John, wait, don't just...
john_locke You have to stop the door. Put something else under the door. Come on, come on.
john_locke Stack 'em, stack 'em. You have to stop the pressure. Come on, come on, come on.
ben_linus Alright, alright, let's get you out. Come on.
john_locke No, no, stop, stop, stop!
ben_linus Alright, we'll wait 'til somebody comes down. Alright? It's only a matter of time, yeah?
john_locke No we don't have time.
john_locke Honey, put on your Sunday best! I'm taking you out to paint...
helen_norwood John, we have visitors.
helen_norwood Um, these men say they knew your father.
jimmy_bane Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.
john_locke I'm sure Helen told you I didn't really know him...
jimmy_bane She told me. But I'd like to ask you a couple questions if that's okay.
john_locke Sure, of course.
jimmy_bane Have you seen your father since he died, Mr. Locke?
john_locke Wh-have-have I...?
jimmy_bane Well, we were thinking possibly he's not dead, and maybe you know that? I mean, for his son, you didn't look too shook up at his funeral.
helen_norwood How dare you? If you had any idea what that man did to him -- what that son-of-bitch...
john_locke Helen, hey Helen.
helen_norwood We were there to get past him, to get on with our lives, to let him go. Get out of here.
john_locke Helen, hey.
jimmy_bane Okay. Okay, just one thing before we go. What's in the bag, John?
john_locke Work papers and stuff. I'm a home inspector.
jimmy_bane You won't mind if we take a look?
jimmy_bane Well, there you go. Thanks for the coffee, miss.
john_locke Helen, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
helen_norwood Were you lying to those men, John?
john_locke No, I was scared. I was -- I was scared.
james_ford So, where'd you learn to play cards, Doc?
dr_jack_shephard Phuket.
james_ford What the hell were you doing in Thailand? What, you don't think I know where Phuket is? Just because I dropped out in 9th grade don't make me an idiot. Far East, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for a world traveler. That where you got the art on your shoulder?
dr_jack_shephard How about you deal again?
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard This time from the top of the deck.
james_ford Well, I had to try.
ben_linus What does it do?
john_locke We're not exactly sure.
ben_linus And you push it...
john_locke Every 108 minutes, yeah.
ben_linus How soon does this alarm go off?
john_locke Very -- which is why I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
ben_linus Grate's bolted shut. I tried it.
john_locke There's another grate in the pantry. You can get up through there. Take the vent into the dome.
ben_linus Maybe we should wait.
john_locke We can't wait; it's going to go off any minute. I trusted you, Henry, now you've got to trust me. That button has to be pushed.
ben_linus Okay, what do I do?
john_locke Once you're inside, you'll hear the alarm beeping, and you just have to enter the Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, and then you press execute. It has to be exactly those numbers in exactly that order. Now do you...
ben_linus 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. I got it.
john_locke Can you reach it?!
ben_linus I think so.
john_locke Be careful!
john_locke Henry?!
john_locke Henry?!
libby_smith What's going on?
hugo_reyes Jack and Sawyer are finally going to beat each other up.
dr_jack_shephard 10 mangoes.
james_ford Okay, I'll call you with the aspirin and raise you with a bottle of Amoxicilin.
dr_jack_shephard Do you even know what Amoxicilin is?
james_ford You may have been to Phuket, Doc, but I've been to Tallahassee. Let's just say something was burning and it wasn't from the sunshine.
dr_jack_shephard I'm all in.
james_ford Well, that's the move of a man who wants me to lay it down.
dr_jack_shephard You're not going to lay it down.
james_ford I'm not, huh? Why's that?
dr_jack_shephard Because there's a bunch of people watching us right now and you don't want them to see you lose. Again.
james_ford Well alright, I call. What you got? Pair a 9s? You pushed in with a pair of 9's?!
dr_jack_shephard You got me. Let's see 'em.
dr_jack_shephard Guess it was enough, huh?
james_ford Son-of-a-bitch.
dr_jack_shephard I'll come get the meds later.
james_ford Hey, when I asked you what you wanted for stakes -- why didn't you ask for the guns?
dr_jack_shephard When I need the guns, I'll get the guns.
john_locke Henry, get up, damn it. Henry! Henry, are you alright?
ben_linus What happened?
john_locke Listen to me, you have to get up into the vents and enter the numbers in the computer.
ben_linus How long was I...
john_locke Please, you have to go right now; we're running out of time!
ben_linus Okay, yeah.
john_locke Be careful!
john_locke Henry?! Henry, can you hear me?
john_locke Henry? Henry?
anthony_cooper Yeah, who is it?
john_locke It's John. Can I come in?
anthony_cooper Yeah, of course.
anthony_cooper Any problems.
john_locke Nope.
anthony_cooper Your date at my funeral -- she got a name?
john_locke Helen.
anthony_cooper That's a nice name -- pretty girl, too.
john_locke I'm, uh, I'm going to ask her to marry me -- tonight, actually.
anthony_cooper Well, good for you. Congratulations.
john_locke Yeah, thanks.
anthony_cooper Your share -- should buy you a nice honeymoon.
john_locke I didn't do this for the money.
anthony_cooper Then why did you do it? Well, alright, um -- my plane, I gotta -- I gotta cab waiting. If you don't want the cash, the maid's going to get a hell of a tip. Bye, John.
helen_norwood Are you him?
anthony_cooper Listen, sweetheart...
helen_norwood How could you? How could you do this to him? We were moving past this.
john_locke Helen, wait. Helen, wait, you don't understand. I was going to tell you everything.
helen_norwood You lied to me.
john_locke No, please, I can explain.
helen_norwood You looked me right in the eye and you lied to me! You made your choice, John. You need his love more than mine.
john_locke No, my choice is you. I was going to -- I love you. No, please. Please, Helen. I love you and I want to spend my life with you and, and I can't live without you. Helen, so -- so, will you marry me?
john_locke Helen.
john_locke Henry! Henry!!
john_locke Please say something.
john_locke Henry!
john_locke Henry? Anybody here?
john_locke Is anybody here? Henry!
john_locke You came back.
ben_linus What, did you think I was going to leave you here? Come on, can you stand?
john_locke I don't -- I think so. Thank you, Henry. Thank you for not leaving me.
ben_linus You're welcome, John.
kate_austen Hey, hey, Jack. Wait up. You heading up to the Hatch?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen Mind if I join? It's been a while since I had a shower and I was just hoping that...
dr_jack_shephard Actually, the plumbing's busted.
kate_austen Busted?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, water's been running muddy. I guess we've got a cracked pipe but it's going to take some time to find it.
kate_austen Oh, well, I guess I wasted a trip, then.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'll let you know as soon as we get things worked out down there.
kate_austen Right. I'm glad you beat Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard You know what? The Hatch can wait until morning -- if you'd like me to walk you back to the beach.
kate_austen Do you see that?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard It's a parachute.
dr_jack_shephard Wait.
kate_austen It's food.
charlie_pace What the bloody hell is that?
dr_jack_shephard What'd you find?
ben_linus I've got you, easy, easy.
ben_linus Sorry.
john_locke What did you do -- what did you do to end it -- to make the doors go up?
ben_linus I did what you told me to. I punched in the code and pressed the execute button, but nothing happened other than that clock flipping back. I was climbing back into the vent when the lights went out. 10 seconds later the doors went up. I didn't do anything.
john_locke You think it was all just random?
ben_linus Don't look at me; it's your hatch.
dr_jack_shephard Get away from him.
ben_linus Wait, you don't...
sayid_jarrah Step back, right now.
john_locke Sayid, it's okay.
dr_jack_shephard I said, "get away"!
john_locke I let him out -- some kind of lockdown or something -- he, he was helping me.
ben_linus Couldn't you find my balloon?
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, we found it.
sayid_jarrah We did find your balloon, Henry Gale, exactly how you described it. We also found the grave you described -- your wife's grave. The grave you said you dug with your own bare hands. It was all there. Your whole story -- your alibi -- it was true. But still I did not believe it to be true. So I dug up that grave and found that there was not a woman inside. There was a man. A man named Henry Gale.
