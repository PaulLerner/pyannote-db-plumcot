dr_daniel_faraday Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it? The hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury. Where is it?
richard_alpert Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk. Okay? Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.
dr_daniel_faraday I'm gonna give you three seconds. One...
richard_alpert Don't do this.
kate_austen What's he doing down there? Jack, he's crazy.
dr_jack_shephard Is he? What if this is why we're here? What if this is our one chance to put things back the way they're supposed to be?
dr_jack_shephard No.
kate_austen What the hell do you think you're doing?!
dr_jack_shephard They shot him! I'm gonna go help.
kate_austen Yeah, they're gonna shoot you, too. We have to go, Jack. We have to go now.
kate_austen Jack!
2ND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN Don't you move!
2ND#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN Don't move.
kate_austen Hey!
middleaged_charles_widmore Just who the bloody hell might you be?
middleaged_charles_widmore Eloise! What happened?
richard_alpert This man walked into camp and put a gun to my head, and Eloise... reacted. Where'd you find them?
middleaged_charles_widmore Crouched in the bushes... like rats.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Did you two come here with this man?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Put them in my tent.
middleaged_charles_widmore Would you care to tell me, Eloise, why the DHARMA Initiative seems to have declared war on us?
middleaged_eloise_hawking These people aren't from the DHARMA Initiative, Charles.
middleaged_charles_widmore Then where the hell are they from?
vanessa Richard, he's here.
john_locke I brought dinner.
richard_alpert John?
john_locke Hello, Richard. It's been a while.
richard_alpert It's--it's been, uh, three years. What happened? What--where--where were you?
john_locke I'll explain on the way.
richard_alpert On the way where?
john_locke It's gonna be night soon. You and I have an errand to run, and we don't have a lot of time.
john_locke What's wrong?
richard_alpert Something different about you.
john_locke I have a purpose now.
richard_alpert What's he doing here?
john_locke He helped me get back.
sunhwa_kwon Why did Locke say these were his people?
ben_linus When I left the Island, John stepped in. He's the leader now.
sunhwa_kwon Who's that man he's talking to?
ben_linus His name is Richard Alpert. He's a kind of... adviser. And he has had that job for a very, very long time.
ben_linus Sun? What are you...
sunhwa_kwon Were you here in 1977?
richard_alpert Excuse me?
sunhwa_kwon These people... Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, Hugo Reyes. They were here with my husband--Jin Kwon. Were you here? Do you remember them? A--any of them?
richard_alpert Yes, I was here 30 years ago. And I do. I remember these people. I remember meeting them very clearly, because... I watched them all die.
john_locke Drink of water?
sunhwa_kwon Do you think it's true? They're all dead?
john_locke I don't think we went through all this for nothing, Sun.
richard_alpert I'm ready, John.
john_locke You still have that compass I gave you?
richard_alpert A little rusty, but she can still find north.
john_locke Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.
ben_linus What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people? Afraid I'll stage a coup?
john_locke I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.
ben_linus Well, in that case, I'd love to come.
john_locke Good. Stay here. We'll be back in a couple of hours. I'll see what I can find out. But whatever happens, Sun, you have my word--if there's a way for you and Jin to be together again, if there's a way to save our people... I'll find it.
dr_jack_shephard Take it easy on her!
erik Don't talk. Understand?
kate_austen Are you okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
kate_austen You know, before we were caught... you said that we needed to put things back the way they were supposed to be. What did you mean by that?
dr_jack_shephard If we can do what Faraday said... our plane never crashes... Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles. And everyone we lost since we got here... they'd all be alive.
kate_austen And what about us? We just... go on living our life because we've never met?
dr_jack_shephard All the misery that we've been through... we'd just wipe it clean. Never happened.
kate_austen It was not all misery.
dr_jack_shephard Enough of it was.
middleaged_eloise_hawking The man I shot... what did he need the bomb for?
middleaged_eloise_hawking I need you to tell me why he needed the bomb.
dr_jack_shephard I don't think you'd believe me if I did.
middleaged_eloise_hawking When I was 17 years old, I took a young man to the bomb. He proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground, then things would work out splendidly. When I asked him how he could be so sure... he said that he was from the future. And then he disappeared, right in front of my bloody eyes. Ten minutes ago, I shot that man in the back. And before he... died... he told me that he... he said he was my son. Explain to me... and you have my word I will believe you. How is this my handwriting if I don't remember writing it?
dr_jack_shephard Because you haven't written it yet. I know this is hard to understand, but... what you just did... it was an accident, and I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.
middleaged_eloise_hawking What?
dr_jack_shephard Your son came back here because he had figured out a way to change things. He doesn't have to be dead. You don't have to have killed him. If we do what's written in that journal... none of this will have happened.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Does he know what he's talking about?
kate_austen He thinks he does.
middleaged_eloise_hawking All right then, I'll take you to the bomb. Just... one small issue, however. We secured it over 20 years ago underground. But since that time, it appears that someone's built an entire village over it.
dr_jack_shephard The DHARMA Initiative?
middleaged_eloise_hawking However... it appears that you two have been passing yourselves off as members, so... I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.
dr_jack_shephard Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that.
stuart_radzinsky That woman--where is she now?
james_ford Call my lawyer.
horace_goodspeed Stuart! What the hell are you doing?
stuart_radzinsky I'm getting answers. Where is she?!
horace_goodspeed Hey. Hey! Stop! Damn it, stop. That is an order. I'm still in charge here.
stuart_radzinsky No, you were in charge, Horace. But if we're gonna protect our people and all the work we're doing here, you don't have the stomach for what happens next.
stuart_radzinsky Phil.
stuart_radzinsky Okay, Jim, last chance. You tell me where she is...
stuart_radzinsky ...or so help me God, I will kill you.
dr_juliet_burke Hey!
stuart_radzinsky You ready to talk now?
james_ford Nope.
stuart_radzinsky Believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim. So why don't you tell me where your girlfriend took the boy? She bring him to the Hostiles? You know where they are?
dr_juliet_burke Aah! Stop! Please!
stuart_radzinsky You want me to stop? Then tell me what I want to know!
dr_juliet_burke Stuart, please. We have known each other for three years. We are not bad people! We are not here to hurt you!
james_ford Juliet... don't. Whatever you tell 'em, they ain't gonna believe you. It's only gonna get more people hurt.
horace_goodspeed What are we doing, man? Beating him is pointless. Okay? He's not gonna talk.
phil I can make him talk.
james_ford Son of a bitch!
horace_goodspeed Easy. Easy.
james_ford You're a dead man, Phil. I'm gonna kill you.
mitch Mr. Radzinsky? There's still no sign of Miles or Jin. But the recruits from last week... I got their sub's manifest from Amy. There were three last-minute add-ons. They were the two people that shot at you--Shephard and Austen--and one guy we can't track down. He's gotta be a part of this.
stuart_radzinsky Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?
phil He's the fat guy.
hugo_reyes So what's the rescue plan?
miles_straume Rescue plan? We're heading to the beach. Why do you think we sent you for food?
hugo_reyes But they got Sawyer and Juliet.
miles_straume And there are 30 of them, and they all have guns. The only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.
hugo_reyes We gotta do something. I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.
miles_straume Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?
dr_pierre_chang I could ask you the same question.
hugo_reyes But we asked you first.
dr_pierre_chang Your friend Faraday said that you were from the future. I need to know if he was telling the truth.
hugo_reyes Dude, that's ridiculous.
dr_pierre_chang What year were you born? What year?
hugo_reyes Uh... 1931?
dr_pierre_chang You're 46?
hugo_reyes Yeah. Yes, I am.
dr_pierre_chang So you fought in the Korean War?
hugo_reyes There's... no such thing.
dr_pierre_chang Who's the President of the United States?
hugo_reyes All right, dude, we're from the future. Sorry.
dr_pierre_chang It's true then? You are my son?
miles_straume Yeah, it's true.
dr_pierre_chang Your friend--the physicist--he also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the Island. He said there was going to be a massive accident at the Swan. Now is that true?
miles_straume He's been right about everything so far. If Faraday said get people off the Island... I'd do it.
dr_pierre_chang Well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.
middleaged_charles_widmore Tell me something. Why is it that this man looks... familiar to me?
middleaged_eloise_hawking Richard... you and Erik are coming with me.
middleaged_charles_widmore Going with you where?
middleaged_eloise_hawking You can untie them. And... would you mind giving us a moment? I'm taking them to the bomb.
middleaged_charles_widmore What? Are you insane? I'm worried about you. Not in your condition.
dr_jack_shephard Who is he?
richard_alpert The man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore. He and Eloise are... well, let's just say love can be complicated.
middleaged_eloise_hawking All right. Let's move out.
richard_alpert So, John... you, uh, you ready to tell me where you've been the last three years?
john_locke You really don't know?
richard_alpert Well, I know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel, that you and I were sitting on a log. There was a bright light. There was a loud noise, and then you just... you disappeared.
john_locke Well, Richard, you're just about to see where I disappeared to. And after we're finished with that, I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.
ben_linus That's... not how it works, John.
john_locke Is that true, Richard? Is this gonna be a problem?
richard_alpert You just got back, John. There's no reason to rush into--
john_locke I am the leader now. Right?
richard_alpert Yes, John. That's right.
john_locke Good. Then I would like you to take me to Jacob. Can you do that?
richard_alpert Yeah, of course.
john_locke Fantastic. Let's keep moving. We're almost to the plane.
ben_linus What plane?
john_locke It's a Beechcraft--used to smuggle heroin. Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here. All right, Richard, listen very carefully because you're only gonna have about three minutes to get this right.
richard_alpert Get what right?
john_locke A man's about to walk out of the jungle. He's been shot in the leg.
john_locke You'll need this to get the bullet out.
richard_alpert Uh, I'm sorry, John. I'm not--
john_locke Now just listen. This is the important part. You're gonna need to tell him that he has to bring everyone who left back to the Island. And when he asks how to do that... You tell him he's gonna have to die.
ben_linus Who is that man, John?
john_locke Me.
john_locke Aah!
john_locke Richard?
john_locke Richard... What is happening?
richard_alpert What's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Okay, here.
richard_alpert I need to get the bullet out.
john_locke How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
richard_alpert Because you told me there was, John.
john_locke No, no. No, I didn't.
richard_alpert Well... you will.
ben_linus This must be quite the out-of-body experience.
john_locke Something like that.
ben_linus Your timing was impeccable, John. How did you know when to be here?
john_locke The Island told me. Didn't it ever tell you things?
ben_linus No, John. And clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is, or you wouldn't need Richard to show you.
john_locke You've never seen him.
ben_linus What?
john_locke Jacob. You've never seen him, have you?
ben_linus What just happened? Where did you go?
john_locke To give Richard his compass back.
richard_alpert You want the bullet?
john_locke Keep it. Everything go all right?
richard_alpert Well, you--you seemed pretty convinced, especially when I said you were gonna die. I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.
john_locke Actually, Richard, it did. We better get back to camp.
dr_pierre_chang You need to evacuate the Island of all nonessential personnel, and you need to do it...
dr_pierre_chang What the hell is going on here?
stuart_radzinsky Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan right now, Chang? We're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.
dr_pierre_chang We're under imminent threat. If we start drilling, there's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.
stuart_radzinsky We are drilling and on schedule.
dr_pierre_chang Horace, you're in charge.
stuart_radzinsky He's not in charge anymore. This is my decision, and it's been made. We keep working.
james_ford Put us on the sub.
james_ford He's right. It ain't safe. Put the women and children on the sub and get 'em the hell out of here. And if you put me and Juliet on the sub with 'em... we'll tell you anything you wanna know. You okay with that, sweetheart?
dr_juliet_burke Absolutely.
stuart_radzinsky You want on that sub, Jim?
stuart_radzinsky Draw me a map. I wanna know exactly where the Hostiles are.
middleaged_eloise_hawking You two know how to swim?
kate_austen Why don't we just go around it?
middleaged_eloise_hawking No, dear, we need to go in. We have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.
kate_austen I'm not going.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen I'm gonna go back and find everyone else. I... I can't go any further with you, Jack. Not this time.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, you can't go back there now. They know about us. They... they tried to kill us.
kate_austen And what are you trying to do? Bye, Jack.
erik You're not going anywhere.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, you don't need to do that.
middleaged_eloise_hawking We're not in the habit of telling our secrets to strangers, then just letting them saunter off.
kate_austen You know I don't care about your secrets. I just wanna leave.
dr_jack_shephard Look, just put the gun--
erik Step away!
dr_jack_shephard If she wants to leave--
erik Hey! I said stop!
dr_jack_shephard --she can leave!
richard_alpert What are we doing here, Eloise? That man just killed one of our own people, and you're acting like it doesn't matter.
middleaged_eloise_hawking If these people are right about what they're about to do, Richard, it won't matter.
richard_alpert And what are they about to do?
sayid_jarrah So you're telling me you're going to erase the last three years of our lives?
dr_jack_shephard We can change things, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah I don't know if you're aware of this, but I've already changed things. I killed Benjamin Linus, and we're all still here.
kate_austen It's because you didn't kill him. Sawyer and me took him to the Others so that they could save him.
sayid_jarrah Why did you do that?
kate_austen Why did I do that? Since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs become okay?
dr_jack_shephard The three of us disappeared off that plane and ended up here, ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.
kate_austen And if you're wrong, then everyone on the Island dies. Do you understand that?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it. This is why we're here. This is our destiny.
kate_austen Do you know who you sound like? Because he was crazy, too, Jack. You said so yourself.
dr_jack_shephard Well, maybe I was wrong.
kate_austen No, you were right. I'm going back to find the rest of our people, because if I can't stop you, then maybe they can.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode15 The submarine departs in 30 minutes. All evacuees, please proceed to the dock.
JEANNETTE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode15 LEWIS Come now, Charlotte.
young_charlotte Just stay with me.
lara This is ridiculous. I can help you.
dr_pierre_chang No, Lara, you can't. Just go over there.
lara Why are you so angry?
dr_pierre_chang I want you to leave, now!
hugo_reyes Why is he yelling at her, dude?
miles_straume It's the only way he can get her to leave.
hugo_reyes Sorry, man.
jinsoo_kwon We'd better get going.
miles_straume Wait! Whoa! Whoa! Wait--wait a second.
miles_straume It's Jim and Juliet. Why the hell are they... putting them on the sub?
hugo_reyes Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Sawyer always has a plan, right?
james_ford We'll buy Microsoft.
dr_juliet_burke Excuse me?
james_ford Then we'll bet the Cowboys in the '78 Super Bowl. We're gonna be rich. Look, I'm sorry. I should've listened to you when you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.
dr_juliet_burke I'm glad you talked me out of it.
mitch Come on, LaFleur. Get in.
james_ford Ladies first.
james_ford Good riddance.
dr_jack_shephard If I don't see you the other side, I won't blame you.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Now take a deep breath and follow Richard under.
middleaged_eloise_hawking There's an opening in the bottom of the rocks at the far side.
dr_jack_shephard That was a lot further than I thought it was. Where are we?
richard_alpert The tunnels.
dr_jack_shephard You wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?
richard_alpert The same way we brought it in.
dr_jack_shephard I assume you don't mean through the pool.
richard_alpert It's a 12-foot long, 40,000-pound hydrogen bomb. No, not through the pool.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't think you'd come.
sayid_jarrah Well, if this works, you might just save us all. And if it doesn't? At least you'll put us out of our misery.
middleaged_eloise_hawking All right. Let's get started.
richard_alpert I'll have a tent prepared for you, John. We'll get going first thing in the morning.
john_locke I thought we could leave right now.
richard_alpert Now?
john_locke I'm eager.
richard_alpert We can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us should go to my tent and talk about--
john_locke Is this everyone?
richard_alpert Well, there's another group at the Temple, but--
john_locke Well, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to everyone here now.
richard_alpert Of course. Be my guest.
john_locke Hello, everyone. My name is John Locke. I've been told that... for some time, you all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob. And yet, oddly enough, it seems that no one has actually seen him. Now I'm sure there are very good reasons why his existence and whereabouts are secret. I just don't know what they are.
john_locke And to be honest with all of you, if there's a man telling us what to do, I want to know who he is.
sunhwa_kwon This man--Jacob? Can he tell us how to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?
john_locke Absolutely. Richard has agreed to show us where we need to go. So I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now. And I'd like all of you to come with me.
richard_alpert I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.
ben_linus Why do you think I tried to kill him?
mitch We're shovin' off in two minutes. Appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.
james_ford Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.
dr_juliet_burke What are we gonna do when we get to Ann Arbor?
james_ford We ain't going to Ann Arbor.
dr_juliet_burke What do you mean?
james_ford These guys ain't cops. They got no authority over us back in the real world. So once we dock, wherever we dock... we're free.
dr_juliet_burke "Real world." I don't even know what that means anymore.
james_ford Hey, come here.
james_ford Whatever happens, I got your back, remember?
dr_juliet_burke I love you.
james_ford I love you back.
phil Hold on! Don't close the hatch! Horace wants her off the Island, too. We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them. Actually caught her coming back into town. Cuff her over there with the others.
kate_austen Hey.
james_ford Hey.

sayid_jarrah Jack. I'm sure it's occurred to you that this woman's motivation in helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb is only to annihilate the DHARMA Initiative.
dr_jack_shephard Yes, but I still trust her.
sayid_jarrah Why?
dr_jack_shephard Because 30 years from now, she's the one who's gonna tell us how to get back to the Island.
sayid_jarrah And that makes you trust her?
middleaged_eloise_hawking Well... now what?
john_locke Beautiful day, isn't it?
ben_linus Yes... so far. Richard had some concerns.
john_locke Concerns about what?
ben_linus This pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable. He's expressed... reservations about whether or not you know what the hell you're doing.
john_locke I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Ben.
ben_linus I know we've had our differences in the past, John, but I'm here to follow you now. So if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, then I'll do whatever--
john_locke I'm not interested in being reunited with my people.
ben_linus What do you mean? You told Sun--
john_locke I know what I told her, but that's not why we're going to Jacob.
ben_linus Then why are we going to Jacob?
john_locke So I can kill him.
