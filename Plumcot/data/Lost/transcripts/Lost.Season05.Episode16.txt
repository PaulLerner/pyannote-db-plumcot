man_in_black IN BLACK Morning.
jacob Mornin'.
man_in_black IN BLACK Mind if I join you?
jacob Please. Want some fish?
man_in_black IN BLACK Thank you. I just ate.
jacob I take it you're here 'cause of the ship.
man_in_black IN BLACK I am. How did they find the Island?
jacob You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.
man_in_black IN BLACK I don't have to ask. You brought them here. Still trying to prove me wrong, aren't you?
jacob You are wrong.
man_in_black IN BLACK Am I? They come. They fight. They destroy. They corrupt. It always ends the same.
jacob It only ends once. Anything that happens before that is just progress.
man_in_black IN BLACK Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?
jacob Yes.
man_in_black IN BLACK One of these days, sooner or later... I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.
jacob Well, when you do, I'll be right here.
man_in_black IN BLACK Always nice talking to you, Jacob.
jacob Nice talking to you, too.
kate_austen Are you gonna do it?
young_tom Uh-uh. You do it.
kate_austen Fine, I'll do it. But you're gonna be lookout, okay?
young_tom Okay.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Yeah, I mean, we've been farming the land all the way back to Aines Road.
SHOPKEEPER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 What you kids got there? Open your bag.
SHOPKEEPER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Mhm. Where'd you get this?
kate_austen I got it over there.
SHOPKEEPER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 I know you. You're Diane Austen's girl...what's your name?
kate_austen Katie.
SHOPKEEPER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Well Katie, I'm calling your mom, then the cops, because I don't tolerate stealing here, you understand?
man_in_black No need to do that. I'll pay for it. I hope this is enough.
SHOPKEEPER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Well, as long as somebody pays for it, I guess there's no harm done. But I don't want to see you in here ever again without your parents, you understand me?
kate_austen Thanks, mister.
jacob You're welcome. You're not going to steal anymore, are you?
jacob Be good, Katie.
captain_bird BIRD Welcome aboard, everyone. We will be doing some system checks offshore here before heading out into the open ocean and submerging to our operational running depth. You should be receiving your sedatives and then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.
captain_bird BIRD Have a nice rest, and we'll see you on the other side.
kate_austen We have to get out of here.
james_ford Outta here? We're underwater. What the hell are you doing here? How'd you get caught?
kate_austen I came back to get you.
james_ford Came back to get me for what?
dr_juliet_burke Where's Jack?
kate_austen Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.
james_ford Why the hell would he do that?
kate_austen Does it matter? We have to stop him.
james_ford Sorry, but I'll pass.
kate_austen Did you hear what I just said?
james_ford Yeah, I heard you. You just don't get it, Kate. We were happy in Dharmaville 'til y'all showed up. But now that's all over. So we're gonna drink our O.J. and take our chances in the real world. Jack wants to blow up the Island, good for Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Is there anything in there about how we were supposed to move a ten-ton bomb across the Island?
sayid_jarrah Actually, it's twenty tons. Fortunately, it seems Faraday never intended freight the device in its entirety.
middleaged_eloise_hawking What?
sayid_jarrah He left detailed instructions on how to remove the plutonium core...and how to detonate it.
dr_jack_shephard Faraday told me that we needed to wipe out some kind of pocket of energy. Is only part of the bomb going to be enough to do that?
sayid_jarrah The core itself is a thermonuclear weapon. It'll be more than enough.
richard_alpert Hey, hey, wait. We sealed that thing up twenty years ago, and we put it underground because it was emitting radiation. Does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise?
middleaged_eloise_hawking Richard --
richard_alpert You're pregnant.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Which is exactly why we have to help them see this through.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Once the core is removed, then what?
sayid_jarrah Then, we have approximately two hours to take it to the Swan site.
dr_jack_shephard Two hours?
sayid_jarrah When Faraday returned to the Island, he was very explicit about this timetable.
dr_jack_shephard Well then, we better get moving.
stuart_radzinsky Who stopped the damn drill!?
dr_pierre_chang I did.
stuart_radzinsky Why?
dr_pierre_chang Because when we passed seventy meters, the drill temp went up sixty degrees, and I didn't want it to melt.
stuart_radzinsky Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water. So cool it down and turn it on.
dr_pierre_chang Stuart, we just evacuated the Island of all nonessential personnel. We're in the midst of a possible insurrection. Do you really think this is the ideal time for your experiments?
stuart_radzinsky I've been working on this project for six years. Designing a station that'll be able to manipulate electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.
dr_pierre_chang Have you thought about the consequences of drilling into that pocket? We have no idea what we are gonna --
stuart_radzinsky If Edison was only worried about the consequences, we'd all still be sitting in the dark. I came to this Island to change the world, Pierre; that's exactly what I intend to do. Let's get it started!
john_locke Take five, everybody! We've still got a ways to go to get to Jacob.
sunhwa_kwon Who's Jacob?
ben_linus He's in charge of this Island.
sunhwa_kwon You said John was in charge.
ben_linus No, I said he was the leader, a title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary. But everyone answers to someone, and the leader answers to Jacob.
sunhwa_kwon What's he like?
ben_linus I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.
john_locke You've been staring for the last ten minutes, Richard. Is there something you'd like to ask me?
richard_alpert Ben told me that he strangled you.
john_locke That is my recollection, yes.
richard_alpert He said he was sure you were dead. That he saw your coffin loaded onto that plane that you came back on. How are you alive?
john_locke Well, you've been on this Island much longer than I have, Richard. If anyone should have an explanation, I'd think it would be you.
richard_alpert I - I have been here a long time, John. And I have seen things on this Island that I could barely describe, but I've never seen someone come back to life.
john_locke And I've never seen anyone who doesn't age. Doesn't mean it can't happen.
richard_alpert I'm this way because of Jacob. And if I had to guess, he's the reason you're not in that coffin anymore.
john_locke I agree completely, Richard. That's why I'm doing this. So I can thank him. Once I've done that, we're gonna need to deal with the rest of the passengers from the Ajira flight that brought me here.
richard_alpert What do you mean, 'deal with them'?
john_locke You know what I mean.
john_locke Let's go!
ilana_verdansky Untie the crate.
bram Why'd we even bring this yahoo?
ilana_verdansky Because, we might need him.
bram For what? He didn't know the answer to the question.
ilana_verdansky That doesn't mean he's not important.
bram What, you think he's a candidate?
ilana_verdansky He's awake.
bram How long you been listening to us?
frank_lapidus Long enough to wonder what the hell I'm a candidate for. Who the hell are you people?
ilana_verdansky We're friends.
frank_lapidus So you smack all your friends in the face with a rifle, shove 'em in a boat, and kidnap 'em?
ilana_verdansky Only the ones we like.
bram Let's go.
frank_lapidus What's in the box?
bram Your call.
ilana_verdansky Open it.
frank_lapidus Terrific.
man_in_black Need a pen, son?
JAMES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Yeah, thanks.
jacob Here you go. You can keep it.
jacob I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.
uncle_doug DOUG Come on, Jimmy. We gotta get to the cemetery, okay? What you writin'?
JAMES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Nothin'.
uncle_doug Dear Mr. Sawyer... You don't know who I am, but I know who you are, and what you done. Listen to me, Jimmy. I know you're angry at the man that did this to your momma and daddy. And hell, you got every right to be. But you gotta move on, boy. They're gone, and there ain't nothing you can do to change that. What's done is done. Now promise me you're not going to finish that letter.
JAMES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 I promise.
uncle_doug Good. Come on, let's go say goodbye.
james_ford Let me get this straight. Jack sets off the nuke, which somehow...resets everything. So flight 815 never crashes...lands in L.A. safe and sound, and none of this ever happened.
kate_austen Sawyer, if Jack does this he could kill everyone on the Island.
james_ford Yeah, I heard that part.
kate_austen And you're okay with that?
james_ford You ain't hearin' me, Kate. I made a choice, and I'm stickin' to it. I decided to leave, and I'm leavin'.
mitch Alright, here's your sedatives.
james_ford What the hell did you just do?
dr_juliet_burke We decided to leave this Island, James, we did. And now we're going back.
james_ford Are you serious?
dr_juliet_burke We can't just let those people die. You want out? Or do you want to stay here and whine about it?
james_ford Unlock the damn cuffs.
captain_bird BIRD Galaga to base. System check is complete. We're locked on a departure bearing and ready to leave the Island.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 OVER SPEAKER Roger that, Galaga. Have a safe trip! See you when you return.
dr_juliet_burke Give me your gun.
james_ford Appreciate that, captain. Now we need you to surface the sub.
captain_bird What? I can't take this sub up--
james_ford Oh, I think you can.
dr_juliet_burke Once we're gone, proceed on course. Whatever you do, do not take those people back to the Island. Understand?
captain_bird What if Horace tries to contact me, hmm? What am I supposed to say?
james_ford You ain't home.
dr_juliet_burke Go.
.#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, is this big enough?
sayid_jarrah That'll do.
dr_jack_shephard Are you done with Faraday's journal?
sayid_jarrah Take it.
richard_alpert Can I ask you a question?
dr_jack_shephard Sure.
richard_alpert Over, uh, twenty years ago, a man named John Locke, he walked right into our camp. And he told me that he was going to be our leader. Now I've gone off the Island three times, to visit him. But he never seemed particularly special to me.
dr_jack_shephard You said you had a question.
richard_alpert You know him? Locke?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, I know him. And if I were you, I wouldn't give up on him.
john_locke Why haven't you told him yet?
ben_linus Told who what?
john_locke Richard. Why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?
ben_linus If by plans you mean murdering him, John, I assumed you'd want to keep that a secret.
john_locke When did that ever stop you?
ben_linus Well, I starting thinking differently about things when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me if I didn't do everything you said.
john_locke Whoa, whoa, wait...where did this happen?
ben_linus In that cavern, beneath the Temple. When we went to see the monster.
john_locke So you're willing to do whatever I say, no matter what it is?
ben_linus Yes.
john_locke Well, then. I guess I won't have to convince you after all.
ben_linus Convince me to do what?
john_locke I'm not going to kill Jacob, Ben. You are.
sayid_jarrah Paris or Rome?
noor_abed_jaseem No.
sayid_jarrah Florence?
noor_abed_jaseem It doesn't matter, as long as we're together!
sayid_jarrah Yes it does! It's our anniversary, we have to find the perfect place.
noor_abed_jaseem Can we settle for finding my sunglasses?
jacob Excuse me, sir? Could you help me? I'm sorry, I think I'm lost. Are you from Los Angeles?
sayid_jarrah What are you looking for?
noor_abed_jaseem I found them!
sayid_jarrah Nadia! Nadia?
noor_abed_jaseem Take me home, take me home.
sayid_jarrah Time is short, let's go.
richard_alpert Alright, stay back.
dr_jack_shephard It's one of the DHARMA houses. I'll go first.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here. I'll go first. Because if someone in that house is a threat, you might hesitate. But I won't.
richard_alpert Alright, okay, Eloise, go on, after you.
middleaged_eloise_hawking Once we give you the all clear, then you bring the bomb. We don't want any accidents --
dr_jack_shephard What the hell are you doing?
richard_alpert I'm protecting our leader. Get back. She's gonna be angry when she wakes up, but that's a lot better than being dead. She ordered me to help you, we helped you, now you're on your own. I'm taking her out the way we came in.
sayid_jarrah After you.
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 OVER SPEAKER We are in a code black! Report with your weapons to your security assignment immediately. If you come into contact with a hostile, you are authorized to use deadly force.
dr_jack_shephard How the hell are we going to get out of here?
sayid_jarrah We hide in plain sight.
phil You go over there by the gate, and you get... ...so you guys go.
roger_linus Hey! HEY! You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid!
sayid_jarrah Don't fire that weapon, I'm carrying a nuclear de---
jinsoo_kwon Get in!
dr_jack_shephard Drive!
james_ford From the looks of the sun, I'd say that's the north shore over there.
kate_austen The sun's over there, that's gotta be the west coast.
james_ford Really? You got a compass?
kate_austen No, do you?
kate_austen Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke For what?
kate_austen For backing me up at the sub.
dr_juliet_burke No problem.
james_ford I got no idea where the hell we are!
james_ford Vincent! Come here! Hey! Hey! How you doin', boy? Haven't seen you since the flamin' arrows three years ago!
dr_juliet_burke Hey! How'd you survive alone out here?
rose_nadler Oh, hell no. Bernard!
rose_nadler They found us.
bernard_nadler Son of a bitch.
miles_straume Is that a bomb?!
dr_jack_shephard Try not to move. I need to stop the bleeding.
hugo_reyes What's going on back there? Is Sayid okay?
dr_jack_shephard Does he look okay?! Just keep your eyes on the damn road!
hugo_reyes Ah, let's pull over!
miles_straume And get shot! Just drive!
hugo_reyes I don't know where we're going.
dr_jack_shephard The Swan site. Head to the Swan.
hugo_reyes Why do you want to go there? If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we--
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, if you want to save Sayid, take us to the Swan!
hugo_reyes The Swan it is.
jinsoo_kwon Jack, what's at the Swan?
dr_jack_shephard I think I found a way to get you back to your wife. So hold on.
james_ford You're telling me you've just been living out here in the jungle for the past three years, by yourselves?
rose_nadler Uh-huh.
james_ford Well, I'm sorry y'all got left behind. Didn't you hear me shout out, "Meet at the creek"?
bernard_nadler You mean with flaming arrows raining down around us, killing everyone we knew? Oh, sure, we heard ya.
james_ford Well, we spent all sorts of time looking for ya. I had Jin out searching the Island grid by grid.
rose_nadler Yeah, we know.
james_ford You know?
rose_nadler Oh, sure, you guys all joined up with the DHARMA Initiative.
james_ford Well, damn, I could've brought both y'all in. Why didn't you find a way to tell us you were out here?
rose_nadler Because we're retired.
james_ford So y'all been scavenging food and living out in a hut by yourselves.
rose_nadler People try their whole lives to get themselves a nice, quiet place near the ocean where they can live in peace. And we did it. That's what we made for ourselves.
james_ford Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but... your condo's about to go ka-blooey.
kate_austen Jack has a bomb.
rose_nadler Who cares?
kate_austen Excuse me?
rose_nadler It's always something with you people. Now you say Jack's got a bomb. And what, you guys are all gonna try to stop him, right?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah, that's right.
rose_nadler We traveled back 30 years in time, and you're still trying to find ways to shoot each other?
dr_juliet_burke Rose, we just need to know which way the DHARMA Barracks are from here so we can stop Jack, or you're gonna be dead. We all will.
bernard_nadler So we die. We just care about being together. That's all that matters in the end.
rose_nadler The Barracks are 5 miles that way.
james_ford Bernard.
bernard_nadler Sawyer.
james_ford Rose.
rose_nadler Thank you.
james_ford Let's go.
dr_juliet_burke Bye.
bernard_nadler You sure you don't want some tea?
dr_juliet_burke Maybe another time.
frank_lapidus I wish you'd never showed me what was in this damn box. What the hell you gonna do with it anyway?
bram We need to show it to somebody.
frank_lapidus What for?
bram So they'll know what they're up against.
frank_lapidus What exactly are they up against?
bram Something a hell of a lot scarier than what's in this box, Frank. Don't worry, though. As long as you're with us, you're fine.
frank_lapidus That'd be reassuring if I knew who you were, "friend".
bram We are the good guys.
frank_lapidus In my experience, the people who go out of their way to tell you that the good guys are the bad guys.
ilana_verdansky We're here.
bram Look at the ash!
ilana_verdansky Wait here.
russian_nurse Как себя чувствуете? Пить хочется?
russian_nurse К Вам кто-то пришёл. Я ему объяснила, в каком Вы состоянии... Но он всё равно настоял на том, чтобы увидеться с Вами. У Вас ещё не было посетителей. Вам это пойдёт на пользу.
jacob Извини, что не смог прийти раньше
ilana_verdansky Я очень рада тебя видеть
jacob I'm here because I need your help. Can you do that? Will you help me, Ilana?
ilana_verdansky Yes.
bram What happened?
ilana_verdansky He isn't there, hasn't been in a long time. Someone else has been using it. Burn it!
frank_lapidus I'm no tree hugger or anything, but that's a pretty good way to torch the whole jungle, don't you think?
bram So what now?
bram Well, I guess we know where we're going.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Call 9-1-1!
jacob Don't worry, everything's gonna be alright. I'm sorry this happened to you.
sunhwa_kwon This is our old camp.
john_locke Home sweet home. Alright, everyone! Richard tells me we should get to where we're going by nightfall. So why don't you all take this opportunity to rest up and catch your breath. Considering what I have planned for you, you're gonna need it. Everything alright?
ben_linus I was enjoying some alone time.
john_locke You see what's behind you?
ben_linus It's a door. How about that?
john_locke Not just a door, Ben. It's the door to the hatch. Where you and I first met. Do you mind if I ask you a question?
ben_linus I'm a Pisces.
john_locke What happened that day at the cabin? When you first took me to meet Jacob?
ben_linus Well, you clearly already know that I was talking to an empty chair, John. That I was pretending. Which is not to say that I wasn't as surprised as you were when things started flying around the room.
john_locke But why would go to all the trouble to make something like that up?
ben_linus I was embarrassed. I didn't want you to know that I had never seen Jacob. So yes, I lied. That's what I do.
john_locke Alright, then.
ben_linus Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?
john_locke Because, despite your loyal service to this Island, you got cancer. You had to watch your own daughter gunned down right in front of you. And your reward for those sacrifices? You were banished. And you did all this in the name of a man you'd never even met. So the question is, Ben, why the hell wouldn't you want to kill Jacob?
sunhwa_kwon 처음 본 그 순간부터 당신을 사랑했어요. 그리고 앞으로 함께 살아갈 미래의 당신도 사랑합니다. 이 반지로 당신에게 서약합니다.
jinsoo_kwon 난 적어 가지고 왔는데 괜찮겠지? 당신과 내가 평생 함께 한다는 의미로 '영원히 함께 하길'이라고 우리 결혼반지에 새겼어. 이 반지로 당신에게... 서약합니다.
sunhwa_kwon 이모!
AUNTIE#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode16 이제 결혼도 했으니까 아이는 언제나 가질거니?
sunhwa_kwon 허니문 베이비가 될지도 모르죠.
jacob 두 분 결혼을 축하합니다. 두 분의 사랑은 아주 특별한 것입니다. 절대로 당연하게 생각하시면 안됩니다.
sunhwa_kwon 누구에요?
jinsoo_kwon 누군지 몰라도, 한국말은 잘하네.
dr_jack_shephard How much further?
hugo_reyes Uhh...we're about five minutes away!
sayid_jarrah You can't stop the bleeding.
dr_jack_shephard I need fresh dressings.
miles_straume Jack! So this bomb is supposed to what, blow us back in time?
dr_jack_shephard We're not going back in time.
miles_straume Right, because that would be ridiculous!
sayid_jarrah I need to modify the bomb. I can make it so it detonates on impact. Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the Incident, or all this will be for nothing.
dr_jack_shephard Why the hell are we stopping?
hugo_reyes That's why.
john_locke What is it? Why are we stopping?
richard_alpert You'll see.
john_locke Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard, but what does it have to do with Jacob?
richard_alpert It's where he lives.
