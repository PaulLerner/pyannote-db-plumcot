michael_dawson Where's my boy? Where's my boy? Hey, what'd you do with my boy?! Do you hear me?! Come back here!
desmond_hume Do you want him to die? Put it down.
dr_jack_shephard Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here.
francine My mother stole again from me this week. Now, I don't even keep money in my purse anymore. I've been hiding it. But when she wants a drink -- she stole 30 dollars. I know it may not seem like a lot of money to some of you, but it's a lot to me. And I want it back.
moderator Something you want to say? John, you've been coming here for a month now...
john_locke I just don't think 30 dollars is worth getting angry about.
moderator Well, Francine feels like 30 dollars...
john_locke Francine feels a little too much, if you ask me. You all do. I mean, seriously -- so-and-so never called me back -- my mother stole 30 dollars from me. I never even knew who my parents were. A couple of years ago my -- my birth mother found me, and uh, she told me I was special. And -- and through her I met my real father. Great news, right? Well, he pretended to love me just long enough to steal my kidney because he had to have a transplant. And then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash -- just like he did on the day that I was born. You want your damned 30 dollars back?! I want my kidney back!
helen_norwood Probably a good idea. You know if you get kidney cancer you've only got one.
john_locke That's funny. I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting.
helen_norwood Oh hell, you just said everything I've always wanted to say in there. Most of the time I want to stand up and scream get over it, freaks.
john_locke Well, why don't you?
helen_norwood I have to keep a cork in. Once I get all hot and bothered there's no stopping me. I guess you won't be coming back next week, huh?
john_locke No, not likely.
helen_norwood Hmmm, that's too bad. I like bald guys.
john_locke I'm not bald.
helen_norwood I can wait. Um, I'm Helen, by the way.
john_locke Hi Helen, I'm John.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?
desmond_hume Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?!
dr_jack_shephard Do not move.
john_locke Now, don't...
dr_jack_shephard Don't what?
john_locke He's unarmed.
dr_jack_shephard He just had a gun pointed at your head!
desmond_hume What did you do? What did you do? We're all going to die. We're all going to die.
desmond_hume I have to fix it.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell is he talking about?
desmond_hume Listen, if you do not let me up, we are going to die...
dr_jack_shephard Stop moving or I swear to God...
desmond_hume Look at the wall! You see that?! That's a timer! It's counting down! I've got to enter the code! I've got to push the button!
dr_jack_shephard Or what?
john_locke Jack, you should let him up.
dr_jack_shephard Don't tell me what to do! Or what? What's going to happen?
desmond_hume Do I know you?
dr_jack_shephard You got him?
desmond_hume Bastard.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke Nothing, Jack.
helen_norwood Hey. What are you doing? Where are you going?
john_locke Nowhere, I -- I -- I just have trouble sleeping in a strange bed. No, it has nothing to do with you, Helen, I promise. I really like you. I'm sorry, I'll call you later.
anthony_cooper Morning.
john_locke Morning.
anthony_cooper John, I know you like to drive through my neighborhood. And I know that every now and then you like to park outside my house. Now, I thought it might all stop when I moved, but here you are. Now, I admit -- at first I thought it was funny -- now it's just annoying. So how about you tell me what the hell it is you want.
john_locke Why?
anthony_cooper Excuse me?
john_locke Why?
anthony_cooper There is no why. Do you think you're the first person that ever got conned? You needed a father figure and I needed a kidney, and that's what happened. Get over it. And John, don't come back. You're not wanted.
john_locke I don't think you need that, Kate. Whatever you're looking for, maybe I can help.
desmond_hume Can you fix a computer? Then you can't help me, can you?
kate_austen Sayid can fix a computer.
john_locke Get him. Go and get Sayid.
dr_jack_shephard Can you get back up that rope?
kate_austen I won't have to, there's got to be a front door in this place.
desmond_hume Down the corridor to the left. Be persistent, the wheel sticks. Gotcha.
dr_jack_shephard Now, you're going to tell me what's going on.
john_locke Jack, we don't have time for...
dr_jack_shephard We're taking a time out.
desmond_hume Please, just let me...
dr_jack_shephard Look, you want to get to work -- you're going to tell me how you got here.
desmond_hume It was 3 years ago. I was on a solo race around the world, and my boat crashed into the reef, and then Kelvin came.
john_locke Kelvin?
desmond_hume Kelvin -- he comes running out of the jungle -- hurry, hurry, come with me. He brings me down here. The first thing he does -- because there's beeping already -- he types in the code, he pushes the button, and it stops. What was all that about, I say. Just saving the world, he says.
dr_jack_shephard Saving the world?
desmond_hume His words, not mine. So I started pushing the button, too. And we saved the world together for awhile, and that was lovely. Then Kelvin died, and now here I am all alone. The end.
dr_jack_shephard Don't tell me you believe this. This is crazy. You think that makes sense -- pushing a button? You're going to take his word for it?!
john_locke His word is all we have, Jack.
desmond_hume You don't have to take my word for it. Watch the film.
dr_jack_shephard What?
desmond_hume The bookcase -- top shelf, behind "Turn of the Screw" -- projector's in the pantry.
hugo_reyes Here! Dude, I've got to say, I didn't think we were going to get through the night. And I wasn't even here for that baby stealing part.
sayid_jarrah I can assure you it was very exciting.
hugo_reyes It's about time things are finally returning to normalness.
kate_austen Sayid!
hugo_reyes Uh, crap.
kate_austen Sayid, we need your help.
james_ford What do you know? What did they do to you? Who the hell are they? Who the hell are they?
jinsoo_kwon Others. 바닷가에서 붙잡혔어.
michael_dawson Did you see Walt?
james_ford The Others? How many? How many?
jinsoo_kwon 놈들이 내 눈을 가렸어. 눈, 눈!
michael_dawson He was blindfolded.
james_ford There could be a hundred of them out there. Push me up.
michael_dawson What?
james_ford Push me up. I'm going to try and get us out of here. C'mon, help us out, Jin.
james_ford They've got it weighted down with something. It's tied off somewhere. C'mon, lift me higher.
michael_dawson It's a girl.
dr_jack_shephard You want to tell me what was going on down here before I showed up, John?
john_locke Kate was tied up, Desmond had a gun on me. I think you pretty much caught the gist of it.
dr_jack_shephard Desmond...
john_locke He wanted to know a lot about us -- how we got here -- if we were sick.
dr_jack_shephard You didn't ask anything about him?
john_locke He was the one with the gun.
dr_jack_shephard You sure seem calm for someone who believes the world's going to end in the next 45 minutes.
john_locke He'll fix it.
dr_jack_shephard You understand that what he's saying. It's -- it's insane. It's impossible.
john_locke Why is it insane?
dr_jack_shephard Because the last time I saw a computer that was going to save the world, it didn't look like that.
john_locke Is the reason you're so upset because he said he recognized you? Because that would be impossible.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode03 CANDLE Welcome, I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for Station 3 of the DHARMA Initiative. In a moment you'll be given a simple set of instructions for how you and your partner will fulfill the responsibilities associated with the station. But first, a little history.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode03 CANDLE The DHARMA Initiative was created in 1970, and it is the brainchild of Gerald and Karen DeGroot -- two doctoral candidates at the University of Michigan. Following in the footsteps of visionaries such as B.F. Skinner imagined a large scale communal research compound where scientists and free thinkers from around the globe could pursue research in meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism, and Utopian social Danish industrialist and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso whose financial backing made their dream of a multi-purpose social science research facility a reality.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode03 CANDLE You and your partner are currently located in Station 3, or the Swan, and will be for the next 540 days. The Station 3 was originally constructed as a laboratory where scientists could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from this sector of the Island.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode03 CANDLE Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer for anything . Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
john_locke We're going to need to watch that again.
john_locke What's that?
helen_norwood It's a present. It's been 6 months -- sort of an anniversary, right?
john_locke I didn't get you anything.
helen_norwood That's okay. It only cost me a buck.
helen_norwood It's to my place -- thought you might be tired of knocking.
john_locke Oh, well, Helen. I don't know what to say.
helen_norwood There's uh, just one condition, though, John. When you stay over, you stay over.
john_locke What do you mean?
helen_norwood I followed you last night -- to that house that you go to. Is it your father's house?
john_locke Why would you follow me, Helen? Why would you do that?
helen_norwood Well, you sneak off in the middle of the night. I -- I just needed to know where you were going? I care about you, John.
john_locke Well, yeah, but what I do is my business. It's personal.
helen_norwood I wasted 20 years of my life being angry. I told myself I would get over it, but I couldn't do it alone. I needed to find help. You help me John. And I can help you. You just have to promise me that you're not going to go to that place anymore.
john_locke Alright.
helen_norwood Alright?
dr_jack_shephard You're going to watch that again?
john_locke Aren't you?
dr_jack_shephard No, John, I'm not.
michael_dawson Okay, okay, okay.
james_ford You alright, sister?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Who are you?
michael_dawson We crashed here. We were on a plane, Sydney to Los Angeles.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What?
james_ford 40 of us made it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Flight 815?
james_ford You were on it, too?
michael_dawson What? You were in the back? It broke off mid-air. How did you...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA I don't know. I don't know. The plane came apart, and -- and somebody's fricking hardside came out of the overhead and knocked me out. I woke up under water and made my way to the top -- swam to shore.
james_ford You've been out here by yourself all this time?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Trying to find food -- making my way -- hoping to find somebody. And then, yesterday, they found me.
michael_dawson Who are they?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You tell me.
michael_dawson Did you see a -- a boy? 10 years old? They took my son.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No, I'm sorry. I'm Ana Lucia.
james_ford Sawyer. This is Mike. The quiet Korean guy is Jin. We're about to be the best thing that ever happened to you.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA How's that?
james_ford Because next time Shaft opens the cage he's going to get a surprising little howdy-doody.
dr_jack_shephard Are you in contact with the people that made it -- the film? Are you in contact with anyone?
desmond_hume Do you think I'd be here if I was?
dr_jack_shephard How is it that you didn't know about the crash? About us?
desmond_hume I push this button every 108 minutes. I don't get out much.
dr_jack_shephard So, these replacements?
desmond_hume Kelvin died waiting for his replacements.
dr_jack_shephard So, you don't get out, you don't see anyone. Where does your food come from? You really think this is happening.
desmond_hume Why wouldn't it be?
dr_jack_shephard It says "quarantine" on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here. To keep you scared. But you know what? We've been up there for over 40 days and no one's gotten sick. You think that this is the only part of it that's true?! Do you ever think that maybe they put you down here to push a button every 100 minutes just to see if you would? That all of this -- the computer, the button -- it's just a mind game?! An experiment?
desmond_hume Every -- single -- day. And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real. But the film says this is an electromagnetic station. And I don't know about you, brother, but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt. Right. Oh no.
john_locke What happened?
desmond_hume It's over.
john_locke What do you mean, it's over?!
john_locke What are you doing? Are you leaving? Desmond? Wait. We can -- we can fix the computer. Sayid is coming. He knows...
desmond_hume Give him my best.
john_locke Wait, wait, wait -- where are you... You can't leave. Where are you going?
desmond_hume As far as I can run, brother.
john_locke What should we do?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing. We do nothing. It's not real. None of it's real.
john_locke This isn't -- this isn't what was supposed to happen!
dr_jack_shephard What was supposed to happen?
john_locke Please, don't leave me here.
dr_jack_shephard Bye, John. You're on your own.
john_locke Jack.
john_locke Why is this happening like this? What do you want? What do you... What am I supposed to do?!
john_locke Helen? Helen, what...
john_locke Helen, wait. Helen, don't. Helen. Why are you doing this?
helen_norwood He's not coming out of this house, John, because he doesn't care. I know why you're here -- why you keep coming here. You're scared. You're scared of moving forward -- with me, with us. You're going to have to choose. Him or me.
john_locke No, no, no, it's not that simple.
helen_norwood Yes it is.
john_locke I, I, I can't. I can't.
helen_norwood Yes, you can.
john_locke No, I can't! -- I don't know how.
helen_norwood Because you don't know what's going to happen. None of us do. That's why it's called a leap of faith, John. You don't have to be alone.
kate_austen Jack! Jack! John?
hugo_reyes Dude.
sayid_jarrah What is this place?
kate_austen John, where's Jack?
john_locke Jack's gone. I need your help.
kate_austen What does it look like?
sayid_jarrah It's a breaker box. There has to be one. Follow the conduit lines.
hugo_reyes Cool, okay, great. What's a conduit line?
kate_austen Those tubes -- follow those.
hugo_reyes Whoa!
kate_austen Did you find it?
hugo_reyes Uh, uh, depends on what you mean by it?
james_ford Alright, here's what we're going to do -- Jin plays dead, you call for help.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Sick prisoner -- are you serious?
james_ford What? You got a better idea, sweetheart?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Where'd you get that gun, anyway?
james_ford What?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA The gun -- how'd you get it on the plane?
james_ford There was a federal marshal on the plane.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA So, what? You just happen to have his gun?
james_ford Yeah, I'm lucky. Mike, let's get this thing going...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA How come you didn't use it when they grabbed you?
james_ford Gosh, I guess I was too busy getting hit in the face with a club. How come you're suddenly so interested, cupcake?
michael_dawson Hey!
james_ford What?
michael_dawson C'mon, let's just -- we gotta=
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Back up! Back up. Pull me out. Pull me out!
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode03 What happened? Who are they?
dr_jack_shephard Stop.
desmond_hume Oh, right. The code, yeah?
dr_jack_shephard What?
desmond_hume Listen carefully. If by some miracle you manage to get the computer working again you've got to enter the code 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hit execute. Again 4, 8, 15-
dr_jack_shephard Shut up!
desmond_hume Sorry?
dr_jack_shephard Nothing is going to happen. Some man takes you down there, shows you a movie, and you push a button on, on faith alone? Nothing is going to happen!
desmond_hume In about 15 minutes you're either going to be very right, or very wrong, brother. You want to shoot me?! Shoot me! But I'm not-
dr_jack_shephard Why are you running? You don't even know what you're running from?!
desmond_hume I remember you -- running -- I know you -- I met you -- Los Angeles. I was training, yeah? You twisted your ankle...
dr_jack_shephard Stop.
desmond_hume You're a doctor, right? There was this girl -- you were worried -- you said, you said you failed her. That was you.
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter.
desmond_hume Was she okay, the girl?
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter.
desmond_hume What happened to her?
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter.
desmond_hume How can you say it doesn't matter?
dr_jack_shephard I married her!
desmond_hume Right, and you're -- you're not married to her anymore, then?
desmond_hume See you in another life, yeah?
john_locke Can you fix it?
sayid_jarrah This man, whoever he was, replaced the motherboard. The power transformer is blown.
john_locke Don't you need to know why?
sayid_jarrah All I need to know is that the timer is counting down to something, and that this computer needs to be repaired. I'm sure you'll tell me why once I've done so.
kate_austen Found it!
hugo_reyes Oh, what's that?
john_locke Sayid!
sayid_jarrah Working on it.
john_locke You have to...
sayid_jarrah I know what I have to do. Reconnected the processor, replaced the transformer.
john_locke It's on.
kate_austen Okay, so what now?
john_locke There was a code. He made me enter it.
hugo_reyes What code?
sayid_jarrah Do you remember what it is?
john_locke 4, 8...
hugo_reyes Wait a minute...
john_locke 15, 16...
hugo_reyes Dude, I'm serious, stop.
john_locke Hugo, this is not the time or the place.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well, I think it is.
john_locke 23...
hugo_reyes What is this thing? You don't even know what it does! I mean we need...
john_locke 32...
hugo_reyes You know what? Forget it, go ahead, do your thing.
dr_jack_shephard It's not 32. It's 42. He just told me -- Desmond. The last number's 42.
john_locke You're sure.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm sure.
john_locke You do it, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke You have to do it.
dr_jack_shephard You do it yourself, John.
john_locke No, you saw the film, Jack. This is a two person job, at least.
sayid_jarrah This argument is irrelevant.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, don't.
sayid_jarrah Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Don't. It's not real. Look, you want to push the button, you do it yourself.
john_locke If it's not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?!
dr_jack_shephard Why do you find it so easy?!
john_locke It's never been easy!
kate_austen Maybe you should just do it.
dr_jack_shephard No. It's a button.
john_locke I can't do this alone, Jack. I don't want to. It's a leap of faith, Jack.
john_locke I'll take the first shift.
