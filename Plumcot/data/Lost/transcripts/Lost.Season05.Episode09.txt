CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Wanna hear something crazy?
frank_lapidus What's that?
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Did you see the big guy when we got on in L.A.? Sitting in first class, curly hair, guitar case?
frank_lapidus What about him?
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 He's one of the Oceanic Six. Guy's got nerves of steel, man. He survives a full-on commercial airliner crash. Now he's back flying over the same South Pacific?
frank_lapidus Yeah, well... maybe he doesn't believe that lightning will strike twice in the same place.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 You all right there, Frank?
frank_lapidus I'm just fine.
[The#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 rattling resumes, more violently now, then stops. The co-pilot reaches above him and flips a switch.
hugo_reyes Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
frank_lapidus Oh, no.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 What?
frank_lapidus Autopilot off! I have the controls.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Autopilot off. You have the controls.
frank_lapidus Pull that rudder!

AUTOMATED#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 FEMALE VOICE Stall.
frank_lapidus We've lost power!
AUTOMATED#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 FEMALE VOICE Stall.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Restarting one. Restarting two.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Altimeter reading 650.
frank_lapidus Oh, my God.
frank_lapidus Give me more power! I can pull us out of this!
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 You're gonna rip us apart!
frank_lapidus Do it!
frank_lapidus Come on. Come on.
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Is that a runway?
frank_lapidus Massive instrument failure! We're puttin' her down!
CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Ajira 3-1-6! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

CO-PILOT#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Come on!
frank_lapidus We're runnin' out! We're runnin' out!
frank_lapidus Hold on! Brace for impact!
frank_lapidus Hey!
caesar Hey. Hey, lady. Are you okay?
ilana_verdansky Jarrah?
caesar No. My name is Caesar. We had an accident. But we're okay now.
caesar Hey.
ilana_verdansky Ohh.
sunhwa_kwon Frank?
frank_lapidus Sun.
frank_lapidus You all right?
sunhwa_kwon Oh, my God. What happened?!
frank_lapidus I don't know.
frank_lapidus Where's everyone else? Jack and... Kate and Hurley--where'd they go?
ben_linus They're gone.
frank_lapidus Gone? Gone where?
ben_linus How would I know?
hugo_reyes You're alive. Dude! I can't believe it!
hugo_reyes Oh! Oh!
james_ford Easy on the ribs there, Kong.
hugo_reyes "Kong." I actually missed that.
james_ford Missed you, too, Hugo.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer.
james_ford Doc.
james_ford Good to see you, Kate.
kate_austen You, too, James.
james_ford You're really here. Son of a bitch actually did it! Locke said he was gonna bring you back, but... where is he?
dr_jack_shephard John's dead.
james_ford Dead? How?
dr_jack_shephard Doesn't matter. He's gone.
hugo_reyes So what's up with you guys and the old DHARMA jumpsuits?
james_ford You didn't tell 'em?
jinsoo_kwon No. I was waiting for you.
kate_austen Tell us what?
james_ford We're in the DHARMA Initiative.
dr_jack_shephard They came back to the Island?
james_ford No. We came back. And so did you. It's 1977.
hugo_reyes Uh... what?
dr_jack_shephard So you're telling me that you've been here, living with the DHARMA Initiative for the past three years.
james_ford That's right. How long's it been for you since the chopper?
kate_austen Three years.
miles_straume Hey, Jin, this is Miles. Where are you? Over.
jinsoo_kwon If I don't report in soon, they'll send out a patrol. What should we do with them?
hugo_reyes Dude, your English is awesome.
james_ford What we do is we bring 'em in.
dr_jack_shephard Bring us in where?
james_ford Back to the Barracks at DHARMAville. You can't be wandering around in the jungle with the Hostiles.
kate_austen "The Hostiles"?
james_ford The Others.
hugo_reyes What about everyone else from the plane? They could still be out there.
james_ford What do you mean, everyone else?
dr_jack_shephard We didn't come back alone. Sayid was on the plane, too. Lapidus... and Sun.
james_ford Jin! Hold up! Where you goin'?!
jinsoo_kwon The Flame. If a plane landed on the Island, Radzinsky will know.
james_ford Hold on! We gotta think about this!
james_ford All right. That's it. Listen, you guys gotta stay put. Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing till I can figure out how the hell to explain where you came from.
kate_austen Sawyer, wait. Other than you and Jin, who else is still here?
dr_juliet_burke Miles, have you seen James?
miles_straume Nope. He's not answering his walkie, either.
dr_juliet_burke Jin called him this morning, then he just ran off without telling me what was going on.
miles_straume Well, let's see what we've got.
miles_straume Hang on. There he is.
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
james_ford You seen my baggy sweatshirt, the one with the bulldog on it?
dr_juliet_burke It's in the laundry. James... what's going on?
james_ford They're back.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry. Who's back?
james_ford Jack, Hurley, Kate.
dr_juliet_burke What?
james_ford I know. They came back, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke Are they here now?
james_ford Yeah. They're out at the North Point, waitin' for me to tell 'em what to do.
dr_juliet_burke How did they get...
james_ford I'm not sure. They said they were on a plane.
james_ford I don't understand it any more than you do. But they're here, and I gotta find a way to bring 'em in before somebody else finds 'em and they screw up everything we got here.
dr_juliet_burke There's, um, a sub coming in this afternoon.
stuart_radzinsky Hey, you understand the concept of knocking?
stuart_radzinsky Oh, get your hands off that! I thought you learned English. I said, hands off! Nobody handles any of the gear in this station except me. Understand?
jinsoo_kwon I need to check the radar logs.
stuart_radzinsky For what?
jinsoo_kwon Please. I need to know if a plane landed on the Island.
stuart_radzinsky If a plane landed? Here?
jinsoo_kwon Yes.
stuart_radzinsky What, so you think if a plane landed on our Island, I'd be over there just building my model? That I wouldn't have called anyone? That I wouldn't have put out an alert?
jinsoo_kwon Maybe you missed it. Can you check with the other stations?
stuart_radzinsky I just told you I would not be--
jinsoo_kwon Check with the other stations.
stuart_radzinsky Attention all stations, this is a system-wide broadcast from Radzinsky at the Flame. I'm checking in to see if anyone's seen an airplane over the Island. No one else has seen an airplane, but if you have, could you call in to me, please? Over.
stuart_radzinsky So what are you all hot and bothered about, Kwon? Why is this plane so damn important?
jinsoo_kwon It just is.
ilana_verdansky Did you lose someone?
sunhwa_kwon Excuse me?
ilana_verdansky I just saw you looking around. I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane.
sunhwa_kwon No. I was traveling alone.
frank_lapidus Can I get everybody's attention?! Everybody, please! Listen up, folks! Here's where we're at. The radio's dead, so I haven't been able to call in our situation. But that's all right. Soon as they figure out we're not where we're supposed to be, they'll come looking for us. So best thing to do right now is just stick together. Stick together, hunker down and just wait till help gets here.
caesar And where is here?
frank_lapidus What's that?
caesar Where is here? What is this place?
frank_lapidus I don't know where "here" is because this island's not on my charts.
caesar Really?
frank_lapidus Really.
caesar Because there are some buildings over there... and animal cages. Down the beach, you can see a bigger island across the water. So maybe you should get some new charts.
frank_lapidus Right now, I'm just trying to keep everyone here safe. So let's gather up some firewood.
caesar If he wants to wait, let him! I say we search these buildings! Maybe they have a radio or some food! Who wants to help me?!
ben_linus Why are you following me?
sunhwa_kwon Where are you going?
ben_linus Back to our Island. ...You wanna come?
amy_goodspeed Juliet?
dr_juliet_burke Hey, Amy. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
amy_goodspeed Oh, no, it's fine.
dr_juliet_burke I just came to get the sub manifest. Obviously, I don't want you working today.
amy_goodspeed Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Full load?
amy_goodspeed Almost. Two of the recruits dropped out in the eleventh hour. They didn't want to take the sedative for the trip. Can you tell Pierre for me?
dr_juliet_burke Hi. Hi. Oh, hello, little one. Hi.
dr_juliet_burke Have you and Horace decided on a name?
amy_goodspeed Yeah, we have. We're gonna name him Ethan.
amy_goodspeed Oh, hey, buddy. So... when are you and Jim gonna have one of these?
dr_juliet_burke I don't know. Timing's gotta be right.
kate_austen So the woman who told you how to come back... did she mention that it would be 30 years ago?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, she left that part out.
kate_austen So what are we supposed to do now?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure yet.
hugo_reyes Sawyer's back!
james_ford All right, listen. Y'all are gonna be the second batch of recruits comin' in off the sub pullin' into port right about now, so we ain't got much time.
james_ford Nice suit, doc. Not exactly Island wear. Try this.
dr_jack_shephard You want us to say we came in on the sub. How's that gonna work?
james_ford Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so no one meets each other until we process 'em.
dr_jack_shephard Look, we need to find the rest of the people from the plane.
james_ford If there was a plane, Jin will find it. So we got about ten minutes to make intake, or y'all are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time. There ain't another batch of recruits due in for six months.
dr_jack_shephard What do you think?
kate_austen I think we should listen to Sawyer.
hugo_reyes I vote for not camping.
james_ford Trust me. Do what I say. Everything will be fine. Let's move.
stuart_radzinsky I just heard from the Looking Glass. They were the last station to check in. They got nothing but an incoming sub. Why don't you go home, and I'll call you if something happens?
stuart_radzinsky Move. Move. Out of my way.
stuart_radzinsky Those bastards.
jinsoo_kwon What do you see?
stuart_radzinsky Grid 325. Motion sensor alarm was tripped. We got a Hostile inside the perimeter.
stuart_radzinsky Hey! Where you going?!
jinsoo_kwon Stop right there!
jinsoo_kwon Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Where's Sun?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
jinsoo_kwon Shut up!
jinsoo_kwon Get down! Say another word, and you're dead.
hugo_reyes Okay, so it's 1977.
james_ford Yep.
hugo_reyes And... you guys are all members of the DHARMA Initiative.
james_ford Yep.
hugo_reyes Well, you do realize those dudes get wiped out, right? I saw where all the bodies got dumped.
james_ford What about it?
hugo_reyes Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em? Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?
james_ford I ain't here to play Nostradamus to these people. Besides, Faraday's got some interesting theories on what we can and can't do here.
dr_jack_shephard Did you say Faraday? He's here?
james_ford Not anymore.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 ON PA ...recruits will be going inside for processing, where you'll be given your work assignment and lodging.
james_ford Put these on and listen up. Juliet's got it worked out so your name's gonna be on the list, all right? So when you get in there, just watch the little meet and greet video, wait for 'em to call your name. When they do, just smile, step up, take your jumpsuits and work assignments.
dr_jack_shephard Work assignments?
james_ford Yeah, don't worry. I got it covered. Just remember to act a little doped up, 'cause you just woke up from the sub.
hugo_reyes What if they start asking us questions we can't answer, like, uh, who's president in 1977?
james_ford It's not a damn game show, Hugo. Besides, I'm gonna be in there to get your backs, all right? Let's move.
miles_straume LaFleur! Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you on the walkie.
miles_straume What--what the hell are they doing here?
james_ford They're our new inductees. I'll explain everything later. Stop staring and tell me what your damn problem is.
miles_straume It's, uh... it's Jin. There's a 14-J at the Flame.
james_ford What?
james_ford Jin, you there?
jinsoo_kwon James, we have a problem. We found a Hostile.
james_ford What?! What do you mean you found a hostile? Where?
jinsoo_kwon He was wandering in the jungle. Radzinksy's taking care of him now.
james_ford What's he doing in our territory? It's a violation of the truce.
jinsoo_kwon It's Sayid.
james_ford What?! Son of a bitch! Was anyone else with him?
jinsoo_kwon No. He was alone.
sunhwa_kwon Wait!
ben_linus I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't interest me much right now. There are three outriggers near here and I'm gonna take one. So you can come along and help me row... or you can stay here. Frankly, it makes no difference to me.
sunhwa_kwon Why are you leaving?
ben_linus Why are you staying?
sunhwa_kwon The main Island... is that where Jin is?
ben_linus Honestly, I don't know. But that's where I'd start looking.
frank_lapidus Sun!
sunhwa_kwon Over here.
ben_linus Hello, Frank.
frank_lapidus You all right?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, I'm fine.
frank_lapidus I got worried when I couldn't find ya. I saw him leaving. What are you doing out here?
sunhwa_kwon Ben knows where there's a boat. I'm going back to the main Island with him.
frank_lapidus You don't think you can really trust this guy, do ya?
sunhwa_kwon I have to trust him.
ben_linus You're ready?
sunhwa_kwon Yes.
frank_lapidus Sun. I want you to think about this, okay? This guy is dangerous. Sun, that boat I came here on--it was filled with commandos whose only mission was to get him.
ben_linus And how'd that work out for everyone?
frank_lapidus Don't do it.
sunhwa_kwon Why don't you come with us?
frank_lapidus I can't. I got a group of people I gotta look after.
ben_linus That's right, Frank. A captain's first responsibility is to his passengers. But I have people I have to take care of, too. There's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water. It leads directly to a town where I used to live. There are resources there. So, if anyone can help you and the rest of the plane get out of here safely, it--
frank_lapidus I thought you trusted this guy.
sunhwa_kwon I lied.
kate_austen How are we gonna do this?
phil Shephard? Jack Shephard?
dr_jack_shephard Here we go.
phil Hey, Jack. Have a seat.
dr_pierre_chang Of course it isn't here...
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
dr_pierre_chang Your file. Could they be any more disorganized on the other side? Sorry. Namaste. I'm Pierre Chang. Welcome to the DHARMA Initiative. How was your ride in?
dr_jack_shephard It was fine.
dr_pierre_chang Good. Who was your shuttle driver?
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry?
dr_pierre_chang Uh... the shuttle from the sub. Who was your driver?
dr_jack_shephard Oh, that was, uh... um... Mr. LaFleur.
dr_pierre_chang Ah, yes. Good man, LaFleur. Runs a very tight operation. I'm sorry for the disorganization. The woman who was supposed to be processing you in had a baby last night. I got pulled out of my lab. I... ah, here it is... your job assignment. You've been assigned to the Shed.
dr_jack_shephard "Work man." What does--what does that mean?
dr_pierre_chang Based on your aptitude test, you'll be doing janitorial work.
phil Hey there, ma'am.
kate_austen Hi.
phil They haven't called you yet?
kate_austen No. Not yet.
phil What's your name?
kate_austen Kate... Austen.
phil Austen. Austen... Huh. You're not on my list, and you're not on the sub manifest either. Who's your recruiter?
kate_austen Um...
dr_juliet_burke Hold on, Phil. I just got the new list from Amy. Some, uh, last-minute additions, including... Miss Austen?
phil All righty then. She's all yours.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry for the mix-up. I'm Juliet.
kate_austen Kate.
dr_juliet_burke Hi, Kate. Welcome to the Island.
james_ford What the hell happened?
jinsoo_kwon Sayid just came walking out of the jungle in handcuffs alone.
james_ford What? Did he say anything about the plane they were on?
jinsoo_kwon No, I couldn't talk to him. Radzinsky thinks he's a Hostile. He won't leave us alone.
james_ford I got this.
james_ford Where is he?
stuart_radzinsky Locked in the storage room.
james_ford Give me the key.
stuart_radzinsky You need to know, LaFleur--he saw the model of the Swan, and he could've seen the survey of where we're building it.
james_ford Your point is?
stuart_radzinsky He's a spy. This whole thing is an act, and we either play into it or we don't. We can end this right now.
james_ford What the hell are you talking about, Radzinsky?
stuart_radzinsky We shoot him.
james_ford Well, I appreciate your input there, quick draw. But I wanna talk to him first. Give me the damn keys.
james_ford My name's LaFleur. I'm head of security. I want you to listen real carefully to what I got to say. And if you do that, you'll be fine. Understand?
james_ford All right, let's start simple. Identify yourself as a Hostile.
james_ford The terms of the truce say you gotta identify yourself as a Hostile, or we got the right to shoot you.
sayid_jarrah We do not refer to ourselves as "Hostile", but yes, I--I am one of them.
james_ford All right. Good. Then we can proceed like a couple of gentlemen. Let's go. Just taking him back to the barracks.
stuart_radzinsky Oh, if you're taking him in, then I'm coming with you.
stuart_radzinsky This is a horrible mistake. I'm gonna talk directly to Horace about this.
james_ford Fine. Talk away.
frank_lapidus You wanna remind me why the hell we're doing this?
sunhwa_kwon Ben said if my husband is on the Island, the best place to start looking for him is here.
frank_lapidus Oh, I see, that's some advice you took before you whacked him in the head.
frank_lapidus Whoa.
frank_lapidus Tell me you saw that.
sunhwa_kwon Probably just an animal.
frank_lapidus Animal. Right.
frank_lapidus I'm sorry to say, Sun, but... I don't think we're gonna find your husband here. Maybe we oughta just head back.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Hello.
frank_lapidus Who the hell are you?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 My name's Christian.
sunhwa_kwon I'm looking for my husband. His name is Jin Kwon. Do you know where he is?
dr_christian_shephard Follow me.
sunhwa_kwon What is this place?
dr_christian_shephard '72... '76, '78...
sunhwa_kwon Where is my husband?
dr_christian_shephard Uh, here we go. '77. He's, uh... he's with your friends.
sunhwa_kwon What are you talking about? What friends?
dr_christian_shephard I'm sorry, but you have a bit of a journey ahead of you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Okay, ready? Everybody say, "Namaste!"
all@ Namaste.
hugo_reyes Nama-what?
phil Okay. Right on. So you guys have the rest of the day to get acquainted with your security protocol handbooks waitin' in your new digs. Now some of it may seem a little scary, but I promise you all, we are perfectly safe here, okay? So make yourselves at home. Come on. We got hamburgers. We got punch.
james_ford You there, Phil? We're coming in with a 14-J.
phil Roger that, Mr. LaFleur.
phil Okay, if I could get everyone to hold back, please, we have a minor security situation.
stuart_radzinsky Move.
hugo_reyes I guess we found Sayid.
james_ford All right, you can hang out here until we can figure out what the hell to do with you.
phil What are we gonna do with him?
james_ford Bring the man some damn food. We're not savages.
dr_jack_shephard Ah, excuse me. Um... Could you tell me where James LaFleur lives?
phil Uh, that's his house right there.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
phil But I wouldn't call him "James". He hates it.
dr_jack_shephard
dr_juliet_burke Hey, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I saw you earlier today when you were helping Kate, and I wanted to say something to you then, but...
dr_juliet_burke We're not supposed to know each other.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Um... I was looking for Sawyer. I guess I came to the wrong house.
dr_juliet_burke No. Come in.
james_ford Evening, Doc.
dr_juliet_burke Well, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
james_ford Take a load off. You want a beer?
dr_jack_shephard No. No, I'm fine.
james_ford What can I do for you, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I don't even know where to start. Uh... how about with Sayid?
james_ford I had no choice. He was running around in the jungle, got caught by my people. And seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here, I had to improvise.
dr_jack_shephard Improvise?
james_ford Uh-huh. And for now, Sayid is safe, which is all that matters.
dr_jack_shephard So where do we go from here?
james_ford I'm working on it.
dr_jack_shephard Really? Because it looked to me like you were reading a book.
james_ford I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, even during the Blitz. He said it made him think better. It's how I like to run things. I think. I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you, 'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted. See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead.
dr_jack_shephard I got us off the Island.
james_ford But here you are... right back where you started. So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think, 'cause that's how I saved your ass today. And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow. All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest. Let me do what I do.
james_ford ...now ain't that a relief?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Hey, Phil. I'm just gonna go in there and deliver him a sandwich.
phil All right.
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Hello. I brought you a sandwich. I didn't put mustard on it, but if you'd like some, I could get some.
sayid_jarrah This will be fine. Thank you.
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 Are you a Hostile?
sayid_jarrah Do you think I am?
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 What's your name?
sayid_jarrah Sayid. What's yours?
BOY#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode09 I'm Ben.
sayid_jarrah It's nice to meet you, Ben.
