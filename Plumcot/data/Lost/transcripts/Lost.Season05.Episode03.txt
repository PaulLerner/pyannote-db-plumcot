desmond_hume Efren Salonga?
desmond_hume Ef—Efren Salonga!
desmond_hume Efren Salonga?
desmond_hume Efren Salonga!
desmond_hume Efren Salonga!
desmond_hume Efren Salonga!
desmond_hume Efren Salonga?
salonga Who are you?
desmond_hume Are you the doctor?
salonga Yes. What's the matter with you?
desmond_hume You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?
salonga Yes, yes!
desmond_hume Because there's a lot of blood, man!
salonga How much blood?
desmond_hume I'm coming, Penny!
desmond_hume It's okay, Pen. We've got a doctor.
penelope_widmore Where have you been?!
desmond_hume It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, here you go.
desmond_hume Okay. Just breathe, Penny, okay? J—just breathe.
penelope_widmore Oh!
desmond_hume Breathe.
penelope_widmore I can't breathe.
desmond_hume You're doing great.
penelope_widmore I can't—
desmond_hume You're doing great, okay. Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay.
penelope_widmore Oh, make it come out!
desmond_hume Just be strong.
salonga Hold it. Hold it.
penelope_widmore I can't! I can't!
desmond_hume Yes, you—yes, you can, Penny.
salonga Push! Push!
desmond_hume Okay, push now, Penny. Push. Now!
desmond_hume Come on, Penny. That's it.
salonga Push!
desmond_hume It's coming. Come on, Penny.
salonga Push! Harder!
desmond_hume I can see the head!
salonga Harder!
desmond_hume I can see the head!
salonga One more time! Push!
desmond_hume I can see it. It's just coming.
desmond_hume It's coming! It's coming! You've got it!
salonga Last time! Yeah!
desmond_hume Oh my God, Penny.
salonga You got it!
desmond_hume You did it. Oh, my God, Penny. You did it.
salonga It's a boy!
desmond_hume I love you, Penny. I love you.
desmond_hume Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, my God. He's so beautiful. Oh, my God.
penelope_widmore I love you.
desmond_hume I love you.
desmond_hume I love you.
desmond_hume Look. Right out there.
desmond_hume Beyond where you can see, there's—there's an island, and it's a very special island. I left it a long time ago. I never thought I'd see it again.
desmond_hume It's called Great Britain. And the most beautiful part of the island is Scotland, and that's where your daddy's from. There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs, and... and it's where your mummy and daddy... fell in love.
penelope_widmore It's also where he broke her heart.
desmond_hume Yeah, well, I... I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it.
penelope_widmore You also left out the bit about his grandfather—the man who sent a boat to the Island to kill all Daddy's friends.
desmond_hume We'll be in and out. He'll never know we're here, Penny.
penelope_widmore Don't underestimate him, Desmond. If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do.
desmond_hume But this has nothing to do with your father, Penny. We are here because of Daniel Faraday. What he told me—that everyone on that island is in danger, and I am the only one that can help them. I have to do this, Penny.
dr_daniel_faraday Are you sure that's what he said?
miles_straume Yeah, Sawyer said to meet at the creek, so unless he got torched by a flaming arrow, that's where he and everyone else should be.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, how's your headache?
dr_charlotte_lewis Worse, but considering we're running for our lives, I'm not gonna complain.
dr_daniel_faraday You have any dizziness or double vision?
dr_charlotte_lewis Both, actually. Why do you look so worried? Is it because you know what's happening to me?
dr_daniel_faraday Listen to me. Nothing is gonna happen to you. Nothing. I won't let it.
miles_straume Hey, we're here!
miles_straume Some rendezvous. It's just us.
dr_daniel_faraday Well, we should probably wait, see if they show up. They could be right behind us.
dr_charlotte_lewis Yeah, or they came and left.
miles_straume Or they're dead.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude... not exactly what we need right now. People are scared enough as it is. Miles—Miles?
miles_straume Wait! Don't move!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Aah!
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE Who's in charge here?
miles_straume He is.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE You just couldn't stay away, could you?
desmond_hume Did he finish his breakfast?
penelope_widmore Yeah. Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end...
penelope_widmore ...unlike his father.
desmond_hume Look, honey, all I have to do is find his mother, tell her he's still on the Island, and then I'm done with this for good.
penelope_widmore Why now? I mean, if he told you all this on the Island, why didn't you remember it until two days ago?
desmond_hume I don't know. Look, I don't understand how any of this works any more than you do. It... Look, I know it happened. Daniel Faraday knocked on the hatch door and told me to go to Oxford... everyone was in danger, and I was the only one that could save them. I know how insane it sounds.
desmond_hume I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done... forever. I promise.
penelope_widmore If you're gonna promise me something, Des, can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again?
desmond_hume Why in God's name would I ever go back there?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE There were twenty of you at the beach, but only five of you here. Where are the rest of your people?
miles_straume Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE We didn't put them here. You did.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE Once we leave here, I will be out of control of what happens to you. But if you cooperate now, things will go much easier for you. So where are the rest of your people?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know.
john_locke Who are these people?
james_ford Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that, with Frogurt on fire and all.
dr_juliet_burke They attacked us on the beach.
john_locke This is a 30-caliber M1 Garand rifle. It looks new.
james_ford Who cares about the rifle? Where the hell you been?
john_locke If you've been going through what I have, James, maybe the more appropriate question would be, when the hell have I been?
james_ford What happened to your leg?
john_locke I got shot.
james_ford By who?
dr_juliet_burke We can swap stories later. We told the rest of our group that we would meet them at the creek. If there's any chance of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving.
james_ford Fine, seeing as we have no rope to make sure these two don't try to kill us again. Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.
cunningham Quare non sunt vestitus eis? (Why don't they have uniforms?)
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Tace! (Be quiet!)
james_ford What?
dr_juliet_burke Cognoscitis qui sumus? (Do you know who we are?)
james_ford What language is that?
dr_juliet_burke They're speaking Latin. That one asked why we aren't in uniform, and this one told him to shut up.
john_locke And how is it that they know how to speak Latin, Juliet?
dr_juliet_burke The same reason I do. Because they're Others.
miles_straume Hey.
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah.
miles_straume We just walked over a fresh grave.
dr_daniel_faraday What?
miles_straume Four U.S. soldiers, dead just under a month. Three of them were shot. One died of radiation poisoning.
dr_daniel_faraday Miles, hey, hey. Did any of them happen to mention what year it is?
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE We're here.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE Richard! We're back.
[Out#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 of the darkness of the tent's interior steps Richard Alpert, looking the same as ever and wearing a blue button-down shirt and blue slacks.
YOUNG#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 BLONDE HOSTILE Caught these three by the creek. This one's their leader.
richard_alpert What's your name?
dr_daniel_faraday What's your name?
richard_alpert My name is Richard Alpert. I assume you've come back for your bomb.
ARCHIVIST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 No, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not finding a record of any Faraday.
desmond_hume No, that—that's impossible. 'Cause I know her son was a professor here. His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database.
ARCHIVIST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Sir, there's no record of any Faraday ever having been employed here at Oxford.
desmond_hume I visited him. I went to his lab. It was in an attic. It was... it was above the physics department.
ARCHIVIST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 The archives go back quite far. Perhaps there was a clerical error. You don't happen to recall the year it was in which you last visited?
desmond_hume The year? ...No. I'm not exactly sure.
ARCHIVIST#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 May I ask why you're seeking this information?
desmond_hume Sorry I wasted your time.
custodian Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.
custodian I wondered when someone'd figure out we weren't just fumigating here.
custodian You a professor?
desmond_hume No. Not exactly.
custodian Well... at least you're honest.
desmond_hume So why'd you tell me not to touch it?
custodian Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made run through this bloody thing down to the incinerator so that no one would find out what he was up to.
desmond_hume You mean Daniel Faraday.
custodian Yeah. You're not the first one to poke around here, asking about him and his work. Rumor had it, he was trying to send rats' brains back in time. Ridiculous, innit?
desmond_hume Aye.
custodian Look, I'll forget you broke my lock if you tell your mates that all you found was rubbish left behind by a madman.
desmond_hume Fair enough.
desmond_hume Faraday—the university says there's no record of him.
custodian Well, can you blame 'em? I mean, after what he'd done to that poor girl?
desmond_hume What girl?
dr_daniel_faraday Hey, take it easy.
dr_charlotte_lewis It's all right, Dan. I'm fine.
miles_straume We are so dead.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. No, no, no. We are not so dead. We're gonna be fine. We just need to keep it together until there's another flash. All right? Then all this disappears.
miles_straume And when's that gonna happen?
dr_daniel_faraday Could be five minutes. Could also be 5,000 years.
miles_straume That's—that's just awesome.
dr_charlotte_lewis What is going on, Dan? Why are they doing this to us?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm not sure. But they must think that we're with the American military. And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive is to let them keep thinking it, all right? Let—
richard_alpert Sorry. Am I interrupting? Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal where the rest of your squad is.
dr_daniel_faraday And why would I do that? So you can kill them, too?
richard_alpert We didn't start this, friend. Your people attacked us. You come to our island to run your tests, you fire on us, and what, you expect us not to defend ourselves?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know anything about that. We are scientists.
richard_alpert So what? So they sent you here to recover it?
dr_daniel_faraday If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes. And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns that the housing has been compromised. Is that right?
dr_daniel_faraday You need to listen to me. You have an unstable device that's capable of destroying this entire island, and it's broken. If you don't allow me to render it inert, all of us are gonna die. All of us.
richard_alpert How do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission? That I'll take you out to the bomb, and you'll just detonate it?
dr_daniel_faraday Because... I'm in love with the woman sitting next to me. And I would never... I would never do anything to hurt her.
richard_alpert All right. Take care of your bomb. But you try anything else, and you will hurt her.
james_ford So who taught you Latin?
dr_juliet_burke Others 101. Gotta learn Latin—language of the enlightened.
james_ford Enlightened, my ass.
john_locke I suggest you talk to us. Once we get back to the creek and meet up with the rest of our people, there's gonna be a lot of anger directed at you for attacking them.
cunningham The rest of your people are either captured or dead.
john_locke What? What makes you say that?
cunningham That idiot shouted out, "Meet at the creek." We knew exactly where they were going. We sent a group after them.
james_ford Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language.
dr_juliet_burke James, wait.
dr_juliet_burke Nos non sumus hostes vobis.
cunningham Itaque nos liberate.
james_ford What the hell are you sayin'?
dr_juliet_burke Duce nos ad vestra castra. Si placet.
cunningham Quare hoc faciam?
dr_juliet_burke Estne... Ricardus ibi? Ricardus Alpert?
john_locke Did you just say "Richard Alpert"?
dr_juliet_burke John, please. Duce nos ad vestra castra. Non necesse est alium mori. Si placet.
cunningham All right. Okay, we need to head east another couple of kilometers until we hit the ridge—
james_ford Shoot him!
james_ford Shoot, damn it!
james_ford Are you crazy?! What were you thinking? Why didn't you shoot him?!
john_locke Because... he's one of my people.
abigail_spencer And who might you be?
desmond_hume Uh, my name's Desmond Hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.
abigail_spencer I'm Abigail Spencer. Theresa's my sister.
desmond_hume Oh, right. Um, can I have a word with her?
abigail_spencer You want to speak to Theresa?
desmond_hume Yeah, I got her name from a—a gentleman I met at Oxford University...um... Daniel Faraday.
abigail_spencer Daniel Faraday? Well, why didn't you say so? Please, you must come in.
desmond_hume Thanks.
abigail_spencer He didn't tell you, did he?
desmond_hume No. No, he didn't. Can she hear us?
abigail_spencer No. Theresa's away right now.
desmond_hume "Away"? What do you mean?
abigail_spencer Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3, wants to know where her dolly is. Yesterday, she was talking to our dad. He died five years ago.
desmond_hume I'm sorry. Um, this was a mistake. I... I shouldn't have come.
abigail_spencer Of course. Why would you want to stay? Daniel certainly didn't.
desmond_hume He left her like this?
abigail_spencer Went running off to the States, never to be heard from again. He abandoned her. What kind of a man does that? I seriously don't know what we would've done if it hadn't been for Mr. Widmore.
desmond_hume Uh, I'm sorry. Who?
abigail_spencer Daniel's benefactor. He funded his research, and he took responsibility for the result of it. He's been taking care of Theresa ever since this happened to her. Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore, God bless him.
miles_straume A hydrogen bomb? Seriously?
dr_daniel_faraday Back in the '50s, the U.S. Government tested H-bombs in the South Pacific.
miles_straume Lucky us.
dr_charlotte_lewis You didn't have to say that.
dr_daniel_faraday Say what?
dr_charlotte_lewis That you loved me. I mean, there are plenty of other ways you could've convinced him you weren't gonna blow up the entire Island.
dr_daniel_faraday I said what I said because I meant it, Charlotte.
ellie Right, then. Let's go.
dr_daniel_faraday Back soon. I promise.
richard_alpert Whatever your, uh, your superiors told you, I want you to know the truth. A month ago, we found 18 members of an Army battalion right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp. We gave them the opportunity to leave the island peacefully. They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill 'em. All of 'em.
dr_daniel_faraday Forced?
richard_alpert Yeah.
dr_daniel_faraday By whom?
richard_alpert Y—you answer to someone, don't you? You follow a chain of command, right?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah.
richard_alpert Yeah, well, so do I.
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Richard! Richard!
richard_alpert What the hell happened to you?
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Cunningham and I — a group of them surprised us. We were outnumbered, but I escaped.
ellie Outnumbered, eh?
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Shut up, Ellie. Who's this?
richard_alpert He's gonna help us take care of our problem. You'd better get going.
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Wait. He's one of them. You can't actually trust him.
richard_alpert Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. Go.
richard_alpert H—how did you escape?
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 I ran.
richard_alpert And it never occurred to you that they might follow you?
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Follow me? Their leader is some sodding old man. What, you think he can track me? You think he knows this island better than I do?
john_locke How did you know Richard would be here?
dr_juliet_burke Richard's always been here.
john_locke How old is he?
dr_juliet_burke Old. Why are you so interested in Richard, John?
john_locke I'm interested in him because he was about to tell me how I could save us.
dr_juliet_burke "Save us"?
john_locke Yeah. But before he could finish, we were interrupted by that flash of light. And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off.
james_ford I hate to bust up the "I'm an Other, you're an Other" reunion, but Faraday — the guy that's actually gonna save us — is being death marched into the jungle right now.
john_locke Good luck with that.
james_ford You're not gonna help me save him?
john_locke No. I'm gonna go down and finish my conversation with Richard.
james_ford That's gonna get us all killed. You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here.
john_locke Fair enough. I'll give you ten minutes head start.
james_ford What about you? You wanna stay here in Crazytown or help me rescue the geek?
ellie Why do you keep looking at me?
dr_daniel_faraday No, no, I'm—I'm not. I—
ellie You are.
dr_daniel_faraday You know what? You're right. I'm—I'm sorry. It's just... you look so much like... someone I used to know.
ellie Someone other than the girl you just professed your love for? Well, aren't you the Romeo.
dr_daniel_faraday Far from it, believe me.
ellie I don't believe you, by the way. You may have Richard fooled, you can't really expect me to believe that you, a British woman and a Chinese man are all members of the United States military. Who are you and what are you doing on our island?
dr_daniel_faraday You wanna know who I am?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm your best chance at disarming that bomb.
ellie Right, then, disarm it.
ellie What are you doing up there?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm examining it.
dr_daniel_faraday Back up.
ellie What?
dr_daniel_faraday Get back, get back. It's unsafe. We need to move.
ellie I swear, if you try anything...
dr_daniel_faraday If I try anything—what, you're gonna—you're gonna shoot me? Is that right? Yeah, that would be perfect because, of course, rifle fire right next to—what would you call this—hydrogen bomb? Yes, fantastic idea. Really... inspired. Okay, listen to me. Do you people have any access to lead or concrete?
ellie For what?
dr_daniel_faraday There's a crack in the casing. It needs to be filled with lead. You need to take it off this platform carefully and bury it.
ellie You brought me all the way out here to tell us that we have to bury it? You told Alpert you could disarm that thing.
dr_daniel_faraday You don't need to worry. You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off.
ellie How do you know that?
dr_daniel_faraday I need you to trust me.
ellie I don't trust you.
dr_daniel_faraday Just bury it. Bury it, and everything will be fine. Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this.
ellie How can you be so sure?
dr_daniel_faraday You wanna take care of this bomb?
ellie How?!
dr_daniel_faraday You bury it!
ellie How do you know that?
dr_daniel_faraday Because 50 years from now, this island is still here!
dr_daniel_faraday There you—
ellie What did you just say?
dr_daniel_faraday Whoa. Take it easy. I can explain myself a little better. I know how this sounds. Believe me, it's... oh, it's hard to explain. 50 years from now, me and my... me and my friends—that's where we're from, okay? And—here's the key—everything's fine. I'm not saying it's perfectly fine, but there hasn't been any atomic blast, all right? There has not—
james_ford Drop the gun, Blondie.
dr_daniel_faraday It's okay. She's okay. You can put your gun down.
james_ford She puts hers down first.
dr_juliet_burke Why don't we all put our guns down?
james_ford I said, drop it!
james_ford Son of a bitch.
ellie Are they from the future, too?
james_ford You told her?
secretary Sir! Sir, you can't—
secretary Mr. Widmore. I'm so sorry. He charged right past me.
charles_widmore That's all right, Melanie. Mr. Hume is a... colleague of mine.
charles_widmore Please leave us.
desmond_hume I know you have questions for me. I'm not gonna answer them. I've come here to ask you something. And once you've told me everything I need to know, you'll never see me again. Understand?
charles_widmore All right.
desmond_hume I need to know where I can find Daniel Faraday's mother.
charles_widmore What makes you think I would even know the answer to that?
desmond_hume Because even before you put Faraday on your little boat and sent him off to the Island, you spent ten years funding his research. So I figure, you must know something regarding his next of kin.
charles_widmore Desmond, I haven't seen or heard from my daughter for three years. Just answer me this. Is she safe?
desmond_hume Where's Faraday's mother?
charles_widmore She's in Los Angeles. This is an address for her.
charles_widmore I suspect she won't be pleased to see you. She's a very private person.
charles_widmore Wait, Desmond.
charles_widmore Deliver your message... but then get out of this mess. Don't put Penny's life in danger.
desmond_hume Danger?
charles_widmore You're getting yourself involved in something that goes back many, many years. It has nothing to do with you or my daughter. Wherever you were hiding... go back there.
desmond_hume Thanks for the advice.
john_locke Richard Alpert!
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Hey. Hey!
john_locke I'm looking for Richard.
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Don't move.
john_locke Richard Alpert!
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 On the ground now.
john_locke Richard, I need to talk to you!
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 Shut—your—mouth!
richard_alpert That's enough! Who are you?
john_locke My name is John Locke.
richard_alpert Is that supposed to mean something to me?
john_locke Jacob sent me.
richard_alpert Put the gun down.
JONES#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode03 What? Richard, you can't seriously trust him.
richard_alpert I said... put the gun down, Widmore.
john_locke Your name is Widmore? Charles Widmore?
charles_widmore What's it to you?
john_locke Nothing. Nice to meet you.
penelope_widmore ...and the fishy suddenly peeked out, but it saw the bear so that it ran away again. Where—?
desmond_hume Hi.
penelope_widmore Hi.
desmond_hume Good day?
penelope_widmore Yeah. He wanted to go fishing in the Thames. We were unsuccessful. And you? Did you find Faraday's mum?
desmond_hume Ugh. There was no one to find. She, um... she died a few years ago.
penelope_widmore Why are you lying to me?
desmond_hume What? I'm not.
penelope_widmore Where is she?
desmond_hume She's in Los Angeles.
desmond_hume Look, Pen, you've got nothing to worry about. You know, this was a mistake. No, I... I made a promise that this would be done in a day, and now it's done. It's not our problem anymore.
penelope_widmore And what happens if you wake up tomorrow and remember something else?
desmond_hume Then I'll forget it.
penelope_widmore And the next day?
desmond_hume I'll forget it. It doesn't matter, Pen. You're my life now—you and Charlie. I won't leave you again... not for this... not for anything.
penelope_widmore You'll never forget it, Des. So I guess we're going with you.
richard_alpert I gave you this?
john_locke Yes.
richard_alpert After you were shot in the leg and I... wandered out of the jungle to patch you up?
john_locke That's right.
richard_alpert Then why don't I remember... well, any of this?
john_locke Because it hasn't happened yet.
richard_alpert I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say, John Locke.
john_locke I expect you to tell me how to get off the Island.
richard_alpert That's very privileged information. Why would I share it with you?
john_locke Because you told me that I had something very important to do once I get there. And because I'm your leader.
richard_alpert You're my leader?
john_locke That's what you told me.
richard_alpert Look, I... certainly don't want to contradict myself, but... we have a very specific process for selecting our leadership, and it starts at a v—very, very young age.
john_locke All right. All right. What year is it right now?
richard_alpert It's 1954.
john_locke All right. May 30, 1956—2 years from now—that's the day I'm born—Tustin, California, and if you don't believe me, I suggest you come and visit me.
john_locke Oh, no.
richard_alpert What's wrong?
john_locke It's about to happen again. You need to tell me now, Richard. How do I get off the Island? Please! Tell me!
james_ford You all right?
dr_juliet_burke Yeah. I think so.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte!
dr_daniel_faraday You okay?
dr_charlotte_lewis Yeah, I'm fine.
miles_straume Yeah, me, too. I'm great, too.
dr_charlotte_lewis Ahh.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte.
dr_daniel_faraday Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! No, no, no. Look it. Hey. Look at me, look at me.
dr_daniel_faraday It's okay. It's okay. Charlotte!
