JACK Hey.
KATE Oh, you don't have to whisper. When he's out, he's out.
JACK At least one of us can sleep.
KATE It's gonna take more than two nights for me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed. What are we gonna do about him? About Aaron.
JACK I don't know.
KATE I've been thinking a lot about him. Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption?
JACK No. No, I didn't.
KATE I think we should say he's mine.
JACK What?
KATE We could say that I was six months pregnant when I was arrested and that I gave birth to him on the Island. No one would ever know.
JACK Kate, no. You don't have to... There's other ways to вo this.
KATE After everyone we've lost—Michael, Jin, Sawyer... I can't lose him, too.
JACK Sawyer's not dead.
KATE No. But he's gone. Good night, Jack.
JACK Kate... If we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna protect the people that we left behind, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to convince everyone to lie. If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it. So I'm gonna turn to you first. Are you with me?
KATE I have always been with you.
SUN How does it fit?
KATE It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.
SUN Looks great on you. Are you sure you want to do this?
KATE It was your idea.
AARON Mommy!
KATE Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand. I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.
SUN Don't worry about us, Kate. There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on TV. We're going to be just fine here.
KATE Sun... I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here. Thank you.
SUN It's what any friend would do.
KATE Okay, well, I will be back soon. Okay, you be good for Sun. Okay, honey?
SUN Good luck.
MAN Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.
SUN Thank you. Thanks.
SUN I'll be right back, honey.
JULIET Charlotte? Charlotte?
SAWYER What the hell's wrong with her? She's been out for 10 minutes.
JULIET Stop shouting, James.
MILES Hey, man.
FARADAY Thank you.
JULIET If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel, now would be a good time.
FARADAY I'm not sure what you mean exactly.
SAWYER She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.
JULIET Give us some space, would you?
SAWYER She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up. He knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it.
JULIET James... go away.
JULIET Did you know that this would happen?
FARADAY I thought... I thought it might. I think it's neurological. Our brains have an internal clock, a sense of time. The flashes... throw the clock off. It's like really bad jet lag.
JULIET Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel. You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?
FARADAY I don't know. But thank God it's not.
NORTON Thank you for waiting. Did my assistant offer you something to drink?
KATE Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.
NORTON Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit. So... how can I help you?
KATE Uh... Mr. Norton, when you came to my house looking for blood samples from me and my son, I asked you who your client was...
NORTON And I said I couldn't tell you.
KATE Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal. I'll give you the blood samples, but first, I wanna talk to your client. Considering what you're asking for, that's more than reasonable.
NORTON Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today, and I will be sure to pass along your offer. But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be—no. And the reason, of course, is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals, and we both know it. I have a signed court order compelling you to let us confirm that you're the child's mother. I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it, but my client insists that we... handle the exchange of custody quietly.
KATE What do you mean "exchange of custody"?
NORTON You know exactly what I mean.
KATE No, I... Mr. Norton, I just wanna know who is doing this to me.
NORTON You did this to yourself. Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen. You are going to lose the boy.
LOCKE We have to go back to the Orchid.
SAWYER Excuse me?
LOCKE The Orchid. That's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
SAWYER That greenhouse is a long ways away.
LOCKE You said you had a Zodiac raft back at the beach. We could take that, cut around the horn of the Island, be at the Orchid in half the time.
SAWYER And let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.
LOCKE No, not exactly at all, but I know that Ben used it to leave the Island. And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.
SAWYER And how you gonna do that?
LOCKE This is all happening because they left. I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.
SAWYER Bring who back?
LOCKE Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.
SAWYER The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.
LOCKE They're not dead, James.
SAWYER Says who?
LOCKE That doesn't matter. All that matters is they've gotta come back. I have to make them come back... even if it kills me. Don't you want 'em to come back, James? Don't you want her to come back?
SAWYER It doesn't matter what I want.
MILES Hey! She's waking up!
FARADAY Are you okay?
CHARLOTTE Who are you?
FARADAY It's me. It's Daniel.
CHARLOTTE Daniel. Oh, my head. What happened?
FARADAY There was another flash. You passed out. How do you feel?
CHARLOTTE A bit dizzy, but... I'm fine.
FARADAY Good.
MILES Hooray. Everything's back to normal. Now what?
SAWYER I'll tell you "now what". We're going to the Orchid.
JACK Dilation's almost back to normal.
SAYID Good. Now take this IV out of my arm, and let's go.
JACK Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours. You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer in your system.
SAYID If you sent that man to Hurley's house, we have to leave now.
JACK You need to relax. Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley. Ben is on our side.
SAYID The only side he's on is his own.
DR. ARIZA Dr. Shephard? I'm Dr. Ariza, director of clinical services. A word with you, please?
JACK I'll be right back.
DR. ARIZA What do you think you are doing here?
JACK I was treating a patient. I apologize. It was an emergency. I know that—
DR. ARIZA You were suspended on charges of substance abuse. Emergency or not, Dr. Shephard, you have no business being here.
JACK I understand, and I take full responsibility for my actions.
DR. ARIZA No, Doctor. The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions, and that makes us liable for them.
JACK Excuse me.
JACK Hello?
HURLEY Jack? It's me.
JACK Hurley.
HURLEY Hey, did Sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?
JACK Yes. He did. Hurley, where are—
HURLEY Is he okay?
JACK He's fine.
HURLEY Awesome.
JACK Hurley, where are you?
HURLEY Dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in L.A. County lockup. Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said. I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now. Thanks, dude.
JACK What are you talking about, Hurley? Wait! Wait—
BEN Good. You're here. How's Sayid?
NURSE How you doing today, sir? Got your meds for you.
SAYID Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.
NURSE Nope. Room 133, right? Got the orders right here. But don't worry. I won't have to give you an injection. Put this right in your IV line.
SAYID Who are you? Who are you working for?
NURSE 
SAYID Okay, talk, talk.
NURSE Address — it's in my pocket.
BEN Hello, Sayid.
JACK What happened?
SAYID Do we know anyone who lives at 42 Panorama Crest?
JACK That's Kate's address.
KATE Hello?
JACK Kate? It's Jack. Are you okay?
KATE Yeah. I'm fine.
JACK Where are you right now? Are you at home?
KATE Uh... what?
JACK Listen, I'll explain everything once you're out, but you've gotta get Aaron—
KATE Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm... Aaron is at a hotel with Sun.
JACK Sun? Sun's in L.A.?
KATE Yeah, she's here on business. Listen. Jack, this is really not a good time. I'm so sorry that I even picked up the phone. I'm not—
JACK Kate, do not hang up on me. Please listen. Listen, uh ... will you tell me where you are? I need to see you. Kate, please.
KATE I'm downtown. Wilshire and Olive.
JACK Okay. All right. I'm on my way.
JACK She's not at home, but I'm gonna go to her right now.
BEN Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
SAYID Sorry, Ben. I'm not letting you get anywhere near him.
BEN You have friends in trouble. Let's get them to safety and save the dirty linen for later.
SAYID I'll drive.
BEN After you get Kate, meet us at the Long Beach Marina, slip 23. And, Jack — hurry. We're running out of time.
SAWYER Hey, Locke? What are you gonna say to her?
LOCKE Sorry?
SAWYER Kate. What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back?
LOCKE I haven't figured that out yet.
SAWYER Well, let me tell you something. She was pretty excited to hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here.
MILES What the hell is that?
LOCKE Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.
SAWYER Beach is this way. Now you wanna take the scenic route?
FARADAY John... do you know when we are?
LOCKE We need to keep moving.
FARADAY Hey. How's your headache?
CHARLOTTE Better. Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh?
FARADAY Well, don't worry. Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the Zodiac around the other side of the island and you can rest.
CHARLOTTE You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. I'm fine.
JULIET You okay?
MILES I'm peachy.
SAWYER Shh!
MILES Now what?
SAWYER Nobody move.
LOCKE James!
SAWYER I got this.
CLAIRE It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away. Babies know that stuff.
KATE Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen. Do you want this baby? Do you want it to be safe and healthy?
KATE You're not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours. But I need you to push. Okay?
KATE One, two, three... push! Push!
KATE Come on, Claire! Push!
CLAIRE Aah!
KATE Okay! He's coming!
KATE Push! Push! Push! Push!
KATE Push! Push! Push! Push!
LOCKE James? What happened? Did you see something out here, James?
SAWYER Don't matter. It's gone now.
KATE You shaved your beard.
JACK Yeah. Just needed a change.
KATE Look, Jack, uh... I don't know why you called, but I can't be dealing with this right now. I...
JACK What's going on?
KATE Nothing. Just... can you just go?
JACK Why don't you just tell me?
KATE Jack, please, just go.
JACK Kate, please, tell me.
KATE Somebody wants Aaron.
JACK What?
KATE There's a lawyer in there. His clients — they know we're lying. They know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away.
JACK Who's gonna take him away?
JACK What—what are you doing?
KATE Look, I gotta go, all right? Get in or don't.
LOCKE Hey. You ready to tell me who you saw back there?
SAWYER I already told you. It was nothin'.
LOCKE You and I both know when we were before the flash, James. So who was it you saw? Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?
SAWYER And how is it that you knew when we were, Johnny Boy? That light in the sky — it was from the Hatch, wasn't it?
LOCKE The night that Boone died... I went out there and started pounding on it as hard as I could. I was... confused... scared. Babbling like an idiot, asking, why was all this happening to me?
SAWYER Did you get an answer?
LOCKE Light came on, shot up into the sky. At the time, I thought it meant something.
SAWYER Did it?
LOCKE No. It was just a light.
SAWYER So why'd you turn us around then? Don't you wanna go back there?
LOCKE Why would I wanna do that?
SAWYER So you could tell yourself to do things different, save yourself a world of pain.
LOCKE No, I needed that pain — to get to where I am now.
MILES Hey. I just got a nosebleed.
FARADAY What? When?
MILES Let's just not freak out the others, okay? Just tell me... why—why her? Why me?
FARADAY I don't know. Uh, I think it might have something to do with duration of exposure. You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.
MILES Doesn't make any sense. Those yahoos have been here for months. I've never been here before two weeks ago.
FARADAY Are you sure about that?
SAWYER Hello?!
JULIET The camp's back.
SAWYER Finally. Anybody for a DHARMA beer? Hello? Anybody here? Rose? Bernard?
LOCKE I wonder how long ago this happened.
SAWYER Son of a bitch!
JULIET What is it?
LOCKE It's Vincent's.
SAWYER Yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog? Where's the rest of our people?
FARADAY The Zodiac's gone, too.
CHARLOTTE Maybe your people took the boat.
SAWYER Why the hell would they do that?
MILES To get away from whoever came in those.
CHARLOTTE Where did these come from?
FARADAY That's a good question. They're pretty old.
MILES Not that old. 
SAWYER Let me see that. "Adg-eh-ruh"?
JULIET Ajira. It's an airline. It's based out of India, but they fly everywhere.
SAWYER Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to Vegas tonight.
SAWYER Who came in these? Other Others?
JULIET Don't look at me.
FARADAY My question is, when are they coming back?
LOCKE Let's not wait to find out.
MILES This plan sounded a hell of a lot better when we were going by motorboat. How far is this place?
LOCKE It's around that point. Not more than a couple hours.
MILES Oh, joy.
JULIET You all right?
SAWYER I saw Kate.
JULIET What?
SAWYER Last night, in the jungle. Before the last flash. She was delivering Claire's baby.
JULIET But that was two months ago.
SAWYER Time travel's a bitch.
JULIET Get down!
SAWYER Paddle!
MILES I think they want their boat back!
LOCKE Move!
MILES These your people?!
JULIET No! Are they yours?!
SAWYER Shut up and keep paddling!
SAWYER Little help! Little help!
SAWYER Paddle harder! They're getting closer!
SAWYER Thank you, Lord!
SAWYER I take that back!
LOCKE Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore!
JACK Kate, just because the guy told you that he was meeting his client doesn't mean that they're here in L.A. He could've just told you that to—to throw you off.
KATE Or they're in that hotel right now.
JACK Okay. And what if they are? What if the person who wants to take Aaron is sitting in that hotel room right now? Then what? Come on. Come with me. We'll—we'll go get Aaron, we'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.
KATE All right.
KATE Oh my god.
JACK It's Claire's mother.
JACK Wait.
KATE What am I waiting for, Jack?
JACK Wait. I just... let's just think about this for a minute.
KATE She knows.
JACK Maybe she doesn't know.
KATE No, but she knows about Aaron, and that's all that matters!
JACK Let me go talk to her.
KATE What?
JACK If I can just explain to her why we did it — maybe if I can get her to understand why... she'll listen to me. I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it. Hey... Aaron is my family too.
CAROLE Dr. Shephard?
JACK Hello, Ms. Littleton. Um... may I come in?
CAROLE Of course.
CAROLE You look drenched.
JACK No, no. No, I'm fine.
CAROLE God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral. How did you even know I was here?
JACK Uh... I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton, because I followed your lawyer.
CAROLE Why would you do that?
JACK I'm — I did it because, um... I understand that you feel the need to do this. But I need you to know that everything that Kate and I have done—it was for Aaron.
CAROLE Who's... Aaron? I—I'm afraid I'm not following you.
JACK Ms. Littleton, um... what are you doing here in Los Angeles?
JACK Let's go. Drive. Then call Sun and tell her to bring Aaron to the Long Beach Marina. We'll meet her there.
KATE What—wh-what are you talking about? What happened?
JACK Kate, we have to go now.
KATE I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what just happened!
JACK She doesn't know anything.
KATE What?
JACK She doesn't know. She still thinks that Claire is dead. She doesn't even know that Aaron exists.
KATE But the lawyer—
JACK She sued Oceanic, and she's in town to pick up her settlement.
KATE What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawyer happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?
JACK I don't know. But whoever's trying to take Aaron... it's not her.
KATE Then who is it?
BEN Can I ask you something? Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue Hugo?
SAYID I had to make sure Hurley was safe.
BEN You can pull in over here.
NORTON Mr. Linus.
BEN Mr. Norton.
NORTON I looked into it, and they don't have any kind of solid case against Reyes. The M.E. said that the man found outside Santa Rosa was killed before Reyes escaped.
BEN That's very good news.
NORTON We have a prelim hearing in the morning. The judge will never let it get past that, and Reyes will be a free man.
BEN Thank you, Dan.
NORTON Anytime.
SAYID Who was that?
BEN That's my lawyer.
LOCKE Aah! Okay!
MILES Remind me never to do that again.
FARADAY Where are we?
LOCKE It's hard to say til it gets light.
JULIET We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.
SAWYER What conversation was that?
JULIET The one before they started shooting at us, where you were about to tell me how it felt to see Kate again.
SAWYER I wasn't about to tell you anything.
JULIET Why don't you tell me now?
SAWYER I was close enough to touch her. If I wanted to, I could've... stood right up and talked to her.
JULIET Why didn't you?
SAWYER What's done is done... Juliet?
JULIET What's wrong?
CHARLOTTE Oi! Come and look at this!
CHARLOTTE It's wreckage. Looks like it just happened.
LOCKE Anybody speak French?
ROBERT Mais j'te l'ai dit, on aurait jamais dû suivre ces maudits chiffres ! 
MONTAND Mais c'est pas ma faute, Robert. C'est Brennan qui devait tenir le sonar ! 
BRENNAN Mais je le faisais, Montand! Je vous l'ai déja dit, les instruments ont mal fonctionné ! 
YOUNG WOMAN Un homme à la mer ! 
ROBERT Quoi? 
BRENNAN Mais je pensais qu'on était tous là ! 
MONTAND On est tous là ! Il n'est pas des nôtres. 
BRENNAN Alors qui est-ce? 
ROBERT Pagaie!
MONTAND Pagayez! Allez! 
UNKNOWN Pointez la lampe de poche sur lui. 
YOUNG WOMAN Il faut tenir la lampe torche. Brennan, aide-les à pagayer. 
UNKNOWN Allez! Dépêchez-vous ! Nous dérivons avec le courant. 
UNKNOWN Non, y'a que lui ! Pas de bateau, rien. 
UNKNOWN Les vagues vont nous amener jusque sur la côte. 
UNKNOWN Le vent va passer par ici. 
YOUNG WOMAN Au nom de dieu, Brennan ! Ta gueule ! 
UNKNOWN Allez, tirez-le dans le radeau. 
UNKNOWN Aide moi. 
UNKNOWN Il est lourd ! 
UNKNOWN Tiens, il respire encore. 
KATE Jack, why did you call me today?
JACK I told you. I was... I was worried.
KATE But why? Why were you worried? Why today?
KATE I don't...
JACK Right before I called you, Sayid was attacked. And the guy that did it—your address was in his pocket.
KATE Sayid? What's he doing here?
JACK That's not important right now. What matters is that we get you and Aaron someplace safe.
KATE Safe from who?
BEN Hello, Kate.
JACK It's okay. He's with me.
KATE He's with you?
JACK I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but he's here to help us. To help everyone that we left behind. We all need to be together again.
KATE It's him.
JACK What?
KATE It's him. He's the one who's trying to take Aaron.
JACK No. No. You—you don't understand.
BEN No, Jack. She's right. It was me. Sorry.
KATE Who the hell do you think you are? Why don't you just stay away?! Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
BEN Because he's not your son, Kate.
AUTOMATED VOICE OVER RADIO 4... 8...
MONTAND Robert... Regarde, le signal vient de l'île. 
ROBERT Tu peux déterminer la source ? 
AUTOMATED VOICE OVER RADIO 15... 16...

ROBERT What boat?
JIN It's gone. Sink.
YOUNG WOMAN It must've been caught in the same storm as ours.
MONTAND Who are you? How long you in the water?
JIN I don't know.
MONTAND How do you not know how you wound up in the middle of the ocean, huh?
YOUNG WOMAN Montand ! Laisse-le, il est en état de choc. On a de l’eau à lui donner ?
