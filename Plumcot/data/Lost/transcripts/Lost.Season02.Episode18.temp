LIBBY Isn't this nice?
HURLEY I kind of prefer breathing.
LIBBY Come on, you're doing great. You know, exercise is addictive.
HURLEY Wow, I can -- I can see why.
HURLEY I guess I need to drop a few pounds.
LIBBY Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not going to happen overnight. Some people's metabolisms are just a little slower.
HURLEY It's not my metabolism. I'm sick.
LIBBY What? What's wrong?
HURLEY Never mind. 
LIBBY Hurley, you can trust me.
HURLEY Okay, but it's bad.
HURLEY When we first crashed here, I thought, this isn't all bad -- it's, like, the all mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing but I did drop a couple belt sizes. Then we found this hatch and it was full of food -- tons of food. I tried giving it all away, but I guess I kind of kept some of it for myself. I wish I could just get rid of it.
LIBBY Then get rid of it.
LIBBY You want to change -- then change.
LIBBY How do you feel?
HURLEY I feel free.
JIN 뭘 찾았대! 뭘 찾았대!
SUN They found something. Come on!
Charlie Risotto. Nice.
HURLEY No.
LIBBY Where did this come from?
JIN 누가 여기다 떨어뜨렸나봐.
CHARLIE Locke said some kind of blast doors trapped him in the Hatch. Maybe it was because of this -- so no one would see who dropped it. Any of you guys see a plane last night?
SAWYER Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo. I just decided not to tell.
REDSHIRT #1 Hey, give those back, man. Those are mine.
REDSHIRT #2 No, man. I saw them first.
HURLEY No.
REDSHIRT #1 No, you saw me put those in my box.
REDSHIRT #2 No way.
REDSHIRT #1 Give me my stuff, man!
SAWYER Hold on, take it easy. You guys are like locusts. How about a little order here?
CHARLIE Shouldn't we let someone a little more trustworthy take care of this?
SAWYER Like you, babynapper?
CHARLIE No, like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's done it before, he can do it again.
HURLEY No. No way! Not me, no! Not again, no!
LIBBY Okay, hey, hey, guys, guys, how about no one's in charge, okay? I'm sure everyone can manage to just take what they need.
SAWYER Great plan, Moonbeam. And after that we can sing "Kumbaya" and do trust falls.
CHARLIE You don't have to be savages about it.
SAWYER We can do it anyway you want.
HURLEY Hey! Hey!!
HURLEY Uh-oh.
LIBBY Hey. What are you doing?
HURLEY Nothing.
LIBBY Who were you looking for out there?
HURLEY No one.
LIBBY When you ran off it sort of seemed like you were looking for someone. I tried to find you.
HURLEY I kind of -- don't want to talk about it.
LIBBY Sure, okay. Pretty weird, huh? So the Island won't let you lose weight -- you destroy your stash, then bang -- more food falls from the sky.
HURLEY How about that?
LIBBY I'm proud of you.
HURLEY Proud of me for what?
LIBBY Not freaking out.
DR. BROOKS How's the diet coming, Hugo?
HURLEY It's okay. I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.
DR. BROOKS That's great. It gets easier, I promise. So I heard you had a visit with your mom. How did that go?
HURLEY It was good.
DR. BROOKS You're not still mad at her, then?
HURLEY Nah. I know she put me in here for a reason.
DR. BROOKS What reason was that?
HURLEY The accident.
DR. BROOKS You want to talk about that today?
HURLEY Do we have to?
DR. BROOKS Hugo, you've been in here almost 2 months, now. Don't you think it's time to start getting our hands dirty? Okay, why don't we talk about the little homework assignment that I gave you?
HURLEY I was never really good at homework.
DR. BROOKS You remember what you were supposed to do -- just make a list of things you like about yourself?
HURLEY Nobody else did it.
DR. BROOKS Nobody else -- meaning -- ?
HURLEY Well, Dave didn't do it. He said it was a stupid idea.
DR. BROOKS Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor, but we have talked about how he could be a very negative influence.
HURLEY Dave's the most normal person in this place, man.
DR. BROOKS But he doesn't want you to change, does he?
DAVE Dude, dude, I'm open, dude! It's called dribbling, not drooling -- dribbling. Well, shoot it then! Shoot it! Wait -- oh, high percentage shot, excellent choice. Do you want in the game, man? Go for it. Something tells me no one will care. What's the matter with you?
HURLEY Nothing.
DAVE Dude, dude, give up the rock!
DAVE Fantastic, give it to the guy who's not even in the game!! Hey, it's taco night, dude, let's blow this pop stand. What?
HURLEY Brooks said you're, like, negative.
DAVE Well, duh. So what, you don't want to hang out with me anymore?
HURLEY Nah, I don't know, it's just...
DAVE Is that quack getting inside your head, man? Do not let him. You've got much more important things to think about.
HURLEY Like what?
DAVE Like hard or soft shell, baby -- chicken or shrimp -- sour cream or hot sauce.
HURLEY Yeah, I guess I could eat.
DAVE Yeah, I thought so -- noche de tacos, amigo.
JACK Good. Now, can you do the other one?
LOCKE Is it broken?
JACK Without an x-ray, you're just going to have to do with my best guess.
JACK Sorry.
KATE How are you holding up?
LOCKE Depends on Jack's best guess.
JACK There's a small fracture -- probably hairline. This will keep the swelling down until I can get a splint on it.
LOCKE How long 'til I can walk on it?
JACK You're going to have to keep off it a couple of weeks. There's a wheelchair back at camp...
LOCKE No! -- I don't need a wheelchair.
KATE We took a pair of crutches from the fuselage when we moved down the beach. Okay. I'll be back in a while.
LOCKE He could have escaped.
JACK Sorry?
LOCKE Henry -- during the lockdown -- I was hurt. He could have escaped. But he came back to help me, why would he do that?
JACK He didn't come back to help you, John. He came back because he thought his story was going to check out.
GALE He was dead already. 4 months ago I was part of the search party. Henry Gale was hanging out of the basket -- neck broken.
SAYID So he was already dead?
GALE Yes.
SAYID Then you buried him and left a grave marker?
GALE Yes.
SAYID You really should have checked his wallet before you did that. I assume Henry Gale did not have any paper on which to compose his thoughts, so he had to improvise. There wasn't much space for that. "Jennifer, well, you were right. Crossing the Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer. I'm hiking to one of the beaches to start a signal fire. But if you're reading this I guess I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny. Always have -- always will. Yours, Henry." So tell me, how did Henry Gale write a note to his wife with a broken neck?
GALE It wasn't me. I didn't kill him. You don't understand.
SAYID How did you know his wife's name? Did you interrogate him?
GALE Please, just listen. I'm just a --
SAYID How many of you are there?
GALE If I told you about them -- you have no idea what he'll do.
SAYID He?
ANA You mean their leader -- the guy with the beard.
GALE Him?! He's no one! Nothing!
SAYID Where are your people?
GALE I can't...
SAYID How many of you are there?!
GALE You don't understand!
SAYID Understand this --
ANA Hey.
SAYID You have 3 seconds to answer my question. How many of you are there? 1 --
GALE He'll kill me!
SAYID I'll kill you. 2...
ANA Sayid!
GALE You can't do this! I am not a bad person!
SAYID 3.
ANA What the hell is wrong with you?
LOCKE What's going on?! I heard a gun shot!
JACK What happened?
SAYID He's a liar!
ANA It's fine, just get him out of here.
LOCKE Jack! Jack! Jack!
JACK I've got it covered, John.
GALE Thank you.
ANA Shut up.
CHARLIE Hey, I noticed you were building something. I thought maybe you could use this -- for whatever it is.
EKO That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie. Why don't you help me?
CHARLIE What are you making?
EKO Hold that end.
CHARLIE Is it a Starbucks?
EKO Help me carry one of those logs, please.
CHARLIE Are you going to tell me?
EKO Not right now.
HURLEY You're not here!
HURLEY Hey, wait!
HURLEY Wait, Dave!
CHARLIE Are you okay, Hurley?
HURLEY Did either of you see a guy run through here -- in a bathrobe, with a coconut?
CHARLIE No. Saw a polar bear on roller blades with a mango.
EKO I did not see anything, Hurley.
HURLEY Yeah, me either.
LENNY 4, 8, 15... 
HURLEY Uh, dude.
DAVE Pretty sneaky, Leonard. You're using those magic numbers of yours as a psyche-out, are you man? Oh, yeah, that's right, you just play dumb. I'm on to your juju, man.
HURLEY They're just numbers, man.
DAVE Hey. What the hell is that?
HURLEY It's my mid-afternoon snack.
DAVE Dude, that's celery. Celery is not a snack. Leonard's got graham crackers, man. You should snag one. He won't notice. What's he going to do -- call you a 23? 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hike!
NURSE Here, Hugo. Here's your meds.
HURLEY Thank you, nurse Lazenby.
DAVE Dude, you want to get out of here with me? Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
HURLEY What do mean, get out of here?
DAVE I mean escape, man. Me and you, A-S-A-P. They're getting to you, dude. We've got to split.
HURLEY Dr. Brooks says...
DAVE Dr. Brooks does not care about you, man. He's the one prescribing that crap. What the hell is it, anyway?
HURLEY Clonazepam.
DR. BROOKS Hugo, something wrong with your meds, there?
HURLEY No, me and Dave were just, you know, talking about stuff.
DR. BROOKS Right, well, sorry to interrupt. Hello there, Dave.
DAVE Hello there, Dr. Brooks.
DR. BROOKS And how are you today?
DAVE Never been saner.
DR. BROOKS I've been taking some pictures for the bulletin board. I've got everyone except you 2. Would you guys mind?
HURLEY Okay.
DR. BROOKS Okay. Why don't you two get a little bit closer.
DAVE Are you going to make us look at the ducky, too?
DR. BROOKS Say cheese.
HURLEY Cheese.
DAVE Queso.
DR. BROOKS Great. Okay, you -- you need a little water with that?
HURLEY Nope, I'm good.
DR. BROOKS Okay, well fine. See you later guys, thanks for the photo op.
DAVE Dude.
HURLEY Dude.
DAVE The revolution has begun, man. Lay low -- when the time is right we fly.
HURLEY You've got to twist it to get the frosting. Pulling it will only break the cookie.
SAWYER Well, that's what I get for not going to the expert in the first place. What can I do you for, Deepdish?
HURLEY I'm kind of looking for something.
SAWYER Forget it. I'm done trading. I got enough food now to open a chain of mini-marts. Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?
HURLEY Well, actually, I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor. Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog -- that you killed?
SAWYER Yeah, I remember.
HURLEY I sort of -- need some medicine.
SAWYER What do you need?
HURLEY It's called Clonazepam.
SAWYER Clonaza -- what? What the hell's that?
HURLEY So you can calm down. Or, for when you're seeing things that aren't supposed to be there.
SAWYER What stuff you seeing?
HURLEY I don't know, maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe.
SAWYER You mean like that guy there?
SAWYER Gotcha.
SAWYER What the hell are you doing? Get off of me.
HURLEY Who the hell do you think you are?!
SAWYER Let go of me.
SUN 뭐야?
HURLEY Pork Rinds! Barbar! Jabba! Stay Puft!
SUN 어우 안되겠다, 가서 도와줘요.
HURLEY Mongo! Lardo!
SAWYER Let go of me. Get him off me.
SUN 도와 줘요!
JIN 이제 그만 해!
SAWYER What the hell's the matter with you? Get off me.
SAWYER What the hell's the matter with you?
JIN 그만 해.
SAWYER You're crazy!
HURLEY I'm not crazy. -- I'm not crazy.
KATE So, he just attacked you, huh?
SAWYER Try to contain yourself, Freckles.
KATE What? I'm -- I'm worried. You look like you got your ass kicked.
SAWYER Don't you got an adventure to get to? I think Timmy fell down a well over that way.
KATE Seriously though, why would Hurley of all people...?
SAWYER I've got no idea. I didn't do nothing. He just Hulked-out on me.
KATE For no reason at all?
SAWYER Okay, you walk off and have yourself a nice long giggle. But steer clear -- the man is crazy.
LIBBY Hurley? Hey, are you okay? What happened with Sawyer?
HURLEY I don't want to talk about it.
LIBBY So, you beat him up?
HURLEY I guess you know what happened, then.
LIBBY I'm on your side, whatever you tell me...
HURLEY I don't want to talk, okay!
HURLEY What?
LIBBY That's a lot of peanut butter.
HURLEY Well, I'm going to need a lot of protein where I'm going.
LIBBY Where are you going?
HURLEY Back to the caves. No one lives there anymore, so I won't bother anybody. I'm just going to live alone and be one of those guys -- you know, the crazy guys -- with a big beard and no clothes who's naked and throws doodie at people.
LIBBY Hurley, you don't have to do this.
HURLEY Just leave me alone. You can't help me. No one can.
HURLEY You're not here. You were in the hospital. You can't be here.
DAVE Sorry, dude. I am here.
HURLEY I like that I have a good relationship with my mom. I like making my grandpa, Tito, laugh. I like chicken.
DR. BROOKS Well, that last one wasn't about you, Hugo.
HURLEY I like that I like chicken?
DR. BROOKS So, tell me, how did it feel writing that? Was that difficult?
HURLEY Kind of -- I think I messed up some spelling.
DR. BROOKS I notice that you didn't say anything about the way you look. Are you comfortable with your appearance?
HURLEY It's not like... I can't really do anything about it, right? If I, uh -- if I w -- wasn't so fat, they never would have died.
DR. BROOKS There were 23 people on that deck. It was built to hold 8. And it would have collapsed whether you went out there or not.
HURLEY Yeah, but I did walk out there. And it did collapse. I killed them.
DR. BROOKS It was an accident.
HURLEY That was my fault.
DR. BROOKS Look, after those people died, you were in a practically catatonic state. You stopped talking, you stopped going out, you stopped sleeping. But you never stopped eating because that's how you punish yourself.
HURLEY Dave's right about you. You know, you're nothing but a quack.
DR. BROOKS Dave doesn't want you to lose weight, does he?
HURLEY You know, Dave cares about me. He's my friend.
DR. BROOKS Let me show you something.
DR. BROOKS It may upset you. This is the photo I took for the bulletin board.
DR. BROOKS Dave isn't your friend, Hugo, because Dave doesn't exist.
DAVE Psst. Hey, wake up, dude. Finally, you could sleep through a damn NASCAR race, man.
HURLEY Wait, you're not -- you're a hallucination. Ow.
DAVE Was that a hallucination?
HURLEY Maybe I just imagined you slapped me? Ow! Damn it.
DAVE We can do this all night.
HURLEY Dr. Brooks showed me a picture from the rec room. My arm was around, like, nothingness.
DAVE Uh, Kinko's, Photoshop? What, you think they really blew up the Death Star?
HURLEY No.
DAVE Then stop talking crazy, man. Come on, we're on a clock here.
DAVE Hey, you in or you out, dude?
DAVE Okay, come on, come on. Yo, check it out, Marcus didn't finish his lasagna. That is a waste, man. One for the road?
DAVE Shhh. Wait for it -- wait.
DAVE Tippy-toes, big guy. Vámonos.
DAVE Okay, man. You've got the keys, hombre. You took them off Brooks' desk earlier.
DAVE Come on, man. Open it, open it.
DAVE Oh, oh, oh -- can you taste that? That is freedom, baby. You know what tastes even better than freedom? Cheeseburgers.
DAVE Come on, man, chili-fries on me. 
HURLEY I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.
DAVE Sorry? What, are you kidding me?
HURLEY You're not real. You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because I want cheeseburgers.
DAVE Did you take those pills, man?
HURLEY No, man. I'm just not coming. Look, you don't want me to get better. You don't want me to change.
DAVE You don't need to change, man. You are fine. You're great.
HURLEY No, I'm not. You just want me to stay fat. You don't want me to get better. You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death.
DAVE Do not do this, man. If you don't come with me right now, you will never get out of here.
HURLEY Bye, Dave.
DAVE You wouldn't happen to have my slipper, would you?
DAVE Thank you. Oh, man, you got peanut butter on it. Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now, and I'm, I'm sorry. But it's going to get a little worse before it gets better.
HURLEY Worse?
DAVE Yeah, kind of. You ready, dude? You remember that night you closed that window on me? You remember what you did after that night?
HURLEY Yeah, I realized you were imaginary.
DAVE Mmmmhmmm.
HURLEY And that was a breakthrough. And a little while later Brooks let me out, and I went home to live with my mom, and I got my job at Mr. Clucks back. And I got better.
DAVE Okay, good, great, yeah -- except see, here's the thing -- uh -- none of that ever happened.
HURLEY What?
DAVE You're still at Santa Rosa, man. You never left the hospital.
HURLEY That's -- not possible.
DAVE It's hard, I know, but I mean -- all this? You, me, this island, that peanut butter -- none of it's real, man. None of it's happening. It's all in your head, my friend. The second you closed that window your brain popped a gasket. You went back into your little coma thing. And that's where you are right this very second. In your own private Idaho, inside Santa Rosa.
HURLEY No. I had my mom, my friend Johnny -- I won the lottery.
DAVE Whoa, wow, awesome, dude! What numbers did you play? Leonard's numbers, right -- from the hospital? What a coincidence. You, uh, seen them around anywhere else?
HURLEY The Hatch?
DAVE Bingo! The Hatch -- with the button that you've got to push every 108 minutes or the world ends. Oh, oh, oh, and what's the code for the button? Oh yeah, the Numbers.
HURLEY But I got better. I changed.
DAVE Changed? What, are you kidding me? Take a look at yourself. You've been on a deserted island for over 2 months and you haven't dropped 10 pounds. How is that even possible, man?
HURLEY I just destroyed my stash, and I've been exercising. Libby says it won't happen over night.
DAVE Oh, right, right, right, Libby -- the mega cute blonde chick who magically appeared from the other side of the Island. Oh, oh, oh, yeah -- and who just happens to have the hots for you. Come on, man, let's take a walk.
HURLEY So this is all in my brain?
DAVE Every rock, every tree. Every tree frog. Even me. The real me -- the one they told you was imaginary? He went out the window, man. Right now he's probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick, unlike me, who's really you, who's got more important things to do.
HURLEY So I'm making you up?
DAVE Well, sort of. I'm part of your subconscious, man. All the people on this island are.
HURLEY What part of me are you?
DAVE I'm the part of you that wants to wake up, man. Follow me.
DAVE This is it, dude.
HURLEY It?
DAVE The big finale. The answer to all your problems. A way for you to wake up, snap out of it.
HURLEY I don't want to kill myself.
DAVE Who said anything about killing yourself, man? This is going to bring you back to life. The only way for you to bust out is to tell your mind that you don't believe any of this.
HURLEY So, if I -- all this will be gone? I'll just wake up?
DAVE That's right. And when you do wake up, come find me. I'm sure I miss you. See you in another life, Hurley.
HURLEY Dave!!
LOCKE Jack not back yet?
ANA Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach that we've got one of them. Something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest.
LOCKE I want to talk to him.
ANA I don't think that's on today's program.
LOCKE Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia, but I don't care what you think. 5 minutes. I earned 5 minutes with him.
LOCKE What's your name -- your real name?
GALE Why don't you just keep calling me Henry? I've gotten used to it.
LOCKE Did you get caught on purpose? You and your people have been here for God knows how long, and you got caught in a net...
GALE God doesn't know.
LOCKE Excuse me?
GALE God doesn't know how long we've been here, John. He can't see this island any better than the rest of the world can. May I ask you a question? What possible reason could I have for putting myself through all this?
LOCKE Maybe your people were looking for this place.
GALE This place? This place is a joke, John.
LOCKE What are you talking about?
GALE I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer as the alarm beeped. And you know what happened? The timer went all the way down to zero, and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place. They looked like hieroglyphics, but I'm no expert. And then things got real interesting. There was a loud clunking and a hum like a magnet -- a big magnet. It was really very frightening. And you know what happened next? Nothing happened, John. Nothing happened at all. Your timer just flipped back to 108. I never entered the numbers. I never pressed the button.
LOCKE You're lying.
GALE No, I'm done lying.
HURLEY Dave!
LIBBY Who's Dave?
HURLEY What are you doing here?
LIBBY What are you doing here?
HURLEY How'd you know where I was?
LIBBY Jin saw you while he was fishing.
HURLEY Hah! Jin doesn't speak English!
LIBBY Sun was with him. She translated. Hurley, what is going on?
HURLEY No! You're just a part of me that's scared. You don't want me to wake up. Well, guess what? I'm not scared.
LIBBY Okay, okay, Hurley, you're having some sort of panic attack. I get that. But this isn't like you.
HURLEY Like me? You don't know me.
LIBBY I was starting to.
HURLEY Yeah, well did you know I'm so fat that I killed 2 people? And that I have an imaginary friend?
LIBBY Hurley, please, you're going to hurt yourself.
HURLEY No, I'm not, because this isn't happening! None of it! I'm just imagining it! This isn't real life!
LIBBY Why would you say that?
HURLEY Because in real life -- no girl like you would ever like me. Remember when I said I knew you from somewhere? Well, maybe it's because I made you up?
LIBBY What was the man's name who broke his leg? The day of the crash on the other side of the Island, Eko brought a man with a broken leg to me for help. What was his name?
HURLEY I don't know.
LIBBY You don't know. You know why? Because it happened to me. His name was Donald, and I buried him. I buried a lot of people, Hurley. So don't tell me that that wasn't real. And don't tell me you made me up. It's insulting.
HURLEY When you saw me on the beach this morning was I holding a slipper?
LIBBY Not that I can remember, no. Hurley, look at me. I am real. You're real. The way I feel about you -- that's real.
LIBBY And that was real.
HURLEY Maybe you should do it one more time just to be sure.
LIBBY Ready to go back?
HURLEY Do you really think I can, you know, change?
LIBBY Yeah, yeah I do.
DR. BROOKS Why don't you get a little closer together.
DR. BROOKS Say cheese.
HURLEY Cheese.
DR. BROOKS Great. So, you need some water to go with that?
HURLEY Nope. I'm good.
DR. BROOKS See you later, guys. Thanks for the photo op.
NURSE Here's your pill, Libby.
