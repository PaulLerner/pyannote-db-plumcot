rose_nadler Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.
bernard_nadler So this isn't bothering you at all?
rose_nadler What's "this"?
bernard_nadler Well, this this...
rose_nadler Why would a bag of potato chips bother me?
bernard_nadler Aren't you remotely curious as to where all this came from? You're acting like we just got back from the supermarket.
rose_nadler Well, I guess I was raised never to question my blessings.
bernard_nadler I was raised to question piles of food with weird labels that just fall out of the sky, Rose.
rose_nadler Well, honey just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to raise your voice.
bernard_nadler Bad day? I had 7 weeks of bad days on the other side of the island just trying to stay alive so I could get back to you. Here -- my God, Rose -- they've built a kitchen on the beach. They've given up.
rose_nadler Given up? On what?
bernard_nadler On getting rescued.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, you going to get that?
dr_jack_shephard When's the last time you went in to see him?
ana_lucia_cortez A couple of hours ago. He was sleeping.
dr_jack_shephard Did he eat?
ana_lucia_cortez No. It's 2 days now. No food. No water. Nothing to say.
dr_jack_shephard I don't know about you but I'm tired of waiting.
dr_jack_shephard I hear you've lost your appetite. Okay, don't talk. I was never that good at bedside manner anyway. I'm going to change that dressing on your shoulder. If you try anything, we've got a problem. So, Henry -- Henry. I was thinking about something you were saying before we found out who you are. This is going to sting. Yeah, you were saying that if you were one of them that you'd lead us into a trap, capture our people, force a trade -- us for you. Pretty good idea, Henry. And, since you are one of them, I thought now might be a good time to use it. I'm going out to the line we're not supposed to cross and telling them that we've got you. And if they want you back, it's going to cost them. And when we get Walt back you might just have been worth all the trouble.
dr_jack_shephard Did you say something?
ben_linus They'll never give you Walt.
bernard_nadler Don't gun it. You're digging yourself in. Just tap the gas lightly.
rose_nadler With all due respect, I have been driving in snow my whole life. You mind stepping back?
bernard_nadler Well, you have to rock it out. You're not going to be able...
rose_nadler I'm calling AAA.
bernard_nadler Why, so they can send a tow truck? Trust me, I can do this.
bernard_nadler Okay, ease on the gas. That's it. You're doing great. Almost. Go, go, go.
rose_nadler Are you okay?!
bernard_nadler Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine.
rose_nadler You know, I would have gotten it out eventually.
bernard_nadler Oh, sure. July's right around the corner.
rose_nadler Well, thanks for helping me.
bernard_nadler Sure.
rose_nadler By the way, I'm Rose.
bernard_nadler Oh, uh, Bernard.
rose_nadler Okay.
bernard_nadler Oh, okay, yeah.
bernard_nadler Drive safe now, okay.
rose_nadler Yeah, you too. Uh, um, Bernard!
bernard_nadler Yeah?
rose_nadler Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
bernard_nadler Coffee would be nice. Yeah, okay.
rose_nadler I had to beat back half the group to get these. I saved them for you.
hugo_reyes No way. I'm on a new diet. Nothing but fish and water; and fish and water.
bernard_nadler Hurley, what are you doing, right now?
hugo_reyes Talking to your wife.
bernard_nadler Good. Can you get Libby and meet me at the edge of the tree line in 5 minutes? Oh, and if you can get Jin and Sun, Jenkins and that Frogurt guy -- the guy who used to make frozen yogurt.
hugo_reyes Neil?
bernard_nadler Yeah, and Craig -- anybody else you can get.
rose_nadler Bernard? What are you up to?
bernard_nadler I got an idea. Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome come here.
ana_lucia_cortez I'm not so sure trading people's their thing.
dr_jack_shephard Well, talking to him is getting us nowhere, so -- I think we can get something for him.
ana_lucia_cortez You want me to come with you?
dr_jack_shephard You need to stay here.
ana_lucia_cortez You need it more than I do. Do yourself a favor, man. Don't go out there alone.
dr_jack_shephard Alright.
james_ford Ah, that's how it's done. Aw, well look at you. That's like 4 in the last half hour. Let me call the Guinness Book.
kate_austen You want help or not? Because I've got better things to do with my time.
james_ford Oh happy day, here comes Dr. Giggles.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
james_ford Hey, yourself.
dr_jack_shephard I'm going back out into the jungle to talk to our friend with the beard -- see if we can make a trade.
james_ford Ah, the old prisoner exchange. And you're inviting me along because you want a gun, huh?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not inviting you; I'm inviting Kate. And I've already got a gun, but thanks for offering.
james_ford How the hell did you get a gun?
dr_jack_shephard Does it matter?
kate_austen I'll get my things.
bernard_nadler Okay, 2 months we've been on this island -- 2 months. And already we have a water trough, and we've got a food pantry. And people are taking showers in your hatch. Have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island? It's like none of you want to go home again.
claire_littleton How can you say that? Of course we want to go home.
bernard_nadler Well, then why aren't we doing anything about it?
hugo_reyes Dude, we, like, built a raft. But it got blown up.
bernard_nadler Okay, so what are we doing now? That pallet of food had a parachute which means a plane dropped it here which means there are other planes that fly over the island. So, we are going to build a sign -- a massive sign along the beach. So that way if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there -- we want to make damn sure that they know we're here -- that they know about us.
rose_nadler Maybe we should speak to Jack about this first.
bernard_nadler Well, do we have to run everything by Jack? I mean, he's not the president. He's a doctor.
rose_nadler You're a dentist.
bernard_nadler Could I speak to you for just a second? Come here. Honey, it is just a sign. I don't see what the harm is.
rose_nadler The harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites coming out of nowhere to save the day.
bernard_nadler I'm just trying to do something. I want to get back to our life.
rose_nadler Well, the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope.
bernard_nadler Excuse me; I have a sign to build. Alright, I want to get this going right away. We've waited long enough.
.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode19
rose_nadler It's just amazing, isn't it?
bernard_nadler Oh, sure, it's beautiful.
rose_nadler You're not impressed, huh?
bernard_nadler Yeah.
rose_nadler So, what does God have to do to get your attention?
rose_nadler Bernard, what are you doing?
bernard_nadler Rose, I've been a bachelor for 56 years, and then I met you. And we just fell into this rhythm like we had known each other forever. I always dreamed of finding somebody like you, but I'd given up hope that I ever would.
rose_nadler Bernard...
bernard_nadler I know, I know. It's crazy. We just met 5 months ago. But 5 months is long enough because I knew after 5 minutes. Rose, I love you. Will you marry me?
rose_nadler Bernard, I'm dying. I'm sick, and I'm dying.
bernard_nadler Would you excuse us for a minute, please?
rose_nadler I've been in remission for the last couple of years. But now it's back and this time it's not going away. My doctor says I have about a year -- maybe a little longer.
bernard_nadler You haven't answered my question.
rose_nadler Are you sure?
bernard_nadler Oh, I'm sure.
rose_nadler Yes. Yes.
bernard_nadler Boy, you bunk with a guy for 48 days -- now he doesn't call or write.
mr_eko Hello, Bernard.
bernard_nadler What have you boys got going up here?
mr_eko Just working.
bernard_nadler Listen, I've got a whole team of folks throwing together a big sign down along the beach. Hopefully, it'll get spotted by a plane or a satellite. We could sure use all the bodies we could get to help put it together.
mr_eko Sorry, I'm busy.
bernard_nadler Charlie?
charlie_pace Ah, regrets, Bernard, I've only got 2 hands, you know. Good luck, though.
bernard_nadler Well, could I at least grab some of these logs? We could use them...
mr_eko We're using them.
bernard_nadler For what, exactly?
charlie_pace A church.
bernard_nadler A church?
mr_eko Yes.
bernard_nadler Everybody on this island is building something. I'm trying to get us saved.
mr_eko People are saved in different ways, Bernard.
bernard_nadler I think I liked you better when you just hit people with your stick.
charlie_pace I like you just the way you are.
john_locke I need to talk to him.
ana_lucia_cortez The gun's with Jack. The door stays closed. But if you want to talk to him -- talk to him.
john_locke Henry, can you hear me? It's John, Henry. Henry, did you enter the numbers? Did you push the button, or not? Henry, I need to know. I want you to answer me. Answer me! Answer me, Henry!
bernard_nadler What happened to everybody? Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt? Okay, alright, moving on. We're going to put this sign across this entire beach which means the letters have to be really big -- about 40 feet. These black rocks will get maximum contrast with the sand.
hugo_reyes Dude, we're, like, going to need a lot more rocks.
bernard_nadler Yes, Hurley, we're going to need a lot more rocks. There's a lava field about a half mile inland that's loaded with them. We're going to haul them out in 2 man teams. So, you guys double up, and I am going to start sketching out the letters in the sand. Let's do this.
hugo_reyes Hey, um, I can sketch the letters.
bernard_nadler Everybody's got a job, Hurley. I do my job, you do yours.
jinsoo_kwon 결국 힘든 일은 우리가 다 하는 거지?
bernard_nadler What? What'd he say?
hugo_reyes I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry the rocks a half mile thing.
bernard_nadler Okay, this is going to take time. But if this is the thing that gets us off this place, isn't that worth it? Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. No, you don't know. Alright, let's get started. Come on.
rose_nadler We're lost.
bernard_nadler You saying we're lost doesn't make us lost, sweetheart. I know exactly where we are.
rose_nadler Me too. Driving around in circles in the middle of the Outback. That's why I wanted to be on a beach for our honeymoon.
rose_nadler Thank goodness, civilization. Bernard, let's get directions.
bernard_nadler Oh, I don't need directions. I told you, honey, we're not lost.
rose_nadler Bernard, what's going on?
bernard_nadler I brought you out here because I want you to see this man. His name is Isaac of Uluru. He's helped hundreds of people. Now, I know how it looks, but believe me he's completely legit.
rose_nadler Bernard, you brought me to a faith healer?
bernard_nadler He's the real deal, Rose. When I started telling people about your situation I got 3 separate calls recommending him.
rose_nadler My situation? This is why you wanted to come to Australia? To bring me to some kind of a kook?
bernard_nadler No, he's not. Rose, I made a 10,000 dollar donation just to get you in to see him. Normally...
rose_nadler I didn't ask for this! This is -- Bernard, I have made my peace with what is happening to me.
bernard_nadler Well, I haven't. I can't just do nothing, Rose. That's not me. That's not who I am. I have to try. Will you try, Rose? For me.
bernard_nadler If you have time to fix your hut you have time to move some rocks. Come on, we could really use your help.
james_ford What, you got union trouble down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?
bernard_nadler Come on, Sawyer, I need your help. What do you say?
james_ford I say Pasadena.
bernard_nadler Well, I hope you're happy.
rose_nadler About what?
bernard_nadler This morning I had 15 people willing to work on the sign, now I'm down to 4.
rose_nadler How is that my fault?
bernard_nadler At the very least I expected your support. You had to go and attack me.
rose_nadler Have you ever stopped to think maybe the reason people are quitting is because you've got yourself a management problem?
bernard_nadler What is the matter with you, Rose? I am just trying to do something.
rose_nadler That's right. You're always trying to do. Why can't you just let things be?
bernard_nadler If I didn't always have to do something you wouldn't be here.
kate_austen I'm flattered.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, why is that?
kate_austen Because you chose me to go with you instead of Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard I asked Sayid first but he turned me down. And I only asked you because they don't want you. They grabbed you -- had you at gunpoint. They could have kept you but they didn't. Then again, they didn't really want me, either.
kate_austen Damaged goods, both of us.
kate_austen What's that?
dr_jack_shephard Kate?
kate_austen It's a doll.
dr_jack_shephard Wait, wait, no. No don't.
kate_austen Sorry.
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Oh good, so you can hear me? This isn't one of theirs.
kate_austen No, it's not sophisticated enough. It must be one of Rousseau's traps, so hopefully she's not far from here.
dr_jack_shephard It could be a week before she shows up.
kate_austen What are you doing?
dr_jack_shephard I'm trying to get the gun. I can't get my arm around.
kate_austen Alright. Sorry. I don't want to shoot you. Okay.
dr_jack_shephard You got it?
kate_austen Okay, ready? Got it, got it, got it.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, alright. Okay, now give me the gun.
kate_austen Why, what for?
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to try to shoot the rope. Oh, hey, hey, hey.
kate_austen I'm a better shot than you are.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, really?
kate_austen Yeah, I told you. I grew up hunting with my dad. Damn!
dr_jack_shephard Well, at least they know where we are. Okay, now give me the gun.
kate_austen Are you going to waste another bullet?
dr_jack_shephard We'll still have 13 more to shoot each other with. Come on.
kate_austen Fine. You have a better angle than mine anyway.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, that's going to be your excuse when I make the shot?
kate_austen When you make the shot.
kate_austen Nice shot.
bernard_nadler No, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong. I told you 3 rows -- 3 so they can see it from the air.
jinsoo_kwon 시키는 대로 하고 있잖아요!
bernard_nadler 3 rows! How hard is that?!
jinsoo_kwon 누굴 바보로 아나? 나도 쓰리 정도는 알아요!
bernard_nadler Do I just have to do everything myself?!
jinsoo_kwon 직접 하실래요? 해보시지!
bernard_nadler No, no, no. No, Jin. No, wait. Please, I just want to get my wife home. Rose. I want to get Rose home.
jinsoo_kwon Sorry.
rose_nadler You're in my spot.
john_locke I can move.
rose_nadler Can you?
john_locke Oh, that's funny.
rose_nadler I guess your sense of humor got trapped under that blast door with your leg.
john_locke I saw your husband walking through the jungle hauling rocks.
rose_nadler He's building a big sign in the sand so the satellites will see it. That man doesn't know the difference between an errand and a fool's errand.
john_locke Well, Rose, most of us don't.
rose_nadler So, what are you doing down here, John? Can't remember the last time I saw you out of that hatch.
john_locke I'm done with the hatch.
rose_nadler Oh, now you're just frustrated. You'll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time.
john_locke And yet, Jack said it would be at least 4 weeks.
rose_nadler But, honey, you and I both know it's not going to take that long.
aussie_woman WOMAN Right this way, Rose. Please, make yourself comfortable. Isaac will be right with you.
isaac_of_uluru You must be Rose. Why don't you have a seat.
rose_nadler So, um, how does this work? I sit here and you chant, pray, or what?
isaac_of_uluru There are certain places with great energy -- spots on the Earth like the one we're above now. Perhaps this energy is geological -- magnetic. Or perhaps it's something else. And when possible I harness this energy and give it to others. May I?
rose_nadler What? What, what is it?
isaac_of_uluru I'm sorry. I can't do anything for you, Rose.
rose_nadler I didn't expect you to.
isaac_of_uluru It's not that you can't be healed. Like I said, there's different energies. This is not the right place for you.
rose_nadler Where is the right place?
isaac_of_uluru I wish I knew. I'll return your husband's donation.
rose_nadler Don't. I'm going to tell him you fixed me. I'm going to tell him you fixed me.
dr_jack_shephard What did you mean back there?
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard In the net -- you said they were sophisticated, the Others.
kate_austen Uh, last week when the baby got sick, Claire and I went into the jungle and, uh, found another hatch.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen It's a medical station. There's nothing you can use; it was all cleared out, but I found some lockers. They had clothes inside -- all worn and dirty. And they were on hangers like costumes, you know. And there was a make-up kit, and a fake beard.
dr_jack_shephard When were you going to tell me this?
kate_austen When you decided to let me back in the club. What, you can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for like a week and say nothing, but then when I...
dr_jack_shephard We're here.
kate_austen Are you sure?
dr_jack_shephard That's where they took a shot at Sawyer. Right over there was where they pushed you out of the jungle with the bag on your head. And right there is where I laid my guns down. Hey, hey I'm back! You say you're watching us -- you hear me? We've got your man! If you want him back you're going to have to come out here! Come on out!
kate_austen Jack!
dr_jack_shephard I know you're out there! I know you can hear me!
kate_austen Jack, they're not here.
dr_jack_shephard I'll be right here 'til you talk to me! I'll be right here!
rose_nadler I brought you some supper.
bernard_nadler Thanks, you can just set it down there.
rose_nadler Where is everybody? I owe you an apology.
bernard_nadler You don't have anything to be sorry for. It's my own damn fault I'm out here by myself.
rose_nadler That's not why I'm apologizing. I lied to you. Back in Australia, Isaac -- he didn't heal me. He didn't do anything.
bernard_nadler Of course he did.
rose_nadler Bernard, he didn't heal me. But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.
rose_nadler When you're sick and you have got something inside you that doesn't belong there you can feel it.
rose_nadler And after the crash I couldn't feel it anymore. At first I thought it was just shock.
But#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode19 it wasn't. It's this place.
bernard_nadler But you said Isaac fixed you.
rose_nadler I told you that so that you wouldn't spend what time we had left trying to do something.
bernard_nadler Rose, you could just be in remission. How do you know it wasn't Isaac who healed you?
rose_nadler Bernard.
bernard_nadler How do you know that he didn't heal you?
rose_nadler I know. I know.
john_locke These yours?
rose_nadler Thank you.
john_locke You're welcome.
rose_nadler Trust me. I know.
bernard_nadler You don't want to be rescued, do you? You think if you leave it'll come back. And if you can't leave, neither can I. We won't ever leave Rose.
bernard_nadler I would offer to take down the sign, but we didn't get very far.
ana_lucia_cortez Hey.
john_locke Hi.
ana_lucia_cortez I pressed your button.
john_locke It's not my button.
ana_lucia_cortez Where did you go?
john_locke I just needed to stretch my legs.
kate_austen How long are you going to wait, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Until I get my voice back. Then I'm going to yell some more.
kate_austen Maybe they can't hear you.
dr_jack_shephard They can hear me.
kate_austen I'm sorry I kissed you.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not.
kate_austen Michael.
