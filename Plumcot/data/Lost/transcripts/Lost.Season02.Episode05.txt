sunhwa_kwon It's been 4 days.
claire_littleton You know, that's not that long. They said it could take up to 2 weeks to find a current. I mean, Michael knew what he was doing. I doubt anything would have...
sunhwa_kwon 어머 어떡해. 어떡해... 어디갔지? 어디갔지? 어딨어?
claire_littleton What? What?
sunhwa_kwon 제발...
claire_littleton Sun, what's wrong?
sunhwa_kwon My wedding ring, it's gone.
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 얘야. 너 그 옷 입고 나갈거야?
sunhwa_kwon 이 옷이 어때서?
sunhwa_kwon 왜? 나 그 신발 마음에 드는데!
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 괜찮지만, 넌 오늘 이것을 신어라. 남자 키가 너보다 작을 수가 있잖아.
sunhwa_kwon 말도 안돼 정말...
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 대학 때 남자를 만났으면 지금 중매쟁이도 필요 없잖아!
sunhwa_kwon 대학을 연애하러 다니나? 공부하러 다니지.
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 4년 대학 졸업하고, 넌 지금 은메달이야! 그러니까 동메달이 되기 전에 남자를 찾아야지.
sunhwa_kwon 때가 되면, 내 남편감은 내가 찾을게요.
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 니 아빠가 그 때가 지금이라고 말하셨어.
tai_soo 정말이야, 임마! 너 올해가 애정의 운세네.
jinsoo_kwon 그래? 그렇게 나왔다면 믿어 봐야지.
tai_soo 야 우리 할머니도 할아버지를 그렇게 만났어. 그리고 말이야 이 책은 한번도 틀린 적이 없거든.
jinsoo_kwon 어떤 여잔데? 아니, 어떻게 생겼는지 알아야 만나면 알아보지.
tai_soo 오렌지.
jinsoo_kwon 오렌지.
tai_soo 너의 사랑은 오렌지야!
jinsoo_kwon 야, 내 주제에 결혼은 무슨! 내 입에 풀칠하기도 바쁜데.
tai_soo 야, 요즘 능력있는 여자가 얼마나 많은데 그러냐?
jinsoo_kwon 남자가 자존심이 있지... 임마, 인생의 목표가 있어야지! 남보다 열심히 일해서 승진도 빨리 하고 성공해야지. 남들이 어부의 자식놈이라고 업신여기지 못하게...
tai_soo 자식, 1차 면접보고 되게 그러네.
jinsoo_kwon 나에겐 인생의 중대사야 임마. 자, 어때? 멋있지?
tai_soo 멋있다. 야야야, 그 가격표는 떼어야지!
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 소리야? 내일 백화점에 어떻게 반환하라고? 이 넥타이 얼마나 비싼건데!
tai_soo 진수야. 운명의 여자가 나타나면 뭐라고 전해줄까?
jinsoo_kwon 기다리라고 해.
michael_dawson Hey man, it's okay. Sun -- you'll be with her again. Soon, okay. Hey, I think they're trying to figure out what to do with us.
james_ford I think they're going to eat us.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA All right, all of you -- get up. We're moving out.
michael_dawson Moving out where?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You're going to help us get food and water.
james_ford What -- we work for you now?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You're going to do it because we have a long walk ahead of us.
james_ford A long walk where?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Back to where you came from.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA All clear.
james_ford Hey Mike, I think we ought to stage a prison break here.
michael_dawson Yeah, well I want to figure out what the hell's going on over here before I make any decisions about anything.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Okay people, listen up. We need to gather as much food and water as we can. You travel in pairs. You move as fast as you can. Don't make any noise.
michael_dawson Maybe you could just take a minute to explain us what the hell is going on over here that's got you all so on edge.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You know what? That's a great idea, maybe we can swap stories on the road.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 I'm going to go scout before we move.
james_ford I think she needs to be slapped.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Cindy, go with him. Libby, see what fruit you can gather. Take him with you.
libby_smith His name is Michael.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Yeah, right, Michael.
james_ford Wait.
michael_dawson I'll be okay, man. Don't worry.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Bernard and I will gather the fish.
jinsoo_kwon Fish.
james_ford The man knows how to fish. I'd take him with you if I were you.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Fine, he comes with us, too.
dr_jack_shephard Sun, you okay?
sunhwa_kwon I lost my wedding ring.
dr_jack_shephard When was the last time you saw it?
sunhwa_kwon I'm so used to it. I don't, I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard I lost my wedding ring once. It's crazy where you look when you want to find something bad enough. I went through the garbage outside the house -- emptied the bags and everything. I even took apart the pipes in my bathroom because I was convinced that it had gone down the drain in the sink.
sunhwa_kwon What did your wife say?
dr_jack_shephard She never knew.
sunhwa_kwon How is that?
dr_jack_shephard I went to a jeweler and I had a replica made, that's how. Yeah, now it's just rattling around in my sock drawer back home. Um, I can help you look.
sunhwa_kwon No, thanks. I'm sure it will turn up.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Hey, hey, you want to help us out over here?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You want to eat? Help us.
jinsoo_kwon 고기 잡는 꼴 하고는... 저러다가 굶어 죽지!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Does it look like I speak Korean?!
jinsoo_kwon Fish.
mr_kim KIM 아시아나 호텔에서도 근무했다고?
jinsoo_kwon 네.
mr_kim KIM 보조 웨이터로?
jinsoo_kwon 네. 웨이터로 승진했습니다.
mr_kim KIM 거기서는 승진하기가 힘들었을텐데...
jinsoo_kwon 네 맞습니다. 제가 운이 좋았던 것 같습니다.
mr_kim KIM 자네 시골 출신이지?
jinsoo_kwon 네?
mr_kim KIM 생김새로나 말투로 봐서 도시 태생은 아닌 것 같고... 자네 고향이 어디야?
jinsoo_kwon 아, 예... 남해입니다.
mr_kim KIM 어쩐지. 생선 냄새가 나더라니.
mr_kim KIM 가격표는 떼고 다니시지?
jinsoo_kwon 감사합니다.
mr_kim KIM (Picking up the phone) 오늘부터 권진수 씨 직원으로 발령하세요. 지금부터 바로 일 시작하고, 비가 오나 눈이 오나 열심히 일하되 봉급 인상이나 휴가는 없어.
mr_kim KIM 미스터 권! 서울 게이트웨이 호텔은 최상의 서비스를 자랑하는 한국 최고의 호텔이야. 자네 같은 사람들은 절대로 드나들 수 없는 곳이야.
jinsoo_kwon 네. 알겠습니다. 열심히 하겠습니다. 감사합니다!
libby_smith Sorry, Michael.
michael_dawson Sorry about what?
libby_smith You know, about throwing you and your friends into the pit.
michael_dawson Friends.
libby_smith What?
michael_dawson I guess I just never thought about it like that. I mean, I guess one of them is my friend.
libby_smith I'm guessing not the redneck.
michael_dawson Yeah, not the redneck.
libby_smith I don't think I've ever seen someone so scared in my life. And I know about scared.
michael_dawson That why you threw us in the pit -- because you're scared?
libby_smith And we've got trust issues.
michael_dawson Huh, how about that? Where the hell are all the fruit?
libby_smith We picked these trees pretty clean. Sometimes you can find them on the ground.
michael_dawson Why don't you head inland? That's where all the fruit is on our side.
libby_smith We don't go that way.
michael_dawson Why?
libby_smith Because that's where They come from.
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 For your protection when we travel.
james_ford Did you make this? So what's your name, anyway?
LEADER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 Mister Eko.
james_ford Mr. Echo?
mr_eko Yes.
james_ford So what's that, like Mr. Ed?
libby_smith It's Michael, he just left.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What?
libby_smith He just said something and he went into the jungle. He's gone.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Let's go. We're leaving now.
james_ford What do you mean, we're leaving?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
libby_smith Michael, he just left.
jinsoo_kwon 마이클이 아들을 잃어버려서 찾으러 가는거야. 그래서 저래.
bernard_nadler What's he trying to say? What's he saying?
jinsoo_kwon 어딘가에 살아있다고 생각하나봐. Walt! Walt!
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Let's go. We're moving out now. Cindy, water. Libby, can you carry the radio?
james_ford Wait, you have a radio? Does it work? Can you use it?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Wow, what a great idea! You going to slow us down?
jinsoo_kwon No! Michael.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We're leaving before he can tell Them where we are.
jinsoo_kwon Michael.
james_ford What are we supposed to do, wait for him? He ain't coming back without his kid. Walt - he ain't coming back without Walt. You really think he's going to find him? In case you haven't noticed it's every man for himself, Chewie. Mike's got to worry about Mike. And I've got to worry about me.
mr_eko Wait, please.
mr_eko You're going the wrong way. That's where he's going. Toward Them.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What are you doing?
mr_eko I'm going to help him find his friend.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA We can't wait for you.
mr_eko I don't expect you to.
hugo_reyes All you've got to do is retrace your steps. Like, what'd you do yesterday?
sunhwa_kwon I woke up, washed up, walked with Shannon, picked some fruit, cut it up to feed Vincent. And then I was...
hugo_reyes Whoa, you fed the dog? Bingo!
hugo_reyes So, Seoul. Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea?
sunhwa_kwon The good one.
hugo_reyes Did you go to the Olympics?
sunhwa_kwon Hurley, this is ridiculous. Waiting here for... the dog did not eat my ring.
hugo_reyes Dude, dogs will eat anything. When I was a kid, my dog, Buster -- I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change, right -- and I guess there were some Smarties in there -- so, like, the next day, Buster craps out a buck thirty-five in nickels. Did you ever own a dog?
sunhwa_kwon Yes. Jin gave me one, a puppy.
hugo_reyes What was his name?
sunhwa_kwon Bpo Bpo.
hugo_reyes Bpo Bpo -- that mean something?
sunhwa_kwon Yes, it means a kiss.
hugo_reyes A kiss.
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 얘야, 선아, 말할 때 손짓하지 말아. 알았어? 그리고, 질문 받기 전에는 절대로 말하면 안된다.
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 SHIN 안녕하세요? 예쁘게 생겼네. 마음에 쏙 들거야. 잘 생겼지, 학벌 좋지, 아버님이 이 호텔 회장님이셔. 거기다가 호텔을 열두개나 가지고 있대.
jinsoo_kwon 어서오십시오, 서울 게이트웨이 호텔을 찾아주셔서 감사합니다!
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 호텔이 너무 멋있어요!
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 LEE 무슨 과찬의 말씀을... 제가 알기로는 댁의 따님이 서울대학 다녔다면서요?
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 PAIK 네... 아무렴 하버드만 하겠어요?
MRS.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 SHIN 자, 이제 그만 둘이서 얘기할 수 있도록 시간을 좀 내줍시다.
jaehyeok_lee 어느 분이 더 걱정하세요? 어머님, 아니면 아버님?
sunhwa_kwon 저희 아버님이요. 물론 어머님을 통해서. 그 쪽은요?
jaehyeok_lee 저도 저희 아버님이죠. 물론 어머님을 통해서... 이모하고 할머니까지 동원하셨어요. 무슨 전공 하셨어요?
sunhwa_kwon 미술 역사학이요.
jaehyeok_lee 오... 그래요? 솔직히 말씀드리면 전 미술은 잘 몰라요.
sunhwa_kwon 뭘 전공하셨는데요?
jaehyeok_lee 중세 러시아 문학이요. 어쩌다보니 지금은 호텔 일을 하고 있네요.
sunhwa_kwon 예... 어쩌다 보니까?
jaehyeok_lee 실은 항상 맞선 별로였거든요. 근데 오늘은 좀 다른데요?
sunhwa_kwon 네, 저도요...
mr_eko No.
jinsoo_kwon Michael.
mr_eko Wait, no.
mr_eko His name was Goodwin.
jinsoo_kwon Others?
jinsoo_kwon Michael?
mr_eko No, for your cut. So, you're married? Your ring. You have a wife?
jinsoo_kwon Yes. You?
mr_eko Worse. Your wife, what is her name? Her name?
jinsoo_kwon Sun.
mr_eko She was with you? On the plane?
john_locke Bad day? It's clean.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you.
john_locke You mind if I sit?
sunhwa_kwon Did you see me?
john_locke Rip apart your garden? No. Sometimes I wish I had a garden to tear apart.
sunhwa_kwon I don't think I have ever seen you angry.
john_locke Oh, I used to get angry all the time. Frustrated too.
sunhwa_kwon You are not frustrated anymore?
john_locke I'm not lost anymore.
sunhwa_kwon How did you do that?
john_locke Same way anything lost gets found -- I stopped looking.
jinsoo_kwon 안녕하세요, 사장님.
jaehyeok_lee 그 꽃 좀 빌려주시겠어요? 데이트가 있어서...
jinsoo_kwon 아, 예... 물론이죠.
jaehyeok_lee 고마워요. 성함이?
jinsoo_kwon 권진수라고 합니다.
jaehyeok_lee 고맙습니다, 권진수 씨.
jaehyeok_lee 갑자기 카드가 안 되는 거에요, 그러니까 제가 타월만 걸치고 변태처럼 복도에 서있게 됐었죠...
sunhwa_kwon 영화에서만 나오는 장면 같아요!
jaehyeok_lee 그리고 호텔 메이드에게 상황을 설명하는데, 글쎄 제가 사장이라니까 절대로 안 믿는 거에요! 얼마나 황당하던지...
sunhwa_kwon 생각보다 참... 평범하신 것 같아요.
jaehyeok_lee 선 씨도 참 좋은 분이신 것 같아요. 그래서 말인데, 앞으로 우리 계속 만나는 걸로 하면 어떨까요? 그러면 부모님들도 안심하시고 우릴 놔두시지 않겠어요? 맞선 볼 걱정도 없고, 부모님 눈치 볼 일도 없고... 한마디로 자유로워지는거죠. 그리고 한마디 더 말씀드려도 될까요? 비밀인데...
sunhwa_kwon 네, 말씀하세요.
jaehyeok_lee 하버드에서 백인 여자친구를 만났어요. 아직 아버지한테 말씀 못 드렸지만, 6개월 후에 미국에 돌아가서 그녀와 결혼할 겁니다. 잠깐, 제가 -
sunhwa_kwon 아니오, 걱정 마세요. 미국이요... 멋지시네요.
jaehyeok_lee 제가 잘못...
sunhwa_kwon 꼭 행복하세요.
MANAGER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 안녕하십니까 사장님. 뭐 더 좀 필요하신 거 없으십니까?
jaehyeok_lee 아니오, 괜찮습니다.
MANAGER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode05 커피나 디저트 갖다 드릴까요?
sunhwa_kwon 아니에요. 제가 중요한 약속이 있어서요, 그만...
jaehyeok_lee 아니, 선 씨!
sunhwa_kwon 오늘 점심 고마웠어요.
mr_eko No, not that way. Over here.
mr_eko A round heel. This is fresh. These tracks...
jinsoo_kwon Michael.

jinsoo_kwon You, go back. I go.
mr_eko No, we go together.
poor_man MAN 잠시만요 잠시만, 저 실례지만 제 아들놈이 급해서 그러는데... 화장실 좀 써도 될까요? 부탁합니다, 급해서 그러는데...
jinsoo_kwon 죄송하지만 호텔 손님만 사용할 수 있습니다. 저 아래로 가시면 화장실이 있습니다. 참을 수 있겠지?
poor_man MAN 부탁합니다. 급해서 그러는데...
jinsoo_kwon 알았어요. 들어가서 왼쪽에 있으니까 빨리 쓰고 나오세요.

jinsoo_kwon 들어가세요... 들어가세요.
poor_man MAN 들어가 빨리, 빨리 들어가.
mr_kim KIM 미스터 권, 누가 들여보내래? 내가 자네에게 그렇게 시켰나?
jinsoo_kwon 잘못했습니다.
mr_kim KIM 이거, 첫 번째 경고야.
jinsoo_kwon 꼬마가 너무 급해 해서...
mr_kim KIM 길에서 싸든 무슨 상관이야! 너 같은 놈들 다 그런 거 아냐? 여기서 계속 일하고 싶으면 지금 당장 들어가서 그 놈들을 쫓아 보내!
mr_kim KIM 아니... 뭐 하는 거야 이거!
jinsoo_kwon 그 동안 고마웠습니다.
kate_austen Hey.
sunhwa_kwon Hello.
kate_austen It's pretty. Hurley told me that you lost your wedding ring.
sunhwa_kwon I was just sitting here telling myself it's silly to be so upset about it -- it is just a thing.
kate_austen Well, they've only been gone a few days, and...
sunhwa_kwon Don't. I'm sick of everyone saying he's alright. He's not alright. Claire found the bottle -- the one with the messages inside -- the one from the raft.
kate_austen Where is it?
sunhwa_kwon I buried it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Stop. Let me see your water. You keep slowing us down, we're going to leave you behind.
james_ford Go ahead, leave me behind.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Alright. See ya.
james_ford Got a question for you.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Yeah?
james_ford Now that your tracker's gone how are you going to find our camp without me?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Walk across the Island, follow the beaches. And Eko's coming back.
james_ford You married?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What?
james_ford You married?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA No.
james_ford Too bad, you seem suited for it.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Funny. What about you?
james_ford No ma'am.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You gay?
james_ford Funny. Let's go. What are we waiting for?
mr_eko Wait here, we lost his trail. I'll go back and find it.
michael_dawson What are you doing? Go back.
jinsoo_kwon Michael!
michael_dawson Go back, man!
michael_dawson Walt! Walt! Walt!
jinsoo_kwon Michael!
michael_dawson Go away! I'm not going back without him. Walt! I'm here! Where are you, man?! Walt!! What, you worried they're going to hear me? Let them take me! Come! Come take me!
mr_eko Shouting is not a good idea. You need to come back with us now.
michael_dawson I'm not leaving him out here! Stay away from me.
mr_eko I know they took your son. But you have no idea what these people are capable of -- and they will not be found if they don't want to be.
michael_dawson They took him right out of my hands -- right out of my hands! I'm not going back without him.
jinsoo_kwon You find Walt, Michael.
kate_austen Can I see it?
sunhwa_kwon Kate! Those are private. Kate, stop. What are you doing?!
kate_austen We didn't, uh... I didn't say goodbye.
sunhwa_kwon Sawyer?
kate_austen Sun?
sunhwa_kwon 어머, 죄송해요.
jinsoo_kwon 죄송합니다.
sunhwa_kwon 제가 죄송해요.
sunhwa_kwon JIN 괜찮으세요?
jinsoo_kwon 여기 있습니다. 제가...
