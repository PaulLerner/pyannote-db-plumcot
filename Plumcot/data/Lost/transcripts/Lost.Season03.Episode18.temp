SUN Oh.
JACK Hey.
SUN Good morning, Jack.
JACK Need a hand?
SUN Thank you.
JACK You know, I came by your tent earlier. Has Jin gone?
SUN Oh. He went off with Charlie, Hurley and Desmond. Did you need him?
JACK Actually, I was looking for you, wanted to see how you were doing with your pregnancy.
SUN Oh, I'm doing fine. A little tired, but that's normal, right?
JACK Sure. Any morning sickness?
SUN Not anymore.
JACK Any bleeding?
SUN Why are you asking me all these questions, Jack?
JACK I'm just checking in. I mean, now that I'm back, I just wanted to make sure that you were doing OK.
SUN Thank you. I'm OK.
JACK Great.
SUN 여보세요? 
JIN 여보? 
SUN 진수씨? 어우, 징그럽게... 벌써부터 무슨 여보야. 
JIN 이제 유부녀인데 빨리 익숙해져야지. 
SUN 자기야, 우리 집에 정말 잘 어울리는 침대보 샀어요. 
JIN 당신이 좋다면 물론 나도 좋지. 나 지금 집이야, 점심시간에 잠깐 들렀어. 
SUN 어, 그래? 집이 엉망이지? 
JIN 박스가 장난이 아니네. 하지만 우리 잠자리만큼은 확실하게 끝냈지. 
SUN 어우, 정말 내가 못살아! 
JIN 나 다시 회사 들어가 봐야 돼. 일찍 들어갈게. 
SUN 여보. 
JIN 네, 여보? 
SUN 정말 정말 사랑해요. 
Jin 나도 사랑해. 
WOMAN 아가씨 맞지? 
SUN 네, 맞아요. 
WOMAN 그렇구나, 축하해. 신랑이 아주 잘 생겼네. 
SUN 제가 운이 좋았죠. 
WOMAN 정말 운이 좋았던 것 같아. 아가씨 아버님이 백자동차 백 회장님 맞지? 굉장한 부잣집 따님이시네. 
SUN 전 아빠 사업엔 별 관심 없어요. 
WOMAN 신랑의 부모에 대해서는 아무 것도 적은 게 없잖아. 
SUN 그 사람 부모님은 돌아가셨어요. 
WOMAN 그래? 
SUN 누구시죠? 
WOMAN 잘못하면 신랑의 배경이 폭로가 될수 있잖아. 우리나라 제일의 권력의 딸이 하찮은 어부 자식과 결혼한다는 사실이 알려진다면... 
SUN 상관 없어요. 전 이미 그 사람 아버님이 어부라는 것도 알고 있어요. 
WOMAN 그래? 그럼 몸 팔던 여자의 아들이라는 것도 알고 있어? 
SUN 뭐라구요! 
WOMAN 3일 후에 5시에 여기서 보지. 나올 때 달러 10만 불 준비해 가지고 와. 정말 사랑한다면 내 요구 조건을 들어줘야 진실을 감출 수 있을 걸? 
JIN Who is she?
DESMOND I've no idea.
HURLEY She seems to know you, dude, she just said your name.
DESMOND I've never seen her before in my life.
CHARLIE She's waking up.
PARACHUTIST ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo!
HURLEY She's trying to talk. We should get her some water.
DESMOND Give me a hand.
CHARLIE Yeah.
PARACHUTIST ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo! 
CHARLIE What's she saying?
DESMOND Don't know.
HURLEY It's Spanish, dude.
DESMOND Wait, you understand her then?
PARACHUTIST ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo! 
HURLEY She says she's dying.
DESMOND Oh god!
CHARLIE It's a branch. She must have hit it on the way down.
DESMOND Right, get her pack! We haven't got much in this first-aid kit. See if there's anything we can use in there.
HURLEY What if this is a rescue? What if she came for us? Wha... I mean, is she gonna be OK? We can't let her...
DESMOND Just go and start looking!
JIN We get Jack. Jack.
CHARLIE We have to get her to Jack as soon as possible. She could be our way off the Island.
DESMOND No, if we move her, it'll make it worse.
CHARLIE Well, we just let her bleed to death?
DESMOND No, we... we need to bring Jack here.
CHARLIE It's an eight-hour walk, one way!
DESMOND Then I'll run.
CHARLIE You out of your mind? It's not safe. It's gonna be dark soon, who knows who's out in this jungle. In case you haven't forgotten, there are people on this Island trying to kill us.
DESMOND Nobody knows we're here!
HURLEY Oops.
JIN 짠! 당신 좋아하는 찌개 사왔어. 
SUN 고마워요. 이 박스만 정리하구요. 
JIN 그냥 두고 빨리 먹자. 그건 나중에 하면 되잖아. 
SUN 이 사진, 저 쪽 테이블 위에 올려놓을까? 
JIN 사모님이 알아서 하시죠. 
JIN 내 평생 학사모를 써도 이렇게 섹시한 여자는 처음이야. 
SUN 왜 당신 가족 사진은 하나도 없어요? 
JIN 어, 내가 어렸을 때 우리 집에는 카메라가 없었어. 
SUN 한 장도 없다구? 그래도... 아버님 유품이나 편지 한 장도 없다구? 
JIN 아버진 내가 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨어. 
SUN 당신이 16살 때 아버님이 돌아가셨다고 하지 않았어요? 
JIN 무슨 소리야? 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨다니까? 
SUN 아니 지난번에 당신이... 
JIN 당신이 잘못 들었겠지! 근데 그건 왜 자꾸 묻는데? 
SUN 그냥... 아니에요. 미안해요. 
JIN 식기 전에 빨리 먹자. 
SUN How's this?
KATE That's perfect. Thank you.
SUN What do you think happened to Jack? While he was with the Others. Since he's been back, he seems different.
KATE He says that he was pretty much a prisoner, and the only reason why he cooperated was 'cause he thought they'd let him off the Island.
SUN Do you believe him?
KATE Why wouldn't I?
SUN He came to me. Asking about my pregnancy.
KATE Well, what, would that have anything to do with—
SUN What if... What if the Others want my baby? He's been there alone for over a week. How do we know he isn't working with them?
KATE He's not working with them.
SUN Do you know something, Kate?
KATE It's Juliet. She was their doctor, their... their fertility doctor studying pregnant women, and... when Claire was sick, she told me and Jack... the reason the Others wanted her baby was for research.
KATE Sun, wait, you don't have to do this.
SUN Go away, Kate.
SUN I want to know about your research.
KATE Sun...
SUN What happens to pregnant women?
JULIET You're pregnant? Are you sure? How do you know?
SUN I asked you a question — everyone else might be alright with you washing your clothes and eating our food, but I want to know what's going on. I want answers. What are you people doing? Why are you taking children? What happens to pregnant women on this Island? What happens to—
JULIET They die. They all die.
KATE Sun, come on, let's go.
PARACHUTIST 
HURLEY What's she saying?
JIN Chinese. Not Korean.
CHARLIE Maybe we should just pull it out.
DESMOND No, you'll just make it worse.
CHARLIE Have you forgotten what's at stake here? Or is this just another one of your flashes — whose getting an arrow in the neck this time?
DESMOND Lest you forget, she said my bloody name! She had a photo of me and my girlfriend. Do I understand?! I understand better than the lot of you!
HURLEY Hey, guys, chill.
DESMOND We've wasted enough time already.
CHARLIE You're not leaving us.
DESMOND Just get out of my way, Charlie.
CHARLIE No.
DESMOND Hey, Jin!
CHARLIE Jin!
DESMOND Jin!
DESMOND Who are you? I said, who are you?!
CHARLIE He's the guy who shot Sayid. Kate told us he lived out in that station Locke blew up. He's an Other.
HURLEY I thought Locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy.
DESMOND You've got five seconds to talk, or I fire this gun brother.
MIKHAIL That's a flare gun.
DESMOND And how do you think it'll feel? Taking a flare to the chest at this range.
MIKHAIL As your friend pointed out, I already died once this week.
PARACHUTIST 
DESMOND You understand her.
MIKHAIL She's speaking Italian. She said she's dying, she needs help. I was a Soviet Army field medic, I can offer you my services.
CHARLIE Wait, what are you doing?
DESMOND I'm saving her.
MIKHAIL This branch has punctured her lung. It's filling with blood. If it is not ventilated soon, she's going to die.
DESMOND Well, do it. Help her.
MIKHAIL If I fix her, you must let me walk away as if I never came upon you.
DESMOND What you need?
SUN 혹시, 권 선생님이세요? 
MR. KWON 그렇소만... 선 맞지? 
SUN 감사합니다. 
MR. KWON 그래... 결혼식은 잘 치렀겠지? 
SUN 네, 멋있었어요. 제 생애 가장 행복한 날이었거든요. 
MR. KWON 그래, 그건 그놈도 그랬을거다. 
SUN 아버님. 왜 저희 결혼식에는 오시지 않으셨어요? 
MR. KWON 그놈이 나에 대해서 뭐라고 하던? 
SUN 그 사람은... 아버님이 돌아가셨다고... 왜요? 
MR. KWON 자신의 과거가 부끄럽고 창피해서... 
SUN 그래서 아버님은 진수 씨가 어렸을 때 어머니가 돌아가셨다고 말씀하신 거에요? 
MR. KWON 그 놈 애미... 그 여잔 남자가 많았어. 그 놈을 낳고 바로 떠나버려서 혼자서 내가 그 놈을 키웠어. 내가 그 놈의 애비인지도 확실치 않아. 그렇지만... 그 핏덩이를 누가 키우겠어? 
MR. KWON 아가야... 정말 이쁘구나. 내 아들이 사랑하는 여자를 만나게 되어 정말 기쁘구나. 진수에게는 날 만났다거나 지 애미가 살아있다는 말은 절대 하지 않았으면 한다. 절대로... 이 늙은이를 봐서라도, 이 사실로 그 녀석의 자존심이 다치지 않았으면 해. 
JULIET Be quiet. Don't move. You want me to help you and your baby, I have answers to your questions, but you have to come with me right now. Just you and me. Nobody else.
SUN If what you said was true, that means I'm already dead. Why should I go anywhere with you?
JULIET Because there may be a hope for you yet.
SUN Where are we going?
JULIET There's a medical station near here, they have an ultrasound machine.
SUN Claire and Kate told me about that place. It was abandoned, they found nothing there.
JULIET Well, that's because they didn't know where to look.
SUN What are you going to do to me?
JULIET I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the DOC. Erm, date of conception. The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant, give or take a day. If you got pregnant off the Island then you and your baby will probably be OK, but if you got pregnant here... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. When was the last time you and your husband had sex?
SUN I would rather not talk about that.
JULIET Look, I know that it's personal, but if I know when, then I...
SUN Isn't that what the machine will do?
JULIET Yeah.
SUN Then let's keep walking.
BUSINESSMAN 위조된 운송 허가증을 저희가 아직 얻지 못했습니다, 회장님.
MR. PAIK 한소 재단에서 우리 측에서 장비를 제공하지 않았다고 난리 났다는데?
SECRETARY 회장님, 따님이 오셨습니다. 
BUSINESSMAN 1 축하합니다. 
SUN 감사합니다. 
BUSINESSMAN 2 행복하게 사시길 바랍니다. 
MR. PAIK 갑자기 이 아빠를 찾아온 용건이 뭘까? 
SUN 부탁이 있어요. 
MR. PAIK 우리 공주님, 무슨 부탁이 있으실까? 
SUN 저... 저 필요한게...  저 10만 불이 필요해요. 
MR. PAIK 어디다 쓰려고? 
SUN 그건 말씀드릴 수가 없어요. 
MR. PAIK 그렇다면 내가 무엇 때문에 너에게 그 돈을 줘야 하지? 
SUN 전 지난 27년 동안... 아빠가 무슨 일을 하시는지도 알면서도 모른 척 해왔어요. 아빠 뜻에 어긋나는 행동을 한 적도, 생각해 본 적도 없어요. 더구나 싫은 내색은 한 번도 하지 않았구요. 저 앞으로도 계속 그럴 거에요, 물론 아빠가 제 부탁을 들어주신다는 조건 하에... 이유는 묻지 마세요. 
MR. PAIK 이유는 묻지 말라고? 이 세상이 니가 생각하는 것처럼 그렇게 호락호락한 줄 알아? 
SUN 제가 사랑하는 사람의 자존심을 지키기 위해서에요. 
MR. PAIK 네 남편 때문에 그러는구만. 
MR. PAIK 그 놈 때문이라면 이 돈은 그 놈이 앞으로 갚아야 할 빚이야. 공장장 일은 그만두고 이제부터 내가 시키는 일만 하게 될거다. 
MIKHAIL What else do you know about this woman? Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?
HURLEY Just a book, fancy radio phone thingy.
MIKHAIL Does it work?
HURLEY Like I'd tell you.
MIKHAIL One of you must help. The rest, clear the way, I need space.
DESMOND I'll do it.
MIKHAIL Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.
MIKHAIL We need to evac the air now! Hold her steady. Steady!
DESMOND Yeah, I heard ya!
DESMOND Is that... normal?
MIKHAIL Gause! Desmond grabs some material and places it on the wound.] Tape it, be careful. Covering needs to be hollow, the wound needs to breathe.
PARACHUTIST  Eu não estou só... Eu não estou só. 
DESMOND What did she say?
MIKHAIL Thank you. She said thank you for helping me.
JULIET It's right down here.
SUN Why are you doing this?
JULIET What?
SUN Helping me.
JULIET Once upon a time, I told women that they were pregnant, and their faces... it was the best news they ever got in their entire life. Then I came here. I've lost... nine patients in the last three years. I'm helping you because I want to tell you that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here. I'm helping you because I wanna give good news again.
SUN I slept with another man.
JULIET Oh.
SUN Before we got to the Island. Jin and I, we were having trouble, we weren't... And I had a friend. It was a mistake.
JULIET We all make mistakes.
SUN Which way?
JULIET Will you help me move this forward?
JULIET OK.
SUN Why is this room hidden?
JULIET Don't worry about it.
SUN What is this place? Tell me.
JULIET It's where we brought the women to die.
MIKHAIL She's fine. Keep the wound as clean as you can, she should be better in a day.
CHARLIE A day? Her lung was punctured.
MIKHAIL On this Island, the wounds are a bit different. Maybe a day and a half. I did as I promised. She will live.
CHARLIE You can't seriously be considering letting him go.
DESMOND Just go.
CHARLIE Are you kidding? He's one of them!
DESMOND So what would you have me do Charlie? We gotta make a stretcher and carry her. How we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?
CHARLIE We need some rope, I'll take responsibility.
JIN Phone. Phone!
DESMOND No, Jin.
JIN Phone.
DESMOND Jin, it's all right!
CHARLIE No, let him, Desmond!
DESMOND Jin! Come back here!
CHARLIE Oi! Let him!
DESMOND Jin, it's all right, Jin!
DESMOND Jin, let him go! Jin, let go!
JIN Phone!
CHARLIE You stole this.
MIKHAIL How could you respect me if I didn't try?
CHARLIE How about I take your other eye? Would you respect that?
MIKHAIL Sorry, what?
DESMOND Charlie, don't, Charlie!
CHARLIE No!
DESMOND Charlie, let him go!
CHARLIE This is a mistake! We can't keep letting these people go!
DESMOND We gave him our word! Go on, get out of here.
SUN The baby isn't Jin's. We tried to have a baby back in Korea and couldn't. And the doctor... he told me Jin was infertile.
JULIET And then you came here.
SUN What?
JULIET Did you know that the average male sperm count is between sixty and eighty million? But on the Island, it's five times that. We call that good odds. You ready?
SUN Yes.
JULIET OK, now lift your shirt up a little. It's cold.
SUN Will I see the baby?
JULIET Maybe, it's your first trimester, so it's a little iffy. If you don't see a heartbeat, don't worry about it, it's just early.
SUN How does it work?
JULIET Well, I take a measurement of the foetus, and that will tell us when your baby was conceived, and then we'll know who. You OK?
SUN I lose either way. If I'm going to live, that means the baby's not Jin's.
JULIET Do you still want to do this?
SUN Yes.
JULIET OK, moment of truth.
JIN 여보? 
SUN 여보? 
JIN 오늘 회사에 왔다면서? 왜 나한테는 들르지 않았어? 
SUN 당신이 바쁠 것 같아서요. 
JIN 아무리 바빠도 당신 볼 시간은 있지. 
SUN 다음엔 꼭 들를게요. 
JIN 우편물 온거 없어? 
SUN 아, 미안. 깜빡했네. 
JIN 열쇠는 어디 있어? 
SUN 거실에 있는 내 가방 안에요. 
SUN 진수 씨! 잠깐만요! 
JIN 이거 무슨 돈이야? 
SUN 그거... 아빠가 주신 거에요. 
JIN 뭐 때문에? 
SUN 가구도 사야 되구... 우리 신혼여행도 가야 되잖아. 
JIN 그 정도는 내가 할 수 있잖아. 신혼여행... 가구 같은 거는 시간이 좀 걸리겠지만 열심히 일해서 내가 다 해줄게. 무슨 일이 있어도 당신은 내가 책임질거야. 
SUN 알아요. 
JIN 드려. 그렇지 않아도 아버님에게 너무 많은 신세를 졌는데, 더 이상 그러고 싶지 않아. 부탁해. 
SUN 진수 씨... 사랑해요. 
JIN 정말? 
SUN 정말. 
JULIET There it is. There's your baby. Can you see?
SUN I can see it. Is it a boy or a girl?
JULIET Oh, it's... it's a little early. But, um, do you see that little flutter? That's the heart beating. It's very strong, it's very healthy. OK, you crashed here ninety days ago. The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago, so around fifty-three days. You got pregnant on the Island.
JULIET I'm sorry, I am so sorry Sun. I will do everything that I can...
SUN It's Jin's!
WOMAN 난 안 나타나는 줄 알았어. 
SUN 진수 씨 어머니라고 왜 말씀하지 않으셨어요? 
WOMAN 낳기만 했지 내가 그 놈 애미라고 말할 순 없잖아. 
SUN 저희 집이 어떤 집안이라는 거 잘 알고 계시죠? 내 남편은 당신이 죽은 걸로 알고 있어. 다음엔 당신에게 무슨 일이 일어날지 나도 장담 못해. 
SUN So how long do I have?
JULIET Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester, nobody made it to their third.
SUN That gives me two months. I am... very happy the baby's Jin's. You gave me good news, Juliet.
JULIET It was my pleasure, Sun. I'm gonna go back inside and make sure that I didn't miss anything. I don't wanna take the chance that we didn't cover our tracks. Do you wanna wait out here?
SUN All right. Juliet. Thank you.
JULIET Ben, it's six AM on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with husband. He was sterile before they got here. I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
JULIET I hate you.
CHARLIE You can't trust 'em, you know.
DESMOND What's that?
CHARLIE The Others. The one you let go. He'll be back tomorrow with five of his mates. Should have killed him.
JIN Charlie. Tight.
CHARLIE Oh, OK.
DESMOND You know brother, by my count, you've killed more of them than they've killed of you.
CHARLIE They started it. You know, just 'cause one comes traipsing back with Jack and Kate doesn't mean that we can trust 'em now.
HURLEY Mom?
PARACHUTIST Where am I?
HURLEY Take it easy, you just had a giant branch...
PARACHUTIST Where am I?!
HURLEY I dunno. You're on an Island. Are you here to rescue us? Are there more of you? Can you make your phone work?
PARACHUTIST Who are you?
HURLEY Hugo Reyes. I crashed here on Oceanic Flight 815. A bunch of us survived. Is that why you're here? Were you looking for us?
PARACHUTIST 815? Flight 815? The one from Sydney?
HURLEY Yeah!
PARACHUTIST No, that's not possible.
HURLEY Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy, but we found food, and a hatch...
PARACHUTIST No. No, Flight 815 they, they found the plane. There were no survivors. They were all dead.
HURLEY What?!
