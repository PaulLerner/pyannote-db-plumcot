desmond_hume Do you need someone to sign for that?
DELIVERY#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode17 TRUCK DRIVER You work here?
desmond_hume I do indeed, brother.
cab_driver You a priest or something?
desmond_hume Or something... Do you mind taking it around the back there?
cab_driver Yeah, sure. You got it.
desmond_hume Just around there, thank you.
kate_austen Who died?
desmond_hume A man named Christian Shephard.
kate_austen Christian Shephard? Seriously?
desmond_hume Seriously.
kate_austen Friend of yours?
desmond_hume Not exactly.
kate_austen H-hang on a second. You bust me out of jail, and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert. And you won't even tell me why were here.
desmond_hume No one can tell you why you're here, Kate... Certainly not me.
kate_austen You're the one who brought me here.
desmond_hume I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here.
kate_austen Who are you? What do you want?
desmond_hume My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And, as for what I want--I want to leave.
kate_austen Leave and go where?
desmond_hume Let me show you.
james_ford You okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. You?
james_ford Well, to be honest, Doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.
dr_jack_shephard That makes two of us.
james_ford So, you're the new Jacob, huh? Feel any different?
dr_jack_shephard Not really.
james_ford Well, Doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?
dr_jack_shephard Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp. Just past it, well, said I'd find the place we need to protect.
kate_austen This place, what is it?
dr_jack_shephard He called it the heart of the island. All he said was that it's...it's a light.
hugo_reyes And that Locke Smoke Thing wants to put it out?
dr_jack_shephard Something like that, yeah.
hugo_reyes So, what if he does?
dr_jack_shephard Then that's it for all of us.
kate_austen But, if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
james_ford 'Cause he ain't got what he needs. I'm guessing that'd be Desmond... That's where we were headed before your inauguration. Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.
dr_jack_shephard Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond.
james_ford Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything.
hugo_reyes That's kinda of true, dude. He's worse than Yoda.
james_ford All right. Y'all head to your heart of the island and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.
dr_jack_shephard If I leave a trail, can you catch up with us?
james_ford Hell, yeah I can.
dr_jack_shephard Then be safe.
james_ford I'd ask you along, but that'd take all of the fun out me telling you, you can't come.
kate_austen Uh, I guess I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.
hugo_reyes I've got a bad feeling about this.
sayid_jarrah I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are. But, you understand, I can't be held responsible for--
hugo_reyes Yeah, yeah. Whatever, dude.
hugo_reyes None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You me, tranquilizer gun?
sayid_jarrah You are insane.
hugo_reyes Okay, fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.
sayid_jarrah What if I don't?
hugo_reyes Then, that's your choice. But, if you stick with me...you'll be happy you did.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode17 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
charlie_pace "Do not disturb" sign... Who are you? Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?
hugo_reyes Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up.
charlie_pace Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey? I don't care about a sodding concert.
hugo_reyes Charlie? Charlie, what if I told you that...playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then?
charlie_pace Sod off.
hugo_reyes Okay, dude. Sorry about this.
sayid_jarrah What was that?
hugo_reyes That was Charlie.
kate_austen Why did you take the job, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Because I was supposed to.
kate_austen Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?
dr_jack_shephard I took it because the island's all I’ve got left. It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin.
kate_austen You haven't ruined anything. Nothing is irreversible.
hugo_reyes This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
ben_linus As long as you’re watching, why don't you join us?
john_locke What are you doing here, James?
james_ford I heard Desmond fell in the well, so I came to help him get out. Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch. Oh well.
john_locke Do you know why I'm here?
james_ford I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island.
john_locke That's absolutely right.
james_ford Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship? Suicide doesn't seem like your style.
john_locke I'm not going down with anything. But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates", absolutely are.
james_ford We're not candidates anymore.
ben_linus Ahh! Ohh! Aah.
james_ford I'll be seein' ya.
ben_linus You're not gonna go after him?
john_locke I don't need to.
ben_linus When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively.
john_locke Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone? I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean. That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat. Because once we get Desmond to do, what we need him to do, I'm going to sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink. I think there was a dog here.
rose_nadler Morning.
bernard_nadler Morning. Sleep okay?
desmond_hume Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
bernard_nadler I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.
rose_nadler Are you gonna talk his ear off or get the man some breakfast?
bernard_nadler Guess I'll go check the traps for fish... Come on. Vincent. Let's go.
desmond_hume So, Rose, tell me...how long have the two of you been living here?
rose_nadler Well, we built this place in '75 and lived here a couple of years and then the sky lit up again. So God only know when the hell we are now. So...Desmond...I don't mean to be rude, but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on. We broke our rule with you.
desmond_hume What rule is that?
rose_nadler We don't get involved. Whatever got you tossed inside the well...that's the kind of drama Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with.
desmond_hume Fair enough.
rose_nadler Looks like you caught something.
bernard_nadler I'm sorry.
john_locke Hello, Rose... I'll make this simple. Come with me now or I'll kill them both right in front of you.
rose_nadler You don't have to go anywhere with him.
john_locke I'll make it hurt.
desmond_hume I want your word. You won't touch them--ever.
john_locke Done.
desmond_hume Then I'll do what you want.
john_locke Yes, Desmond. You will.
john_locke You have any idea where I’m taking you, Desmond?
desmond_hume No. But, I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light.
john_locke What makes you say that?
desmond_hume Oh. Just a hunch.
john_locke What was that?
ben_linus What was what?
miles_straume Linus, can you hear me? Come in...I found Alpert. Linus... Damn it! You okay?
richard_alpert What--what--what happened?
miles_straume You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke. It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
richard_alpert Locke--L...is he still here?
miles_straume No...I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie, he won't pick up... Come on, let's get you some help.
richard_alpert Help? Help? Help from where? You still have the explosives, the--the C-4?
miles_straume Yeah. Why?
richard_alpert Because we need to go the other island to finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane.
james_ford Detective Ford.
miles_straume Jim, it's me...I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.
james_ford You at county lockup?
miles_straume No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing.
james_ford Well, it can't be Jarrah. I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.
miles_straume Really? Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.
james_ford What?
miles_straume Help me out here, Jim. Jarrah popped four people in cold blood. Only one witness left the scene alive, right? Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay?
james_ford Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital. Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe.
jinsoo_kwon 좀 어때?
sunhwa_kwon 좀 쑤시네요.
jinsoo_kwon 총 맞으면 다 그래. 아이가 괜찮은지 보러 의사가 곧 올거야. 아무 이상이 없으면 바로 떠나도 된대.
sunhwa_kwon 떠나? 우리 어떻게 해요... 이렇게 아빠로부터 계속 도망쳐요?
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode17 Am I interrupting? Hi...Miss Paik. I'm Juliet Carlson. I'm here to make sure your baby's okay. You must be the daddy. I'm sorry. You don't speak English. I'm...I'll try not to talk too much.
dr_juliet_burke Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit. It's a little cold... Okay. Let's take a look.
dr_juliet_burke You okay?
jinsoo_kwon 자기야, 괜찮아?
sunhwa_kwon 나... 기억이 나.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 기억?
dr_juliet_burke There it is. There's your baby.
sunhwa_kwon 당신 봤어요?
dr_juliet_burke Do you see that little flutter? Right there? That's the baby's heartbeat. Perfectly perfect in every way. I have your amnio results. Everything checked out. Would you like to know if it's a boy or girl?
sunhwa_kwon It's a girl.
dr_juliet_burke Yeah.
jinsoo_kwon Her name is Ji Yeon.
dr_juliet_burke That's a lovely name... And for the record, y-you two speak English just fine. Congratulations.
hugo_reyes Whoa!
james_ford Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me...I found Locke. The son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island. You had it right, Doc. Good news is, Desmond got out of that well. So, if we can find him before Smokey can--
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James. We're all going to the same place anyway.
james_ford Then what?
dr_jack_shephard Then it ends.
dr_jack_shephard Hello, Mr. Locke.
john_locke Dr. Shephard. Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me John.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, John. I thought I'd stop by and say hi before we started the anesthesia. You nervous?
john_locke Are you sure this is going to work?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. I'm very confident that it will.
john_locke Really?
dr_jack_shephard Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you...but, I'm trying to make you feel better.
john_locke Okay. Okay, let's do it.
dr_jack_shephard All right. I'll see you on the other side.
john_locke Hey, Doctor, back at L.A.X. when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up?
dr_jack_shephard As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning. They, uh, they found the coffin.
john_locke Oh, good.
dr_jack_shephard Actually, it might be here already.
john_locke Well, I hope that brings you some peace.
dr_jack_shephard If I can fix you, Mr. Locke, that's all the peace I'll need.
richard_alpert It's gonna be a hell of a storm.
miles_straume Welcome to the club.
richard_alpert What?
miles_straume Do you mind?
miles_straume Looks like you got your first grey hair.
miles_straume What are you smiling about?
richard_alpert I think I just realized that I wanna live.
miles_straume Well, it's good timing.
richard_alpert What was that?
frank_lapidus Help!
richard_alpert Hey! Miles, up ahead!
frank_lapidus Hey! Wha...
miles_straume Get him some water.
frank_lapidus What are you guys doing out here?
richard_alpert We're going to Hydra island to blow up the plane.
frank_lapidus What do you want to do that for?
richard_alpert Because the black smoke wants to get off the island. We have to stop that thing from leaving.
frank_lapidus Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.
richard_alpert And how are we going to do that?
frank_lapidus In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.
john_locke Well, this is gonna be interesting.
james_ford Kate! Kate!
kate_austen You killed them!
james_ford Kate!
john_locke You might wanna save your bullets.
john_locke So it's you.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. It's me.
john_locke Jacob being who he is, I expected to be a little more surprised. You're sort of the obvious choice, don't you think?
dr_jack_shephard He didn't choose me. I volunteered.
john_locke I assume you're here to stop me.
dr_jack_shephard I can't stop you. In fact, I uh, wanna go with you.
john_locke I'm sorry, Jack. I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do.
dr_jack_shephard No I'm not. No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest. To the place that I've sworn that I'll protect. And then you think you're gonna destroy the Island.
john_locke I think?
dr_jack_shephard That's right. Because that's not what's gonna happen.
john_locke Then what's gonna happen, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I'm gonna kill you.
john_locke How do you plan to do that?
dr_jack_shephard That's a surprise.
john_locke Okay. Then let's get on with it.
dr_juliet_burke Doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Doctor.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't know you were working today.
dr_juliet_burke I just finished. Did you get the tickets for the concert?
dr_jack_shephard Yep. Right here.
david_shephard Hey dad, did you remember the tickets?
dr_jack_shephard I just gave 'em to your mom.
david_shephard Uh, who's gonna take yours?
dr_jack_shephard Well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt Claire. I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
dr_juliet_burke Oh yeah, it's fine with me. In fact I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant.
dr_juliet_burke Good luck on your surgery, doctor.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you.
dr_juliet_burke Did you pick out a tie?
david_shephard I did.
james_ford Hi. I'm detective Ford, L.A.P.D.
RECEPTIONIST#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode17 M-hm.
james_ford I'm looking for a patient's room. Sun Paik.
james_ford Something you wanna share with the rest of us, Doc?
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
james_ford You said you were gonna kill Locke. What's your surprise?
dr_jack_shephard Desmond.
james_ford How's that gonna work?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob would have brought him all the way back to this Island just so Locke could make him destroy it.
james_ford So, what, Desmond is bait?
dr_jack_shephard No. I think he's a weapon.
james_ford That's a hell of a long con, Doc.
john_locke Jack, Desmond. It should just be the three of us from here on.
hugo_reyes Jack. I believe in you, dude.
john_locke Gonna be a bad one.
john_locke We're here.
desmond_hume This doesn't matter, you know.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
desmond_hume Him destroying the Island, you destroying him. It doesn't matter. You know, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else. A place where we can be with the ones we love, and not have to ever think about this damn Island again. And you know the best part, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard What?
desmond_hume You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there too.
dr_jack_shephard Desmond, I tried that once. There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. Trust me, I know. All of this matters.
john_locke Shall we?
sayid_jarrah What are we doing here?
hugo_reyes I'm not allowed to tell you.
sayid_jarrah What do you mean you're not allowed?
hugo_reyes There are rules, dude.
sayid_jarrah Whose rules?
hugo_reyes Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you.
sayid_jarrah And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust?
hugo_reyes I think you're a good guy, Sayid. You know, a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. You can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry. You clearly don't know anything about me.
hugo_reyes I know a lot about you, dude.
hugo_reyes Looks like a gnarly fight.
shannon_rutherford Hey, leave my brother alone.
sayid_jarrah Hey, it's alright.
shannon_rutherford Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Shannon.
boone_carlyle I just got pounded, man. Thanks for taking your sweet time.
hugo_reyes It takes as long as it takes.
boone_carlyle It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but dude, it was worth it.
boone_carlyle Should I go get 'em?
hugo_reyes Nah, let's give 'em a minute.
miles_straume Linus, are you there?
james_ford What the hell is that?
ben_linus Miles, where are you?
miles_straume We just got to Hydra Island. We're on our way to the plane.
ben_linus Miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane.
miles_straume We're not gonna blow it up, we're gonna fly it the hell off the Island. Just get over here now.
frank_lapidus What in the hell?
miles_straume Claire.
kate_austen Miles, it's Kate. Did you say Claire? Is she okay?
miles_straume Put the gun down.
claire_littleton Don't come any closer!
kate_austen Miles? Miles, what happened? Miles, are you there?
claire_littleton He sent you here to kill me, didn't he?
richard_alpert No, listen. We're not with Locke.
claire_littleton Why should I believe you?
richard_alpert Because we have a real chance to get far far away from him. We can be free from everything he ever did to us, and never look back. We can go home.
richard_alpert Will you come with us, Claire?
claire_littleton No.
john_locke All right we...we lower him down nice and easy.
dr_jack_shephard You know what to do once you get down there?
desmond_hume Aye. I go where the light's brightest.
dr_jack_shephard Don't get yourself killed.
john_locke This remind you of anything, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke Desmond...going down into a hole in the ground. If there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it. It'd be just like old times.
dr_jack_shephard You're not John Locke. You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about most everything. I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.
john_locke He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that.
dr_jack_shephard Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.
dr_juliet_burke Oh...it's the hospital
david_shephard Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.
dr_juliet_burke I'm so sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can.
david_shephard I know. It's cool. Go.
dr_juliet_burke We'll get to know each other better, I hope?
claire_littleton Yeah, yeah, sure... Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid.
dr_charlotte_lewis Oi... Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up.
charlie_pace Hey, What you doin'?
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm just following the instructions... You're in the band, aren't you?
charlie_pace How do you know that?
charlie_pace Oh...I was shot by a fat man. It's all right.
dr_charlotte_lewis Excuse me... Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is?
dr_daniel_faraday I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?
dr_charlotte_lewis I-I think he's in the band.
dr_daniel_faraday Yes, yes. Of course. He’s the bass player from Drive Shaft. They're accompanying me tonight. I play piano...I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.
dr_charlotte_lewis I'm Charlotte.
dr_daniel_faraday It's a great pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
dr_charlotte_lewis You, too.
claire_littleton Well, lead the way.
david_shephard Excuse me. Is this table 23?
desmond_hume Aye, indeed it is.
kate_austen Claire.
claire_littleton I...
desmond_hume You two know each other?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode17 ON MICROPHONE Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention, please? Welcome to this very special benefit concert for the Golden State Natural History Museum. I'm Dr. Pierre Chang. Thank you. I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us. So, let's get to it, shall we? It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Daniel Widmore accompanied by Drive Shaft.
claire_littleton Mm.
david_shephard You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah, yeah. I'm just--I'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll--I'll be right back...
desmond_hume Aah! Aah! Aah!
desmond_hume Uhh!
desmond_hume No! No!
john_locke It looks like...you were wrong... Goodbye, Jack.
john_locke Uhh!
dr_jack_shephard Looks like you were wrong, too.
claire_littleton Oh, hello. Hello? Hi, uh, do you know where the bathroom is? Umm. Oh.
kate_austen Uh, can you please get a doctor?
kate_austen Small world, huh?
claire_littleton Yeah, well, what are you doing--mm! Oh!
kate_austen Oh! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Come on. Sit down.
claire_littleton Um, I-I think he's coming.
eloise_hawking I thought I made it clear that you were to stop this.
desmond_hume Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore you.
eloise_hawking And once they know...what then?
desmond_hume We're leaving.
eloise_hawking Are you going to take my son?
desmond_hume Not with me...no.
claire_littleton Uhh!
kate_austen Just breathe, okay? Just breathe, breathe, breathe. Help is on the way.
claire_littleton Mnh-mnh! It's hap--it's happening. Like--like, right now.
kate_austen Right now... Um. Okay. I'm...I'm gonna get you comfortable. I want you to relax and breathe, all right? Just relax and breathe.
claire_littleton Who are you?
charlie_pace I'm with the band.
claire_littleton Uhh!
kate_austen Listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please?
charlie_pace Water and blankets?
kate_austen Yeah. All right. Uh...this is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing
claire_littleton I'm not ready. I'm really scared.
kate_austen I'm scared too, all right? Really scared. But I'm gonna need you to push because I can't do it without you. Okay? Okay? One, two, three. Push! Good, that's good. Okay, we’re gonna try again. You’re doin' good. One, two, three. Push!
kate_austen Push, push again.
claire_littleton Oh!
claire_littleton Shh... It's Aaron. It's...
charlie_pace I brought a blanket.
kate_austen Thank you.
charlie_pace It's just a blanket.
kate_austen Then go ahead and bring it to her.
charlie_pace Couldn't find any water.
claire_littleton Charlie.
charlie_pace Claire? Claire.
charlie_pace Hi, Aaron. Hey. Shh. It's okay... Hey, Aaron.
desmond_hume Do you understand?
kate_austen So now what?
ben_linus Hugo, get out the way!
ben_linus Ohh!
dr_jack_shephard Desmond! Desmond!
kate_austen We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
james_ford It's too damn heavy. There's no way we're gettin' it off him.
hugo_reyes We have to try.
kate_austen One...two...three!
kate_austen What is happening?
james_ford I'll tell you what's happening! Locke was right! This Island's goin' down!
miles_straume Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Come in!
kate_austen Miles. Is that you?
miles_straume Yeah. What the hell is happening?
kate_austen Are you with Claire?
miles_straume She's here, but she doesn't want to come with us.
kate_austen Come with you where?
miles_straume Lapidus is working on the plane right now. Then we’re taking off... Hey, how much longer 'til we get this thing in the air?
frank_lapidus I still have to check the electrical and the hydraulics. Five hours, maybe six.
richard_alpert You've got maybe one.
miles_straume Get your asses over here! We're leaving in an hour!
james_ford Son of a bitch! How the hell are we supposed to get over there?
ben_linus I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat.
dr_jack_shephard LOCKE!
john_locke I want you to know Jack, you died for nothing!
kate_austen I saved you a bullet!
john_locke You're too late.
nurse Nice work, Dr. Shephard. What happened to your neck?
dr_jack_shephard Damn it.
dr_jack_shephard OK, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower and see if I can catch up with David before the concert's over. Just give me a call if you need me.
nurse Dr. Shephard? He's waking up. I watched the anesthesiologist...he got the full dosage.
dr_jack_shephard OK. I'll take it from here. Mr. Locke. Can you hear me? John, are you awake?
dr_jack_shephard You just had major surgery so I need you to try not to move and just relax, OK?
john_locke It worked.
dr_jack_shephard Uh...it went well...but we wont know how you responded to the surgery--
john_locke No, Dr. Shephard, it worked. I can feel my legs.
dr_jack_shephard John, it's highly unlikely that you would regain sensation that quickly so lets just take it slo--
john_locke Oh.
john_locke Oh. Did you see that?
dr_jack_shephard See what?
john_locke You don't remember?
dr_jack_shephard Um... Mr. Locke Please just, ah, just relax. What we need to do...
john_locke What we need to do is go...
dr_jack_shephard No, no, no...hey. John...
john_locke Will you come with me?
dr_jack_shephard We're not going anywhere. You just had extensive spinal surgery and I...I need to see my son.
john_locke You don't have a son.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke You don't have a son, Jack.
nurse Doctor?
dr_jack_shephard Jean, um, would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest? I need to go.
john_locke Jack...I hope that somebody does for you what you just did for me.
kate_austen Oh my god.
dr_jack_shephard Ahh.
kate_austen Jack...
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. Just find me some thread and I can count to five.
james_ford Hey! Oh my god. What the hell happened?
kate_austen Locke's dead...it's over.
james_ford Sure don't feel like it's over.
james_ford Excuse me, Miss...Paik?
sunhwa_kwon Yes.
james_ford Hi. I'm Detective Ford, LAPD. I'm sorry I heard you were shot, I didn't expect you to be checking out so soon. Hey.
jinsoo_kwon Hello. Detective.
james_ford Well I came by to check if you've seen this man. He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you. I'm gonna assign a uniform to keep an eye on you until we can app--
sunhwa_kwon You don't have to do that.
james_ford All due respect, I have a job to do here ma'am. I need to keep you safe.
sunhwa_kwon It's okay, I am safe.
jinsoo_kwon We'll see you there.
james_ford See me where?
frank_lapidus Alright. It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work. Gotta reset the electronics.
frank_lapidus Something's wrong with the hydraulics down at the nose wheel. You know any guys mechanical? Yeah?
miles_straume Well, I--I worked for a--a contractor renovating apartments for a couple of summers--
frank_lapidus Take that! And this, and this. Go down there and make sure everything's hooked up right. Go!
ben_linus Lapidus?
frank_lapidus Yeah?
ben_linus Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable?
frank_lapidus Don't bother me!
ben_linus Sounds like they're making progress.
james_ford We gotta go now.
kate_austen I don't understand. Locke's dead, why is this still happening?
dr_jack_shephard Because whatever Desmond turned off...I need to turn it back on again. But if it doesn't work, if I don't get it done you all need to leave now. You need to get on that plane.
kate_austen You can come with us too, Jack. You don't have to do this.
dr_jack_shephard No I do have to do this.
kate_austen No, you don't! Let the Island sink, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Kate...I can't. You think you can get that boat across the channel in time?
james_ford Yeah, I can manage.
dr_jack_shephard Good luck to you, James.
james_ford Thanks, doc...for everything.
ben_linus James!
ben_linus If the Island's going down, I'm going down with it.
dr_jack_shephard Hugo, you better get going.
hugo_reyes Uh-uh, no way. You think I'm going down that? I'm with you, dude.
dr_jack_shephard Okay. Kate...you gotta go. Get Claire on that plane.
kate_austen Tell me I'm gonna see you again.
kate_austen I love you.
dr_jack_shephard I love you.
richard_alpert Can you fix it?
miles_straume I don't believe in a lot of things but I do believe in duct tape. Yeah, I think we're good.
miles_straume Let's get the hell out of here.
james_ford Yo Chesty, Sawyer and Kate...
richard_alpert Yeah?
james_ford We're on our way down to the sailboat then we're heading to you...don't leave without us.
frank_lapidus We're getting off the ground while there's still ground to get off. So if you wanna go you better get your asses in gear.
james_ford Lapidus! Lapidus! Son of a bitch.
kate_austen What now?
james_ford We jump.
kate_austen I'll see you at the boat.
james_ford Kate!
james_ford Hey, you know where I could get some grub around here?
dr_jack_shephard Uhh... the cafeteria's closed, but there's a vending machine down the hallway.
james_ford Thanks, doc.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, no problem.
james_ford Oh, come on...
james_ford Unbelievable.
dr_juliet_burke Can I help you?
james_ford It's okay... I'm a... I'm a cop.
dr_juliet_burke Mmmm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights?
james_ford That's funny.
dr_juliet_burke Mmmm... Can I tell you a secret?
james_ford Please.
dr_juliet_burke If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again... the candy just drops right down.
james_ford Is that right?
dr_juliet_burke Yes, and it's technically legal.
james_ford Oh... give that a shot...
james_ford Oops...
dr_juliet_burke It worked.
dr_juliet_burke Oh...
james_ford Whoa... did you feel that?
dr_juliet_burke We should get coffee some time.
james_ford I'd love to but the machine ate my dollar, I only got one left.
dr_juliet_burke We can go dutch.
james_ford Juliet? Juliet it's--it's me. Ju--
james_ford It's me babe... I gotcha... I gotcha babe.
dr_juliet_burke Kiss me, James!
james_ford You got it blondie...
kate_austen It's over.
dr_jack_shephard Excuse me?
kate_austen The concert. It's over. You lookin' for someone?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, my son. I was supposed to bring him here tonight, and then... I couldn't come, and...
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry, where do I remember you from?
kate_austen I stole your pen.
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen Uh... Oceanic 815, from Sydney? I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom, and I stole your pen.
dr_jack_shephard And that's how I know you?
kate_austen No... that's not how you know me.
kate_austen I missed you so much.
kate_austen Are you okay?
dr_jack_shephard What is happening to me? Wh--who are you? I don't--
kate_austen I know, you don't understand Jack. But if you come with me... you will.
dr_jack_shephard It's over there.
hugo_reyes How are we getting down there?
dr_jack_shephard We're not, I'm going alone.
hugo_reyes Dude, you can't go down there alone. If Desmond didn't make it, how the hell are you going to survive?
hugo_reyes No. No way, I'm not gonna let you die.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, I'm already dead.
hugo_reyes You said you'd protect the Island!
dr_jack_shephard And that's what I'm doing.
hugo_reyes You're committing suicide!
dr_jack_shephard I'm not, this is the way it has to happen! This is what I'm supposed to do.
hugo_reyes You're not supposed to die! The Island needs you!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley... it needs you.
hugo_reyes What?
dr_jack_shephard It needs to be you, Hugo.
hugo_reyes I can't... it's supposed to be you!
dr_jack_shephard It was only supposed to be me so I can do this. But if someone has to take care of the Island, if someone has to protect it then... then it should be you. Hurley... I believe in you.
hugo_reyes Alright I'll take it. But it's only temporary, as soon as you get that light back in, I'm pulling you up, and I'm giving it right back to you, deal?!
dr_jack_shephard Deal.
dr_jack_shephard Do you have anything to drink? Anything to drink out of... uh... a cup, a canteen?
ben_linus I do. Is that okay?
dr_jack_shephard It's perfect.
dr_jack_shephard Drink this.
hugo_reyes Is that it?
dr_jack_shephard Now you're like me.
frank_lapidus Second time's a charm. It better be because we sure as hell don't have the battery power for a third time.
richard_alpert That good?
frank_lapidus That my friends, is pure music!
hugo_reyes Easy. Easy. Easy.
dr_jack_shephard Ah, ahh.
dr_jack_shephard Desmond! Desmond? Can you hear me?
desmond_hume The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place.
dr_jack_shephard I got you. Come on. Come on.
desmond_hume I'm still here. You were right Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Well, there's a first time for everything.
desmond_hume I have to put it back. It was like a drain.
dr_jack_shephard That's what you did, you took that stone out of that hole over there?
desmond_hume Jack you can't, even if you turn it back on it'll kill you. It has to be me!
dr_jack_shephard Desmond, you've done enough. You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son.
desmond_hume What about you, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I'll see you in another life, brother.
kate_austen Claire?!
james_ford Oh, that ain't good.
frank_lapidus Miles, go look out the door! You gotta be my eyes while I back this outta here! Richard, go tell me what he says!
kate_austen Claire! Are you okay?
james_ford Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
kate_austen Claire, come on please!
claire_littleton I can't!
kate_austen Why?!
claire_littleton Look at me! This Island's made me crazy, I--I don't want Aaron to see me like this. I don't even know how to be a mother anymore.
kate_austen Listen to me, none of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Come on, let's go.
frank_lapidus Are we clear?!
richard_alpert Are we clear?!
miles_straume Yeah looks like it to me!
richard_alpert He says we're good!
frank_lapidus You better pray we are Ricky boy, because I'm gonna spin her around! Hold on!
kate_austen Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell him we're coming!
james_ford Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on!
frank_lapidus Alright, we're good to go!
frank_lapidus Let's go!
frank_lapidus What the hell? Boys we got some late arrivals, open the door. Come on!
frank_lapidus We're running out of time!
miles_straume Way to wait until the last second, Jim.
james_ford Good to see you too, Enos.
richard_alpert We got 'em!
frank_lapidus Everybody buckle up tight! Hold on!
frank_lapidus Here we go, Frank.
frank_lapidus Come on. Come on.
frank_lapidus Amen.
ben_linus He did it, the light's back on.
hugo_reyes Dude, pull!
hugo_reyes Hang on, Jack!
hugo_reyes Got him...Desmond? No...Jack! Jack!
john_locke Thank you.
john_locke Hello Benjamin.
ben_linus Hello John.
john_locke Is everyone already inside?
ben_linus I believe most of them are, yes.
ben_linus I'm very sorry for what I did to you John. I was selfish, jealous. I wanted everything you had.
john_locke What did I have?
ben_linus You were special, John... and I wasn't.
john_locke Well if it helps, Ben, I forgive you.
ben_linus Thank you, John...that does help. It matters more than I can say.
john_locke What are you gonna do now?
ben_linus I have some things I still need to work out. I think I'll stay here a while.
ben_linus You know, I don't think you need to be in that chair anymore.
john_locke Goodbye, Ben.
ben_linus I think Desmond's gonna be okay.
hugo_reyes Jack's...gone...isn't he?
ben_linus He did his job, Hugo.
hugo_reyes It's my job now... What the hell am I supposed to do?
ben_linus I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.
hugo_reyes But how? People can't leave the Island.
ben_linus That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.
hugo_reyes Will you help me?
ben_linus I'm sorry?
hugo_reyes I could really use someone with like, experience. For a little while. Will you help me, Ben?
ben_linus I'd be honored.
hugo_reyes Cool.
hugo_reyes Oh, hey dude.
ben_linus Hello, Hugo!
hugo_reyes We're all inside.
ben_linus I don't think I'm coming in.
hugo_reyes You know, you were a real good number two.
ben_linus And you were a great number one, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Thanks, dude. I'll see ya.
kate_austen Do you know where we are?
