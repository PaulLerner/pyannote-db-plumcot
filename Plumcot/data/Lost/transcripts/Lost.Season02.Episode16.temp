JIN 자기야, 뭐 해? 안 자? 
SUN 곧 가요. 
JIN 와, 근사한데. 
SUN 왜 그래... 
JIN 돌아 봐 봐. 
SUN 자기야... 
JIN 한 번만. 부탁합니다, 돌아봐 주세요. 
JIN 체온은 쟀지? 
SUN 분위기 다 망치네. 
JIN 미안해. 난 그저... 지난 1년 동안 노력해도 아무 소식이 없어서... 우리 병원에 가자. 
SUN 병원? 
JIN 불임 전문의한테. 
SUN 애랑 놀아줄 시간도 없으면서 애 욕심은... 
JIN 내 핑계 대지 마. 다 일 때문에... 
SUN 일 때문에? 피 묻힌 손으로 집에 들어오는 것은 일이 아니에요! 
JIN 당신은 내 손에 왜 피가 묻었다고 생각해? 어? 피를 묻히게 한 사람은 당신 아버지야! 다 아버님이 시킨거야! 
JIN 다른 뜻은 없었어... 정말 미안해. 우리한테 애가 생기면, 아버님도 생각이 바뀌실 걸? 손주가 생기면 혹시 알아? 좀 더 안전한 일자리를 주실지... 아이가 생기면 모든게 변할 거야. 아이만 생기면 다... 좋아질거야. 
SUN 여보! 깜짝이야. 
JIN 얼마나 찾았는데! 여기서 뭐 하고 있는거야! 
SUN 뭐 하기는? 밭에서 일하고 있잖아요. 
JIN 어서 돌아가자! 
SUN 뭐? 싫어! 
JIN 당장 가자니까! 또 납치당하고 싶어? 
SUN 뭐라구요? 
JIN 바로 여기서 놈들한테 당했잖아! 우리 얘기한거 다 잊어먹었어? 가자 어서! 
SUN 이런 식으로 날 보호할 필요는 없어요! 그냥 내 밭에서 일하게 내버려 둬. 
JIN 뭐? 내 밭? 
SUN 뭐 하는 거야! 
JIN 이제 여기 올 필요 없지? 이제 갈까? 
LOCKE You were running like the devil's chasing you.
ANA Maybe he is.
LOCKE Good for you, keeping in shape.
ANA What do you want, Locke?
LOCKE What do I want?
ANA I've been here over a week -- you've never said 2 words to me. And now you're sitting outside my tent?
LOCKE We've got a man locked up down in the Hatch. There's a possibility he's one of them -- the Others.
ANA Who's we?
LOCKE Me and Jack. He's keeping watch right now.
ANA How long's he been down there?
LOCKE 3 days. I'd like you to talk with him. You have experience with the Others. You were a cop. Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out if this man's telling the truth.
ANA Does Jack know you're coming to me with this?
LOCKE We've got a serious problem, Ana Lucia -- all of us. I'm taking the necessary steps to solve it. I don't need Jack's permission to talk with you because right now there's a man sitting in a room in my hatch and I want him out.
ROSE I don't have to give you anything. It's the thought that counts. You just didn't think.
BERNARD I think all the time. You know, maybe you should think about giving me a little bit of a break here.
ROSE Oh, just hush, Bernard. Just hush.
ROSE Honey? Are you alright?
SUN I'm -- I think I'm just a little lightheaded.
BERNARD You look as pale as a sheet.
ROSE Well, give her some water.
BERNARD Yes, ma'am.
ROSE Don't pay him any mind, honey. He's just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday.
BERNARD I didn't forget. I don't even know what day of the week it is, Rose.
ROSE It's Saturday, Bernard. Honey, can you walk?
SUN Really, I'm alright.
BERNARD Maybe we should go get Jin?
SUN No -- I think I was just out in the sun too long.
ROSE Well, you spent a lot of time around the baby maybe you caught something. At least talk to Jack.
SUN Really, I'm okay. Thank you -- both of you.
JAE 교통이 많이 막히진 않았죠? 
SUN 맨날 똑같죠, 뭐. 
JAE 진수 씨가 여기 오는거 아시죠? 
SUN 아니오. 
JAE 난 얘기할 줄 알았는데... 
SUN 그럴 수가 없었어요. 
SUN 많이 바쁘실 텐데, 이렇게 시간 내주셔서 고마워요. 
JAE 호텔 매니저나 회장님 외아들만이 할 수 있잖아요... 근무 시간이 자유로운 편인거. 방도 이 정도면 괜찮은 것 같은데요. 마실 것 좀 드릴까요? 
SUN 그냥 아이스티 주세요. 
JAE In English.
SUN I would like iced-tea, please.
JAE Very good.
SUN Thank you.
JAE 괜찮아요? 
SUN 네. 
JAE 무슨 고민 있으세요? 
SUN 아니에요... 
JAE 나중에라도 마음이 바뀌시면... 뭐 그렇다고 제가 충고할 입장도 아니지만... 그래도 선 씨가 영어를 잘 하시면 진수씨가 좋아하실걸요? 
SUN 어떻게 배웠냐고... 누구한테 배웠냐고 하면 뭐라고 해요? 
JAE 우리가 이렇게 만나는 것이 불편하시면 그만 하죠. 
SUN 그러길 원하세요? 
JAE 아니오. 사실은 저한테도 공부가 많이 돼요. 
LOCKE Morning, Jack.
JACK You couldn't wait 'til I was done in here?
LOCKE The steam opens up my pores. A man's got no shaving cream, he's got to improvise. I also thought this might be a good time to talk about our problem.
JACK Our problem?
LOCKE Our Henry problem. We've had him locked up for 3 days now, and I can't help but get the sense that he's just not motivated to cooperate with us.
JACK And how are we going to motivate him?
LOCKE I don't think there's anything we can do. I think we need to bring in some new blood.
JACK Obviously, you have someone in mind.
LOCKE What do you think about Ana Lucia?
JACK Why her?
LOCKE She's the one you went to to start an army to fight these people -- why not her? Unless you're worried about what she'll do to him.
JACK I'll talk to her.
LOCKE I already did. In there with him now.
GALE Were you on the plane, too?
ANA I was in the tail section. We crashed on the other side of the Island.
GALE You walked across all the way here? That must have been fun.
ANA It had its moments. So, are you going to tell me your story, Henry?
GALE Why bother, I've already told it to everyone -- Jack, Locke, the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me. Oh, yeah, and my buddy, Sayid. You can see how much he liked my story.
ANA So how about you try me.
GALE I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why are you going to help me get out of here?
ANA On the other side of the Island there was this guy with us. I was 100 percent convinced that he wasn't on the plane. So I dug a hole and I threw him in it.
GALE And what happened?
ANA I was wrong. And now he's dead. But good news for you Henry -- I don't make the same mistake twice. So how about you tell me your story?
SUN Sawyer?
SAWYER Well, hey there, Sunshine, what can I do for you?
SUN How's your book?
SAWYER Predictable -- not nearly enough sex.
SUN I heard that you have all the medical supplies.
SAWYER You heard correct.
SUN May I look through them?
SAWYER No you may not. But if you'll tell me what you're looking for...
SUN Forget it.
SAWYER Okay, hold on. Now I'm intrigued. Tell you what, tell me what you're looking for and it's yours, gratis.
SUN Can't I just look myself?
SAWYER It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.
SUN I need a pregnancy test.
JACK Can't hear anything.
LOCKE She's only been in there about 30 minutes.
JACK How do you know he hasn't snapped her neck, John?
LOCKE How do you know she hasn't snapped his?
ANA So let me get this straight -- you and your wife travel around the world and crash here in a smiley-face balloon? Then she dies. You get captured by a French chick who brings you here, and then they lock you up.
GALE It sounds kind of silly when you say it like that.
ANA Why don't you have a beard?
GALE Because I shaved -- because I needed something normal.
ANA Okay, so why don't you draw me a map to your balloon? We'll go out there, we'll find it, and everybody will believe you.
GALE That's what they all keep asking me to do -- draw a map. And if I mess up they'll crucify me.
ANA You flew around the world in a balloon and you don't think you can draw up a good map?
GALE Air travel -- it's a different animal. It's about wind currents and...
ANA Do you or do you not know where it is?
GALE Yeah, I know where it is. I went back there to bury my wife.
ANA Why'd you do that?
GALE Because our balloon was the closest thing we had to home. You people have been looking for someone to punish for everything that's happened to you -- someone to blame -- and now you've got him. It doesn't matter what I do, I'm dead already.
ANA You draw up that map, Henry. I'll find your balloon. But if you don't, things are going to play out just like you said.
HURLEY Hey, Sun. Look what I found in the middle of the jungle. It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh? You want to split it?
SUN No. No, thank you. I was just heading to the beach.
HURLEY Okay, well, later, dude.
DR. KIM 안녕하세요, 미스터 권. 아, 선화 씨. 죄송합니다, 오래 기다리게 해서. 아버님은 건강하시죠? 
SUN 네, 덕분에요. 
DR. KIM 아버님께 안부 좀 전해주시죠. 
SUN 그럼요. 다른 환자분들도 많으실 텐데 이렇게 시간 내 주셔서 감사합니다. 
JIN 선생님, 결과는요? 
DR. KIM 말씀드리기가... 별로 좋지 않습니다. 초음파 검사 결과, 부인의 나팔관은 조직 상처로 인해 다 막혀있습니다. 그래서... 수술을 하더라도... 임신 가능성은... 불가능합니다
JIN 고칠 수 없을까요? 어떻게 해서라도... 
DR. KIM 글쎄, 저는... 죄송합니다. 
JIN 결혼하기 전부터 알고 있었어? 
SUN 뭐요? 
JIN 전혀 몰랐단 말야? 
SUN 이런 사실을 내가 왜 숨기겠어요? 아, 그렇지. 내가 어떻게 당신같은 잘난 남자를 꼬셨겠어요? 
ANA Coming out.
ANA He told me the same story he told you.
LOCKE You believe him?
ANA I don't know yet. I need more time with him.
LOCKE He's all yours.
ANA Tomorrow. I want to give him some time to think. If that's okay with you.
JACK I didn't tell anyone, Ana.
ANA No worries, man.
CHARLIE A bit large for a dining room table, isn't it?
SAYID If we cut them in two, it will suit the purpose.
ANA Sayid, can I talk to you?
SAYID Of course.
ANA Alone?
SAYID Whatever you need to say you can say it here.
ANA It's about the Hatch.
CHARLIE You mean the guy locked in the closet there? What about him?
ANA It's to his balloon.
SAYID How did you get him to do this?
ANA I asked nicely.
SAYID Do Jack and Locke know about this?
ANA Jack and Locke are a little too busy worrying about Locke and Jack. All I want to know is if this guy's telling the truth.
SAYID Why come to me?
ANA Judging from what you did to his face that's what you want, too.
SAYID This is at least a day's walk.
ANA Then we should get going.
ANA You okay?
CHARLIE I'm alright. Thanks.
SAYID That cliff there appears to be this .
ANA Score one for Henry.
SAYID Pointing out a geographical touchstone does not mean he's leading us to a balloon.
ANA Maybe not, but at least we're on the right island.
CHARLIE Humor's not his strong suit. And I'm saying this to you.
CHARLIE You looking at my bum?
ANA No, I'm looking at your gun.
CHARLIE My what?
ANA Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it.
CHARLIE Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun you murdered someone.
SAYID That's enough.
SAYID We'll go as far as the base of the cliff and we'll camp there.
SUN How long is it supposed to take?
KATE Uh, up to two minutes.
SUN I'm sorry -- I'm just...
KATE I know. Where did Sawyer find one of these anyway? I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right?
SUN Have you ever taken one?
KATE Yeah.
SUN Thank you for waiting with me and not asking why you're here and not Jin.
KATE You're welcome. It's time.
KATE You're pregnant.
SUN Is it 100 percent sure?
KATE There's only one way to find out.
JACK These tests are pretty accurate. You know, a false negative in the first week maybe, but positive is a positive.
SUN But it's impossible.
JACK Oh, it's possible. You feeling queasy, lightheaded?
SUN Please, Jack. This is private, nobody can know.
KATE You're not going to tell Jin?
SUN In time I will, it's just -- it's complicated.
JACK As complicated as Jin being the last one on the Island to find out you spoke English? Sun, my advice -- and it's just that because I'm the last person to ask about this, but -- you should tell him. And when you do, you should tell him everything -- the whole truth. I'm going to get back to the Hatch. Congratulations, Sun.
KATE You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay?
JACK Sure, yeah, everything's fine. 
KATE Are you okay? Sun?
JAE Sun? Sun. Sun are you alright?
SUN Yes, I'm fine.
JAE You were distracted for our entire lesson. You're not fine.
SUN We -- Jin and I went to see a doctor. He said I cannot have children.
JAE I'm very sorry, Sun.
SUN I was glad.
JAE 우리가 여기서 뭐하는 거죠? 
SUN 저한테 영어를 가르쳐 주시고 있잖아요. 
JAE 선 씨는 이미 한달 전부터 영어를 유창하게 하는데요, 왜 영어를 배우려는 거죠? 
SUN 저... 미국에 가려고요. 
JAE 진수 씨하고... 헤어질 생각이세요? 난 한 여자 때문에 미국으로 도망갔었어요. 그것이 사랑인줄 알고... 하지만 자기 인생에서 도망갈 순 없죠. 
SUN 그럼... 그 사람이 제 인생의 전부인가요? 저는요? 
JAE I'm not saying you should stay for Jin.
ANA Do you mind?
SAYID You should sleep while you can.
ANA Yeah, I can't sleep. People don't like me. I tried to get them to most of my life. I guess I just gave up a while back. I mean, I am what I am. But you -- you've got a good reason to hate me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did.
SAYID You were trying to protect your people. It wasn't you that killed Shannon; it was them. And once we find out he is one of them then something will have to be done.
ANA What?
SAYID Nothing.
ANA It's going to rain.
SAYID We should get moving.
CHARLIE Morning! Who wants breakfast? I have papayas and papayas.
SAYID Let's go.
CHARLIE Right, why eat?
SAYID This is it.
CHARLIE This balloon would be rather large, right?
SAYID Why am I not surprised?
ANA We need to look some more.
SAYID This is where he said it would be.
ANA If I'm going to back your play on this, Sayid, we need to be sure.
SAYID I'll divide the area into 3 grids, so search as thoroughly as you please.
BERNARD Oh, for the love of god.
JIN 펼쳐 놔야지. 한데 모아놓지 말고, 펼쳐 놔야 돼.
BERNARD Oh, no, no, no, it's not for fish.
JIN 아니, 아뇨...
BERNARD No, no, no, oysters. Pearl, for Rose.
JIN Ahhh.
BERNARD Pearl.
JIN 시간 낭비하지 마세요. No oyster. No oyster here.
BERNARD Ah, of course not. Why would there be?
SAWYER Yo, Daddy-o.
JIN Sawyer.
SAWYER Way to go, Papa-san. You didn't waste much time. I'd give you a cigar, Bernie, but I'm fresh out.
BERNARD Sun's pregnant?
SAWYER Keep it down there, Suzie; I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet.
SUN 여기서 뭐하는 거에요? 
JIN 내가 잘못했으니까 바로 해 놔야지. 
SUN 그럴 필요는 없는데... 
JIN 아니, 내가 그렇게 했잖아. 자기야... 난 니가 필요해. 
SUN 네? 
JIN 난 이런건 너무 싫어. 자꾸 싸우는 거. 근데 내가 어떻게 해야... 다른 사람들하고 얘기도 할 수 없어. 의사소통이 전혀 안 돼. 난 당신이 필요해. 
SUN 진수 씨, 난... 
JIN 아냐, 괜찮아... 미안하다. 다 내가 못나서... 
SUN 나 임신했어요. 
JIN 뭐? 임신? 
SUN 임신이요, 여보. 
SUN 진수 씨, 내 말 좀 들어. 
JIN 왜? 
SUN 당신한테... 당신한테 할 얘기가 있어요. 
DR. KIM 백선화 씨! 선 씨! 
SUN 김 선생님? 
DR. KIM 잠깐 차에 타시죠. 
SUN 왜요? 무슨 일이시죠? 
DR. KIM 잠시 드릴 말씀이 있습니다. 
DR. KIM 잠시만요! 잠깐이면 돼요. 선 씨, 지난번엔 제가 큰 잘못을 했습니다. 사실은요, 선 씨에게 문제가 있는게 아니고요... 
SUN 네? 
DR. KIM 부군에게 문제가 있습니다. 
SUN 아니, 뭐 때문에 그런... 
DR. KIM 그땐 제가 어떻게 할 수가 없었어요. 죄송합니다, 정말 죄송합니다. 부군께서 아버님 밑에서 일하지 않습니까. 그런 사람에게 제가 사실대로 마냥 다 얘기했다면 그 분은 제 병원을 불살라 버렸을 겁니다! 
SUN 왜 이 얘기를 이제 하시는 거죠? 
DR. KIM 선 씨가 이 사실을 다 아셔야 하니까요. 
JIN 왜 나한테 얘기 안 했어? 
SUN 어떻게 얘기를 해요... 
JIN 아니 만약 내가... 나한테 문제가 있다면... 어떻게 아이가 생길 수 있지? 
SUN 당신한테 맹세하는데... 나한테는 당신 뿐이야. 그게 사실이고. 
JIN 그랬다면... 이건 기적이야. 
JIN 만약 아들이면, 우리 아버지 이름에서 한 자를 따면 어떨까? 
SUN 하나는 우리 엄마 이름으로 해요. 
JIN 사람들에게 알려도 돼? 
SUN 잭하고 케이트는 벌써 알고 있고... 아마 소이어도 알고 있을 거에요. 
JIN Daddy-o. 그럼 버나드도 알고 있겠네? 
SUN 섬에서 아마 모르는 사람 없을걸요? 
JIN 배 안 고파? 우리 점심 먹으러 가자. 
SUN 나, 한 20분만이라도 혼자 있고 싶은데... 그냥 혼자서... 당신이 괜찮다면. 
JIN 그럼 그렇게 해. 바닷가에서 보자. 
SUN 사랑해. 
JIN I love you. 
JACK How is it?
GALE Men reject their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain. So what's the difference between a martyr and a prophet?
JACK Either way, it sounds like you end up dead.
GALE That's the spirit.
JACK In the mood for some breakfast?
GALE What's the computer for?
JACK Nothing.
GALE Cereal? Wow, where'd you guys get cereal?
LOCKE It was down here all along. The pantry's full of food.
GALE How old is it? You guys don't know much, huh? I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here. You guys don't even seem that curious.
JACK Do you want the cereal or don't you?
GALE This must be my reward for good behavior, huh? I guess I earned myself some good will for finally drawing that map for Ana.
LOCKE What map?
GALE To my balloon.
JACK Did you...
LOCKE No.
GALE Wow, you guys have some real trust issues, don't you? Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you. I mean, with the two of you fighting all the time. Of course, if I was one of them -- these people that you seem to think are your enemies -- what would I do? Well, there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map to a real secluded place like a cave or some underbrush -- good place for a trap -- an ambush. And when your friends got there a bunch of my people would be waiting for them. Then they'd use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh? You guys got any milk?
