SAWYER Ow. Son of a bitch. What the hell are you doing?
KATE What the hell are you doing?
SAWYER It's my knee. You practically busted my damn knee.
KATE You stalking me, now?
SAWYER Stalking you? I was protecting you.
KATE From what? Southern perverts?
SAWYER Yeah, whatever. I can't believe you.
KATE It's not that bad.
SAWYER It's my knee. I'll tell you how bad it is. What the hell you doing out here anyway?
KATE Everyone's been eating a lot. This is the only place the trees aren't picked clean.
SAWYER Yeah, well, you shouldn't be out here alone. Not after what happened...
KATE No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.
SAWYER Oh, of course. I don't need protection. I can take care of myself. Me Kate. Me throw rock.
KATE Shhhh.
SAWYER What? You smell blood on the wind?
KATE You don't hear that?
KATE What are you doing?
SAWYER I need to soak my sore knee. Come on, Freckles, after all we've been through on this damn Island, don't we deserve something good? What? You going to say no? You some sort of navel-gazing, no-fun, mopey type?
SAWYER Well, ... it's chilly. Come on, girl, woohoo. It's nice, huh? C'mon, what you got? C'mon, let's go up the rocks. C'mon.
SAWYER Hey, are you okay?
KATE Yeah. Yeah, you?
SAWYER Yeah, I'm going to go check them out.
KATE Check them out for what?
SAWYER See what they got on them.
KATE Sawyer!
SAWYER Hey, I got myself a wallet.
KATE You're disgusting.
SAWYER He ain't gonna miss it.
KATE Help me get that case.
SAWYER Oh, I'm disgusting, but you're not?
KATE It's mine.
SAWYER Wouldn't happen to have your key on you, would you? That case ain't yours, is it?
KATE No.
SAWYER Well, you wouldn't mind if I just -- take it.
KATE I don't care.
SAWYER Not what it looks like. Something you want to tell me about this little suitcase, Freckles?
KATE Take it.
SAYID Everything is getting washed out to sea. This can't be normal. The tide shifting so suddenly, rising in so short a time.
JACK There's a lot not normal around here. At the rate this beach is eroding this fuselage is going to be underwater in a matter of days. We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall.
SAYID I just hope that moving up the coast will make a difference.
JACK It would make a difference if everyone moved inland.
SAYID I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle after what happened to the pregnant girl. Not to mention whatever that thing is.
JACK Sayid, I need you to take me back to the French woman, Rousseau. Claire's still out there. Now, Rousseau mentioned that there are others on this Island.
SAYID Her mind is gone.
JACK You heard them yourself.
SAYID I don't know what I heard.
JACK You said that when you...
SAYID The wind, Jack. It was the wind playing tricks.
JACK Okay, then, what about the papers that you took from her -- the documents, the maps. I mean, isn't there anything here that. . .
SAYID I'm skilled at mathematics and decryption, but these equations are beyond anything I've ever seen. There are these notes in French accompanying some of the maps and diagrams. If I could translate them I might be able to make sense of it, but. . .
JACK What?
SAYID Perhaps some things are best left untranslated.
JACK Yeah? Maybe you should tell him that.
BOONE Glad to see you're doing something productive with your time.
SHANNON Where have you been?
BOONE What do you mean where have I been?
SHANNON You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for the last 4 days. What are you doing out there? Is he your new boyfriend?
BOONE We're looking for Claire.
SHANNON I thought there was no trail anymore -- that no one even knew where to look.
BOONE Yeah, well, at least I'm doing something. Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just -- you're useless.
Mark Hutton Okay, Ms. Ryan, if you'll just give me some ID, we'll get started on your loan app.
KATE Okay, here you go.
HUTTON So what brings you to New Mexico?
KATE My work.
HUTTON And what line of work is that?
KATE I'm a photographer.
HUTTON What do you photograph?
KATE I've been commissioned for a coffee-table book. Uh, pictures of old theaters in small towns.
HUTTON Oh, there's a fantastic one down in Ruidoso. You can't miss it. It's right off the main road.
KATE Well, if I end up using it, I'll have to make sure I give you acknowledgment, Mr. -- Hutton.
HUTTON Mark.
ROBBERS Everyone down on the ground. Down on the ground, now.
ROBBERS Don't. Don't even think about it. Let's go. Shut up and move over there. Let's go. Move. Who's back there, I see you. All right, big boy, get your ass down there! Get out. Alright, girlie, get up and get over there! Let's go, move. Stay there, right there! Get down on the floor, bitch! Are you the manager?! I said, are you the manager?!
HUTTON Yes.
JASON Good. Then let's open the money cage now, before people start getting killed.
ROBBER #2 Don't look at me, look at the floor.
SAWYER Gotcha.
KATE Get off of me.
SAWYER Golly, I hate to bicker about positions, sweetheart. But I think you're the one on top. Maybe you're not here for the case at all.
SAWYER Ow, woman. If you wanted to play rough, all you had to do was say so. You want to try for it again?
KATE Give it to me.
SAWYER No.
SAYID We're quite close to the equator. The sun might be stronger than what you're used to.
SHANNON I have a pretty good base.
SAYID There was a matter I was going to ask you about.
SHANNON What?
SAYID I need a favor. I need your help translating some papers I took from Rousseau.
SHANNON Who's Rousseau?
SAYID The French woman -- the distress call we intercepted.
SHANNON Did my brother put you up to this?
SAYID Your brother? No. The papers contain equations accompanied by notations in French. If I could understand the notations, then-
SHANNON Sorry, can't do it.
SAYID You're the only person on this Island who speaks French.
SHANNON I barely speak French.
SAYID Please, Shannon, can you at least try?
SAWYER Son of a bitch!
Michael You're wasting your time, man. If you pick the lock on a Halliburton, I'll put you on my back and fly us to LA.
SAWYER You better find yourself a runway, daddy, cuz there ain't a lock I can't pick.
HURLEY What's he trying to do?
MICHAEL Pick the lock on a Halliburton.
HURLEY Good luck.
MICHAEL The only way you're going to open that case is with pure force, man. Impact velocity.
SAWYER What the hell is that supposed to mean?
MICHAEL You've got to hit it with something hard, like a sledgehammer. Or the axe.
LOCKE You got it?
BOONE Yeah. Right there. Isn't there any easier way to get there?
LOCKE The easiest way isn't always the best. Did anybody see you take it?
BOONE No, I don't think so.
LOCKE Well, which is it?
BOONE Sorry?
LOCKE No? Or, I don't think so?
BOONE No.
LOCKE Good. Let's get to work.
ROSE Hello, Charlie. Oh, that's right, you're not talking much these days. It doesn't mean you get to be rude.
CHARLIE Excuse me?
ROSE Everybody else is helping us move the camp up the beach except for you.
CHARLIE Are you serious?
ROSE Do you think you're the only one on this Island that's got something to be sad about? Baby, I've got sob stories for you, so why don't you grab the other end of this thing and help me. Well?
SAWYER Come on. Come on, god.
SAWYER Impact velocity -- physics my ass. Alright. Son of a... Unbelievable. Hey, hey, don't even think about it! Hey! Damn it.
SAWYER Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it. I just didn't know how bad. Whoa-hoa, you're going to have to come up with a new move. Ow, god, okay, okay. Okay, this is just silly. Hold on. I've got a proposition for you. You tell me what's inside and I'll give it to you.
KATE Are you serious?
SAWYER Hell, no way to open the damn thing. At this point all I care about is satisfying my own curiosity. Whoa, easy, sweetheart, I don't really care what it is. What's burning me up is why it means so much to you. -- Last chance. Alright.
JASON Give me the key, now. I'm tired of asking nice. Give me the money cage key, now.
HUTTON You're just going to kill me, anyway, why would I give you-
JASON You think we're in a conversation, here, huh?
ROBBER #2 Everybody be cool! You want to go home?! Don't look at me, look at the floor! Be calm, stay down!
JASON Listen to me, I am not going to ask you again. I want that key!
BASEBALL HAT I can take him.
KATE What?
BASEBALL HAT The tall guy, he's not watching us... It's now or never. Keep your head down.
BASEBALL HAT Pick it up, pick it up! Shoot him! Shoot him! What's wrong with you, shoot the gun! Turn off the safety!
JASON Give me that gun.
BASEBALL HAT Other side, turn it off!
KATE I don't know how to use a gun!
ROBBER #2 You want to get shot, fat boy, huh?
JASON Okay, little hero...
KATE No, please don't.
JASON Shut up. Let's you and me go talk, huh?
JASON I don't know how to use a gun? That's classic.
KATE Yeah.
SHANNON You never said anything about math.
SAYID You worry about the French, I'll take care of the math.
SHANNON I can't do this.
SAYID If you really put your mind to it, I know you can, Shannon. Where did you learn to speak French?
SHANNON I knew this guy.
SAYID This guy?
SHANNON In France, in Saint Tropez. I kind of lived there for a while.
SAYID Well, they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language.
SHANNON Alright. Let me see.
JACK So, what is this? What is this for?
SUN 두통에 쓰이는 약초인데, 그러니까...
JACK A headache? Oh, cool, alright.
KATE Jack? We got a problem.
JACK We have a problem? Or, you have a problem?
KATE Jack, you're the only one who knows about me. Before I left the city, the Marshal who was escorting me, he had this silver case. The airline wouldn't let him bring the case on the plane. It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun on his ankle. But the case, they made him check it.
JACK What was in the case?
KATE Some traveling money, some of his personal stuff. And 4 nine millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.
JACK Guns?
KATE Guns.
JACK So, where is the case now?
KATE Sawyer has it.
JACK Aha.
KATE He hasn't been able to open it.
JACK Lucky for us.
KATE He will. Sooner or later.
JACK So, what do you need me to do?
KATE I know where the key is. The Marshal, he kept it in his wallet. In his back pocket.
JACK I buried him, Kate.
KATE I know. Where?
JACK So, what else is in the case?
KATE What?
JACK What else is in the case, Kate?
KATE Nothing.
JACK That's the truth?
KATE Just the guns.
JACK If you want my help, we're going to open the case together.
KATE Okay.
JACK Okay.
CHARLIE Why are you smiling?
ROSE Am I?
CHARLIE You look -- happy.
ROSE Well, I guess I must be then.
CHARLIE There's no reason to be happy, things are awful.
ROSE They're not that awful.
CHARLIE We're stranded on an Island. No one's coming for us.
ROSE You don't know that.
CHARLIE Well, what I do know, is there's something in that jungle that eats people. Just because we haven't heard from it in a couple of weeks doesn't mean it won't get hungry again. And I know there's a person, or people, that are trying to hurt us...
ROSE Charlie. Nobody blames you.
CHARLIE What?
ROSE For what happened to Claire. It's not your fault. You did everything that you could do. And you came very close to dying yourself.
CHARLIE Maybe I should have died.
ROSE You know what I think, Charlie? You need to ask for help.
CHARLIE Who's going to help me?
KATE So, why didn't you put him with the others, when you burned the fuselage?
JACK Because I needed to bury him.
KATE So you ready to do this?
JASON Hell, yeah, by now their imaginations are running wild.
KATE Don't hold back. He won't talk if the details are off.
JASON You and your details, Maggie. 
JASON Okay, hero.
KATE No, please don't. I've got...
JASON Shut up.
ROBBER #3 Everybody just relax. I said quiet.
JASON Okay, Mr. Manager, you want to be a hard-ass? Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you? Okay? There's going to be consequences.
KATE He's going to kill me anyway.
JASON I said... if you don't shut up! You've got 3 seconds to give me that damn key. 1, 2, , 3.
HUTTON Alright, I'll give it to you.
JASON Good. Let's go, right around here. Let's go.
JACK Okay, alright?
KATE Compared to what?
JACK You want me to...
KATE No, I'll do it.
JACK Did you get it?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Key isn't in here.
KATE It isn't?
JACK No, but that was real good sleight-of-hand distracting me with the wallet. Open it. 
KATE Jack, I...
JACK Don't. Don't. 
SHANNON A des reflets d'argent. La mer des reflets changeants -- the sea of sparkles? No, wait, um, the sea of silver sparkles that change. It's the same as the last one.
SAYID Are you sure? But the equation is completely different. It doesn't relate. What you're saying doesn't make any sense.
SHANNON Okay?
SAYID What about this one? It should say something about latitude or longitude, something about the stars...
SHANNON Okay, just give me some room, okay? Um, next to the pond, blue, um, blue eternity, blue eternity? No, wait, no, blue infinity.
SAYID Blue infinity?
SHANNON Blue infinity. There's something about this that is so familiar.
SAYID You've been telling me what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour and now it seems to me...
SHANNON Okay, a) I told you that my French sucks, and b) this isn't my nonsense, okay? Did you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island your friend might not be quite adjusted?
SAYID This was a mistake.
SHANNON Yeah, haven't you heard? I'm completely useless.
JACK Sawyer.
SAWYER Doctor? What can I do you for? Figured she'd get you to do her dirty work for her. So what? Are we going to wrestle for it?
JACK No, you're going to give it to me.
SAWYER Am I?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER I'm just going to give it to you?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER Why would I want to do that?
JACK Cephalexin.
SAWYER Yeah, go on?
JACK That's the antibiotic I've been giving you for the knife wound in your arm. You're right in the middle of the treatment cycle now, if I keep giving you the pills you're going to be as right as rain. But I'm going to stop giving you the pills. And for 2 days you're going to think you're all good, then it's going to start to itch. The day after that the fever's going to come and you're going to start seeing red lines running up and down your arm. A day or two after that you'll beg me to take the case, just to cut off your arm.
SAWYER That's a nice story, Jack. And, even if it were true, I don't think you could do it.
JACK You're wrong.
SAWYER Did she tell you what's inside? Yeah, me neither. Hope you got yourself some jaws-of-life back in cave-town, that's what it's going to take to pop this bitch.
JACK I'll figure something out.
SAWYER I know you think you're doing her a favor. But however she talked you into doing this, she lied, brother.
KATE Jack?
JACK We're going to do this together.
KATE Why?
JACK Because that's what I said we'd do.
JASON What the hell you waiting for? Open the damn thing. Well, now we're talking. Don't move.
KATE Please, don't. I can't...
JASON Shut up.
HUTTON I let you in, now please, let the girl go.
JASON Let the girl go? Man, you have no idea, do you? The girl is the one who set you up. The girl picked this bank, picked this vault. This whole thing is the girl's idea. 
KATE What are you doing?
JASON Easy, Maggie -- just cleaning up after myself.
KATE You shoot, I shoot.
HUTTON Please, what's...
KATE I said, no one gets hurt.
JASON I know you're cold, baby. But you're not that cold.
JASON You shot me, stupid bit...
KATE Shut up, Jason.
ROBBER #2 I told you not to trust her.
KATE I need the key to safety deposit box 815, now.
HUTTON Who are you?
KATE The key to the box, now.
HUTTON You need 2 keys. The bank's, and... If you had the customer key, why would you need...
KATE I'm not on the signatory card.
JASON You put me up to this to get into a safe deposit box? I swear to god, you better kill me, Maggie. Because if you don't...
KATE My name's not Maggie. Now, go.
JACK Anything you want to tell me? Alright then. 
JACK Is this it? Is this what you wanted?
JACK What is it?
KATE It's nothing.
JACK What is it, Kate?
KATE You wouldn't understand.
JACK I want the truth, just this once. What is it?
KATE It belonged to the man I loved.
JACK The truth.
KATE It belonged to the man I loved.
JACK Stop lying and tell me the truth!
KATE I'm not! It belonged to the man I killed!
CHARLIE Your husband was in the tail section of the plane.
ROSE Yes, he was. But he'll be back.
CHARLIE You think he's still alive?
ROSE I know he is.
CHARLIE How?
ROSE I just do. It's a fine line between denial and faith. It's much better on my side.
CHARLIE Help me.
ROSE Baby, I'm not the one that can help you... Heavenly Father, we thank you. We thank you for bringing us together tonight, and we ask that you show Charlie the path...
SHANNON The guy from Saint Tropez, he had this kid, a real snot, who hated me. His name was Laurent. He watched this movie over and over and over again, everyday, all day, the way kids do, 900 times. It was the cartoon about fish, you know, one of the computer ones?
SAYID Why are you telling me this?
SHANNON Because the movie was dubbed in French. And at the end there was this song. Those notations, they're song lyrics. And your French woman, she's just like Laurent, because she wrote them over and over and over again.
SAYID What's the song?
SHANNON La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs. A des reflets d'argent. La mer. Des reflets changeants. Sous la pluie. La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs...
