WALT Dad, please! Dad!
MICHAEL Walt!
MICHAEL Walt! No! Walt!
SAWYER Mike!
MICHAEL Walt!
JIN Sawyer!
SAWYER Jin!
JIN 안 보여, 어딨어?
MICHAEL Walt! Walt!
SAWYER Hang on Mike! Hang on Mike! Hang on!
SAWYER Mike! Mike!
LOCKE Kate! Kate!
MICHAEL Where's Walt?
SAWYER I don't know.
MICHAEL Where is he?
SAWYER I don't know.
MICHAEL Where the hell is my son? Walt!
ATTORNEY How'd you hurt your leg?
MICHAEL Got hit by a car.
ATTORNEY Ow.
MICHAEL Yeah.
ATTORNEY So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over.
MICHAEL She's not my ex-wife, man. She's just -- Walt's mother. She, uh, Susan, she just got an new job in Rome -- the boyfriend -- they want to take Walt with them.
ATTORNEY Don't worry, I'm going to take very good care of you, Mr. Dawn.
MICHAEL Dawson.
ATTORNEY Right, sorry, Dawson. So this boyfriend -- this is this guy Brian Porter?
MICHAEL Yeah, why, what's it say?
ATTORNEY It seems that Susan wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father so that Mr. Porter can adopt him.
MICHAEL She wants me to sign my son away?
ATTORNEY It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah. Listen, if you sign this document -- legally, he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street. You'll be giving up your paternal rights -- all of them.
MICHAEL Yeah, so then, can I stop her from going?
ATTORNEY Well, I guess we could file an injunction so she couldn't leave the city, but-
MICHAEL Yeah, that, that. I want to do that.
ATTORNEY Right. Um, Mr. Dawson, the fact that you came in through these doors -- that tells me something. It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford. If we go forward with this, it's going to take money. A lot of it, even at my rates. This is David and Goliath, so I've got to ask you -- are you sure you want to do this?
MICHAEL They're not taking my son away.
MICHAEL Walt! Walt! Walt!
SAWYER Mike, you should save your energy.
MICHAEL They took my son!
SAWYER Yeah, I saw that -- onto a boat which means he's not in shouting distance.
MICHAEL You don't know that.
SAWYER Well, I got a pretty good sense. And even if he was, there's nothing you can do.
MICHAEL But if he can hear me, he knows that I'm alive -- that I'm coming for him -- that I'm going to get him back. Right now, all I've got is that maybe my son can hear me. Does that make any sense to you? Walt! Walt!
LOCKE Kate.
LOCKE Kate.
KATE John.
LOCKE Easy, easy, easy.
KATE Behind you.
DESMOND Are you him? Are you him?
SAWYER Jin! Jin! Jin!
MICHAEL I thought we had to save our energy.
SAWYER Yeah, well, Jin's still out there in the water, so if it's okay by you, I'm going to keep shouting for him. Jin!
MICHAEL Feeling guilty.
SAWYER What?
MICHAEL You made me fire that flare.
SAWYER I made you fire -- what, this is my fault?
MICHAEL They took my son. They found us -- took Walt -- because you made me fire the flare.
SAWYER At least Walt is on a boat -- probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa -- while we're on this piece-
MICHAEL Get off my raft.
SAWYER What?
SAWYER What the hell is that?
MICHAEL I see you managed to hold on to your best friend there . That thing ain't going to work, anyway.
SAWYER It'll work.
MICHAEL You were under water.
SAWYER What do you know about guns, anyway, Hoss? It'll work. Bullets are dry, powder's dry -- if the powder's dry- 
MICHAEL What the hell is that?
SAWYER It's a shark. It's only a shark.
MICHAEL It's only a shark? That's supposed to make me feel better? Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around -- your shoulder.
SAWYER Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then. Did you suddenly forget what happened? Why I got shot?
MICHAEL What?
SAWYER Hey, how about a little gratitude here? I'm mean -- a thank you!
MICHAEL Thank you? For what? For you trying to save your own ass?
SAWYER You want me off this raft? You got it.
SAWYER I was trying to save your damn kid.
LIZZY Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr. Dawson?
MICHAEL Uh, sure, okay.
LIZZY When was the last time you actually saw your son?
MICHAEL Um, about a year ago.
LIZZY It was 14 months, actually.
ATTORNEY Is that a question, Lizzy?
LIZZY Why is that Mr. Dawson? Why so long?
MICHAEL Susan took him to Amsterdam -- for work.
LIZZY And you didn't have a problem with that?
MICHAEL Excuse me?
LIZZY Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction. It just seems a little inconsistent to me.
MICHAEL Incon -- no. No, no, no, no.
ATTORNEY Michael, she's baiting - she's baiting you. Don't give her an answer.
MICHAEL She took him, though. I didn't want her to go.
ATTORNEY Michael, please don't talk.
MICHAEL You said there was nothing I could do.
LIZZY And you didn't do anything, did you?
ATTORNEY He's not going to answer that question.
LIZZY That's because there is no answer. You were in an accident recently, no?
MICHAEL Yeah.
LIZZY You had several surgeries, spent weeks in a private hospital room, extensive rehabilitation. Who paid for all of that, Mr. Dawson?
MICHAEL I didn't ask you for anything.
LIZZY Could the record reflect that Mr. Dawson acknowledged that Ms. Lloyd paid his bills?
MICHAEL Susan! Tell them -- Susan, tell them that I didn't ask you for anything.
LIZZY Please don't address my client directly.
MICHAEL But I didn't. 
LIZZY Do you know what Walt's first words were, Mr. Dawson?
MICHAEL I'm sorry, what?
LIZZY His first words, do you know what they were?
MICHAEL I -- no, I -- I wasn't there.
LIZZY Do you know what his favorite food is? Do you...
MICHAEL No!
ATTORNEY Okay, this is unnecessary.
MICHAEL No.
LIZZY Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr. Dawson.
MICHAEL I'm his father.
LIZZY I'm sorry, could you say that louder please -- just for the record.
MICHAEL I'm his father.
MICHAEL Are you crazy? You're going to take a bullet out with your bare hands?
SAWYER You got a better idea? Then go to hell.
MICHAEL You're never going to be able to do it by yourself.
SAWYER I thought we parted ways, Mike.
MICHAEL We're caught in the same current.
SAWYER Still talking.
SAWYER You got a Band-aid?
DESMOND Are you -- are you him?
LOCKE Yes. Yes I am.
DESMOND I can't believe it. You're finally here.
LOCKE Well, here I am.
DESMOND Who's she?
LOCKE She's with me.
DESMOND What did one snowman say to the other snowman?
LOCKE I don't know what you're talking about.
DESMOND Get rid of the knife. You're not him.
LOCKE We didn't come here to hurt you.
DESMOND Yeah, then why did you come?
KATE We were in a plane crash.
DESMOND Were you now? And when was that?
LOCKE 44 days ago.
DESMOND 44 days? Move.
LOCKE How long have you been down here?
DESMOND Shut it. Tie him up. Do it!
LOCKE Wait. Wait, wait -- you're tying up the wrong person.
DESMOND How's that, brother?
LOCKE It's pointless to tie me up, I'm not dangerous. But her, she's a fugitive.
DESMOND So, what does that make you then, brother?
LOCKE I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer -- boxes primarily.
DESMOND All right then, box man, tie her up.
KATE Don't you dare touch me.
DESMOND Hey! You be good girl, right?
KATE What do you think you're doing?
LOCKE I'm doing what's best for all of us.
DESMOND Alright, bring her here.
KATE Oh, hey, John, wait, hey. Wait!
HURLEY You're kidding, right? You're going back?
JACK Yeah.
HURLEY What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?!
JACK I changed my mind.
CLAIRE What do you suppose all that's about?
CHARLIE I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic. What?
CLAIRE You always try to be funny when you don't want to answer a question.
CHARLIE Try to be funny?
CLAIRE What's this?
CHARLIE Oh, I found it in the jungle.
CLAIRE You found it?
CHARLIE Yeah. Be careful. Be careful with it. Here, take Aaron. You've got to be careful with it, you know. It's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.
CLAIRE I didn't realize you were so religious.
CHARLIE I'm not. It's just, you know, it might come in handy. It'd be a nice thing to have around.
SAWYER It wasn't the flare. I said it wasn't the flare. Those people that did this -- at first I thought they were fisherman or pirates or something. Then I got a good look at their boat. You know anything about boats, Mike? A boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean -- water's coming over the side with the first little squall -- maybe got a range of 100 miles. Nope, a boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close -- like the Island. French chick said the Others were coming for a kid. I think they came, Mike.
MICHAEL What?
SAWYER He's the one they wanted -- why I got a bullet in my shoulder. Hell, Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.
MICHAEL Are you saying this is my fault?
SAWYER That's what I'm saying.
MICHAEL They took my son because of you! They were sailing away!
SAWYER They found us because they were looking for us, for Walt!
MICHAEL Don't you ever say his name again, ever!
SAWYER Oh, what are you gonna do, splash me?
SAWYER Look, I know you-
MICHAEL Shut up! Don't even -- you have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.
SUSAN Hi.
MICHAEL Where are your lawyers?
SUSAN Out. I told them I wanted to talk just you and me. But if you want yours I understand.
MICHAEL No, it's okay.
SUSAN I think you're going to win.
MICHAEL Excuse me?
SUSAN In court. I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt. I just have to ask you why?
MICHAEL Why what?
SUSAN Why are you doing this?
MICHAEL He's my son.
SUSAN Since when, Michael? Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me, but in Rome I'll be senior partner at the firm. I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs. You're still on disability, Michael. You can't work. You're about to be evicted from your apartment.
MICHAEL You got your lawyers checking up on me, now?
SUSAN Well, of course I did. Just like you had your lawyers checking up on me. Nobody's winning here.
MICHAEL Then stop.
SUSAN Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to get healthy. You need to get back on your feet financially so you can get back to pursuing your art. You have rare talent as an artist, Michael. But how are you going to do that -- any of that -- and still be a part of Walt's life?
MICHAEL I do it by doing it. Walt is my responsibility, too.
SUSAN Then let him go because it's not about you or me -- it's about him. I don't want to go court, Michael. So please just let him go.
LOCKE The pilot said we had lost radio contact, but by then we were already a thousand miles off course. Any search teams would have given up weeks ago.
DESMOND So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles?
LOCKE Yes.
DESMOND So the world is still out there?
LOCKE As far as I know. Could you tell me your name?
DESMOND My name? My name is Desmond.
LOCKE Desmond, I'm John. You should know the gun is really unnecessary.
DESMOND Yeah, so I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there?
LOCKE 43, but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft.
DESMOND A raft?
LOCKE That simulated sunlight -- is that because you never leave? Is there another way out?
DESMOND How many of your group have gotten sick.
LOCKE Sick?
DESMOND Sick, as in ill, as in dead!
LOCKE Is that why it says quarantine on the inside of the hatch...
DESMOND Answer the question.
LOCKE No one has. No one. No one is sick.
DESMOND Get up. Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man?
LOCKE I haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
DESMOND Do you know how to use it?!
LOCKE Yes.
DESMOND Sit!
DESMOND Listen carefully, type in exactly what I tell you understand -- exactly, nothing else. 4, 8, 15... Did you hear that?
LOCKE What?
DESMOND What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?!
LOCKE 15
DESMOND Right, 16, 23, 42. Now press execute.
LOCKE What's going to happen?
DESMOND Just push it!
JACK Kate! Locke!
DESMOND Who the hell is that?
LOCKE That would be Jack.
DESMOND Who is he?
LOCKE His, uh, his name is Jack. He's our doctor.
DESMOND What is he doing here?
LOCKE To be honest with you I'm a little surprised to see him.
DESMOND Your doctor has a gun, brother. Move. Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move.
LOCKE I wouldn't do that, Jack.
JACK Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
DESMOND Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
JACK Where's Kate?
LOCKE Jack, it's okay.
DESMOND I said drop it.
JACK Where's Kate?!
LOCKE She's fine. Just put down the...
JACK I'm not putting down anything!
DESMOND Do you want him to die? Put it down.
JACK Is this what you were talking about Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
LOCKE Jack, calm down.
DESMOND Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
JACK You.
MICHAEL What the hell is that? Part of the raft -- one of the pontoons. Stop paddling. Hey stop it. You're putting a strain on the binds; it's going to break us up. Damn it, you're going to...
MICHAEL Hey Sawyer! Climb up.
SAWYER I do and we both sink. I'm going for the pontoon.
MICHAEL Don't be an idiot.
SAWYER You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze, got it?
MICHAEL Got it.
MICHAEL Sawyer! Sawyer! Sawyer!
SAWYER Give me your hand.
SUSAN There he is, do you see him? Hi.
MICHAEL Hey.
SUSAN Hey, I'm sorry I'm late -- packing's been a disaster and the plane leaves first thing in the morning.
MICHAEL Sure, no problem.
SUSAN Uh, you want to say hi, Walt?
MICHAEL Hi, Walt. I'm... hey, uh, this is for you, man. He like bears?
SUSAN Yes, sure, he's just really shy.
MICHAEL Hey little man, look, I guess I can't call you that -- I mean, because look how big you are. So, you and I -- well, we're not going to see each other for a while, Walt. But you are going to have a great life. I know your mommy, she's going to take real good care of you. And Brian is going to take good care of you, too. But, you know what? I just want you to know that no matter where you go that I -- that your daddy -- yeah, your daddy -- he loves you very, very much. And I always will. Always, okay.
SUSAN I'm sorry -- this...
MICHAEL It's okay. Uh, hey, here -- just, you know -- you know, let him know it's from me -- sometime.
SUSAN Okay. Goodbye, Michael.
MICHAEL Yeah, bye.
SAWYER You alright, Mike?
MICHAEL It's my fault.
SAWYER What?
MICHAEL I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get back my son.
SAWYER How about that? The current brought us back. We're home.
SAWYER Jin?
JIN Michael! Sawyer! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼!
SAWYER Jin!
JIN 여기 있으면 안돼! 이쪽으로 오지 마! 이 쪽으로 오지 마! 돌아가야 돼! 말 좀 들어봐. 여기 있으면 안돼! 지금 오는 거야! 지금 오는 거야! Others. Others. Others.
