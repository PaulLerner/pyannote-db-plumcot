STEWARDESS Would you fasten your seat belts? Would you put your seat belt back on, please?
WOMAN Oh.
STEWARDESS Would you fasten your seat belt, please?
JACK Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. Can I get another one of those, please?
STEWARDESS I'm sorry, sir. We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
JACK Well, 20 minutes is a long time.
STEWARDESS How about a newspaper instead? ... And if you could buckle your seatbelt, sir?
STEWARDESS Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you.
CAPTAIN Sorry about the bumps, folks, we're just hitting a little warm air as we make our descent into Los Angeles. Please keep those seatbelts fastened and we'll have you on the ground shortly.
VOICEMAIL You've reached three one zero five five five zero one four eight. Please leave a message.
JACK Hey. It's me. I, er, I just read... 
JACK Oh, forgive me.
KID Mom! Mom! Mom!
MOTHER Help!!!
KID Mom!
JACK You have everything you need?
SAYID No, but I made the best out of what we have.
JACK Bernard and Jin?
SAYID They're both excellent shots... and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. Jack, no matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving; keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand?
JACK Yeah. I understand.
SAYID And good luck.
JACK You too.
ROSE If I told you that I'd help you with your SOS sign, would you change your mind?
BERNARD No ma'am.
ROSE Then I want you to say it again.
BERNARD Rose—
ROSE Say it, Bernard.
BERNARD I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.
ROSE And don't you forget it.
HURLEY Charlie's gonna be fine.
CLAIRE Yeah. 'Course he is.
JIN 잭 옆에서 떨어지지 말고, 피곤하면 꼭 쉬어라. 
SUN 진수 씨... 왜 이러는 거에요? 
JIN Because...we have to go home.
JACK All right. Let's do it.
NAOMI Jack. Can I ask you a question?
JACK Sure.
NAOMI What did you do for a living before you became Moses?
JACK I was a doctor.
NAOMI Right, course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.
NAOMI Is she OK?
JACK Why wouldn't she be?
NAOMI Because none of your people trusts her. No offense.
JULIET You know what, why don't you catch up to me when you're done.
JACK Juliet...
JULIET It's fine.
NAOMI So, I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat.
JACK OK. Show me.
NAOMI It's actually simple. You turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep, and say hello.
JACK And that's it?
NAOMI That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption's jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah?
JACK Hopefully.
BONNIE Who are you?
GRETA Look, if you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you.
CHARLIE I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it?
GRETA Hey! Take it easy.
BONNIE Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here, huh? How did you find out about this station?
CHARLIE Juliet told us. She's one of us now. In case you haven't heard.
GRETA Stop. We gotta call Ben.
CHARLIE Oh yeah. Let's call Ben.
BONNIE Come on.
DESMOND You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch...
DESMOND ... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown.
BONNIE Come in. Come in, Ben.
BEN Hello?
BONNIE Ben, it's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me, Ben?
BEN Why are you breaking radio silence?
BONNIE One of them's down here.
BEN I'm sorry, what?!
BONNIE We have him tied up, but he's here. One of them swam down here.
BEN Who? Which one?
BONNIE He won't tell us.
CHARLIE It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!
BEN How did... how does he know about the station?
BONNIE He said Juliet told them.
BEN All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help. Mikhail, you need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.
MIKHAIL You told us The Looking Glass was inoperable. Flooded.
BEN I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now.
MIKHAIL I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass, what else did she tell them?
BEN Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?
RYAN Your walkies all off?
TOM Yes, sir.
RYAN Did you get a good look?
FEMALE OTHER The tents are marked with white coral, three of 'em. Juliet did her job.
RYAN All right, let's do this.
FEMALE OTHER It's empty!
RYAN Get away from the tent!
RYAN It's a trap! Move!
BERNARD Please, God.
MALE OTHER Tree line!
RYAN I got your man! Drop your weapons!
RYAN I got your man!
RYAN It's over!
MALE OTHER Don't. Finger off the trigger.
[Miles away, the main group watch the smoke rise from the beach.
ROSE There were supposed to be THREE explosions.
KATE It didn't work.
TANNOY Doctor Leon to surgery, Doctor Leon to surgery.
DOCTOR There you go. Good as new.
JACK Thanks.
DOCTOR The news people are waiting for you outside. You being a hero and all.
JACK Right. The woman, how is she?
DOCTOR She's been stabilized. Thank god you were on that bridge.
JACK Right.
DOCTOR Sorry, no visitors in ER.
JACK It's OK. She... we used to be married.
DOCTOR Come on in.
SARAH What happened?
JACK We saw... a car accident.
SARAH Are you OK?
JACK Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
SARAH Are you drinking again?
JACK No.
SARAH Are you, Jack?
JACK No. Why did you come down here, Sarah?
SARAH Erm, I'm still your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at two o'clock in the morning?
JACK You think maybe you could give me a lift home?
SARAH I don't think that would be appropriate.
JACK Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah.
SARAH Goodbye, Jack.
SUN Why were there only two explosions?
JACK Maybe they didn't have to blow the third tent.
ROSE But those gunshots, what was that all...
JACK He's OK, Rose.
SUN Do you believe that?
JACK Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them. And Sayid's with your husbands, they're gonna be fine and they're gonna be a couple of hours behind us.
SUN Then we should wait for them here. You go on...
JACK No. No one gets left behind.
ROSE If you say live together die alone to me, Jack, I'm gonna punch you in your face.
JACK Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. But we have a plan. And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be OK, everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, OK?
SUN It's OK, let's go.
BONNIE I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?
CHARLIE I'm here, to turn off your jamming equipment. It's in there, next to the flashing yellow light.
GRETA How do you know about that?
CHARLIE I know because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off.
BONNIE You are, huh?
CHARLIE Most definitely am.
BONNIE So what's the code?
CHARLIE What?
BONNIE Oh Charlie, if you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment, you're gonna need the code. And only three people know it. Me, her and Ben.
CHARLIE Well, guess I won't need the code. Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. I just turn off your little jammer and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends.
BONNIE But if this station floods, what happens to you?
CHARLIE I die.
BEN What?
TOM They're all dead. Diane, Ivan, all of 'em, dead. And Shephard and his people, they're all gone.
BEN Gone, gone where?
TOM I dunno. Did you hear me? They killed seven of our—
RYAN Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news.
BEN What good news?
TOM We caught three of 'em. The one's who stayed behind to blow up the tents. Ben, they knew we were coming.
BEN It was Juliet. She betrayed us.
TOM What?
BEN Just figure out where she is, Tom.
RYAN Get up.
RYAN OK, junior, where the hell did—
TOM They're not talking.
BEN Who do you have?
TOM Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.
BEN Shoot Kwon.
TOM What?
BEN If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now.
JIN 지옥에나 떨어져라. 
RYAN I dunno what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely.
BERNARD No, wait. No.
JIN No. No talk.
BERNARD No, please.
TOM You talk to me, nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people are.
SAYID He's lying, he's going to kill us all any—
RYAN Where are they?
RYAN Sayonara.
BERNARD A radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower.
TOM Why in the hell are they going there?
BERNARD A woman... parachuted here. She has a satellite phone and they're gonna call her ship.
BEN Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?
RYAN You heard him. How'd you know?
BERNARD A kid... told us. He came in a canoe, and he warned us.
TOM What kid?
BERNARD Karl. He said his name was Karl.
TOM You heard that, Ben? Ben?!
BEN I heard.
TOM What do you want us to do, kill 'em?
BEN No. Not yet.
RICHARD We're going to the radio tower?
BEN Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned.
RICHARD Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own.
BEN Oh really? And why not?
RICHARD Because people are asking questions, Ben. About leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumor that everyone that went down to the beach is dead.
BEN They're not all dead.
ALEX Where are you going?
BEN Hello, Alex.
ALEX I asked where you were going.
BEN Well, I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends.
ALEX I'm coming with you.
BEN All right.
ALEX What?
BEN I said all right. In fact, I think it's a good idea. I mean, you do want to see Karl again, don't you? Get your pack, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
RICHARD There's 40 of them. And you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the Island. What do you think is gonna happen when you get there?
BEN I'm going to talk them out of it.
KATE Something's wrong.
SAWYER Lots of things are wrong, Kate.
KATE Jin, Bernard and Sayid... they should have caught up to us by now. I want to go back to make sure they're all right.
SAWYER 'Course you do.
KATE What's that supposed to mean?
SAWYER It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for.
KATE What's the matter with you?
SAWYER Nothing.
KATE Nothing?
SAWYER I'm fine.
KATE Why don't you just tell me what happened?
SAWYER What you do that for?
KATE To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Locke, it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me Kate?
KATE You know. They sent Juliet to check out Sun, but she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant too.
SAWYER Well, let's hope you're not.
JACK The light's still red?
CHARLIE Des. Des!
DESMOND Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?
CHARLIE Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, Des, hide, hide, there's people in there! Quick, hide hide hide. Go go go! Hide hide hide.
BONNIE Who's he talking to?
CHARLIE I feel like standing... stupid people...
BONNIE Who are you talking to?
CHARLIE I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just singing. You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody!
BONNIE Shut up.
CHARLIE Right, OK, you got it.
BONNIE Come on.
MALE DOCTOR Can I help you?
JACK Just checking her chart.
MALE DOCTOR I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill, Rob. The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet.
JACK Jack Shephard.
DR. HAMILL Dr. Shephard, the hero? Twice over.
DR. HAMILL You all right? After last night, I'm surprised that you'd even want to come in. Talk about right place right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there.
JACK If she was lucky, she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging upon her spinal cord. I'd like to operate first thing in the morning.
DR. HAMILL You want to operate?
JACK Yes.
DR. HAMILL I'm sorry, Jack, but this isn't your patient. And we are well aware of the issues; Gary Nadler's doing the surgery at 6 a.m..
JACK With all due respect, Doctor Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.
DR. HAMILL Jack. Last night you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a burning car, then you went back for her. I think you've done enough.
JACK I want to do the surgery.
DR. HAMILL Look. Everything's under control. She'll be fine. Go home, have a drink. You deserve it.
DR. HAMILL The chart, please, Jack.
JACK You call me. I wanna know what happens.
REPORTER This morning .. ... bridge was shut down for several hours in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured, an unidentified 40-year-old woman and her son...
REPORTER ...Fortunately for the two of them, Dr. Jack Shephard, who was at the scene of the crash, pulled both victims from the burning wreckage and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived. The victims were later transported to Saint Sebastian Hospital. Further details of their conditions have not yet been....
SAWYER I'm going back.
JACK What?
SAWYER I'm going back to the beach.
JACK No way. We keep moving.
SAWYER I ain't asking permission.
SAWYER Look, you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it. And you sure as hell don't need me.
JACK What do you think you're gonna get done, alone and unarmed?
KATE He won't be alone, I'll go with him.
SAWYER No!
KATE Twenty minutes ago you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden you're telling Jack that I'm—
SAWYER I didn't wanna go with you.
JACK Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.
JULIET I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.
JACK Juliet, you don't have to do that.
JULIET Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.
SAWYER Let's do this.
JACK Don't do anything stupid.
JULIET I won't if you won't.
JULIET Don't wait up.
CHARLIE 
BONNIE AH!! I told you to shut up!!!
CHARLIE You know when you get a tune stuck in your head? This song just started coming to me, it's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge. 
BONNIE Get the speargun!
GRETA What, why?
BONNIE 'Cause I want it to hurt.
GRETA No, Ben said—
BONNIE You don't want to get it, I will.
GRETA Bonnie.
CHARLIE Oi, oi, oi, no! I'll, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up.
BONNIE Mikhail?
MIKHAIL I thought you two were on assignment in Canada?
GRETA He made us promise not to tell anyone.
CHARLIE Hello again.
MIKHAIL Where is the other one?
BONNIE What?
MIKHAIL This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here.
BONNIE He's alone.
MIKHAIL Are you sure about that?
CHARLIE Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't? Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the Island.
MIKHAIL What? Is that true?
GRETA That's Ben.
MIKHAIL I'll get it.
BEN You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island.
MIKHAIL The Island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?
BEN Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this.
MIKHAIL Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?
BEN Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here.
MIKHAIL So why not trust me?
BEN I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize.
BEN Mikhail, are you still there?
MIKHAIL Yes.
BEN I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too.
MIKHAIL How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me?
BEN Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead.
SAWYER So, when you pulled us out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for anyway?
JULIET We were building a runway.
SAWYER Runway, for what?
JULIET The aliens.
JULIET I don't know what for, do you think they told me everything?
SAWYER Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet?
JULIET No. Are you?
SAWYER How far away are these guns?
JULIET There aren't any guns.
SAWYER What?
JULIET I lied.
SAWYER You lied?
JULIET It was the only way he'd let us go back.
SAWYER So why are you going back?
JULIET Karma. Why are you going back, James?
HURLEY Hey! Hey guys, wait up!
SAWYER What the hell do you want?
HURLEY I'm coming with you guys.
SAWYER Uh-uh, no way. Not a chance.
HURLEY Come on, I can help. They're my friends, too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?
SAWYER For God's sake, Hugo, look at you. You're just gonna get in the way. You want to get us killed? Come on.
BEN If we head North, we should get to 'em before they reach the tower.
ALEX Why did you let me come?
BEN I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex.
ALEX You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.
BEN I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.
ALEX Ben. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave?
BEN Because I can't, Alex.
VOICE Don't, John.
WALT Put the gun down.
LOCKE Walt!
WALT Now get up, John.
LOCKE He shot me and I can't... move my legs.
WALT You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John.
LOCKE Why?
WALT Because... you have work to do.
JACK You OK?
KATE Yeah, I just... got a rock in my shoe.
JACK He didn't mean it, you know.
KATE What?
JACK Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.
KATE He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?
JACK He was trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.
KATE Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer? He'd never do it for you.
JACK Because I love you.
VOICEMAIL You have reached three one zero five five five zero...
DIRECTOR Can I help you?
JACK Sorry, I, er... Actually, I came, er... Is the funeral over?
DIRECTOR There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing. Nobody showed up.
JACK Nobody? You sure?
DIRECTOR Just you. My deepest condolences. Friend or family?
JACK Neither.
DIRECTOR Would you like me to open it up?
JACK No... no.
DIRECTOR Take your time.
JACK Damn it.
JACK Danielle. How much further?
ROUSSEAU About an hour.
JACK The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?
ROUSSEAU The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.
JACK What?
ROUSSEAU There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.
BEN Hello, Jack. We need to talk.
GRETA What did Ben say?
BONNIE Can we kill him?
MIKHAIL Is it possible to turn this equipment off?
BONNIE What?
MIKHAIL The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?
GRETA Sure. Ben gave us the code.
MIKHAIL You are the only ones who have it?
BONNIE Yeah. Why?
MIKHAIL What would happen if this station were to be flooded?
GRETA Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.
MIKHAIL Then why do you need to be here?
BONNIE Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.
MIKHAIL And you never asked why?
BONNIE No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.
MIKHAIL She makes an excellent point.
BONNIE No, please.
MIKHAIL I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.
DESMOND Hey!
CHARLIE No, Des, no, don't! We need her.
BEN Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...
JACK Don't talk to him! What do you want?
BEN Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.
JACK For what?
BEN Jack, you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.
JACK He alone?
KATE There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.
JACK Five minutes.
PHARMACIST I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.
JACK Ah, that's a mistake. I, uh, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?
PHARMACIST I did check it again, Dr. Shephard, and that was the third refill, so there's nothing I can do.
JACK Fine. I've got another prescription right here.
MAN Hey, I know you. You're the hero.
JACK I'm not a hero.
MAN Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?
JACK Here it is, here. Oxycodone.
PHARMACIST Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.
JACK That's not me, that's Dr. Christian Shephard, I'm Dr. Jack Shephard, he's my father.
PHARMACIST I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.
JACK He's out of town right now.
PHARMACIST Well, I'm sure somebody in the office—
JACK Don't bother.
BEN Have a seat.
BEN Not so long ago, Jack, I made a decision, that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day. I'm telling you this because... history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.
JACK Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say, you're gonna... you're gonna kill all my people.
BEN No Jack, you are.
JACK And how am I going to do that, Ben?
BEN The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.
JACK She's not, huh?
BEN No, she's not.
JACK Then who is she?
BEN She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.
JACK Oh, I almost forgot, you're the... you're the good guys.
BEN Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.
JACK I'm not going anywhere.
BEN May I have my walkie back?
JACK What?
BEN There's something you need to hear. Please.
BEN Thank you. Tom, are you there?
TOM Yeah, I'm here.
BEN Your plan killed seven of my people, but the ones that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.
SAYID Jack, don't give him anything!
BERNARD Leave him alone!
RYAN I said shut up!!
JACK And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?
BEN Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.
TOM Got it.
RYAN I said don't move!!
BEN Bring me the phone, Jack.
SAYID Don't negotiate with him—
TOM Gag him.
JIN No!
BEN Forty seconds.
JACK No. I'm getting them all off the Island. ALL OF THEM!
BEN Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's 20 seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.
JACK No.
BEN Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
JACK No.
BEN I'm not bluffing!
JACK I WON'T DO IT!!!
BEN Five. Four. Three...
JACK No.
BEN I'm so sorry, Jack.
JACK Tom. Are you there?
TOM Yeah, Jack, I hear you.
JACK I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get 'em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill you.
CHARLIE What's the code?
BONNIE Go away.
CHARLIE Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?
DESMOND She's not gonna tell you, brother.
CHARLIE Yeah she's gonna tell me.
DESMOND What makes you say that?
CHARLIE Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?
BONNIE Five, four, five...
CHARLIE What?
BONNIE Eight, seven, sev-...
CHARLIE Is that the code?
BONNIE Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...
CHARLIE Start again.
BONNIE Six, one.
CHARLIE Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again. Start again.
BONNIE "Good Vibrations."
CHARLIE What?
BONNIE Beach Boys. "Good Vibrations." On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.
JACK Tie him up. He's coming with us.
ALEX What?
BEN Alex. This is your mother.
ROUSSEAU I'll help you tie him up.
KATE What happened? What'd he say?
JACK It's not important right now. Just, get everything together—
KATE Jack. Your knuckles. Here.
KATE What happened?
JACK He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid that we would keep moving.
KATE So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?
JACK Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know... that he failed. And then I'll kill him.
RYAN It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.
TOM Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean, look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.
SAWYER All they got left is three guys and four guns.
JULIET And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.
SAWYER So we'll wait 'til night.
JULIET That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed. If you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go, I can try—
SAWYER Shh! You hear that?
MALE OTHER RYAN!
HURLEY Woo!
SAWYER Stay in the bus, Hugo.
JULIET Stay right there, Tom.
TOM OK. I give up.
SAWYER That's for taking the kid off the raft.
HURLEY Dude, it was over, he surrendered.
SAWYER I didn't believe him.
DR. HAMILL What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?
JACK I was just, uh... I was just checking the, uh, the Arland charts. Just wanted to... just wanted to see how the operation went.
DR. HAMILL I left three messages on your voicemail, you didn't get them?
JACK My phone's broken.
DR. HAMILL Let's go to my office, Jack.
JACK For what?
DR. HAMILL We need to have a talk. Come on.
JACK You know, I know that you're... you're new around here, so you don't know much about—
DR. HAMILL I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office—
JACK If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.
DR. HAMILL Will you excuse us, please?
DR. HAMILL Mrs. Arlene, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.
JACK That's... that's great.
DR. HAMILL But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw a man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?
JACK Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?
DR. HAMILL How much have you had to drink today, Jack?
JACK OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me! Don't you look at me like that. Don't you... pity me.
DR. HAMILL I'm trying to help you.
JACK YOU CAN'T HELP ME!
HURLEY Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...
JACK Hurley?
HURLEY Jack?
JACK Where are you, what's going on?
HURLEY Dude. I'm back at the beach.
JACK What?
HURLEY Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer. I, I saved them.
JACK They're OK, Juliet and—
HURLEY Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all—
JACK What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!
HURLEY Yeah, dude, I told you, I saved 'em all.
JACK Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.
HURLEY Yeah, I got ya, we'll stay put until you, like, phone home.
CLAIRE What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?
HURLEY Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.
CHARLIE Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?
DESMOND Aye. There's plenty.
CHARLIE Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."
DESMOND All right, mate.
CHARLIE Hey, Des.
DESMOND Aye?
CHARLIE You get any flashes?
DESMOND No, nothing.
CHARLIE Meet you back here then.
DESMOND Aye.
CHARLIE So much for fate.

DESMOND Penny!!! NO!
DESMOND Charlie!!!
CLAIRE Shhh. Hey Aaron, it's OK, sweetie.
NAOMI What's the matter?
CLAIRE I dunno, I think he's just a bit scared.
NAOMI Hard to blame him.
CLAIRE What is it?
NAOMI What's your boyfriend's name? The rock star who swam down to the station?
CLAIRE Charlie, why?
NAOMI Charlie just got us rescued.
NAOMI Jack!! Jack, he did it!! Your friend bloody well did it!
JACK What?
NAOMI The green light, it's on. The jamming's stopped.
JACK Use it then.

VOICE Four, four, two..
FEMALE VOICE 
NAOMI What's this?
JACK It's Rousseau's message, it's still blocking the signal.
ROUSSEAU It doesn't matter. We're here.
VOICE Iteration one, seven, five...
ROUSSEAU I recorded this 16 years ago. Three days before you were born. I guess we don't need it anymore.
JACK All right, do it.
NAOMI I can't get a signal in here.
NAOMI I'm getting something!
KATE It's gonna work! It's happening, we're gonna get off of this Island!
JACK We'll celebrate when we're home.
BEN Jack! I know you think you're saving your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.
JACK The mistake was listening to you.
BEN This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.
NAOMI I've got it, I've got a signal!!!
BEN Jack, please, you don't know what you're doing!!
JACK I know exactly what I'm doing.
JACK JOHN!!!
LOCKE Step back, Jack.
JACK What did you do?
LOCKE What I had to. Now step back.
LOCKE Stay away from the phone.
JACK What are you doing, John?
LOCKE I don't wanna shoot you.
BEN Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do—
LOCKE Please. Put the phone down.
JACK No. You're done keeping me on this Island.
LOCKE I will kill you if I have to.
JACK Then do it, John.
KATE Jack.
LOCKE Jack. You're not supposed to do this.
MAN Minkowski. Hello?
JACK Who is this?
MINKOWSKI Who is this?
JACK My name is Jack Shephard. Are you, are you on the boat, the freighter?
MINKOWSKI How'd you get this channel?
JACK Naomi, Naomi told us about your search team. About the boat.
MINKOWSKI Naomi. You found her? Where is she? Who are you?
JACK I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location?
MINKOWSKI Hell yeah we can. Sit tight. We'll be right there.
VOICE Hello.
JACK Hello? It's me. Whoa whoa, wait, don't, don't hang up, please. I know what you said, I just... I just need to see you, please? Yeah, yeah, out at the airport. You know where. Thank you.
KATE Hey.
JACK Hey.
KATE Saw you on the news. Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?
JACK Old habits.
KATE You look terrible.
JACK Thanks.
KATE Why did you call me, Jack?
JACK I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.
KATE Why would I go to the funeral?
JACK I've been flying a lot.
KATE What?
JACK Yeah, that golden pass that they gave us—I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I... fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney. And then I... I get off, and I... have a drink, and then I fly home.
KATE Why?
JACK Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on board. Every little bump we hit, or turbulence, I mean, I... I actually close my eyes, and I pray that I can get back.
KATE This is not gonna change.
JACK No, I'm sick of lying! We made a mistake.
KATE I have to go. He's gonna be wondering where I am—
JACK We were not supposed to leave.
KATE Yes, we were.
KATE Goodbye, Jack.
JACK We have to go back, Kate.
JACK We have to go back!
