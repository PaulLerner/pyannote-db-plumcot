hugo_reyes Dude, they'll find out.
dr_jack_shephard Not if we stick to the story.
sayid_jarrah I don't know, Jack. It could be a risk.
dr_jack_shephard It's the only way. We have to do this.
frank_lapidus They're still at it, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Look, we're running out of time. We gotta make a decision now. So are we all okay with this?
sayid_jarrah This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives. I'm not taking it lightly.
dr_jack_shephard Kate?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Sun?
dr_jack_shephard Frank?
frank_lapidus What?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry you got dragged into this, but we need to know that you're with us.
frank_lapidus Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, what about you?
hugo_reyes I don't think we should lie, dude.
dr_jack_shephard We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
hugo_reyes How does lying protect them?
dr_jack_shephard It protects them from Charles Widmore. The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us. He faked a plane crash. I mean, you think telling him the truth, he's just gonna—he's gonna leave them alone?
hugo_reyes Look, he's your dad, right? Can't you just, like... call him off?
penelope_widmore There's no calling my father off.
hugo_reyes But he'll never find them. I mean, the Island disappeared. We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!
dr_jack_shephard You think anyone's gonna believe that... believe any of it? They're gonna think you're crazy.
hugo_reyes Not if someone backs me up. Sayid, come on. They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth. But what if we all do? And if we can stick together, we can make 'em believe us. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying. Do you?
sayid_jarrah No. But... I don't believe we have a better choice.
sayid_jarrah Sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
hugo_reyes You know what, dude? I'm gonna remember this. And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now... you're not gettin' it.
hugo_reyes Wake up, Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, wake up! Sayid!
hugo_reyes No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!
hugo_reyes What am I supposed to do?!
hugo_reyes Okay, okay, okay. Just stay calm.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA What the hell were you thinking?
hugo_reyes Ana Lucia?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You were driving like a maniac. And why'd you pull over?
hugo_reyes I just... I—I thought—
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA You didn't think. What if I were real? What if a real cop stopped you? They already have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
hugo_reyes Actually, it's ketchup. We went to a—a drive-thru, and, uh...
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Well, you need to pull it together. You've got a lot of work to do.
hugo_reyes I do?
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Let's start with the basics. First off, you need new clothes. Then you need to go to a safe place. And take Sayid to somebody you trust. You getting all this?
hugo_reyes Yeah.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Then get to it. And stay away from the cops.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Do not get arrested.
hugo_reyes Thanks, Ana Lucia.
ana_lucia_cortez LUCIA Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.
hugo_reyes Well... you heard her.
rose_nadler You really think that thing's gonna work?
bernard_nadler Rose, I told you a hundred times. Of course it's gonna work. Yes. I worked hard on it. It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
rose_nadler Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do, is rub—
bernard_nadler Yeah? Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?
rose_nadler Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside. That's gonna smother the leaves.
bernard_nadler Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.
neil_ Fire? Who cares about fire? Any minute the sky could light up, and who the hell knows what could happen this time?
rose_nadler Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control. You are either gonna help or be quiet!
james_ford Whose shirt is this?
neil_ It's mine.
james_ford Can I have it?
neil_ What does it matter? We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
james_ford I'll take that as a "yes," Frogurt.
neil_ It's Neil.
james_ford Yeah, yeah.
james_ford Still in one piece?
dr_juliet_burke As far as I can tell.
james_ford I figured it would've disappeared with the rest of our stuff.
dr_juliet_burke I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
james_ford What?
dr_juliet_burke Look who's back.
james_ford Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
miles_straume I think it's Mr. Wizard.
james_ford Shut up. You've been gone for two hours. What the hell were you doing?
dr_daniel_faraday Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I... left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back I—I—I just—it was a while before I realized that I was just... uh, I was really lost.
james_ford Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know.
james_ford Well, you at least got a plan?
dr_juliet_burke I think we should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
dr_daniel_faraday No. No, no, no. We can't just sail out on any course. For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, and, uh, to do that...
dr_daniel_faraday ...I need to determine where we are now... in time.
dr_charlotte_lewis And what are the rest of us supposed to do?
miles_straume I'm gonna go find us something to eat.
dr_juliet_burke And how are you planning on doing that?
miles_straume Don't worry about it.
dr_juliet_burke I guess we'll get the water.
hugo_reyes Dude, wake up! Come on. I can't do this on my own!
hugo_reyes I promise I'll pay you back.
hugo_reyes Wait right here.

aaron Mommy, where are we going?
kate_austen To see a friend.
ben_linus You looking for your pills, Jack? I flushed them down the toilet.
dr_jack_shephard Thank you. I was just gonna do that myself.
ben_linus Yeah, I figured you were.
dr_jack_shephard Going somewhere?
ben_linus I'm checking out.
dr_jack_shephard Where are we going?
ben_linus You're going home. And find yourself a suitcase. If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there... because you're never coming back.
dr_jack_shephard Good.
ben_linus Good. I'll pick you up in six hours.
dr_jack_shephard And where will you be going?

WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 1 Yeah.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 2 I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work Stage 3.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 She's hit!
david_reyes Hmm.
hugo_reyes Hey, Dad. How's it going?
hugo_reyes You seen the news?
david_reyes No. I just got up. Why, are you wanted again?
hugo_reyes Uh, yeah. Kinda. Is Mom here?
david_reyes No, she's out shopping. Hey, set him over there. Oh, man, he's out.
hugo_reyes Is he... breathing?
david_reyes Barely. What happened?
hugo_reyes He got shot by a dart.
david_reyes Dart? What, were you in the zoo or something?
hugo_reyes No, we were at the safe house.
david_reyes Safe house?
hugo_reyes Sayid took me there to protect me. Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts, and now he's—he's in a coma or something.
david_reyes Hugo, this doesn't make sense. And what are you doing out of the mental institution?
hugo_reyes Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. We both are.
david_reyes Danger from who?
hugo_reyes I'm not sure exactly.
david_reyes Hello?
detective Mr. and Mrs. Reyes? L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?
david_reyes Just what kind of trouble are you in?
hugo_reyes Dad, please! Just don't tell 'em I'm here!
david_reyes All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.
detective Well, give us a call if you hear anything. We really appreciate it.
david_reyes Thanks, bye-bye. I'll have to tell him.
david_reyes You killed three people?
hugo_reyes No. Sayid did.
david_reyes Oh. Well, that's better. Come on. Let's get him to the couch.
hugo_reyes He saved me.
david_reyes I think we should call a lawyer—right now.
hugo_reyes No, no, no. We can't go public. They're after us.
david_reyes Who? Who is after you?
hugo_reyes I don't know. Sayid knows. He can explain.
david_reyes Sayid ain't explaining nothing. We need to get him to a hospital.
hugo_reyes Did you not hear me? People are trying to kill us. We go to a hospital, they'll find us! Like—like The Godfather. It's the last place you go. Everyone knows it. Wh—they—they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident. Sayid, please wake up!
david_reyes That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.
hugo_reyes I think I know what to do.
aaron Mommy, Mommy, can I push the button?
kate_austen Sure you can, sweetie. But we're all the way to the top, okay?
kate_austen So I want you to press number 3-1. You see it? You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.
kate_austen Yeah! That's the one! You pressed it! You pressed it!
kate_austen Hi.
sunhwa_kwon Hello, Kate.
jill Have a nice day. I'll be right with you.
jill Hello, Ben. If it's the Porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
ben_linus No, no Porterhouse. I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me.
jill Is it what I think it is?
ben_linus It is.
jill He'll be safe with me.
ben_linus Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
jill Yeah. Everything's moving right on schedule. How's it going with Shephard?
ben_linus He's with us.
jill Really? What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?
ben_linus Cut the man some slack. He's been through a lot. We all have.
jill Right. Of course. Sorry.
ben_linus So keep him safe, Jill. Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all.
rose_nadler Aah! Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it! You got it. You got it.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 All right! Finally we got...
rose_nadler Why did you do that?
bernard_nadler Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.
neil_ I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.
rose_nadler And I thought you said you didn't care.
neil_ I care about surviving.
rose_nadler I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.
rose_nadler You'll get it, Bernard. You will.
bernard_nadler Yeah. All right.
rose_nadler Just—just try again.
dr_charlotte_lewis Hey.
dr_daniel_faraday Hey. Give me one second.
dr_charlotte_lewis I got you something.
dr_daniel_faraday Ooh. Hey.
dr_charlotte_lewis I found these in the jungle.
dr_daniel_faraday Look at that. Thank you.
dr_charlotte_lewis There was only two, but I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.
dr_daniel_faraday Thank you very much, very much.
dr_daniel_faraday You all right?
dr_charlotte_lewis I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.
dr_daniel_faraday Well... I'm sure it'll pass.
dr_charlotte_lewis No, it's not just that. It's the weirdest thing. Earlier, I was... I was thinking about my mom, and all of sudden, I—I couldn't remember her maiden name. I mean, isn't that odd?
dr_daniel_faraday Don't worry about it. Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress. Okay?
dr_charlotte_lewis Daniel... do you know what's happening to me?
miles_straume Dinner!
bernard_nadler That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?
miles_straume I found it.
james_ford What do you mean you "found" it?
miles_straume It died in the jungle. I found it. Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.
MALESURVIVOR#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 What?
miles_straume Who's got a knife?
neil_ A knife? You need a knife? Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
miles_straume What's your problem?
neil_ My problem is, we don't have a knife. W—we don't have anything. And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 'cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.
james_ford Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.
neil_ It's Neil, you inbred!
neil_ And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed! We're all screwed!
dr_juliet_burke Calm down, Neil. We're gonna get through this.
neil_ How are any of us gonna get through this?! Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!
neil_ Aah!
james_ford Run!
james_ford Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!
dr_charlotte_lewis Ow! Dan!
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 Keep moving!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 Aah! Uhh!
ANOTHER#unknown#Lost.Season05.Episode02 MAN Uhh! Uhh!
james_ford Come on. He's dead.
dr_juliet_burke No!
james_ford Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!
james_ford There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!
hugo_reyes Dude, they're on a stakeout?
david_reyes You just escaped from a mental institution. There's dead bodies everywhere! Of course they're on a stakeout! They think you're crazy enough to come back home. S—so are you... crazy?
hugo_reyes Do you think I am?
david_reyes Well, either that or you're lying to me.
hugo_reyes I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
david_reyes W—well, what is it?
carmen_reyes Why there is a dead Pakistani on my couch?!
hugo_reyes He's not dead, Ma.
carmen_reyes Well, he's not breathing.
hugo_reyes He's not?!
david_reyes It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.
carmen_reyes A plan? What are you talking about?
hugo_reyes He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.
carmen_reyes Hugo, what's happening?
hugo_reyes Mom, please!
carmen_reyes No "Mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news? Do you know what they are telling about you?
hugo_reyes Yeah, Mom. I know. Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.
carmen_reyes It better!
david_reyes Officers.
kate_austen So how long are you in L.A.?
sunhwa_kwon Just a few days. I have some business to attend to. But I wanted to see you.
sunhwa_kwon Here it is. Her name's Ji Yeon. Here's a baby picture.
kate_austen Oh! She's beautiful.
sunhwa_kwon Thank you. She's with her grandmother in Seoul. I hope someday you get to meet her. It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
kate_austen Yeah.
sunhwa_kwon Kate? Are you all right?
kate_austen Yeah. I'm fine.
sunhwa_kwon Are you?
kate_austen Somebody knows we're lying.
sunhwa_kwon What?
kate_austen Some lawyers came to see me.
sunhwa_kwon Who?
kate_austen Two men. They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample. Some kind of lawsuit. They wanted to test to see if... to see if Aaron's my son.
sunhwa_kwon Who did these lawyers represent?
kate_austen I don't know. They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
sunhwa_kwon Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
kate_austen How do you know?
sunhwa_kwon Because if they were, they would just do it. They wouldn't come to you in private. They don't care that we're lying. They just want Aaron.
kate_austen But who... who would do that? We—
sunhwa_kwon I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
kate_austen What do you mean, "take care of them"?
sunhwa_kwon Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
kate_austen What kind of a person do you think I am?
sunhwa_kwon Jin! Jin!
sunhwa_kwon The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
kate_austen You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin.
sunhwa_kwon Like you did on the freighter. You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
dr_jack_shephard We gotta get outta here!
kate_austen Sun, I hope you don't think...
sunhwa_kwon But you did what you had to do. And if you hadn't... we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
kate_austen I...
sunhwa_kwon I don't blame you.
sunhwa_kwon So... How's Jack?
david_reyes Hugo said I could trust you. I wasn't so sure. But he swore I could, so... can I?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. Of course.
david_reyes All right.
dr_jack_shephard What happened to him?
david_reyes Hugo said he got hit with some dart. Must've been some drugs or something.
dr_jack_shephard And where is Hurley right now?
david_reyes At our house, freaking out.
dr_jack_shephard Let me get my car. Help me move him over. I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.
david_reyes No. No, H—Hugo said that whoever did this—they'll come back after him.
dr_jack_shephard All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, so I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.
david_reyes All right, fine. Take him to the hospital. But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shephard, when this is over, you're gonna do something for me.
dr_jack_shephard What?
david_reyes Stay away from Hugo. Whatever it is you talked him into, something tells me you don't have his best interests at heart. So stay away from my son.
ben_linus Hello?
dr_jack_shephard Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
ben_linus Who?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid.
carmen_reyes Who is Sayid? I thought he was your friend.
hugo_reyes He is my friend... but he's also got this double life where he does crazy Ninja moves and spy stuff. But he's a good guy.
carmen_reyes A good guy doesn't kill three men. A good guy doesn't kill any men.
hugo_reyes Mom—
carmen_reyes Don't "mom" me. You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
carmen_reyes The news thinks you did this. And if the news does, everyone does. Why is this happening? How can anybody want to hurt you?
hugo_reyes I don't know.
carmen_reyes Tell your mother the truth.
hugo_reyes We lied, Ma!
carmen_reyes What do you mean you lied?
hugo_reyes All of us—the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
carmen_reyes And what did happen?
hugo_reyes Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true. But the re...
hugo_reyes But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.
carmen_reyes I believe you. I don't understand you, but I believe you.
hugo_reyes A lot of people died, ma. And now this bad stuff is happening because... well, um... we shouldn't have lied.
james_ford Ow!
dr_juliet_burke You okay?
james_ford Yeah, I'm fine. I just stepped on something. Something jammed...!
james_ford Son of a bitch.
james_ford We should keep moving. We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
dr_juliet_burke It's a long creek, James. Which part?
james_ford I don't know—the wet part. Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan—

james_ford Who were those people? Are they yours? Did they shoot the arrows?
dr_juliet_burke You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?
james_ford You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying to—
dr_juliet_burke Aah!

sayid_jarrah Does anyone else know he's there?

ben_linus Hello, Hugo.
hugo_reyes Aah!
hugo_reyes Get away from me. Get away!
ben_linus Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything.
ben_linus I have a car waiting for us out back. The police didn't see me come in. I can get you out of here.
hugo_reyes No way, dude. Sayid warned me about you.
ben_linus I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack. That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me. How else would I know that they're together?
hugo_reyes No. You're—you're playing one of your mind games. They would never trust you.
ben_linus In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust. But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
hugo_reyes And what's that?
ben_linus To go back to the Island. Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over. You can stop hiding. You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions. If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again.
ben_linus Please. Let me help you.
hugo_reyes Never, dude.
hugo_reyes Hey! Hey, you got me! That's right, you got me! That's right! I'm the killer!
detective Stop! Police! Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees!
hugo_reyes I'm the killer. I'm crazy. I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people. However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them.
hugo_reyes I killed them all. J—just—just get me away from here.
