MAN Come on! Dammit, push!
WOMAN Something's wrong! I can't...oh...
MAN Emily! You can do this! Now push, come on! Come on, baby. You can do it, now come on.
MAN Come on, there you go. Come on.
MAN It's a boy! You did it.
EMILY It hurts.
MAN Oh...
EMILY Roger, it hurts.
ROGER Emily, no one knows we're out here. We gotta get back, okay, honey? Can you hold on to the baby? Emily! Can you hold the baby? Hold him tight.
ROGER Help. Help! Help!
ROGER Oh my God, help me.
MALE DRIVER Hey, what happened, man?
ROGER We were hiking. She went into labor and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.
MALE DRIVER Okay, okay, look, we'll put her in the car, okay? Let me get you to the hospital.
ROGER Oh, okay, okay, honey.
MALE DRIVER Okay, it's all right. Let's keep her warm, all right? How's the baby?
ROGER Fine, I guess—I don't know.
EMILY Roger? Roger.
ROGER I'm right here.
EMILY Call him Benjamin.
ROGER Stay with me. Stay with me. Emily! Emily! Emily! Oh God, no!
RICHARD What you got there?
BEN It's a birthday present. Mine just happens to be today. You do remember birthdays, don't you Richard?
RICHARD So do you want me to bring the tape back to Juliet?
BEN What?
RICHARD The tape with your instructions for Juliet, do you want me to bring it back to the medical station?
BEN I recorded it yesterday, before we left. I thought you already took it!
RICHARD No.
BEN Where's Tom? Tom! Have you seen my recorder?
LOCKE You said that if I killed my father, you'd tell me everything I wanted to know about the Island.
LOCKE So why don't you start at the beginning?
BEN I know I promised to tell you everything, John, and I wish it was as simple as me taking out a dusty old book and opening it up.
BEN But it's not that simple.
LOCKE How about you just tell me?
BEN You probably think I'm the leader of this little community, but that's not entirely true. We all answer to someone, John.
LOCKE And whom might that be?
BEN His name is Jacob.
LOCKE Okay, then. Take me to Jacob.
BEN I can't do that.
BEN Where are you going?
LOCKE Hell, Ben, if you don't wanna take me, maybe someone else will. I'll just go and ask Richard...
BEN Why would Richard take you? He doesn't know where Jacob is. He doesn't talk to Jacob...
LOCKE Well, who talks to him?
BEN I do.
LOCKE So you're the only one who talks to him?
BEN That's right!
LOCKE And no one else knows where he is?
BEN I was born here on this Island. I'm one of the last that was. Most of these people you see—I brought them here. So Jacob talks to me, John. He tells me what to do, trusts me.
LOCKE And no one else has ever seen him?
BEN That's right.
LOCKE How convenient. You know what I think, Ben? I think there is no Jacob. I think your people are idiots if they believe you take orders from someone else. You are the man behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz. And you're a liar.
BEN And what might you base that theory on, John?
LOCKE Because if you were telling the truth, your hand wouldn't be shaking.
WOMAN Namaste!
ROGER Thanks.
WOMAN Namaste!
MALE DRIVER Hey, welcome to the Island, man! Namaste.
ROGER Namaste, yeah!
MALE DRIVER So, what do ya think?
ROGER Wow, this is...some place. Thanks again for the opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.
MR. GOODSPEED Horace! Please.
ROGER Horace.
HORACE And this must be Ben.
ROGER Yeah. Mr. Goodspeed was there the day you were born.
HORACE Yes, I was.
ROGER He's doing us a big favor here. Gave your old man a job. Ah, he don't say much.
HORACE That's okay. I bet he will when he has something to say. Right, Ben? Hey, you hungry, kiddo? Huh, huh? Great. Well, I'll tell you what. After you're done processing, we'll have some lunch. How's that sound?
ROGER Yeah, thank you.
HORACE You're gonna love it here.
MARVIN Welcome to the Island. For your own comfort and safety, we ask that you stay within the confines of your new living quarters. Our Barracks are surrounded by a high frequency sonar fence, to protect us from the Island's abundant and diverse wildlife. You are now a member of the DHARMA Initiative...
ROGER What kind of wildlife you think this fence is protecting us from?
MAN Roger Linus? Roger Linus?
ROGER Yeah.
MARVIN ...Every morning you will be given a new code which will allow you to cross outside the fences if you so desire... there are properties on this Island that exist nowhere else on Earth. Our mission is to study these properties for the betterment of mankind and advancement of world peace. Most of you will be working on the mainland. Should you be assigned zoological studies, the Pala Ferry will carry you to and from the Hydra 3 times a day...
GIRL Hey. You're new, huh?
GIRL I'm Annie. Want one?
ANNIE We can have as many as we want.
ROGER Work man? What is this? Work man? I'm a janitor?!
OPAL I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.
ROGER Goodspeed told me you people were doing experiments, changing the world. I didn't come here to clean up after ya!
OPAL Look, if anything else opens up, you can feel free to apply for it.
ROGER Come on.
CHARLIE I think he'll grow out of it.
CLAIRE You don't think it's too big?
HURLEY Dude, you know what I'm saying? It can't be worse than haggis.
DESMOND Oh I dunno, I could murder some haggis right now.
SAWYER Hey! Sayid!
SAYID What happened to you?
SAWYER I was with Locke.
SAYID Well, where is he?
SAWYER He went back.
SAYID Back where?
SAWYER With them. Don't ask me where the hell it is, 'cause it don't matter right now. What does matter , is this.
MIKHAIL Where is Ben?! Where is he?!
BEN I thought you were dead.
MIKHAIL I'm fortunate the pylons were not set to a lethal level.
MIKHAIL What is he doing here?
BEN It's all right.
MIKHAIL He's the one who tried to kill me!
BEN He's with us now. Where have you been, Mikhail?
MIKHAIL I encountered several of his people in the jungle. They had an injured woman with them. Apparently, she had just parachuted onto the Island.
BEN What?!
MIKHAIL Her helo crashed into water. She says her ship is approximately 130 clicks to the west of us. She has a radio telephone.
BEN Where is she now?
MIKHAIL I assume they have taken her back to their camp.
BEN We'll be visiting their camp day after tomorrow. We'll take care of it then.
MIKHAIL Day after tomorrow? We have to go now!
LOCKE Ben's not going anywhere with you.
MIKHAIL Excuse me?
LOCKE He and I are going to see Jacob.
MIKHAIL Please tell me this isn't true, Benjamin.
BEN I'm sorry, I have to deal with this now, John. Our excursion will have to wait.
MIKHAIL Since when do you explain yourself to him? An outsider-
BEN Tom? Richard?
LOCKE So when do we leave?
BEN You know, you didn't have to beat Mikhail senseless to make your point, John.
LOCKE Yes, I did.
ALEX Locke.
ALEX I hear you're gonna go see Jacob. You're gonna need this.
LOCKE Thanks.
ALEX Happy birthday, Dad.
OLIVIA So, once water is added to the bicarbonate, we will get our very own volcanic reaction.
OLIVIA Yes?
ANNIE Is that what happened to the volcano on this Island?
OLIVIA Exactly Annie, but that was a long time ago. Okay! Let's get ourselves an eruption.
OLIVIA Just add water, and...voilà. Now I know it's not lava, but—
OLIVIA Okay, everyone into your positions! That's right, all together. Annie, lock the back door please!
OLIVIA Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move. Ben!
ANNIE Come on!
ANNIE Don't worry. It's just the Hostiles. We'll be okay.
HORACE Hey, man, heard you ran into a little trouble.
ROGER We're driving back from the Flame and we hear this huge explosion. Next thing I know, there's a siren wailing, and we're driving through the middle of a shootout.
HORACE Look, we're having some skirmishes with the natives.
ROGER What do you mean, "natives"?
HORACE Well, we're not exactly sure who they are.
ROGER Oh, this ain't what I signed up for!
HORACE Roger, I did you a favor, man. You were having trouble finding work. And don't forget about Ben—he's getting a quality education here.
ROGER I don't give a damn about his education! If I'm gonna get shot at, I want hazard pay! I want another thirty grand.
HORACE Calm down, man.
ROGER And don't try to tell me you don't have it, you hear me?!
ROGER All right, get the hell out of my house!
ROGER I thought I told you to go to bed.
SAYID She's not here.
SAWYER I noticed.
KATE What are you doing?
SAYID Looking for Juliet.
KATE Well, you're not gonna find her in there. She left with Jack.
SAYID Juliet left with Jack?
KATE He took off right after I told him about Naomi.
SAWYER Who's Naomi?
SAYID And why would you do that, Kate?
KATE Because she's hurt, because he's a doctor, and because he has a right to know.
SAYID Where is he now?
KATE I dunno, Sayid.
SAYID Of course you don't.
KATE You know, it might be time for you to tell everybody else about Naomi, too.
SAYID Play her the tape!
KATE What tape?
BEN Something you should know, John, before we go. Whether or not you think he's the Wizard of Oz, I can assure you that Jacob is very, very real. And we're gonna go see him, and he's not gonna like it. In fact, I have a feeling he's going to be very...angry. And that's why my hand was shaking, because this is not a man you go and see. This is a man who summons you.
LOCKE Well, I guess there's a first time for everything.
ANNIE It's us. That's you and that's me. Now we never have to be away from each other. Happy birthday, Ben.
BEN Thanks.
ANNIE You're welcome.
ROGER Wow... It's your birthday. Sorry I forgot. Kinda hard to celebrate on the day you killed your mom. She was just seven months pregnant. We went for a hike, but you had to come early. Now, she's gone. And I'm stuck here on this island...with you. Happy birthday, Ben.
BEN Mom?
EMILY Ben, don't!
BEN Mom!
EMILY It's not time yet, Benjamin.
BEN Mom!
BEN Let's go, John. John!
CLAIRE So, what, the whole world thinks we're dead?
SAYID That's not important right now.
SUN Not important?!
CLAIRE What do you mean it's not important, Sayid?
NAOMI Excuse me. I'm sorry, don't you people want to be rescued?
SAYID We kept her a secret to keep her safe.
KATE Safe from what, Sayid?
SAYID Safe from Jack. He spent a week with the Others, and he brought one of them back with him. Here, amongst us. And every time we try to get answers from this woman, he prevents her from giving them.
SUN But it's Jack! He would never do anything to hurt us. And Juliet? I believe she's a good person.
SAWYER Good person, huh? You basing that on what? Wouldn't involve her taking you to one of their medical stations would it now, Mrs. Kwon?
SUN How—
JULIET Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband, he was sterile before they got here.
JIN 무슨 일이야?
JULIET I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
JACK Where'd you get that?
SAYID Where have you been, Jack?
JACK I asked you where you got it.
SAWYER You really think you're in a position to be asking us questions?
JULIET Turn the tape over.
SAWYER Stay out of it.
JULIET You wanna burn me at the stake, here I am, but first, turn the tape over, press play.
BEN Juliet, it's Ben. I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon the night after tomorrow. We won't have time to run Austen's sample, so if you determine that she or anyone else is pregnant, mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. Good luck.
JULIET The night I saw your baby on the ultrasound, I told Jack what they were making me do.
SAYID Why didn't you tell us?
JACK Because I hadn't decided what to do about it yet.
SAYID "Yet"?
JACK I think we've got some catching up to do.
BEN Mom..? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom!
RICHARD Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, I didn't mean to scare you. Wait, wait! Are you lost? Wait!
BEN Are you one of them?
RICHARD One of whom?
BEN A hostile.
RICHARD Do you even know what that word means? What's your name?
BEN Ben.
RICHARD Ben? So you wanna tell me what you're doing in the middle of the jungle all by yourself?
BEN I left home, and...I'm looking for my Mom.
RICHARD You think she's out here?
BEN You wouldn't believe me.
RICHARD Try me.
BEN She's dead.
RICHARD Did she die here, on the Island?
BEN No. When I was a baby.
RICHARD Did you see her, out here, Ben, in the jungle?
BEN She talked to me.
RICHARD What did she say?
BEN That I couldn't come with her. She said it wasn't time yet.
RICHARD You should go home now, your people will be looking for you.
BEN I don't want to go back there! I hate it there! Take me with you.
RICHARD Maybe that can happen, maybe. But if that's what you really want, Ben, if that's what you want, I want you to really think about that. And you're gonna have to be very, very patient.
BEN We're here.
BEN You'll wanna turn off your flashlight, John.
LOCKE Why?
BEN Jacob feels the same way about technology as you do.
BEN Once I open this door, there's no turning back. You sure this is what you want?
BEN So be it. Jacob? I'm here with John Locke. We're coming in now.
BEN Jacob. This is John. Aren't you going to say hello, John?
LOCKE What?
BEN I told you he wouldn't.
LOCKE Who—what are you talking about?
BEN You can't see him?
LOCKE See who?
BEN Jacob! He's sitting right here, in this chair! Yes, I know, but he insisted.
LOCKE What is this?
BEN You wanted the secrets of the Island? Well, here they are. This is the man who can answer every single- I am not. He made me bring him here—do you think that that was my—sorry, may I finish?
LOCKE You're crazy.
BEN Excuse me?
LOCKE You don't know anything about the Island, do ya? You just...made it all up.
BEN Jacob, please, I can't hear him if you're gonna talk over what he's saying—
LOCKE Stop. Stop. Shut up! You're putting on a show for me? Or do you...do you really think there's someone there?
BEN I know there's someone there!
LOCKE You don't know anything.
BEN I'm sorry you feel that way, John. And I'm sorry that you're too limited to see.
LOCKE You're pathetic.
VOICE Help me.
LOCKE What did you just say?
BEN I—I didn't say anything.
LOCKE Oh yes you did. I heard you, you said...
BEN That's enough, you've had your fun!
LOCKE What was that?
BEN That was Jacob.
BEN What did you hear in there, John? What did Jacob say to you?
LOCKE He didn't say anything to me. You did.
BEN What are you talking about?
LOCKE There is no Jacob, Ben. I'm not gonna be taken in by the little show you put on last night. You're a fraud. And it's time your people were told the truth. And this is not the way we came.
BEN I'm taking us back another way. I wanted to show you something first.
LOCKE I've seen enough.
BEN You know, John, you're not wrong. Some of the things I've told you—some of the things I've told everybody—are simply not true.
LOCKE Like what?
BEN Well, for starters, I wasn't born on this island.
LOCKE Then where did you come from?
BEN That's what I wanna show you.
ROGER Morning. Okay, wait. Put it right—right down there. What's the problem now? You're usually Chatty Cathy in the morning.
BEN It's my birthday. I dunno why I keep fooling myself into thinking that one of these years you're actually gonna remember.
ROGER Well, I'll tell you what. All we gotta do this morning is run this stuff out to Pearl station. Why don't we go up to the mesa, drink some beers? Have some...I dunno, father and son time.
BEN I'd like that.
ROGER Okay.
ROGER Well, you sure can't say it ain't beautiful.
BEN Do you really blame me?
ROGER What?
BEN Do you really think it's my fault that she died?
ROGER What do I know...
ROGER Why do you keep looking at your watch? You got a date? Listen...if it makes you feel any better, I will do my best to remember your birthday next year.
BEN I don't think that's going to happen, Dad. 
ROGER What do you mean?
BEN You know, I've missed her too. Maybe as much as you have. But the difference is, for as long as I can remember, I've had to put up with you. And doing that required a tremendous amount of patience.
BEN Goodbye, Dad.
ROGER Ben?
RICHARD You want us to, um...go get his body?
BEN No, leave him out there.
BEN This is where I came from, John. These are my people. The DHARMA Initiative. They came here seeking harmony, but they couldn't even coexist with the Island's original inhabitants. And when it became clear that one side had to go, one side had to be purged, I did what I had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch. Which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.
BEN What did Jacob say to you?
LOCKE Why did you do this?
BEN Because you heard him. Now, I need to know what he said.
LOCKE Help me...
BEN John, I'm not going to ask you again. What did he say to you?
LOCKE He said, "Help me."
BEN Well, I certainly hope he helps you, John.
