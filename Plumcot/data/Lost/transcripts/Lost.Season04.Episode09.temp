KATE You got a prescription for that?
JACK Yeah. I wrote it myself.
KATE You look terrible.
JACK Well, thanks.
KATE What are those?
JACK Antibiotics. I just got a... a stomach bug.
KATE You should eat some crackers. Crackers always make me feel better.
KATE Why aren't they back from the boat yet, Jack?
JACK Well, Sayid said the engine was down. My guess is they're trying to fix it and wondering why the hell they can't get in touch with us.
KATE And you're not worried?
JACK No. My gut says we're getting off this island.
KATE I thought your gut was sick.
BERNARD Help! I need some help! Help!
BERNARD Help! I need help! I need some help down here!
BERNARD The dog was barking. I didn't see him.
JACK Do you know who this is?
DANIEL He was on our boat. He's the doctor.
HURLEY We're all gonna die.
SAWYER Calm down, Chicken Little. The sky ain't falling just yet.
HURLEY This is exactly what he wants—to fight amongst ourselves. You're making a big mistake, dude.
LOCKE It's his to make, Hugo. Let's get on with it.
SAWYER Right... I'm attackin' Siberia.
SAWYER Sorry.
HURLEY Can't believe you're just giving him Australia. Australia's the key to the whole game.
SAWYER Says you.
KEAMY Stop here. On your knees. Get on your knees.
KEAMY Hey. Turn this thing off.
ALEX P-please. There's a baby with them. Just promise you won't—
KEAMY Turn the fence off.
ALEX Okay. It's off.
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE Code 14-J. Code 14-J.
HURLEY Who is it?
LOCKE I think it's for Ben.
LOCKE What's "code 14-J"?
BEN Where did you hear that?
LOCKE The phone rang. I picked it up. A voice kept repeating, "code 14-J."
BEN We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, and we'll have better position on the tree lines.
LOCKE What are you talking about?
BEN They're here.
SUBTITLE Sahara Desert
BEN Hello.
BEN No, no, no, no. Wait.
RED 
GRAY Look around! He doesn't have any trail.
RED Where did he come from? Fell from the sky?
BEN Wait. I can explain. D-do you speak English?
BEN Do you speak Arabic? 
BEN Do you speak Turkish? 
GRAY Do not move! 
BEN Sure. Sure.
BEN Ah. Okay. Okay, okay.
BEN This...
GRAY What is this? 
GRAY What is this? 
GRAY Surrender! Surrender!
BEN Oh, so you do speak English.
BEN Yah!
SAWYER Let me guess. "14-J" ain't the code for the pizza boy.
BEN It's an early warning system.
LOCKE Warning for what?
BEN Somebody tripped the panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured.
BEN How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?
LOCKE Five minutes.
BEN Well, so much for our head start.
SAWYER Hold up. If we're hunkerin' down, I gotta grab Frenchie and the kids.
BEN Don't bother. They're safe. I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday.
SAWYER Away where?
SAWYER Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.
BEN There's no time!
SAWYER I'll make time.
BEN It's very important that you survive what's about to happen here, John. So I need you to stay close to me.
LOCKE And why would I do that?
BEN Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance.
JACK His throat was slit.
JACK Know anything about that?
DANIEL No. Uh, he was fine when I last saw him.
JACK Which was when?
DANIEL When? "When" is kind of a relative term.
CHARLOTTE We don't know anything about this.
JULIET Any luck fixing the sat phone?
DANIEL Uh, yeah. Sorry, no. The, uh, the mic was... smashed up pretty good. Best-case scenario, we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch. Beeps and boops.
BERNARD Well, yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?
DANIEL If I had some strips of ferrous metal, uh, a 9-volt battery clip and some ... wiring.
KATE We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane.
DANIEL Great.
KATE I'll show you where it is.
JACK Bernard, you got a second?
LOCKE These people who are coming — you're scared of 'em, aren't you?
BEN That's right, John. I am.
HURLEY What's going on?
LOCKE Get away from the window, Hugo.
HURLEY How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
BEN He's not.
SAWYER Hey! You see if Claire left her house this morning?
DOUG What's going on? Why do you have that? 
SAWYER Just get back inside and wait until—
SAYWER Get back inside!
SAWYER Get inside!
SAWYER Claire!
SAWYER Claire!
SAWYER CLAIRE!
NARJISS Good afternoon, sir.
BEN Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.
NARJISS Of course, sir. Is this your first time in Tunisia?
BEN No. But it's been a while.
NARJISS Your name?
BEN I'm actually a preferred guest. It should be under "Dean Moriarty."
NARJISS Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.
NARJISS May I help you with anything else?
BEN Yes. Um, today's date is...
NARJISS October 24th, sir.
BEN 2005?
NARJISS Yes, sir. 2005.
BEN Thank you.
SAYID I just want to bury my wife in peace.
LOCKE Right now, I need you to tell me what's going on.
BEN I think the technical term is "shock and awe." They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.
LOCKE Well, why did they stop shooting?
HURLEY Was that Claire's house?! Claire was there!
LOCKE Hugo, get the baby away from the window. Put him in the back room.
LOCKE You said I need to survive this. Why?
BEN Because there's only one person that can help us now, and that's Jacob, and we have to go to him together.
LOCKE What makes you think I can find him? I—I don't even know where the cabin is.
BEN I know, but Hurley does.
SAWYER Claire! Claire! Claire!
SAWYER Claire!
SAWYER Are you okay?
CLAIRE Charlie?
SAWYER Okay.
CLAIRE Where's Aaron? Where's Aaron?
SAWYER He's with us. It's okay. We're gonna move now. Let's go.
SAWYER Open the front door!
BEN Hugo, you don't want to do that.
SAWYER Open the damn door!
SAWYER Open the door! Open the damn door!
SAWYER Careful.
LOCKE Is she all right?
SAWYER She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.
SAWYER They just started shootin'. Why? Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?
BEN Those people were murdered to make you angry, James. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here and throw me to the wolves.
SAWYER Yeah, what's wrong with that? Sounds like a great plan to me. What do you say, on three?
BEN I wouldn't if I were you.
SAWYER Shut up!
LOCKE Miles?
SAWYER Who the hell let you out?
MILES The people who gave me this. They want to talk.
SUBTITLE Tikrit, Iraq
SAYID You vultures, you followed me to Tikrit? You spy on me?
SAYID What are you doing here?
BEN I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.
SAYID How did you get here?
BEN I came across the Syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might—
SAYID How did you get off the island?
BEN Your friend Desmond had a boat. Remember? The Elizabeth. I followed a heading to Fiji. Then I chartered a plane.
SAYID Why now?
BEN You remember the name Charles Widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world that your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?
SAYID What does it have to do with me? With Nadia?
BEN There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir. He's one of Widmore's men.
BEN Bakir was last seen five days ago in Los Angeles, caught by a traffic camera, speeding away from the corner of La Brea and Santa Monica.
SAYID That's three blocks from where Nadia was killed.
SAYID Why would these people want to murder her?
BEN I don't know. But they did.
LOCKE How many of 'em are there?
MILES Maybe six. I'm not sure.
SAWYER The hell you mean, you ain't sure? You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?
MILES They told me they were just security.
LOCKE Security for what?
MILES For him. Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.
BEN Well, Miles, sounds like you're not gonna collect your 3.2 million dollars.
MILES Just take it. 
BEN Why would I talk to them?
MILES Because they have a hostage.
BEN Well, then they've badly miscalculated, 'cause every single one of my people is prepared to die in service to this island.
MILES It's your daughter!
BEN Hello?
KEAMY Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?
BEN That's right.
KEAMY My name is Martin Keamy. I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.
SAWYER Who's Charles Widmore?
LOCKE Later.
KEAMY I'd like you to go look out your east window so we can talk about this face-to-face.
KEAMY To the left. You see me?
BEN Yeah, I see you.
KEAMY All right, Mr. Linus, these are my terms You're gonna step out the front door, put your hands above your head, and you're gonna walk straight to me. Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you that no one else in that house will be harmed.
BEN You and I both know that once you have me, there's nothing to stop you from killing everybody else on this island.
KEAMY What kind of guy do you think I am?
BEN Martin Christopher Keamy — former first sergeant, United States Marine Corps, served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, but since then, you've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, specifically in Uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, Mr. Keamy, and we can dispense with the formalities.
KEAMY Okay, Ben. You got it.
KEAMY Get down.
KEAMY Get your ass out here right now... or I'm gonna kill your daughter.
BEN I'd like to present a counterproposal.
KEAMY I'm listening.
BEN You and your friends... you turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.
KEAMY Tell your daddy goodbye.
ALEX Dad... they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother.
BEN Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay.
ALEX Please, daddy! Just please, please...
KEAMY You have 10 seconds, Ben.
BEN Okay, listen.
KEAMY Nine...
BEN She's not my daughter.
KEAMY Eight...
BEN I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it—
SAWYER I don't see 'em. They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.
LOCKE They won't be gone for long. It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes, and then they're gonna come for him.
SAWYER Then let's just hand him over.
LOCKE I don't think these people have any intentions of letting us walk out of here alive, James, no matter what we do.
SAWYER Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.
BEN He changed the rules.
LOCKE What? Who? What rules?
SAWYER You know I'm right.
SAWYER Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.
SAWYER Hey! Where you goin'?
SAWYER Open this damn door! Open up!
BAKIR Walk.
BAKIR Who are you and why are you following me?
BEN My name is Benjamin Linus...
BEN ...and I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.
BAKIR And what message is that?
BEN That should do it.
SAYID Wait. Where do you think you're going?
BEN We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. Get on with your life.
SAYID I have no life. They took it from me.
BEN Go home, Sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours.
SAYID I spent the last eight years of my life searching for the woman I love. I finally found her and I married her. And I buried her yesterday. So don't tell me this is not my war. Benjamin... Who's next?
BEN I'll be in touch.
SAWYER Open the damn door! Son of a bitch just left us here. Open the damn door!
CLAIRE What's going on?
LOCKE Claire?
SAWYER You all right, sweetheart?
CLAIRE Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.
MILES Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
BEN Excuse me, James.
SAWYER 'Scuse you?
SAWYER What were you doing in there?
BEN Okay, listen to me very carefully I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head straight for the tree line.
HURLEY You mean towards the guys with guns?
BEN No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.
BEN Okay, outside. Outside now!
LOCKE What did you do?!
HURLEY Did you just call that thing?!
DISTANT VOICE Fall back!
SAWYER Go! Go, go!
BEN Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.
LOCKE Hey, where are you going?
BEN I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.
DANIEL I can't believe it. Might actually have a signal.
JACK What are you sending?
DANIEL "What... happened... to... the... doctor?"
DANIEL Okay. They didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor, but your friends are fine, and the helicopter's coming back in—in the morning.
JACK Well...
BERNARD He's lying. What the message said was, "What are you talking about? The doctor is fine."
DANIEL You know Morse code.
JACK What does that mean, "The doctor is fine"?
DANIEL I don't know.
JACK Why are you lying? Why did you say that the helicopters are coming back?
KATE Jack!
JACK Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?
DANIEL ...No. No, no.
KATE Jack.
SAWYER I think your chopper buddies ran that way, if you wanna catch up.
MILES Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for—for now.
LOCKE Sorry about your daughter.
BEN Thank you, John.
LOCKE That being said, you lied to me. You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.
BEN You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.
SAWYER Hang on. "Jacob"? Who the hell's Jacob?
BEN He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.
SAWYER You know what? I'm done with all this. I never should have followed you wackos in the first place. I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid are comin' with me. You good with that?
CLAIRE Yeah, I'm good with that.
MILES I'm coming with you.
SAWYER Let's go. You too, Hurley.
SAWYER Have you lost your mind?
LOCKE Hugo stays with us.
SAWYER Not a chance.
HURLEY Wait. Leave me out of this.
LOCKE I'm sorry, Hugo. We need you to find the cabin.
SAWYER He ain't goin' anywhere with you, you crazy son of a bitch.
HURLEY Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.
SAWYER Hugo.
HURLEY It's okay, Sawyer. Please, put your gun down.
HURLEY You too.
SAWYER You don't have to do this.
HURLEY You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.
SAWYER You harm so much as one hair on his curly head... I'll kill you.
LOCKE Fair enough.
SAWYER Let's go. Go. Move.
LOCKE Which way?
BEN Follow me.
SUBTITLE London, England.
BEN Thank you.
DOORMAN Good evening, sir. May I help you?
BEN Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.
DOORMAN At this hour, sir?
BEN They're expecting me. Feel free to call up.
DOORMAN No need, sir. Good night, sir.
BEN Wake up, Charles.
WIDMORE I wondered when you were gonna show up. I see you've been getting more sun.
BEN Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?
WIDMORE When the nightmares started.
WIDMORE Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?
BEN We both know I can't do that.
WIDMORE Then why are you here?
BEN I'm here, Charles, because you murdered my daughter.
WIDMORE Don't stand there, looking at me with those horrible eyes of yours and lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me, when we both know very well I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin — you did.
BEN No, that's not true.
WIDMORE Yes, Benjamin, it is. You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night — like a rat — and have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?
WIDMORE I know who you are, boy. What you are. I know that everything you have you took from me. So... once again I ask you Why are you here?
BEN I'm here, Charles, to tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... once she's dead... then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.
WIDMORE You'll never find her.
WIDMORE That island's mine, Benjamin. It always was. It will be again.
BEN But you'll never find it.
WIDMORE Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.
BEN I suppose it is. Sleep tight, Charles.
