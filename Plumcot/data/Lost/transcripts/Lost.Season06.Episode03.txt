dr_jack_shephard You died.
kate_austen How is that even possible? I mean one minute he's gone and now he's fine?
james_ford Of course he's fine.
kate_austen What's that mean?
james_ford He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids. He definitely deserves another go around.
hugo_reyes All right.
kate_austen What are you lookin' at?
james_ford How many guards with guns do you think are outside this place?
kate_austen What?!
james_ford I was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?
kate_austen What are you thinking?
james_ford Thinkin' about running, Kate.

sayid_jarrah Who are these people? What do they want?
hugo_reyes It's the Others, dude. They caught us again. I dunno, I think they are trying to protect us.
miles_straume Uh, as you can see, Hugo here has assumed the leadership position so that's pretty great.
sayid_jarrah What?
dr_jack_shephard The wound it's almost completely closed.
sayid_jarrah Thank you Jack.

sayid_jarrah For saving my life.

lennon Where'd Ford go?
dr_jack_shephard What?
lennon Ford, your friend who just ran outta here. Where did he go?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
lennon Do you expect me to believe that?
dr_jack_shephard He told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?
kate_austen I can bring him back.
lennon You know where he went?
kate_austen No, but I can track him. Let me go. I will bring him back and I can make him stay.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, you sure you want to go out there alone with these people?
jinsoo_kwon I'll go with her.
lennon It's very important that he get back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
kate_austen I can be very convincing when I wanna be.
kate_austen Where's your tire hammer?
REPAIRMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 You've got a problem.
kate_austen So do you. Where's your tire hammer?
REPAIRMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 Tire hammer will just cut off your wrist. The problem is you need a punch press and you're not gonna be able to use one of them and keep that gun pointed at me.
kate_austen You volunteering?
REPAIRMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 I got a steady hand but I kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
kate_austen I'll give you two hundred dollars.
REPAIRMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 Now hold still.
kate_austen Thanks.
REPAIRMAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 So why the bracelets?

kate_austen Better not slow me down.
dr_jack_shephard I'd go with you but..

kate_austen I'll take care of James. You take care of Sayid.
dr_jack_shephard Deal.
kate_austen Good bye.
dr_jack_shephard Be careful.
sayid_jarrah What is it you want? Please, whatever you are thinking of doing What is that?
sayid_jarrah Just tell me what you want.
sayid_jarrah Why? Why are you doing this?

lennon We're sorry we had to put you through that. It was a test. We had to be sure.
sayid_jarrah Test to be sure of what?
lennon Don't worry. You passed.
lennon I just lied to him, didn't I?
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Yes.
kate_austen Where were you going?
claire_littleton What?
kate_austen Before I got in the cab, where were you going?
claire_littleton Why, so you can hijack them too?
claire_littleton I was waiting for a bus.
kate_austen I came to bring you your stuff.
kate_austen Relax, I didn't take your money.
claire_littleton Well, uh, gee, thanks.
kate_austen So where were you going?
claire_littleton Don't worry about it.
kate_austen Fine.
claire_littleton Langdon street. Brentwood.
kate_austen You got family there?
claire_littleton Uh, no. It's the couple who's adopting my baby. They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but I guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.
kate_austen Brentwood's not far. Get in.
claire_littleton Seriously?
kate_austen Do you want a ride or not?
kate_austen So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?
aldo We're protecting you.
kate_austen From what?
aldo You've been on this island for a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a ticka ticka sound, looks pissed off?
kate_austen Yes.
aldo From that.
jinsoo_kwon Do you know anything about another plane coming in? An Ajira flight.
aldo I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?
justin I think he means the one that landed...
aldo Justin! Shut up.
kate_austen No, no, no, that's a decoy trail. He went this way.
aldo And you're basing this on what?
kate_austen Experience.
justin Aldo.
aldo What?
justin I think she's right.
aldo Of course she is.
aldo After you, princess. So what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back? I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out. If he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.
justin Watch it!
kate_austen Thank you.
jinsoo_kwon Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.
justin The French woman? She's been dead for years. This, this couldn't be one ...
aldo Justin! Shut up!
kate_austen What was he gonna say?
aldo You don't even remember me, do you? You don't recognize me? Well maybe this will jog you memory. Three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break, and you did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle. That would be me.
jinsoo_kwon What are you doing?
kate_austen Escaping.
[Back#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 at the Temple chamber with the spring. Two men are dragging Sayid. Hurley rushes to Sayid and they give him Sayid.
hugo_reyes Sayid! You okay, man? Jack! He's back!
dr_jack_shephard Sayid, what happened?
sayid_jarrah They tortured me.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
sayid_jarrah Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.
dr_jack_shephard Step aside.
lennon Hey, Shephard.
lennon We were hoping you'd come on your own.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell did you do to Sayid?
lennon We, we didn't do anything to him. Your, your friend is sick.
dr_jack_shephard Sick with what?
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Kare wa kegasarete shimatta ]
lennon He's yeah, I, not really there's not really a literal translation. The closest thing would be infected.
dr_jack_shephard Infected? He's not even running a fever.
dr_jack_shephard Did I say something funny?
lennon I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.
[The#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 Temple Leader smiles and wraps a capsule in a piece of paper.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Korewo Jarrah ni nomasete moraou
lennon He says you have to give your friend this pill.
dr_jack_shephard Are you serious?
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you give it to him?
lennon Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly, and he won't take it willingly from us.
dr_jack_shephard Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it before you tortured him.
lennon We didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.
dr_jack_shephard To see if he was infected.
lennon Yes.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid unless I know what's in it.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Tell me, Shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?
dr_jack_shephard He was, um, he was helping me.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER So it was your fault?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER And there have been others who were hurt or died, helping you?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Well, this is your chance to redeem yourself.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER It's medicine and your friend needs it.
dr_jack_shephard What happens if I don't give it to him?
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER The infection will spread.
miles_straume So, nothing? There wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?
sayid_jarrah I remember being shot.
hugo_reyes You're not a zombie, right?
sayid_jarrah No. I am not a zombie.
miles_straume Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Mind giving me and Sayid a minute?
hugo_reyes Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they lead me to having to do something I don't quite understand.
dr_jack_shephard I'm right there with you.
miles_straume Its fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.
sayid_jarrah So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?
dr_jack_shephard They said they were trying to diagnose you.
sayid_jarrah Right. They told me it was some sort of test which they said I passed. Clearly, I didn't.
sayid_jarrah What's that?
dr_jack_shephard They want you to take it. It's medicine, according to them.
sayid_jarrah What about according to you?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know. And you know, before when you when you thanked me for saving your life, I, I didn't have anything to do with it Sayid. I didn't fix you. They did.
sayid_jarrah I don't care who fixed me. I only care about who I trust. So, if you want me to take that pill, Jack, I'll do it.
jinsoo_kwon Wait. Where are you going?
kate_austen Catching up with Sawyer.
jinsoo_kwon So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.
kate_austen No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?
jinsoo_kwon Where did your plane land, Kate?
kate_austen What?
jinsoo_kwon The Ajira plane that you, Jack and Hurley came in on. Where did it land?
kate_austen I don't know.
jinsoo_kwon Sun was on that plane too and I have to find her.
kate_austen You think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?
jinsoo_kwon Who do you care about Kate?
kate_austen Good luck, Jin.
jinsoo_kwon Once you catch up with Sawyer, then what?
kate_austen I guess we'll figure that out together.
claire_littleton So, uh, what happened to your handcuffs?
kate_austen I cut them off.
claire_littleton It's a beautiful neighborhood. I bet they're a really nice couple.
claire_littleton What?
kate_austen I didn't say anything.
claire_littleton What, you, you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?
kate_austen Why would I think that?
claire_littleton Good, 'cause they didn't.
kate_austen This is it.
claire_littleton Um, will you come in with me?
kate_austen Are you kidding me?
claire_littleton Please, I just I really don't want to go up there on my own.
claire_littleton Uh, hi, um, Mrs. Baskum? I, I'm, I'm Claire Little ton.
MRS.BASKUM#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Um, my husband he left me. And, believe me, I wanted a baby so much, but I can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, I know I should've called you.
claire_littleton So uh, wh-what, y-y-you just changed your mind?
MRS.BASKUM#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 Um, look, my, my life is just, a little bit complicated right now.
kate_austen She came all the way from Australia and you don't call?
claire_littleton Oh my God.
kate_austen Are you okay?
claire_littleton Aah! It's coming!
james_ford Who's there? Better come out now or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.
james_ford What the hell are you doin' here?
kate_austen I was worried about you.
admitting_nurse What's happening here?
claire_littleton I-I think I'm having contractions.
admitting_nurse When did they start?
claire_littleton Um, about three minutes ago.
admitting_nurse Try to relax. We're gonna take you to the M.C.U to get it looked at.
admitting_nurse Are you with her?
kate_austen Yeah.
admitting_nurse Okay, follow me.
claire_littleton What are you doing? What, what's going on?
admitting_nurse 2 Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
claire_littleton I need to know what's going on? Is something wrong?
kate_austen Excuse me. Excuse me.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Yes.
kate_austen Are you a doctor?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.
kate_austen Can I please get your help in here?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Miss Littleton? Claire, how are you feeling?
claire_littleton Uncomfortable. What, wh-what's happening.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED What's happening is that Mother Nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?
claire_littleton I-I'm sorry. What?!
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED You're at thirty six weeks, three centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced, which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.
claire_littleton If I want? So what, you mean, you mean you can stop it then?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.
claire_littleton Drugs? I mean. W-will that hurt the baby?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED No. They're perfectly safe. I just don't want to stick you with needles if I don't have to. So it's up to you.
claire_littleton I'm, I'm not ready.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Okay. Let's get her started on the Nifedipine drip.
claire_littleton Wh, what, what is it?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Margaret, let's do an ultrasound. I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there. Ah, it, it could just mean the baby's out of position.
claire_littleton Wh-wh-what are you, what are you saying?! W-what, what's happening to my baby?! Is my baby okay? Is Aaron okay?
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED See? There he is. Everything is just fine. Your boy just likes to move around.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED 140 B.P.M, perfectly normal. I have a feeling that Aaron is gonna be a handful.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED Now let's see if we can slow this down.
dr_ethan_rom GOODSPEED You did great, mommy. Thanks.
kate_austen A couple days ago, you asked me why I came back to the island. I need to find Claire. I thought maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me, and then maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron, then maybe all of this wouldn't be for nothing.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I never should have followed you.
james_ford Which time?
kate_austen That was your house, right? With Juliet.
james_ford Yep.
kate_austen I'm sorry.
james_ford You already said that.
kate_austen No for Juliet. If I hadn't come after you on the sub, then you two would've left and she would've never died.
james_ford It's not your fault she's dead. It's mine. She was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place. And I convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island 'cause I didn't want to be alone. You understand that, right?
james_ford But, uh, but I think some of us are meant to be alone.
james_ford I was gonna ask her to marry me.
james_ford You can probably make it back to the Temple by nightfall.
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER It's a baseball.
dr_jack_shephard You speak pretty good English for someone who needs a translator.
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER We both know that I don't need a translator.
dr_jack_shephard Then why do you have one?
TEMPLE#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode03 LEADER Because I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.
dr_jack_shephard Who are you?
dogen My name is Dogen.
dr_jack_shephard Are you from here, the island?
dogen I was brought here like everyone else.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean, "Brought here."?
dogen You know exactly what I mean.
dogen You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?
dr_jack_shephard No.
dogen Why not?
dr_jack_shephard Because I don't know what's in it.
dogen It will eliminate--
dr_jack_shephard --the infection, yeah. I got that. But what's in it?
dogen I cannot explain.
dr_jack_shephard Try.
dogen There isn't any time. He'll die if you don't...
dr_jack_shephard He already died. What is in it?
dogen You just have to trust me.
dr_jack_shephard I don't trust myself. How am I supposed to trust you? Let's see where trust gets us.
dr_jack_shephard Now, are you gonna tell me what's in it?
dogen Poison.

kate_austen Well, I should go.
claire_littleton Oh, wait. Um, here, take my credit card.
kate_austen No.
claire_littleton There's not much of a limit on it but it's something.

claire_littleton You didn't have to do what you did either.
kate_austen Aaron's a great name.
claire_littleton I don't know why I said it. It's like, I don't know. I knew it or something.

dogen Tea.
dr_jack_shephard Why would you people want to kill Sayid?
dogen We believe he has been mesarete itandarou.
lennon Closest translation is "claimed."
dr_jack_shephard Claimed by what?
dogen There is a darkness growing in him and once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was, will be gone.
dr_jack_shephard No uh. How can you be sure of that?
dogen Because it happened to your sister.
