dr_juliet_burke I burnt my hand -- and my muffins.
amelia Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
WORKER#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode01 GUY It's a work in progress.
adam It's not even literature. It's popcorn.
amelia And why isn't it literature, Adam? I'm dying to know.
adam There's no metaphor. It's by-the-numbers religious hocum-pocum.
amelia No metaphor?
adam It's science-fiction -- now I know why Ben isn't here.
dr_juliet_burke Excuse me?
adam I know the host picks the book; but seriously, Julie, he wouldn't read this in the damn bathroom.
dr_juliet_burke Well, Adam, I am the host and I do pick the book. And this is my favorite book. So I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it. Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like. Here I am thinking that free will still actually exists on--
dr_juliet_burke The doorway -- get into the doorway.
ben_linus Goodwin, did you see where the tail landed?
goodwin_stanhope Yeah, probably in the water.
ben_linus You run and you can make that shore line in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors; and you're one of them. A passenger -- in shock -- come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in 3 days. Go.
ben_linus So I guess I'm out of the book club.
dr_jack_shephard Kate! Kate, can you hear me?! Kate!
tom_friendly Rise and shine, Kate.
kate_austen Where am I?
tom_friendly You don't really think I'm going to answer that, do you?
kate_austen Where are Sawyer and Jack?
tom_friendly I'll tell you what, why don't you just take a nice hot shower -- wake yourself up -- wash the day off you and start fresh. There's a nice clean towel, soap, shampoo...
kate_austen I'm not showering in front of you.
tom_friendly Kate, you're not my type.
james_ford Hey. Where are we? Who the hell are you? Oh, you ain't gonna talk to me? What -- you got more important things to do?
karl_martin I wouldn't do that.
james_ford If I want your advice -- I'll ask for it.
james_ford Son-of-a-bitch!!
karl_martin Told you.
UNKNOWN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode01 VOICE Stop that.
dr_juliet_burke Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet.
dr_jack_shephard Hi, I'm Jack Shephard. I'm here...
sarah_shephard Where's your lawyer?
dr_jack_shephard You look pretty.
sarah_shephard Where's your lawyer?
dr_jack_shephard I fired him. Sarah, I'm sorry for, for pushing us to this place. I know that I...
sarah_shephard Excuse me; I'm sorry. Yeah, um, no not yet. He just got here. I'll call you when I get home. Jack, I'm going to say this as simply as I can...
dr_jack_shephard What's his name?
sarah_shephard Jack, stop it.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to keep asking you that until you tell me.
sarah_shephard No, I don't ask you what you do in your...
dr_jack_shephard Just tell me what his name is! I want to know who he is. Look, you can have everything -- the cars, the house -- I don't care. I just -- I just want to know the name of the man that is with my wife.
dr_juliet_burke Jack, can you hear me in there? Is that a yes?
dr_jack_shephard Where are my friends?
dr_juliet_burke Come down from the table first.
dr_jack_shephard You want me to come down -- come in here and get me down.
dr_juliet_burke If you want to talk, I'm happy to...
dr_jack_shephard Tell me where my friends are!!!
dr_juliet_burke I will -- if you let go of the chain.
dr_jack_shephard You think I'm stupid?!
dr_juliet_burke I don't think you're stupid, Jack. I think you're stubborn.
kate_austen Hey! Where are my clothes?!
tom_friendly Come on, Kate. He's waiting.
ben_linus Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to put those on, Kate.
kate_austen And if I don't?
ben_linus Then you don't get any coffee.
ben_linus A little tighter. Please.
kate_austen What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?
ben_linus Now why Sawyer?
kate_austen Why Sawyer what?
ben_linus He's the first one you asked about. "What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"
kate_austen You don't know me.
ben_linus Of course I don't.
kate_austen I want my clothes back.
ben_linus We burned them.
kate_austen Why did you bring me here? Why did you make me put on this dress? Why are you feeding me breakfast?
ben_linus I brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted -- comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean. I gave you the dress so that you'd feel like a lady. And I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized. I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to. Because, Kate, the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, hi. Uh, I met a woman on the train. Sarah. And she dropped her cell phone and I don't even know her last name. But your number was in her phone so I was just wondering... I'm sorry, forget it.
dr_christian_shephard Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Just give me a minute, Dad. I asked you to give me a minute here.
dr_christian_shephard What's this? Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?
dr_jack_shephard Because one of them is him.
dr_christian_shephard You've got to stop this, Jack. It's over.
dr_jack_shephard Not until I know his name -- where he works, where he lives, when they first kissed. I want to know what it is about him.
dr_jack_shephard Why is Sarah calling you, dad?
dr_christian_shephard I think it's time that you let this go.
dr_jack_shephard Why is she calling you?!
dr_christian_shephard Because she was afraid -- for you.
dr_jack_shephard I want to know exactly why the hell she was calling...
dr_christian_shephard She could see that you were slipping -- you were losing your grip.
dr_jack_shephard My grip is not the problem here!
dr_christian_shephard Which is exactly what's happening here! Jack, I think I know a little something about being obsessive.
dr_jack_shephard No, being a drunk is not obsessive.
dr_christian_shephard Let it go, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard What? If you're trying to talk to me, I can't hear you.
dr_juliet_burke I know you're hungry. I brought this for you. This is how it will work. You sit there across from the door, back against the wall. I open the door and leave the tray. Can I trust you to do that, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I don't want your food.
dr_juliet_burke Well, it's a delicious sandwich...
dr_jack_shephard I want you to tell the guy who's trying to talk to me through that intercom that he can give it up.
dr_juliet_burke Maybe you're hungrier than you think. That intercom hasn't worked in years.
dr_jack_shephard What's that for -- the button -- what's it for?
dr_juliet_burke It's for emergencies.
dr_jack_shephard Who's watching me?
dr_juliet_burke Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door? It's just off the frying pan.
dr_jack_shephard You can have it.
dr_juliet_burke What do you do, Jack? What's your profession?
dr_jack_shephard I'm a repo man. You know, when people don't pay their bills I go in for the bank and I collect their possessions. I'm a people person so I really love it.
dr_juliet_burke Are you married?
dr_jack_shephard No. I never saw the point. What about you? What's your job, besides making sandwiches?
dr_juliet_burke Oh, I didn't make it. I just put the toothpicks in. When your plane crashed, where were you flying from?
dr_jack_shephard Sydney.
dr_juliet_burke What were you doing there?
dr_jack_shephard I was bringing my father home.
dr_juliet_burke Why would you go all the way to Australia just to...
dr_jack_shephard Because he was dead.
dr_juliet_burke I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm sure you are. Thanks.
dr_juliet_burke You can trust me, Jack. I'm not going to hurt you.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell is going on here?
karl_martin Hey. Hey, how long would it take to get to your camp?
james_ford What, you talking to me now, Chachi?
karl_martin From where they got you, how long a walk was it? A day, two days? And what are the people like from your plane?
james_ford Oh, they're just awesome. Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our Iraqi. He tortured me, too. But hell, he don't know any better.
james_ford Hey, how'd you get out of there?
karl_martin Run that way.
james_ford Hold on!
karl_martin You run that way!
dr_juliet_burke Hey.
tom_friendly Say it. Say it, Karl.
karl_martin I'm sorry. Sorry, I involved you in my break out attempt.
dr_juliet_burke The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a pretty serious side-effect -- dehydration. Your head is probably sore, your throat is raw. If you don't eat or drink something soon you're going to start hallucinating.
dr_jack_shephard So, you're a doctor, huh?
dr_juliet_burke No, I'm a repo woman. No strings attached. You don't have to answer any questions. You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall. Let me open that door, put the plate down and leave. I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing, if you do anything that I ask you to. But you're not. You need to eat. What do you say?
dr_juliet_burke Thank you, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a PCA.
nurse You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?
nurse Dr. Shephard...
dr_christian_shephard Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Give me your cell phone.
dr_christian_shephard What? What?
dr_jack_shephard I want to see it. Now.
dr_christian_shephard Look where you are, Jack. I mean, just look around you, please.
dr_jack_shephard Give me the phone.
dr_christian_shephard This is not the place for this.
moderator You must be Jack. Why don't you grab a chair and join us?
dr_jack_shephard You know me?
moderator Yes, your father's told us all about you.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, what's he told you about me? What did you tell them about me, dad? That your son never really had it -- not like the old man. I didn't have the will to make it work? My life, my job, my marriage. What did you tell them about my marriage, dad?!! You want to know how he manages his marriage? A bottle of scotch every night before dinner.
moderator Your father has been sober 50 days now. We're very proud of that.
dr_jack_shephard Wow, dad, I wonder what helped you turn that corner? Do you think maybe it was a new lady friend? Do you think maybe that's what...
dr_christian_shephard I will not let you you talk to me...
dr_jack_shephard I will not let you sleep with my wife.
dr_christian_shephard Oh, Jack. Jack, I'm your father. Jack, please just let it go.
dr_jack_shephard Which way out?
dr_juliet_burke Don't do this, Jack. Don't. Don't.
dr_jack_shephard Open the door.
dr_juliet_burke No. I can't. I can't, Jack. I do that -- we die. I'm not. I'm not.
dr_jack_shephard Open the door!!
dr_juliet_burke I can't! I swear I can't!!
ben_linus She's telling the truth, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I swear to god, I will kill her.
ben_linus Okay. Have her open the door and she dies anyway. We all do.
dr_juliet_burke Jack, over here!
dr_juliet_burke The button!
dr_jack_shephard What?
dr_juliet_burke The yellow button, the button!!
james_ford Oh, come on. Unbelievable.
tom_friendly Keep moving.
tom_friendly Stick your arms out through the bars; I'll take off your cuffs. They scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they? I'll bring you some anti-septic later.
james_ford How about you bring me an ottoman? While you're at it I could use a blow dry.
tom_friendly Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit. How'd you do that?
james_ford I figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how.
tom_friendly Only took the bears 2 hours.
james_ford How many of them were there? You okay, Freckles?
kate_austen Yeah. You?
james_ford Just swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Nice dress.
kate_austen They made me wear it.
james_ford You hungry?
dr_jack_shephard It's an aquarium.
dr_juliet_burke Excuse me?
dr_jack_shephard This thing's for what -- sharks?
dr_juliet_burke Dolphins, too.
dr_jack_shephard We're underwater, aren't we?
dr_juliet_burke Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Is this one of their stations -- the DHARMA Initiative?
dr_juliet_burke They called it the Hydra.
dr_jack_shephard So you people are just whatever's leftover of them.
dr_juliet_burke Well, that was a long time ago. It doesn't matter who we were. It only matters who we are. We know exactly who you are, Jack Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard You don't know anything about me.
dr_juliet_burke We know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of St. Sebastian's Hospital in Los Angeles. I know that you went to Columbia and that you graduated med school a year faster than anyone else. I know that you were married only once and that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in Sydney. I know this because I have a copy of his autopsy report.
dr_jack_shephard How did you get...
dr_juliet_burke We got it.
dr_jack_shephard What is that?
dr_juliet_burke This, Jack, is your life.
dr_jack_shephard Do you -- is it just about me or is it about my family, too -- my friends.
dr_juliet_burke It's pretty much about everything.
dr_jack_shephard Do you know about my -- about my ex-wife.
dr_juliet_burke Sarah. Yes, Jack, we know all about her. What would you like to find out?
GUARD#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode01 Shephard, someone posted your bail.
dr_jack_shephard How'd you, uh...
sarah_shephard Your dad told me you were here. I called you a cab. So, um, goodbye.
dr_jack_shephard Sarah!
sarah_shephard What?!
dr_jack_shephard Is that him?
sarah_shephard What difference does it make?
dr_jack_shephard It just does.
sarah_shephard It's not going to change anything.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I want to know! I need to know who he is.
sarah_shephard It doesn't matter who he is. It just matters who you're not. Jack, your father -- he called me to help you. He was so drunk I could hardly understand him. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix.
dr_juliet_burke Jack. Jack. What would you like to find out?
dr_jack_shephard Is she -- is she happy?
dr_juliet_burke Yes, Jack, she's very happy. Now, I'd like to bring you some food and water. But this time I need to know that you'll behave. Can I trust you, Jack? Put your back against the wall, please.
ben_linus Good work, Juliet.
dr_juliet_burke Thank you, Ben.
