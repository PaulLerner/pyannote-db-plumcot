charlie_pace Are we rescued?
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode23 Saved?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps it's them.
charlie_pace You see anything?
kate_austen No.
charlie_pace Maybe it's a trap?
hugo_reyes What do you mean a trap?
james_ford You hear that?
VOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode23 Damn it.
desmond_hume You.
kate_austen Okay, okay, just wait one second, okay. I'll be right back. Everybody needs to know what's going on, Jack. There's a boat...
dr_jack_shephard Just tell them Desmond's back until I find out the rest, okay.
dr_jack_shephard So, before you ran off, I guess you just forgot to mention that you still have a sailboat. Why'd you come back?
desmond_hume Do you think I did it on purpose? I was sailing for two and half weeks, bearing due West and making 9 knots. I should have been in Fiji in less than a week. But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No, it was here—this, this island. And you know why? Because this is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snow globe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink.
desmond_hume Are you still pushing it?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, we're still pushing it.
master_sergeant SERGEANT Set of keys; one pocket watch, gold plated; one photograph (the same picture Desmond had in the Hatch); one book, Our Mutual Friend. Why didn't you bring that inside?
desmond_hume To avoid temptation, brother. I've read everything Mr. Charles Dickens has ever written - every wonderful word. Every book except this one. I'm saving it so it will be the last thing I ever read before I die.
master_sergeant SERGEANT Nice idea, as long as you know when you're going to die. Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume your sentence is hereby complete and you are now and forever dishonorably discharged from the Royal Scotts Regiment of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Long live the queen. Enjoy your sodding book.
charles_widmore You want a ride?
desmond_hume Not with you.
charles_widmore Get in the car.
desmond_hume Did you bring me a present?
charles_widmore Actually, two presents. One of these boxes contains your past, Hume. The other, your future. Go ahead, open it.
desmond_hume You're a bastard, you know that?
charles_widmore The fact that she never received your sentiments is good for her. Good, because as far as she's concerned you've forsaken her. And that's the way it's going to stay.
desmond_hume Is it now?
charles_widmore Penelope's moved on, Hume. She's getting married. This is for your new life—away from my daughter. The conditions are simple—no contact, no calls, no posts. You just run away, Desmond.
desmond_hume And what makes you think I would just run away?
charles_widmore Because you're a coward.
sayid_jarrah On the way to the funeral I told you that Michael had been compromised by the Others, and then you asked me how we might take advantage of that. I believe fate has given us our answer—the boat.
dr_jack_shephard The boat?
sayid_jarrah This camp Michael is leading you to across the Island—that is where they will set their trap. While Michael leads you by land, I can approach far more quickly by sea. And I can go ashore undetected.
dr_jack_shephard Go ashore and do what?
sayid_jarrah Scout them—their numbers and positions, their weapons. Then I'll go to the nearest beach and start a signal fire with these . They burn with a dark, black smoke. You and your team will come to meet me at the signal and we will go in together.
dr_jack_shephard We're not even sure if Michael's been turned by them.
sayid_jarrah He has been turned.
dr_jack_shephard I'll have to tell Kate, and Hurley and Sawyer what we're doing.
sayid_jarrah No. Michael cannot sense we know he is lying. All we have is the element of surprise, Jack. Right now it's only your responsibility to keep it secret.
dr_jack_shephard Black smoke, huh?
sayid_jarrah This time they will know that we are coming.
mr_eko Hello, John. Where have you been?
john_locke I've been thinking.
mr_eko About what?
john_locke That in a minute that computer's going to start beeping, and when it does you're going to let it go. You're going to let it run down to zero, past zero. And you're not going to push the button.
mr_eko But I am going to push the button. Why wouldn't I?
john_locke Because you don't want to be a slave.
mr_eko I am a slave to nothing.
john_locke You're a slave to that , just like I was. So I'm going to tell you again—don't push it.
mr_eko Do not tell me what I can do.
john_locke You cannot push that button.
john_locke No, it's not real. We're only puppets—puppets on strings. As long as we push it, we'll never be free.
mr_eko Well, you're free now, John. Do not come back.
john_locke No.
hugo_reyes No way. I'm not even going to kill someone.
james_ford Ain't that the point?
hugo_reyes I thought the point was to get Walt back?
dr_jack_shephard What's the matter?
kate_austen All that stuff we found in the medical station—costumes, make-up, fake beards—what if these people just want us to think they're hillbillies?
michael_dawson Listen, I was there. I saw them. They are hillbillies. They live in huts; they eat fish; they're probably more scared than we are. And they have no idea we're on our way.
james_ford Alright, enough jibber-jabber, let's roll.
sayid_jarrah I need your boat.
desmond_hume I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal.
sayid_jarrah I'm not going out there. I need to get to the North shore of the Island, and quickly.
desmond_hume Going to see the hostiles, are you?
sayid_jarrah What?
desmond_hume You know what, ignorance is bliss. The boat's all yours, brother, for all the good it'll do you.
sayid_jarrah I don't know how to sail.
desmond_hume Then I suggest you find someone who does.
desmond_hume Just give me which ever one has the most caffeine in it, brother. Damn, um, I'm sorry. I've just arrived and I spent all my American money on a taxi.
libby_smith I've got it.
desmond_hume That's not necessary.
libby_smith It's just 4 bucks.
desmond_hume I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those do you?
libby_smith Depends on what it's for.
desmond_hume I was joking.
libby_smith No you weren't.
libby_smith So, a sailing race around the world?
desmond_hume I have 8 months to get into the best shape of my life. I'll tell you what, miss, I'm going to win.
libby_smith And what do you get if you do?
desmond_hume What really matters is who I win it for.
libby_smith Charles Widmore.
desmond_hume He tried to buy me off. And when I didn't take his money, he took away the only thing in the world that I ever truly cared about.
libby_smith Who is she?
desmond_hume His daughter. I was unsuitable on several levels.
libby_smith And what's the 42 grand for?
desmond_hume It's a wee bit complicated. As of yet, I don't actually have a boat. Sorry, did I say something wrong?
libby_smith I have a boat. It was my husband's but he got sick. He wanted to sail the Mediterranean—he never—he passed away about a month ago.
desmond_hume I'm sorry.
libby_smith I want you to have it.
desmond_hume I can't take your boat, miss.
libby_smith But you have to. He'd want you to.
desmond_hume What was your husband's name?
libby_smith David.
desmond_hume And what did he name his boat?
libby_smith Elizabeth. He named it after me.
desmond_hume Then I thank you, Elizabeth. And I shall win this race for love.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐라는 거야?
sunhwa_kwon Would you excuse us, please?
sayid_jarrah I'll be at the shore.
sunhwa_kwon 당신이 배로 사이드를 섬 반대쪽으로 데려다 주기를 원해요. 마이클을 도와주기 위해서야.
jinsoo_kwon 안 돼. 이제 당신을 두고 갈 수 없어.
sunhwa_kwon 날 두고 당신 혼자 가라는 얘기가 아니에요. 나도 같이 갈 거에요.
kate_austen Don't even think about it. It's a trap—a net. Rousseau's got them all over the Island.
james_ford How the hell would you know that?
kate_austen I tripped one with Jack. We ended up—never mind. What?
james_ford When the Doc told me you all got caught in a net I thought he meant, uh—something else.
kate_austen Since when did you and Jack start talking about me?
hugo_reyes Did that bird just say my name?
james_ford Yeah, it did. Right before it crapped gold.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, man. I guess I forgot to load that one. Want to give me the mag?
charlie_pace John. What happened to your face?
john_locke Nothing, I'm fine.
charlie_pace Hey, uh, if you're feeling a little sorry for yourself you may want to have a drink with your mate from the Hatch. I hear he's a little despondent, as well.
john_locke What?
charlie_pace Oh, that's right; you weren't there for the dramatic arrival at the funeral. I think he's pushed your button too many times, if you ask me.
john_locke Desmond?
charlie_pace Yeah, Desmond. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry if what I said was confusing, but I asked Jin to come.
sunhwa_kwon You need someone to translate. And you need at least two people who know how to sail.
sayid_jarrah Desmond managed by himself.
sunhwa_kwon And look where he ended up.
desmond_hume You're wasting your time, sister. I shot myself with that stuff every 9 days for 3 years. He's lovely. Is the father here on the Island?
claire_littleton No. Nope, he's been gone a long time. Sort of walked off the moment he got a bit scared by the situation.
desmond_hume Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad—thought he was doing what was best for you.
claire_littleton He was doing what was best for him.
desmond_hume How did you find me?
penelope_widmore The landlord at your flat told me you ran here everyday.
desmond_hume How did you find me?
penelope_widmore I have a lot of money, Desmond. With enough money and determination you can find anyone. Did you read your beloved book—the one you were saving?
desmond_hume Not yet.
penelope_widmore I thought you might have read it while you were away.
desmond_hume I was in prison, not away.
penelope_widmore Why didn't you write to me?
desmond_hume When are you getting married, Pen?
penelope_widmore We haven't set a date yet.
desmond_hume I'll be back in a year.
penelope_widmore What if you were back, right now?
desmond_hume I'm going to win this race, Pen—his race. And in a year, I'll be back.
penelope_widmore Desmond, what are you running from?
desmond_hume I have to get my honor back, and that's what I'm running to.
john_locke So what did one snowman say to other snowman?
desmond_hume Smells like carrots.
john_locke Hello, Desmond.
desmond_hume Hello yourself, box man.
john_locke Do you mind?
desmond_hume Oh, I insist. So you managed to fix the computer, then, did you?
john_locke World's still here, ain't it?
desmond_hume I'm not so sure about that, brother.
john_locke Refresh my memory, Desmond. How long did you say that you were down there in the Hatch?
desmond_hume 3 years.
john_locke Desmond, what if I told you that for all that—all those years that you and all the men before you were down there pushing that button—what if I told you that it was all for nothing?
desmond_hume I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that?
john_locke I found another hatch—another station on the Island. They called it the Pearl, and I saw a film there—an orientation film. And it said that everything that was happening in our hatch wasn't real—that it was a test—a psychological experiment.
desmond_hume You're lying.
john_locke You want to take a walk? I'll make the popcorn.
desmond_hume You're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button!
john_locke Well, I have. Except, unfortunately, someone else decided to start. So you're going to sober up. We're going to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we're going to find out what happens if that button doesn't get pushed.
james_ford DHARMA nutri-bar?
hugo_reyes No thanks; I'm not hungry.
james_ford You serious?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, you alright?
michael_dawson Yeah, just getting some more firewood. Not feeling too hot.
dr_jack_shephard You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll give you a hand.
michael_dawson Hey, thanks for coming out here—risking your neck for my boy.
dr_jack_shephard Live together, die alone, man.
michael_dawson Yeah.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 오지 말라고 했잖아.
sunhwa_kwon 뱃멀미 하는 거 아니에요.
jinsoo_kwon 알아. 보여줄 게 있어.
sayid_jarrah I don't know what is more disquieting—the fact that the rest of the statue is missing, or that it has 4 toes?
mr_eko John!
john_locke Neat trick.
mr_eko John! John! Can you hear me? Open up.
desmond_hume Are you sure about this, brother?
john_locke I'm more sure about this than anything in my entire life.
mr_eko Don't do this! John!
desmond_hume Alright then, box man. We wait.
kelvin_inman Are you him?
desmond_hume What?
kelvin_inman What did one snowman say to the other?
desmond_hume What are you talking about? Who are you?
kelvin_inman I'm Inman. Kelvin Inman.
desmond_hume What, what happened to my boat?
kelvin_inman I found you washed up on the beach. There was no boat.
desmond_hume What was all that about, then?
kelvin_inman Just saving the world.
MARVIN#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode23 CANDLE Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor.
kelvin_inman How many times are you going to watch that thing?
desmond_hume Why are there missing parts?
kelvin_inman Radzinsky made some edits.
desmond_hume Who's Radzinsky?
kelvin_inman He was my partner.
desmond_hume And what happened to him?
kelvin_inman Just make sure you put that back behind Turn of the Screw when you're done with it.
desmond_hume Why do you wear that suit?
kelvin_inman So I don't get infected out there. Give yourself a shot of this every 9 days. You were out there a while before I found you. Hope it's not too late.
mr_eko John!
desmond_hume Who is he, box man—the man out there pounding on the door?
john_locke His name is Mr. Eko.
desmond_hume Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture?
john_locke Because he's a priest.
mr_eko Open the door, please. John! Can you hear me? Open up.
desmond_hume We locked out a priest?
mr_eko Charlie, do you know how they got the Hatch door open?
charlie_pace No, but if you hum it, I could probably play it.
mr_eko How did they open it—the door that says "quarantine"?
charlie_pace They blew it up, why?
mr_eko Charlie, I need your help.
charlie_pace Oh, now I'm back in your good graces, Father?
mr_eko Charlie, John has locked me out of the Hatch. And I believe he is doing this because he is going to stop pushing that button. And, Charlie, I am absolutely certain that if he is successful, in 90 minutes everyone on this island will die.
charlie_pace Alright, I'm in. I'm in.
mr_eko Thank you. Come, come quickly.
james_ford So, these Others, you think they're left over from the DHARMA folk?
michael_dawson I don't know, man.
james_ford My theory, they're aliens. That's why they use the fake beards—their heads are made of pathetic.
hugo_reyes Prosthetic, dude.
james_ford You can't even spell and now you're correcting me? What do you think, Freckles?
kate_austen Just keep moving, we're being followed.
james_ford What?
kate_austen Just keep smiling. There's at least two of them across the river. In about 5 seconds I'm going to turn the tables on them.
james_ford Wait a second.
kate_austen You in?
kate_austen He's getting away!
kate_austen He's dead. We have to find the other one.
dr_jack_shephard No!
kate_austen I'm going. Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard I said no!
james_ford Are you crazy?! We let him go they'll know we're coming! He'll...
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter if we catch him now! They've already been warned.
james_ford What do you mean "warned"?
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you tell them, Michael?
kate_austen Jack.
michael_dawson I don't know what you're talking about.
dr_jack_shephard Stop lying! Tell them.
michael_dawson Tell them what?
dr_jack_shephard I know what you're doing, Michael! Now tell them the truth! Tell them!
michael_dawson It was the only way. They gave me a list.
dr_jack_shephard What list?
michael_dawson It had your names on it. I had to bring all 4 of you back, or they said I'd never see my son again!
dr_jack_shephard Who are they?
michael_dawson It's like I said—they live in a camp with huts. I swear, that's it.
kate_austen You let Henry go?
hugo_reyes Did you kill them? Ana Lucia and Libby? Did you?
michael_dawson I had to, man. I, God, I couldn't find any other way. And Libby was a mistake. I, I didn't have time to think.
hugo_reyes But if you did have time—you still would have killed her, right?
michael_dawson I'm sorry. You understand—I am sorry. I'm sorry. I—my son!
hugo_reyes I'm going back.
dr_jack_shephard No, Hurley. Hurley, you can't!
hugo_reyes We're all going to get killed and you knew it! You let us come anyway.
dr_jack_shephard It's too late to go back now, Hurley. We already caught them following us once. If they don't believe that we trust Michael, they'll kill us all! I'm sorry that I didn't say anything. But you have to know that I would never bring you out here if I didn't have a plan.
james_ford What plan?
sayid_jarrah
jinsoo_kwon Sayid! Here.
sayid_jarrah That's the rock Michael described. We're here.
mr_eko Hurry, please.
charlie_pace Hurley showed me. It's around here somewhere. It's definitely around, uh...
mr_eko We're running out of time, Charlie.
charlie_pace Here it is! Told you. Careful. Careful. Dynamite is very unstable. You don't want to end up like Dr. Arzt.
charlie_pace Careful. Eko, hey, Eko. Listen, what if we hurt them? Or blow up the computer?
mr_eko You can leave now, Charlie.
charlie_pace John, it's Charlie. Let's work this thing out, John. John! Eko is very upset, John. Just open this door and we can talk about it. John, you should know Eko is going to blow open the blast door.
john_locke Blow it open with what?
charlie_pace With dynamite from the old ship in the jungle.
desmond_hume It would take an atom bomb, brother. Tell him not to bother.
john_locke You're sure it'll hold?
desmond_hume Aye, I'm sure.
desmond_hume Maybe you should do it?
kelvin_inman Come on, Des, you've seen me do it a hundred times.
desmond_hume How do you even remember where you left off from?
kelvin_inman Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly. You should have seen Radzinsky do this. He had a photographic memory. I mean, this whole baby was his idea.
desmond_hume Yeah, right, Radzinsky. Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown. Radzinsky created this great invisible map. More and more tales about your former partner. Yet for some reason, you never want to tell me what bloody well happened to him.
kelvin_inman See that brown stain, there? That's Radzinsky. He put a shotgun in his mouth when I was asleep. The bitch of it was, I only had a 108 minutes to bury the poor bastard.
desmond_hume Well, if you don't want me to go crazy, next time let me go out.
kelvin_inman Well, you want to go out there with the quarantine and the hostiles?
desmond_hume I haven't been outside for 2 bloody years! Yes, I want to go! I was in the army for God's sake!
kelvin_inman Oh, right, Her Majesty's Army, correct? Tell me, Desmond, why'd you leave that nice old lady's army? Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out because you couldn't follow orders.
desmond_hume Why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh?
kelvin_inman Because men followed my orders. Ah, but then thank God I joined the DHARMA Initiative. Namaste, thank you, and good luck.
desmond_hume Please, Kelvin. Let me go out, huh? Just once.
kelvin_inman Sorry, Des. You stay here. You push the button. That's an order.
charlie_pace John! Seriously, you're about to be detonated.
charlie_pace Hey, what if John's right. What if it's just some colossal joke? You know, it's just some old computer connected to nothing? Maybe it's just a bunch of wires?
mr_eko Is that a joke?
charlie_pace I'll see myself out.
mr_eko John, this is your last time to end this. Open the door, and I will forgive you.
john_locke Forgive me for what?
charlie_pace Hey, hey, Eko. Wait. Just wait a second. I don't think it's a good idea, Eko. We're in a very confined area.
charlie_pace Oh, bollocks.
desmond_hume Kelvin! Hey, Kelvin.
kelvin_inman I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
desmond_hume What is this?
kelvin_inman This is the only other way out, partner.
desmond_hume What are you talking about?
kelvin_inman Failsafe. Turn this key and this all goes away.
desmond_hume What's behind that wall, Kelvin? Huh? What was the incident?
kelvin_inman Electromagnetism, geologically unique. The incident—there was a leak. So now the charge builds up and every time we push the button it discharges it before it gets too big.
desmond_hume Why make us do it—push the button? If we, if we can just...
kelvin_inman Here's the real question, Desmundo—do you have the courage to take your finger out of the dam and blow the whole thing up, instead?
desmond_hume I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother.
john_locke They're not my friends.
desmond_hume I can't hear anything. Maybe we should open it.
john_locke No, no; it's a trick.
desmond_hume A trick? They could be hurt! Is your doctor around?
john_locke Our doctor is God knows where. And he sure as hell doesn't care about anything happening down here.
desmond_hume Can I ask you a question, brother?
john_locke Absolutely.
desmond_hume Is the reason you're letting that clock there run all the way down to the very last tick—is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun to find out what you really believe, John?
john_locke I looked down the barrel of the gun and I believed. I thought it was my destiny to get into this place. And someone died—a kid. Because he was stupid enough to believe that I knew what I was talking about. And the night that he died for nothing, I was sitting right up there, all alone, beating my hand bloody against that stupid door—screaming to the heavens asking what I should do. And then a light went on. I thought it was a sign. But it wasn't a sign. Probably just you going to the bathroom.
kate_austen Jack.
hugo_reyes What are they?
kate_austen It's handwritten. It's all filled, the whole book. They're journal entries.
kate_austen 0400 S.R. moves ping-pong table again. 0415 Takes a shower. What is this?
james_ford Hey, Doc, what did you say Sayid's signal's going to be when the coast is clear to hit that beach party?
kate_austen That means he found them, right?
dr_jack_shephard That's miles from here. Where were you taking us?
michael_dawson What?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid said that he'd light the signal so that we could meet him at the shore. Why aren't we going to the beach?
michael_dawson We are headed to the beach.
dr_jack_shephard We're nowhere near the beach!
michael_dawson Look, I had to.
dr_jack_shephard What?!
kate_austen Sawyer!
dr_jack_shephard Run!!! Go, go!
michael_dawson Wait!
desmond_hume Tell me about this other hatch you found—this Pearl.
john_locke What do you want to know?
desmond_hume Details.
john_locke The Pearl is a psychological station full of TV monitors. And two men sat in viewing chairs and filled notebooks with observations on what happens in here. And then they put the notebooks in pneumatic tubes and send them back to their headquarters so they could evaluate us—as an experiment. What?
desmond_hume What if you've got it backwards?
john_locke Backwards?
desmond_hume What if the experiment wasn't on the two men in here, but on the two men in there? I want to see that tape, John.
john_locke No, you can't. There's no way to see it down here.
desmond_hume Well, was there anything else in that station? Was there a computer?
john_locke Yeah.
desmond_hume So what did it do?!
john_locke Nothing! It didn't do anything. It printed out numbers. Lots and lots of numbers.
desmond_hume What printout, where is it?
john_locke Here, reading material for the next 19 minutes. Knock yourself out.
kelvin_inman You've been shaving everyday for the last 3 years. You need to live a little, let go.
desmond_hume I'm never going to let go, brother.
kelvin_inman Oh, that's the spirit. Bye, Des.
desmond_hume Goodbye?
kelvin_inman Yeah, goodbye. See you in a couple hours.
kelvin_inman Well, gosh, I didn't think you had the stones to come after me. I was a spook for 10 years, Des. I know when I'm being followed.
desmond_hume What are you doing with my boat?
kelvin_inman I'm fixing it.
desmond_hume You were leaving?
kelvin_inman Well, I mean, not yet. It's still about a week away. You wrecked it pretty good, Des. What do you think? Want to come with me?
desmond_hume Come where?! What about the button?!
kelvin_inman Screw the button, man. Who knows if it's even real?
desmond_hume That's not what you said when you were going on and on about dams and electromagnetics and failsafes!
kelvin_inman Well, I was drunk.
desmond_hume Why did you lie to me?!
kelvin_inman I lied to you because I needed a sucker to save the world after I left!
desmond_hume You crazy old bastard! You stole my life!!
kelvin_inman Oh, come on.
desmond_hume What else did you lie to me about?! What else? Tell me?!
desmond_hume How could you do this to me?! Get up.
desmond_hume Oh my God. Oh my God.
john_locke What are you doing?
desmond_hume When did you come here?
john_locke What?
desmond_hume The Island—when did you come here? How long ago?
john_locke 60-65 days.
desmond_hume The date—what was the date?
john_locke September 22nd.
john_locke It was September 22nd.
desmond_hume I think I crashed your plane.
james_ford Son-of-bitch...
tom_friendly FRIENDLY Everybody just calm down.
kate_austen It's fake. I know that your beard is fake.
tom_friendly FRIENDLY Sorry, missy, I didn't get you.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH She says she's knows your beard's fake, Tom.
tom_friendly FRIENDLY Well, thanks for pointing that out, Kate. I can't tell you how much this thing itches. And thanks for telling them my name, Bea.
ben_linus Hello again. Where's your beard?
tom_friendly FRIENDLY I think they know.
ben_linus Alright, let's take care of business, shall we?
charlie_pace Eko? Eko! It's Charlie. Wake up.
desmond_hume We need to push the button.
john_locke No, we don't!
desmond_hume Do you not hear me, brother? I crashed your bloody plane?
john_locke How did you manage to do that?
desmond_hume On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics. And when the last one came down this whole place started to shake! And that screen? That screen filled up with "system failure," System Failure! And I know what they are. 92204—September the 22nd, 2004, the day your planed crashed! It's real! It's all bloody real!! Now, push the damn button!!
john_locke I know what I saw! It's a lie; it's not real! None of it is real!
desmond_hume You don't want to push the button? Then I will.
john_locke No!
desmond_hume You killed us. You killed us all.
john_locke No. I just saved us all.
charlie_pace Hey, Eko, wake up. Hey, can I get some help? Can you help me?
desmond_hume I'm trying, brother.
penelope_widmore Dearest Des, I am writing this letter to you as you leave for prison. And I've hidden in the one place you would turn to in a moment of great desperation. I know you go away with the weight of what happened on your shoulders. And I know the only person who can ever take it off is you. Please don't give up, Des. Because all we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you, Pen.
desmond_hume It's all gone. It's all gone!!
john_locke I've done everything you wanted me to do? Why did you do this?! Why?!
desmond_hume 3 days before you came down here, before we met, I heard a banging on the Hatch door, shouting. But it was you, John, wasn't it? You said there isn't any purpose—there's no such thing as fate. But you saved my life, brother, so that I could save yours.
john_locke No, no, no, none of this is real! Nothing is going to happen. We're going to be okay.
desmond_hume I've got to go. And you've got to get as far away from here as possible.
john_locke Go where?! Stop!
desmond_hume I'm going to blow the dam, John. I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing. But it's all real. Now I've got to go and make it all go away.
john_locke Wait, Desmond.
desmond_hume I'll see you in another life, brother.
charlie_pace Eko! Eko! Wake up! Can you move? Okay, come on.
charlie_pace Eko, on your feet.
mr_eko Charlie.
charlie_pace No.
mr_eko John!
john_locke I was wrong.
penelope_widmore All we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you.
desmond_hume I love you, Penny.
bernard_nadler Charlie, are you okay?
charlie_pace It's hard to tell exactly. But, my ears, you know?
bernard_nadler Where's Locke—Eko?
charlie_pace They're not back yet?
ben_linus I'm not happy about the arrangement that was made with you Michael, but we got more than we bargained for when Walt joined us, so I suppose this is what's best. And you let me go, set me free—you lived up to your word. We live up to our word, too. Do you know how to drive a boat?
michael_dawson Yeah, I can drive a boat.
ben_linus Good, then you're going to take this boat and follow a compass bearing of 325, and if you do that exactly, you and your son will find rescue.
michael_dawson That's it? I follow the bearing and me and my son get rescued?
ben_linus Yes.
michael_dawson How do you know I won't tell people about where I was?
ben_linus Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But it won't matter. Once you leave, you'll never be able to get back here. And my hunch is you won't say a word to anybody because if you do, people will find out what you did to get your son back.
michael_dawson My friends—I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.
ben_linus A deal's a deal.
michael_dawson Who are you people?
ben_linus We're the good guys, Michael. Alright, she's all yours.
michael_dawson What? What, am I stupid? Where's my son?!
ben_linus Walt's inside.
ben_linus Bon voyage, Michael.
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad!
michael_dawson Come here, come here . You okay?
walt_lloyd Yeah.
michael_dawson You sure? Okay, I've got you now. It's going to be okay now. We're going home, Walt. We are going home.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
hugo_reyes What?
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Go back. Your job is to tell the rest of your people they can never come here.
hugo_reyes But what about my friends?
ben_linus Your friends are coming home with us.
beatrice_klugh KLUGH Go.
claire_littleton What happened out there, Charlie?
charlie_pace You want to hear the part about me nearly being killed by the flaming fireball—or the flying fork?
claire_littleton I want you to be serious.
charlie_pace Nothing happened.
claire_littleton Well, something happened. I mean that noise, and the sky turned that weird violet color.
charlie_pace Did it?
charlie_pace Ow, ow.
