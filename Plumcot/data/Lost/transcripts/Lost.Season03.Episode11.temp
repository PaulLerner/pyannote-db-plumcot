SAWYER Ping-pong table? Where the hell did that come from?
HURLEY Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood. We made legs for it, paddles, now all we need is a ball.
SAWYER Found it?
HURLEY It must've landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.
SAWYER I thought the hatch collapsed.
HURLEY Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple. After that I don't ask questions. Just make myself a salad and move on.
SAWYER Yeah, I can see that's working for you. Hey! You seen Kate around?
HURLEY Wow. She's not back yet? Hmm. You guys find anything we could use as a ball?
BACKGROUND VOICE No.
SAWYER Hey, that's my Guns and Ammo. Where the hell you get it?
PAULO It was in the magazine stack. We share things now.
SAWYER Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff. Stuff you all decided to have yourselves a little party with while you thought I was dead.
PAULO Listen, hillbilly, if you want it that bad, take it. 
SAWYER Just keep it. 
SAYID We need to eat.
LOCKE Are we still on course?
SAYID We're still heading north on a bearing of 3 0 5. Yes.
LOCKE I'm sensing a lack of confidence.
SAYID We've been walking for two days, following a compass bearing provided by the carvings on a stick!
LOCKE And?
SAYID You really think we're just going to chance upon where The Others are?
LOCKE I don't know what we're going to chance upon, Sayid, but my bearing is the only bearing we got.
SAYID I'm going to find some fruit, and then, John, we'll have a rational conversation regarding our next move.
SAWYER You all looking for something like this? 
HURLEY Cool, the ball. 
SAWYER Uh-uh. We need to do a quick prid quo first. I know I've been gone a while, and you thought the General Store was having a "going-out-of-business" sale. But now I'm back. And I want what’s mine.
NIKKI Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.
SAWYER A, it was mine to begin with when I took it. B, who the hell are you? And C, because I'm fair, I'm going to let you play me for it.
HURLEY Play ping pong?
SAWYER That's right, Avalanche. You bastards put up your best player. One game. And when I crush them, you all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.
HURLEY If you lose?
SAWYER I ain't gonna lose, but if I do, tell you what, name it.
JIN 소이어가 뭐래?
SUN 잠깐만, 내가 나중에 얘기 해 줄게. 나한테 좋은 생각이 생겼어.
SAWYER Ooh, looks like crouching tiger and hidden dragon got something good. Lay it on me.
SUN No nicknames. If you lose, no nicknames for anyone for a week.
CHARLIE Nice!
SAWYER You're on. Pick your player. I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.
LOCKE You sure it's completely isolated?
SAYID I've circled the house. Nothing but jungles surrounding it. Here. 
LOCKE Does that dish still work?
SAYID A satellite dish of that size would have broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles. Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower. Is this it?
ROUSSEAU I have never been here before.
KATE The man in the house, you said you've seen him before?
SAYID On a video feed from the Pearl Station.
KATE So who is he?
SAYID Only one way to find out. We ask him. 
KATE What's this for?
SAYID If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened. In case he is threatened, you cover me from here.
KATE Hey, where are you going?
ROUSSEAU I have no interest in that man inside the house. I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters. I'll wait for you by the stream, for those of you who survive.
ARABIC MAN Najeev. Najeev. A man out front wants to see you.
SAMI Did you cook this?
SAYID Yes, I did.
SAMI Wow, it is delicious. My name is Sami.
SAYID Najeev. Thank you.
SAMI Please sit. Sit. Where are you from, Najeev?
SAYID I'm Syrian.
SAMI Please. والله يااخي, انت مبين عليك كثير انك عراقي مثلي. 
SAYID What do you want from me?
SAMI You're an excellent cook. And I, I have a restaurant. Much nicer than this place. Come take a look. If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.
SAYID You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?
SAMI I'm offering you a job because we're outsiders here. And because, um, my chef just quit.
KATE No, he's been hit. He's been hit.
LOCKE Not yet. Do you want to get shot too?
MIKHAIL I didn't cross the line! We had a truce! This is my land! You said I could stay here!
SAYID I'm not who you think I am! My name is Sayid Jarrah! I was on a plane that crashed here months ago!
MIKHAIL A plane?!
SAYID I'm unarmed, I swear!
MIKHAIL Stay right there!
LOCKE Drop the rifle! Stop, right now. Back up. Back up. 
KATE Are you all right?
MIKHAIL You really did crash here?
SAYID Over 40 of us, yes.
LOCKE I'll go in first. Make sure it's ok.
KATE Who are you?
MIKHAIL My name is Mikhail Bakunin and I am the last living member of the DHARMA Initiative.
KATE Watch your step.
MIKHAIL Please. Sit. Here, let me... 
SAYID You've had experience treating gunshot wounds?
MIKHAIL I spent some time in Afghanistan. I had experience with field medicine in the Soviet Army. In the kitchen, on the top shelf there is a medical kit. Will you bring it please?
SAYID It's alright, Kate.
SAYID How did you get here?
MIKHAIL I almost don't know where to begin.
SAYID Why don't you begin with the DHARMA Initiative.
MIKHAIL I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet Army. I was stationed at a listening post at Vladivostok. After the Cold War, after we lost the Cold War, my unit was decommissioned. I was dismissed from my life in the military. And after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies, I found myself wanting to do something good. So I replied to a newspaper advertisement.
SAYID An advertisement?
MIKHAIL 'Would you like to save the world?' it read. That's how I met them, the Initiative. They're very secretive, very rich, very smart.
SAYID So, when did you come to the island?
MIKHAIL 11 years now. I like computers, communications equipment, being alone like a lighthouse keeper. So they put me in this station. They called it The Flame.
SAYID What is the purpose of the flame?
MIKHAIL To communicate with the outside world, of course.
COMPUTER VOICE Ready to play? Ready to play?
COMPUTER VOICE Your move.
SAYID What happened to the DHARMA Initiative?
MIKHAIL They're all dead, of course. They foolishly initiated a war against The Hostiles, the purge they called it.
SAYID How did you survive this purge?
MIKHAIL By not participating in it. I told you, I like being alone.
SAYID And the hostiles allowed you to stay here?
MIKHAIL After it was over, four men appeared in the yard. They offered a truce. They said to imagine a line that extended all the way across the valley. As long as I did not cross it, I would be left alone. Then they took two cows and I never saw them again.
KATE They weren't interested in the satellite dish in the yard?
MIKHAIL Why would they be? It hasn't functioned for years.
SAYID Who are they, these Hostiles?
MIKHAIL I do not know. But they were here a long time before we were. A very long time.
SAYID I am looking for Sami.
MAN Sami!
SAMI Najeev! I'm so glad you came. What do you think? It's a simple place. We have simple customers. Ah, here's my wife. She is in charge of the kitchen. Amira, come meet the chef.
SAYID Pleasure to meet you.
SAMI Are you sure this is him?
AMIRA Yes.
SAYID Look, I do not know who you think I am--
SAYID What did you just say?
MIKHAIL I told Nadia to be polite because you are my guests.
SAYID Nadia?
MIKHAIL Mm hmm. After Nadia Comaneci, the greatest athlete the world has ever known. We have the same birthday. Excellent work if I say so myself.
SAYID Thank you, Mikhail
MIKHAIL Perhaps I can begin to earn your forgiveness by offering you some iced tea. I will also check on your friend.
MIKHAIL Ha! Don't waste your time. For ten years I have tried to defeat that game. But it was programmed by three grand masters. And it cheats.
LOCKE Hmm. Well, I've played a lot of computers and I'm pretty sure they don't know how to cheat. That's what makes being human so distinctly wonderful.
SAYID What's wrong?
KATE It just doesn't make any sense. Why would they let him stay here with all this stuff, all this equipment?
SAYID Actually it makes perfect sense.
KATE What are you talking about?
SAYID The reason they let him stay here is because he is not DHARMA. He is one of them.
KATE He shot you and you just let him- Why are we still sitting here?
SAYID We are sitting here, Kate, because I am certain he is not alone.
SAWYER So, you really the number one draft pick, Grimace?
HURLEY Yep. Are we playing with the mercy rule?
SAWYER Mercy rule?
HURLEY Yeah, if I am like up 11-0 I, you know, automatically win.
SAWYER You're going to go up 11-0.
HURLEY Well, any one of us.
SAWYER Sure, we can have a mercy rule.
HURLEY Wanna volley for serve?
SAWYER Tell you what, you can be my guest.
CHARLIE Take him down, Hurley!
HURLEY 0 serving 0.
CHARLIE Yes!
HURLEY 1-Nothing
MIKHAIL I grow the tea myself. So pardon its bitterness.
SAYID Any tea is good tea.
KATE You know how long it's been since we've seen ice?
SAYID I noticed a series of thick wires as I walked around the station.
MIKHAIL This is the hub. But they go around to various stations on the island.
SAYID And these cables, do any of them run into the ocean?
MIKHAIL Yes. There is an underwater beacon that emits sonar pings to help guide in the vessels.
SAYID By vessels, you mean submarines.
MIKHAIL Yes. The Initiative used it to bring us to the island. But I can only imagine that the Hostiles have either destroyed it or commandeered it by now.
SAYID That explains how they were able to get around my position and capture our sailboat.
MIKHAIL You have a sailboat?
SAYID Until we lost it to your Hostiles.
MIKHAIL That's very unfortunate.
SAYID Well, at least we were able to kill one of them.
MIKHAIL Why are we continuing to play this little game when we all know it has moved to the next stage?
SAYID Get some rope.
SAMI Drink.
SAMI You were a torturer, were you not, in the Republican Guard? Do you not recognize one of your victims? Do you not recognize the woman you tortured? Do you not recognize my WIFE?!
SAYID No I have never seen- You are confusing me with someone else.
SAMI Amira was arrested for harboring an enemy of the state. She was held for three months while she was questioned. Her arms bear the scars of those questions. So I assure you, Najeev, I am NOT confused.
SAYID My name is not Najeev. I'm Sayid Jarrah. I was in the Republican Guard and, yes, I was an interrogator. But I have never seen your wife. Maybe she saw me at the same facility, but I do not know her. I can remember every face of every person I interrogated.
SAMI She remembers your face. She remembers it so well that she recognized you from a mere glimpse as we walked by the restaurant where you worked!
SAYID What do you want from me?
SAMI I want you to admit what you did. And if you don't, you will leave this room in a bag.
KATE How do you know he is not alone?
SAYID The horse is still saddled outside, and the stirrups are set for someone much shorter than this man.
LOCKE You think the Others sent someone out here to keep him company?
SAYID I think they sent someone out here because they lost communication.
LOCKE Maybe when the sky turned purple.
SAYID That would be my guess.
LOCKE Well, if they sent somebody out here, they're hiding pretty good. I checked every nook and cranny of this place.
SAYID Not every nook and cranny, John.
SAMI Are you ready to tell me the truth?
SAYID I have already told you the truth. I do not know you.
SAMI You tortured her.
SAYID No, I would never touch a woman. Do you think this will do any good? To make me confess to something I didn't do?
SAMI My wife confessed to something she didn't do. She confessed when you poured a pan of boiling oil all over her arms!
SAYID No I did not-
SAMI Admit it!
SAMI Admit it!
SAYID I can not admit to something I didn't do.
AMIRA That is enough for today.
SAMI Then I will see you tomorrow.
COMPUTER VOICE Your move.
KATE What is it?
SAYID C4. Explosive. The entire place is wired.
KATE Why?
SAYID I don't know.
DR. CANDLE Manual override complete. For pallet drop enter 24. For station uplink enter 32. for mainland communication enter 38.
DR. CANDLE The satellite dish is inoperable. Communications are down. For sonar access enter 56.
DR. CANDLE Sonar is inoperable. Has there been an incursion of this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
MIKHAIL Keep your voice low, and your hands in front of you.
SAYID Stop right there. Put the gun on the ground, now.
SAYID What are you doing?
KATE It's her! She was there! She was at the dock! She was there when we got kidnapped! She knows where Jack is!
SAYID Are there any more of you here?
SAYID Let's take her upstairs. John, we're coming up! John!
LOCKE Out here!
MIKHAIL This is simple. Send her over to me and I release him, and we all go our separate ways.
LOCKE Don't listen to him. If he was going to kill me, I'd be dead already.
MIKHAIL Shut your mouth!
SAYID Listen to me.
LOCKE Sayid, do not let her go.
MIKHAIL I will execute you right here!
LOCKE He's not going to do it!
SAYID Be quiet, John!
LOCKE I'm the only thing keeping him alive!
MIKHAIL I swear to you!
MS. KLUGH Михаил. 
SAYID Calm down everyone!
MS. KLUGH Михаил! Ты знаешь что делать. 
MIKHAIL У нас есть ещё выход. 
LOCKE Sayid!
SAYID I'll handle this, John.
KATE John...
MS. KLUGH Мы не можем рисковать. 
MIKHAIL нет. 
MS. KLUGH Ты знаешь условия. 
MIKHAIL Есть другой выход. 
MS. KLUGH Они взяли нас. Мы не дадим им пройти на территорию. 
LOCKE Don't let her talk to him!
MS. KLUGH Ты знаешь что делать. 
SAYID Mikhail!
MS. KLUGH Это приказ! 
MIKHAIL У нас всё ещё есть выход! 
SAYID Stop!
MS. KLUGH Just do it, Mikhail!
MIKHAIL Прости меня. 
SAYID John!
MIKHAIL Finish it! Kill me.
HURLEY Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.
SAWYER Sorry you hustled me, you mean.
HURLEY My mom had a table in her basement. And I played a lot at the instit— this place I hung out at. And I got kinda good.
SAWYER Well, hooray for you.
HURLEY Looks like that last slam didn’t cause any long-term damage to your forehead. And you got three points which is better than nothing.
SAWYER Is there something you want?
HURLEY I came to give you back your stuff. Cause I know you're the kind of guy who needs stuff.
SAWYER Are you a shrink now?
HURLEY She'll be ok, dude- Kate. I know you're worried about her. But she's with Locke and Sayid. She's going to be fine.
SAWYER Well, thanks for the pep talk—
HURLEY Uh uh. It's Hurley. Or Hugo if you want.
SAWYER Get bent, Hugo.
KATE Ready to go, Locke?
LOCKE Be there in a minute!
DR. CANDLE Has there be an incursion on this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
SAYID Danielle! Danielle! Tell me something. Were you ever a member of the DHARMA Initiative? Or was everything you said a lie? Of course, I'm wasting my breath.
MIKHAIL I was never a member. But everything else I told you was true. I moved into this station after the purge.
SAYID The purge? In which a group of scientists attacked your people?
MIKHAIL Believe what you want, but that is what happened.
ROUSSEAU Your friends, did he kill them?
SAYID No. They are collecting whatever is useful from the farmhouse. And now we have our ticket to where the Others live, where we will find your daughter, and Jack, and finally, perhaps, a way home.
MIKHAIL There is nothing you could do to me to make me lead you there.
SAYID I didn't say you were our ticket, did I? This is a map showing electrical and data cabling running from the Flame, here, to a place called the Barracks, here. It's comprised of houses and dormitories, with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community. Sounds like a place well worth visiting, don't you think?
MIKHAIL There will come a time when your guard is down. And when it is, I will not hesitate a moment before killing you. You should know this before you--
ROUSSEAU He is making an excellent point. You have a map. Why keep him alive?
AMIRA After my husband and I first arrived to Paris, I was afraid to ever leave our apartment. So I would stare out in the window into the alley, and I would see this cat looking for scraps. One day some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box. I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box. I could hear him howl from three stories above. So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment. I rescued this cat and I brought him home. He sits with me when I read, sleeps with me, and he purrs. But, every once in a while, he will bite me or scratch me. He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now. So I forgive him when he bites me, because I remember what it is like to never feel safe. And that is because of you. So today, I ask only one thing of you I ask you now to show me the respect by acknowledging what you did to me. That it was you who questioned me, tortured me and that you remember me.
SAYID I remember you. I remember your face. Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq. I am sorry. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I am sorry.
AMIRA I forgive you. When my husband returns, I will tell I made a terrible mistake, that it was not you, and he will release you.
SAYID Why? Why are you letting me go?
AMIRA We are all capable of doing what those children did to this cat. But I will not do that. I will not be that.
ROUSSEAU We should kill him, Sayid. He already told us he would kill us.
SAYID No. He's my prisoner. I will decide his fate.
SAYID I can see you didn't see anything worth taking.
LOCKE Actually I just played that silly chess game again. And now I can see why you didn't want me to beat it.
SAYID Meaning what?
SAYID What have you done, John? That place was our one hope of communication with the outside world!
LOCKE The computer said that if there was an incursion of the station by the Hostiles, I should enter 77. So I entered 77.
SAYID We should go. If anyone is around this explosion's going to attract their attention.
