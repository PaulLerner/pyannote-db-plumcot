CHARLIE You're insane mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
HURLEY Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by The Flash.
CHARLIE But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
HURLEY Er, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
CHARLIE Oohh vibration, whatever would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
HURLEY Well, no smashing allowed.
CHARLIE No flying, no smashing, any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite...
CHARLIE The hell?
HURLEY Charlie!
JIN 가만히 있어!
DESMOND Don't, don't touch it.
HURLEY Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
DESMOND Just breathe, just breathe huh.
DESMOND Don't try to talk mate. We've gotta get back.
JIN No, you help!
DESMOND I can't help! I'm sorry mate.
HURLEY Hey, here it is.
CHARLIE Superman can fly around the entire planet...
DESMOND Hey. Where's the wire?
HURLEY D'you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
DESMOND Listen to me, there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. Do you know what I'm talking about?
HURLEY This is future crap, isn't it?
DESMOND The cable, do you know where it is?! This is important.
HURLEY Why?
CHARLIE Superman can...
DESMOND Because someone's coming.
MONK God tests our faith in many ways. So, as you well know, we have our own test here. A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit. This challenges both one's patience and his faith. For some, it may last a week. Those we are less sure about, a month. Personally, Desmond, I never thought you'd last. And so now I stand corrected. For whatever reason, your path has led you here. And now you're one of us. Welcome, brother.
DESMOND Thank you, brother.
DESMOND Morning, Jack. Must be nice to wake up in your own bed.
JACK Yep, home sweet home.
DESMOND Listen, I was wondering if I could borrow your first-aid kit. Er, twisted my ankle.
JACK You want me to take a look at it?
DESMOND Nah, you're alright. I've taped my share of ankles.
JACK Right.
DESMOND Thanks.
JACK Something wrong Hurley?
HURLEY Nah, uh uh, just, keeping Desmond here company. 'Cause, we're friends.
JACK Bring that back when you're done with it, OK?
DESMOND Absolutely.
DESMOND What the hell was that? Do you want him to get suspicious?
HURLEY Suspicious of what? Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it? That's why you got the first-aid kit, someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me?
DESMOND No. It's just a precaution.
HURLEY Look, dude. You want me to take you to the wire, I want an explanation.
DESMOND I saw a sequence of events. Things that are gonna happen.
HURLEY What'd you see?
DESMOND It was, it was like a sorta jigsaw puzzle. Only I didn't have the picture in the box, so I dunno how the pieces fit exactly, but... but one of the pieces, the first one...
DESMOND ... It was you, pulling the cable out the sand.
HURLEY So what are the other pieces?
DESMOND If I tell you that, it'll change the picture in the box.
HURLEY So what? Isn't that the point? Preventing something bad?
DESMOND Not this time.
HURLEY So you're not trying to stop something from happening, you actually want it to happen.
DESMOND More than anything.
SAWYER Hey Freckles, you home?
KATE Thought you weren't allowed to use nicknames.
SAWYER Well, you weren't around when I lost the bet, so you're—
SAWYER ...Exempt.
KATE What's up?
SAWYER Uh, I wanted to ask you something.
KATE Yep.
KATE I'm up here.
SAWYER Uh ... so did you tell him?
KATE Did I tell who what?
SAWYER You know, did you tell the Doc? About you and me.
KATE No. But he knows. He saw us on one of those surveillance monitors.
SAWYER I thought you said the camera was broken?
KATE Well they had another camera.
SAWYER Perverts.
KATE Anyway, he knows.
SAWYER Well, now that... that's out of the way, maybe a little afternoon delight?
SAWYER It means sex.
KATE I know.
SAWYER Come on, Freckles, wait, now look, you need me to make ya a mix tape?
KATE Yeah, why don't you do that.
HURLEY Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. What do we need Jin for?
DESMOND Because he was there with us.
HURLEY On the beach, when I find the cable.
HURLEY Here it is!
DESMOND That's right.
HURLEY In one of your puzzle flashes.
DESMOND Aye.
HURLEY So, if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about.
DESMOND That'd be the long and short of it. But I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
HURLEY Watch the master.
JIN Camping?
HURLEY Yeah, you know, like sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach. Marshmallows.
JIN Camping.
JIN Yes.
HURLEY Everybody likes marshmallows.
DESMOND Good man. Get food, water.
HURLEY Where are you going?
DESMOND We need one more.
CHARLIE How daft do you think I am? This isn't a camping trip. You've had another one of your visions, haven't you? What was it this time?
DESMOND Someone's coming to the Island.
CHARLIE Coming? As in someone who's not already here, how the hell is that gonna happen?
DESMOND Can't tell ya.
CHARLIE It's got nothing to do with me?
DESMOND Well, you're a part of it, yeah. As are Jin and Hurley.
CHARLIE Right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.
DESMOND Well, that's not gonna happen. Not this time.
CHARLIE Can I bring my guitar?
DESMOND Absolutely.
CHARLIE Alright, I'm in. You had me worried there for a second.
HURLEY This is it.
DESMOND But, how can you tell?
HURLEY 'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle.
DESMOND Where is it then?
JIN 이거지?
HURLEY Way to go, dude!
HURLEY Here it is!
HURLEY Just one thing, last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death-trap things.
DESMOND Cut her down!
DESMOND We're not going in the jungle, well, not yet. It's getting late, so we'll, er, we'll camp here the night.
JIN Camp.
CHARLIE So when do they get here? Your mysterious someone.
DESMOND Soon.
MONK You do realize you are free to talk again, Brother Desmond.
DESMOND Used to being quiet, I suppose.
DESMOND Moriah. I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here, interesting.
MONK And why is that brother?
DESMOND Well, Moriah's the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. It's not exactly the most... festive locale, is it?
MONK And yet God spared Isaac.
DESMOND Well, one might argue then, God may not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place.
MONK Well, then it wouldn't have been much of a test, would it brother? Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice.
MONK 2 Brother Desmond. Brother Desmond. I met this man waiting at the gates, he says he needs to have a word with you.
MAN Sorry, sir.
DESMOND Forgive me, brother.
KATE Hey.
JACK Hey.
KATE The oatmeal's awesome.
JACK It is, huh?
KATE It's strange, huh?
JACK What's that?
KATE Being back. Not... looking for a way out of a cage. Not... finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again. I almost don't know what to do with myself.
JACK Well, enjoy it, I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough.
KATE Well, my big dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes, in the ocean.
JACK Be careful.
KATE I'll try.
JACK Erm, can I borrow that spoon?
KATE Yeah.
JACK Thanks. Good night.
KATE Yeah, good night.
SAWYER What, my doorbell busted again? What the hell are you doing?
KATE Shut up and don't talk.
SAWYER You crying?
KATE I said shut up.
SAWYER You got it.
JIN '하느님, 감사합니다. 저는 갈고리 손인줄 알고 무서웠어요.' 그러니까 그 남자가 웃으면서 이 말 했지. '걱정 마세요, 소녀 아가씨. 내 갈고리 손은 니 애비 머리 속에 아직도... shout 박혀 있다!'
HURLEY Dude, I love the part about the bird. It was a bird right?
JIN You.
HURLEY Me? OK, erm, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra..
JIN Chupa...?
HURLEY Yeah, like a bear with spines...
DESMOND Thanks.
CHARLIE Who's that?
DESMOND Her name's Penny.
CHARLIE That's not bad, Des. Not bad at all. So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?
DESMOND Because I'm a coward.
CHARLIE Sorry.
DESMOND You and me both pal. You know, I tried to run away from her, and she, she tracked me down. With enough money and determination, you can find anyone, she said. And I used to wake up at nights, thinking if she actually meant it, that she never gave up, that maybe she's spent the last three years looking for me.
HURLEY What's that?
CHARLIE Is that a helicopter?
JIN Rescue!
HURLEY Uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?
DESMOND No.
HURLEY We gotta go out there.
CHARLIE Out there?
HURLEY Well, yeah.
CHARLIE In what?
HURLEY Well, we gotta do something.
JIN Look.
DESMOND Oh my god.
JIN Pallet.
HURLEY Nah, dude, it's not a food drop, you saw the beacon thing, someone like ejected.
CHARLIE Yeah, but that was a helicopter, you can't eject from a helicopter.
HURLEY Well, maybe they jumped. All that matters is that they're here.
CHARLIE They, how do we even know it's a person?
HURLEY 'Cause he said someone was coming.
CHARLIE Where you going?
DESMOND Out to where it fell. Come on, let's go.
CHARLIE No, whoa, slow down. We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
DESMOND Yes we are.
CHARLIE Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death-trap? Now, it's going to be light in two hours, we'll wait until then.
DESMOND She can't wait.
CHARLIE She?
DESMOND They. Whoever it is... could be hurt. We have to go, all four of us, now.
CHARLIE Why?
DESMOND Because that's the way its supposed to happen.
CHARLIE Right, well, I guess, it's supposed to happen without me.
DESMOND We'll leave at first light then. Together.
CHARLIE Terrific.
DESMOND Is your sister in?
MAN Leave. Now.
WOMAN Let him be, Derek.
DESMOND Hello, Ruth.
RUTH So you're a monk now, are ya?
DESMOND Well, technically, I'm still what they call a novice, 'til the abbey...
RUTH Why are you here, Desmond?
DESMOND Well, now that my initiation's done, I felt like I owed you an explanation.
RUTH Desmond. You can never begin to explain what you did. You left one week before the wedding, everything was planned, bought and paid for. You just disappeared completely.
DESMOND I had a calling.
RUTH We dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup.
DESMOND OK, yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe, and I... I raised my eyes, and I asked, am I doing the right thing, and that's the last thing I remember. And when I woke up, I was lying on my back in the street, and I dunno how I got there, and... there was this man standing over me, Ruth. And he reached out his hand, and he said to me, "Can I help you brother?". And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied round his waist, and... I looked at him... and I knew. I knew... I was supposed to go with him. I was supposed to leave everything that mattered behind, sacrifice all of it... for a greater calling.
RUTH Well, it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep wouldn't you? Next time you want to break up with someone, Des, don't join a monastery. Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared.
JACK You a doctor or a carpenter?
JULIET What, your dad never taught you to use a hammer?
JACK No, my dad taught me how to drink.
JULIET Oh, at least it's something.
SAWYER Hope I'm not interrupting. You two arguing over who's your favourite Other?
JACK What do you want, Sawyer?
SAWYER Well, what I wanted, Doc, was to inform you there's been some developments since you were AWOL. So tell me...
SAWYER ...How's your backhand?
JACK So where'd you get the table?
SAWYER Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo. We don't play every hundred and eight minutes, the Island's gonna explode!
SAWYER Finally, something I can beat you at.
JACK You know, considering I haven't played since I was 12, I wouldn't be too proud. What's that, 18th point?
SAWYER It's kinda strange, huh? Being back.
SAWYER Something funny?
JACK Er, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night.
SAWYER She did huh.
JACK She did.
JACK Nineteenth point.
SAWYER So you guys ate together, huh?
JACK No, Juliet and I had dinner together last night.
SAWYER Huh.
JACK Best two out of three?
SAWYER You got it.
CHARLIE So what's next?
DESMOND Next?
CHARLIE Yeah, you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky. Now what? Maybe I can help you find--
DESMOND That's it, there is no next. We find the beacon.
CHARLIE Why you lying to me mate?
DESMOND Look, mate. I've saved your life three times now. If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. Let's move.
HURLEY Dude, seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.
DESMOND Actually you're not. And if you don't get a move on, we're not gonna make it before nightfall—
CHARLIE Hey.
CHARLIE Look at this.
JIN 이건 도대체 어디서 난 거야?
CHARLIE It can't be Rousseau's. If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now.
DESMOND Don't move.
HURLEY What are you doing? Ow. Ah, ahh!!!
HURLEY Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?
JIN Walkie-talkie!
HURLEY No, dude. That's a satellite phone.
HURLEY Crap, it's dead.
CHARLIE Shocker.
DESMOND Oh my god.
HURLEY Is that you? And who is she?
CHARLIE That would be Penny.
KATE What's this?
SAWYER Your mixtape.
SAWYER Well, you gonna take it or ain't ya?
KATE The best of Phil Collins, huh?
SAWYER Don't get picky. And if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it.
KATE Thanks, James.
SAWYER So why'd you jump me last night?
KATE What?
SAWYER Was it 'cause you saw the Doc hanging out with Juliet?
KATE It is not like that.
SAWYER It's not? You ain't gotta use me Freckles, all you gotta do is ask.
CHARLIE You think it's her, don't you?
DESMOND Who?
CHARLIE Your girl. Penny. You think its actually her who bailed out the helicopter.
DESMOND Earlier I hoped it. Now I know it.
CHARLIE Why didn't you tell us?
DESMOND Would you come if I had?
CHARLIE Of course. Why wouldn't I?
DESMOND I didn't wanna tell you because... I didn't want anything to change.
CHARLIE Fair enough. Look, if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued, why would we want to change anything, right?
DESMOND Right.
DESMOND Right.
HURLEY Thanks for the heads up about bringing an umbrella, dude.
DESMOND Well it's a grand old team to play for, and it's a grand old team to see. And if you know your history, it's...
MONK Brother Desmond. What are you doing?
DESMOND Well, I believe I'm... getting pissed on our lovely wine.
MONK That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over a hundred quid. We've only bottled a hundred and eight cases this year.
DESMOND Well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it?
MONK We've also taken a vow of charity.
DESMOND Right.
MONK Something tells me, Desmond, that you're not cut out to be a monk.
DESMOND Well... ah, you know, I, I've had a tough week. I'm sorry for the wine. I'll take the penance.
MONK I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond.
DESMOND Brother Desmond.
MONK Not any more.
DESMOND Are you firing me?
MONK I am indeed.
DESMOND You can't do that, I heard the call.
MONK I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you were meant to end up. I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond. Bigger plans—
DESMOND Oh aye, I'm sure he does.
MONK He does! You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward.
DESMOND Hey. What am I supposed to do now?
MONK Whatever comes next.
JIN Who's Penny?
HURLEY She's a chick Desmond used to date. And now he thinks she fell from the sky. So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued... Dude, even if I spoke Korean, it wouldn't make any sense.
DESMOND Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. She might be hurt.
HURLEY I'm moving as fast as I can. In case you haven't noticed dude, I'm not exactly the Flash.
CHARLIE The Flash is pathetic.
HURLEY You got something against the fastest man alive?
CHARLIE You're insane, mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
HURLEY Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by the Flash.
CHARLIE But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
HURLEY Uh, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
CHARLIE Oohh vibration, and what would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
HURLEY Well, no smashing allowed.
CHARLIE No flying, no smashing... any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite ballet slippers...
CHARLIE The hell?
DESMOND Ahh, Charlie, duck!
HURLEY Dude.
JIN This way.
DESMOND No, the beacon fell this side of the rise.
JIN No, there.
HURLEY How about we split up? Me and Charlie go that way, you and Jin go round, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there.
CHARLIE Uh, you and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.
CHARLIE You said "duck."
DESMOND Sorry.
CHARLIE You shouted "duck." You knew, even before we set off. You knew all this time, didn't you?
DESMOND Aye.
CHARLIE Well, then why didn't you say anything?
DESMOND Because if I'd told you the truth, you wouldn't have come!
CHARLIE Oh, and you needed me to come. 'Cause I was part of your vision. You thought that the only way you could get your girl back was if I took an arrow in the head. You would have sacrificed me!
DESMOND If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.
CHARLIE What's that supposed to mean?
DESMOND It means it's bloody pointless. I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? Its just gonna keep happening again and again, maybe that's the point, eh? Maybe it's a test.
CHARLIE Test?
DESMOND Like God testing Abraham, except I failed, because I changed what I saw.
JIN 빨리 와, 찾았어!
JIN 우리 하는 말 들려요?
HURLEY Hey! Hey, can you hear me?!
JIN Hello! 괜찮아?
HURLEY Dude, she's not moving.
DESMOND I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.
MONK I was afraid you'd leave without saying goodbye.
DESMOND No.
DESMOND I nearly took this with me.
MONK If you're not in a hurry, Brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours; he can give you a ride. That is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting.
MONK All 10 cases are ready to go. Desmond there is just getting the last one.
PENNY Thank you, and my father sent the check in advance.
MONK Please thank him for his generous donation. Always a pleasure to see you.
MONK Goodbye Desmond.
PENNY I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not, we'll put the rest in the front. Is that alright?
DESMOND Absolutely.
DESMOND You better drive safe, Miss. This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year.
PENNY Is that so?
DESMOND Aye, it's 'cause the monks are lazy.
DESMOND Yeah, its easier making grape jelly than wine.
PENNY And how do you know so much about monks?
DESMOND Cause I'm an ex-monk.
PENNY Really?
DESMOND As of last night. I was fired.
DESMOND Oh, it wasn't that funny.
PENNY I'm sorry, I've never, I... I didn't know monks could be fired.
DESMOND Oh, they can. You know, I was told under no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up. It's just a... step along a path. You know, God allegedly has bigger plans for me.
PENNY Something tells me you don't entirely believe that.
DESMOND I suspect that's because I don't.
PENNY Well, maybe they're right. I mean, just think, if you hadn't got fired, we wouldn't have met, and then, how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle?
DESMOND Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
PENNY Not yet.
PENNY I mean, of course, if an ex-monk already has plans, then...
DESMOND You know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers.
PENNY Well, in that case I'm Penelope. Penny.
DESMOND Desmond. Very nice to meet you, Penny.
HURLEY She's alive!
DESMOND Stand back! Get away from her! I'm here, I'm here, Penny.
CHARLIE Just, be careful.
DESMOND Just get off, Charlie! Sorry Penny, I'm sorry.
WOMAN Desmond...
