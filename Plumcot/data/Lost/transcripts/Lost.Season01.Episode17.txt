woojung_paik PAIK 내 딸과 결혼하려는 이유가 뭔가?
jinsoo_kwon 아버님 -- 지금은 보잘 것 없는 시골 출신이지만, 제게는 야망이 있습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 야망이라… 그게 뭐지?
jinsoo_kwon 우선 식당을 열고… 더 나아지면 호텔을 갖고 싶습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 자네 아버님은 이 결혼에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나?
jinsoo_kwon 제 아버지는… 돌아가셨습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 내 딸을 위해 자네가 뭘 해줄 수 있지?
jinsoo_kwon 뭐든지 하겠습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 내가 시키는 어떤 일도?
jinsoo_kwon 네.
woojung_paik PAIK 꿈을 그렇게 쉽게 파는 사람에게 내 딸을 왜 줘야 하지?
jinsoo_kwon 따님은 -- 제 꿈이니까요. 아버님.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐하고 있어? 정신이 나갔어? 빨리 나와!
sunhwa_kwon 왜 그래요? 수영 좀 하고 나왔는데.
jinsoo_kwon 말이라고 해?
sunhwa_kwon 이 수영복이 어때서 그래요?
jinsoo_kwon 아이 참! 다른 수영복도 있는데 왜 이걸 입어?
sunhwa_kwon 알았어요!
jinsoo_kwon 가자! 아니, 빨리 가자!
dr_jack_shephard There they go again.
claire_littleton Do you think we should do something?
charlie_pace What should we do?
jinsoo_kwon 다른 사람들이 다 보잖아!
michael_dawson What's going on?
kate_austen I don't know, he just walked up and started going off on her again.
sunhwa_kwon 왜 그래요!
jinsoo_kwon 이제 남편 말이 말 같지가 않아?
michael_dawson Hey, hey, hey -- get your hands off of her.
jinsoo_kwon 너랑 상관이 없는 일인데 왜 끼어들어?
michael_dawson I swear to god, you put your hands on her one more time...
jinsoo_kwon 네가 뭔데! 남의 일에 끼어들지 마!
michael_dawson Get your hands off of me.
jinsoo_kwon 저 녀석하고 무슨 일이 있었어?
sunhwa_kwon 누구요?
jinsoo_kwon 마이클 말이야.
sunhwa_kwon 말도 안되는 소리.
jinsoo_kwon 진짜?
sunhwa_kwon 아무 일도 없었어요.
best_friend FRIEND 색깔 너무 예쁘다.
sunhwa_kwon 괜찮아?
best_friend FRIEND 너무 예뻐, 맘에 들어. 너 너무 좋겠다, 결혼도 하고...
sunhwa_kwon 질투하는 거야?
best_friend FRIEND 아니.
jinsoo_kwon 제 와이프랑 단 둘이서 할 얘기가 있는데요.
best_friend FRIEND 선, 손님들 아랫층에 있는거 잊지 마, 알았지?
sunhwa_kwon 어, 알았어.
sunhwa_kwon 자기야, 나 너무 행복해. 아버님이 살아계셔서 우리 결혼식을 보셨더라면 참 좋았을텐데. 미안해요, 내가 괜한말을 했나봐.
jinsoo_kwon 아니야. 괜찮아. 어디에 계시든 기뻐하셨을거야. [Subtitle No. Wherever he is. I'm sure he is proud of me.
sunhwa_kwon 지퍼 좀 올려줄래요?
jinsoo_kwon 꼭 올려야 돼?
sunhwa_kwon 자기야 우리 신혼여행 어떻게 할거야?
jinsoo_kwon 아... 선. 나도 가고 싶지만, 지금은 안 되잖아. 지금은 아버님께 좋은 모습을 보여야 돼.
sunhwa_kwon 내가 아빠 딸인데... 우리 결혼식 하는 걸 가지고 뭐라고 하시겠어? 응?
jinsoo_kwon 6개월 후에, 경영 수업을 마치고 가자.
sunhwa_kwon 아빠 자동차 회사만큼 나도 중요하잖아.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 약속할게. 그땐 우리가 꿈꾸던 멋진 신혼여행이 될거야.
sunhwa_kwon Michael? I'm sorry.
michael_dawson Don't worry. I stuck my nose where it didn't belong. It's on me.
sunhwa_kwon You must understand that-
michael_dawson Look, all I understand is that I've got to get this raft finished so I can get my boy out of here and take him home.
sunhwa_kwon When I slapped you I was protecting you.
michael_dawson Oh, yeah? From what?
sunhwa_kwon From Jin. You don't know what he's capable of.
michael_dawson It's not my problem. It's yours.
hugo_reyes You should try sea urchin. They've got more ping. Hey, so listen, I know things got kind of nasty down there at the beach, and, um, I don't want to get involved in husband and wife stuff, but I figured, you know, you might need to relax. So... C'mon, dude, I'm trying here. Okay, you want to be an outsider? It's your business.
shannon_rutherford I tied this side down. Do you think this is going to hold?
sayid_jarrah Do you have a past in the Navy you neglected to tell me about?
shannon_rutherford Why?
sayid_jarrah How does a woman like you learn to tie a perfect bowline knot?
shannon_rutherford By dating guys with sailboats?
sayid_jarrah Since you bring it up. I've been worried since I first met you that you might end up being a spinster.
shannon_rutherford Spending my Saturday nights alone at home, tying knots?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps with an overweight aunt? It's a very sad image.
shannon_rutherford Maybe we should get some rope, spend a Saturday night alone together, and see what happens.
walt_lloyd Dad...
michael_dawson Thanks. You are going to love New York, Walt. No city like it. You know, what I really want to show you in New York are the buildings, the architecture...
walt_lloyd Buildings?
michael_dawson Yeah, I used to say that, too, 'til I saw the Flat Iron Building.
walt_lloyd What's that?
michael_dawson Oldest skyscraper in the city, built in 1902. And it's flat. That one building inspired me to start drawing and, you know, designing things.
walt_lloyd Why?
michael_dawson You've just got to see it, man. You want to see it, right?
walt_lloyd I guess. Could I go throw the ball to Vincent?
michael_dawson Yeah, sure, of course.
walt_lloyd Come on, Vincent.
dr_jack_shephard Wow, you're making a lot of progress.
michael_dawson Yeah, trying.
dr_jack_shephard It's pretty cool.
michael_dawson Got this bamboo for the decking. Got a piece of the fuselage for a cabin, some storage bins. -- What's up?
dr_jack_shephard I thought I'd give you the heads-up.
michael_dawson Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, there's a lot of talk going on about who's going on this thing with you.
michael_dawson Hey man, it's not the Queen Mary. I've only got room for 4 people. There's one open spot.
dr_jack_shephard Who took the other one?
james_ford What's the matter, Doc? Feelin' left out?
dr_jack_shephard You're taking Sawyer with you?
james_ford Yep, bought myself a ticket on this little tub. Let me tell you, the fare was steep. I could've used that cable to hold up the whole east wing of my new beach house.
dr_jack_shephard You sold him a spot?
michael_dawson I needed the halyards for the mast.
james_ford Good thing I'm a saver, not a spender, huh, Doc?
kate_austen How much longer are you going to let him treat you this way?
sunhwa_kwon Please...
kate_austen Sun...
sunhwa_kwon He's my husband...
kate_austen Yeah, a husband you're afraid to tell you speak English. I'm trying to understand, Sun.
sunhwa_kwon He wasn't always like this. He used to tell me how beautiful I looked to him. He was so tender. And then he was different.
kate_austen What changed him?
kate_austen Hey, Charlie, what's going on?
charlie_pace The raft, it's on fire, look.
michael_dawson No, no, no.
michael_dawson Where is he? Where the hell is he?!
michael_dawson Where is he?
sunhwa_kwon 무슨 말씀 하시는지 모르겠어요.
michael_dawson Where is he?!
dr_jack_shephard She doesn't understand you, man!
michael_dawson Hey! Where is he?
kate_austen Back off.
michael_dawson No, her husband did this, and she knows. You're trying to protect him now, is that it?
kate_austen She was with me!
michael_dawson Walt, hey Walt. Get back. Get back.
walt_lloyd I was...
michael_dawson No, no. It's done.
kate_austen Sun, wait.
michael_dawson I'm going to break his damn neck!
dr_jack_shephard Take it easy, man. We don't know that Jin did this.
james_ford Are you serious?!
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, shut up!
charlie_pace Jack, c'mon, we saw him on the beach this morning.
dr_jack_shephard That doesn't mean that he torched the raft.
michael_dawson Yeah, then who did, Jack?!
sunhwa_kwon 여보, 뭐 하는 거에요?
jinsoo_kwon 좀 다쳤어.
sunhwa_kwon 당신이 이런 거에요? 마이클은... 이 섬에서 우리를 탈출시키려고 노력하는데 왜 그런 사람...
jinsoo_kwon 마이클?
jinsoo_kwon 이번 일은 제가 모두 책임지겠습니다. 공장 기계가 나간 걸 제가 미리 체크하지 못했습니다.
woojung_paik PAIK 자네를 문책하려고 부른게 아니고... 자네 승진 얘기를 하려고 부른거야. 이제 자네가 내 새로운 보좌관이 되어주게.
jinsoo_kwon 회장님, 죄송하지만 무슨 말씀이신지...
woojung_paik PAIK 한병철이라고 아나?
jinsoo_kwon 환경 차관 말씀이십니까?
woojung_paik PAIK 오늘 밤 메시지를 그에게 전달해주게. '내가 섭섭한 점이 참 많아서 그래.'
byung_han 당신 누구시죠?
jinsoo_kwon 안녕하십니까. 전 권진수라고 합니다.
byung_han 무슨 일로 오셨죠?
jinsoo_kwon 백 회장님 밑에서 일하고 있습니다.
byung_han 미스터 권, 네... 들어오세요.
byung_han 우선 이쪽으로 앉으세요. 뭐 마실 것 좀 드릴까요?
jinsoo_kwon 아니 괜찮습니다. 여기 회장님의 메시지를 전하러 왔습니다.
byung_han 제발, 부탁합니다. 우리 딸 앞에서만은...
jinsoo_kwon 회장님이 굉장히 섭섭해 하시는데요... 그 말만...
byung_han 아, 그래요? 고맙습니다. 고마워요! 회장님께 앞으로는 섭섭한 일 없도록 하겠다고 전해주세요. 어떻게라도 사과를 해야 하는데...
byung_han 이 개는 당신께 드리는 선물입니다. 이 개는 품종이 좋은 개에요.
jinsoo_kwon 차관님.
byung_han 정말 비싼 개에요. 회장님께 사과 드린다고 꼭 전해주세요. 그래 주실 수 있죠?
jinsoo_kwon 저는 이걸 받을 수 없습니다.
byung_han 받아주세요. 제발 받아주세요. 고맙습니다. 정말 고맙습니다.
boone_carlyle What do you want?
sayid_jarrah I'd like to talk to you about Shannon. It's very possible your sister and I are going to become more than just friends.
boone_carlyle What is this? Some Middle Eastern thing? You want my blessing or something?
sayid_jarrah My hope is you won't object.
boone_carlyle Yeah?
sayid_jarrah I was extending a courtesy, not asking your permission.
boone_carlyle Let me tell you about my sister. She likes older men, guys who can take care of her. My guess is, in this place, you fit the bill. She'll make you feel like the greatest guy ever while you get her food, or whatever it is that she needs. And when she gets whatever it is that she wants, she'll move on. When she does, don't take it personally, man.
james_ford You messed up my ride, Chief.
shannon_rutherford Hey, there you are. Come, help me with this, I'm completely destroying it.
sayid_jarrah You seem to be doing just fine.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, in trying making it collapse.
sayid_jarrah You're very capable, Shannon. I'm sure you'll be alright building it on your own.
shannon_rutherford What's going on?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps you should find another friend to help you with your shelter.
shannon_rutherford You've been talking to my brother, haven't you?
shannon_rutherford Oh, gross.
john_locke Gross to you, dinner to me.
shannon_rutherford Boone, where is he?
john_locke Don't know.
shannon_rutherford What do you mean you don't know? You two are like jungle pals.
john_locke Sorry, I haven't seen him.
shannon_rutherford Well, if you do see him, tell him to keep his stupid mouth shut. And if he does have something to say, he can leave Sayid out of it, and come say it to my face.
john_locke Should I be writing this down?
shannon_rutherford Just tell him to stay the hell out of my business.
john_locke Do you like him?
shannon_rutherford What?
john_locke Sayid.
shannon_rutherford Are you serious?
john_locke Because if you do -- like him, what's it got to do with your brother? You're a grown woman. Sure, you can yell at Boone 'til you're blue in the face, but all you're doing is giving him what he wants.
shannon_rutherford Yeah, what's that?
john_locke Your attention. Everyone gets a new life on this Island, Shannon. Maybe it's time you start yours.
james_ford You're pretty scared, huh? Scared, you understand scared, don't you? Huh? If you ain't, you're going to be, Bruce. Folks down on the beach might have been doctors and accountants a month ago, but it's Lord of the Flies time, now.
sunhwa_kwon 계속 걷고... 여기서 스톱! 돌고, 앉으세요. 쨘!
jinsoo_kwon 와... 진수성찬이네. 당신이 만들었어?
sunhwa_kwon 그럼... 자기를 위해서 만들었지. 우리 오랜만에 같이 저녁식사하는 거니까 맛있게 드세요.
jinsoo_kwon 그래, 아주 잘 했어.
jinsoo_kwon 걱정 마. 오늘은 일 안 해.
sunhwa_kwon 정말 고마워요.
jinsoo_kwon 그래, 나도 고마워.
sunhwa_kwon 이거 먹어봐요.
woojung_paik PAIK 내 공장 문 닫게 만들었다 이거지? 메시지 못 전한 네 무능력 때문에 몇십 억을 손해본 줄 알아!
woojung_paik PAIK 한병철 집에 이 사람 데려다 줘. 이 사람 하는 걸 보고 잘 배워!
white_suit SUIT 2분 안에 처리할 테니 시동은 끄지 마시오. 내가 일 끝내고 돌아오면 빨리 운전해서... 시내와 떨어진 한가한 강가로 갑시다. 알겠소?
byung_han 여보! 빨리 피해! 미스터 권, 내 말 좀 들어봐!
jinsoo_kwon 내일 바로 공장 문 열어! 내가 당신 목숨을 구했다는 걸 명심해. 이 정도면 알아듣겠죠.
sunhwa_kwon 여보... 여보! 말 좀 해봐. 다쳤어? 이 피는 누구 피야? 밖에서 무슨 일 있었구나, 어? 밖에서 무슨 일 있었냐구?
jinsoo_kwon 일 하고 왔어.
sunhwa_kwon 일 하고 왔다구? 도대체 아빠 밑에서 무슨 일을 하는거야?
jinsoo_kwon 아버님이 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 다 우리를 위해서 하는거야.
dr_jack_shephard Michael! Take it easy!
michael_dawson I'll take it easy, alright!
hugo_reyes Hang on, man. You've got to slow down. Slow down!
michael_dawson Hey, man. You burn my raft?!
dr_jack_shephard Just calm down. Calm down and take a breath.
michael_dawson You burn my raft?! Why'd you burn my raft, man?!
dr_jack_shephard Just calm down, and think about it for a minute.
michael_dawson Look at his hands, man. They're burned.
james_ford Back off, Jack. It's got nothing to do with you.
dr_jack_shephard Shut it!
hugo_reyes Look, everybody chill out.
jinsoo_kwon 당신도 나를 못 믿겠어?
michael_dawson What'd he say?
jinsoo_kwon 난 아니야.
michael_dawson You said something to me?!
dr_jack_shephard Michael.
jinsoo_kwon 난 아니야!
michael_dawson Say it again!?
dr_jack_shephard Michael, Michael.
michael_dawson No, no, no. Say it again, man.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 불 지른게 아니야!
dr_jack_shephard Michael.
jinsoo_kwon 알았어? 어?
dr_jack_shephard Hey!
james_ford Easy, Doc. One fight at a time.
sayid_jarrah He's right. This is between them.
jinsoo_kwon 내가 갔을 땐 이미 불타고 있었어!
jinsoo_kwon 불 끄려다가 내 손이 이렇게 된거야. 손을 좀 봐.
sunhwa_kwon Stop it!! Leave him alone.
sunhwa_kwon He didn't burn your raft.
charlie_pace You speak English?
hugo_reyes Didn't see that coming.
dr_jack_shephard You understood us? All this time? Why didn't you say anything?
sunhwa_kwon Your raft was already on fire when he arrived. He burned his hands trying to put it out.
michael_dawson Then why did he run?
sunhwa_kwon 잘못하지 않았는데 왜 도망쳤냐고 이 사람이 물어보네요.
michael_dawson Exactly, that's what I thought.
sunhwa_kwon My husband is many things. But he is not a liar.
james_ford You're going to lecture us about lying, Betty? From the look on his face, even your old man here didn't know you speak English. How do we know she's not covering for him?
john_locke Because she's isn't! Why would he burn the raft?
michael_dawson He's been after me since day one, everybody knows it! What if-
john_locke Okay, it's personal, but why take it out on our best chance of getting off the Island? Why would any one of us block an attempt to get home? We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth that the problem isn't here, it's there! They've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us! Maybe it's time we stop blaming us and start worrying about them! We're not the only people on this Island and we all know it!
sunhwa_kwon He did not do it.
michael_dawson I can't salvage a thing -- pontoons, the decking. Fire burned up all the twine! Damn it!! Damn it!! God! I'm sorry, man.
walt_lloyd It's okay.
michael_dawson No. Come here. Come here. Look, we all have set-backs. I mean, God knows, man. It's just life, we'll start over.
walt_lloyd You're going to building another one?
michael_dawson Yeah. A better one.
walt_lloyd Can I help?
michael_dawson No doubt you can help. Come on.
sunhwa_kwon 지금 뭐 하는 거에요? 말 좀 해 봐요! 어딜 가게요? 해변으로 가게요? 우리 관계를 이런 식으로 정리하고 싶어요? 뗏목에 대해서... 왜 나한테 사실을 말해주지 않았죠? 대답하기 싫어요? 나한테 이러는 이유를 모르겠어. 내가 뭘 잘못했는데? 우리가 언제부터 이렇게 대화가 안 됐어요! I was going to leave you! I was going to get away. But you made me change my mind. You made me think that you still loved me. 나... 처음부터 다시 시작하고 싶어. 여보... 우리 새롭게 시작해요, 네?
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 진수야!
jinsoo_kwon 죄송해요, 아버지... 용서하세요. 아버지가... 부끄러웠어요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 괜찮다, 괜찮아.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 그래, 네 색시는 어떤 사람이야?
jinsoo_kwon 아주 예쁘고, 똑똑하고... 고집 있는 친구에요. 요즘은... 대화도 없어요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 아니 왜 말을 안해?
jinsoo_kwon 아버님에 대한 진실을... 그 애에게 직접 얘기할 수가 없어요. 진실을 알게 되면... 나보다 아버님을 더 미워할테니까요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 진수야, 지금은 살기 좋은 세상이다.
jinsoo_kwon 제가 어떤 일을 저질렀는지 아버지는 모르실 거에요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 너는 내 아들이야. 니가 무슨 일을 하든 상관 없어.
jinsoo_kwon 다시 시작하고 싶어요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 아니 그럼 왜 다시 못해?
jinsoo_kwon 제가 하는 일이 좋지...
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 아니, 니 부인보다 더 중요한 게 있어?
jinsoo_kwon 장인 어른은 제게 시드니와 LA에 있는 더러운 거래자에게 시계를 전달하라고 하셨어요.
FATHER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode17 그러면 이번일을 마지막으로 네 장인한테 해주고... 진수야. 손 떼고, 다신 하지 마. 그리고 미국으로 가. 응? 그래서 너의 결혼을 살려라.
jinsoo_kwon 그러기에는... 너무 늦었어.
sayid_jarrah What was that for?
shannon_rutherford Everyone gets a new life on this Island. I'd like to start now.
john_locke Got yourself an opponent?
walt_lloyd Hurley owes me 83,000 dollars. I told him I'd give him a chance to win it back.
john_locke It's been awhile since you and I played. I don't have 83,000 dollars.
walt_lloyd That's okay.
john_locke Where's your pop?
walt_lloyd Down at the beach, I think. I'm not allowed to leave the caves after dark. You have a dad?
john_locke Everyone's got a dad.
walt_lloyd Is he cool?
john_locke No. No, he's not.
walt_lloyd Yes!
john_locke Good for you. Hey, you mind if I ask you something?
walt_lloyd Sure.
john_locke Why did you burn the raft, Walt? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell. You must've had a really good reason.
walt_lloyd I don't want to move anymore. I've been moving places my whole life. I like it here.
john_locke I like it here, too.
jinsoo_kwon Boat.
hugo_reyes Son of a bitch.
