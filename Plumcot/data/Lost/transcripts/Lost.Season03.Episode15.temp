KATE Ah!
JULIET I was just bringing you something to eat. Enjoy your sandwich.
.
TRUCK DRIVER Been on the road a while, huh?
KATE How long's it gonna take?
TRUCK DRIVER Well your fan belt's shot. Take two days, maybe three.
KATE Three days for a fan belt?
TRUCK DRIVER Welcome to Iowa. Name's Johnny.
KATE I'm Lucy.
CASSIDY They're all 18-carat gold. 
MAN Come on, those don't look real. I'm not buying them. 
JOHNNY If you need a lift into town, I'm finished up here in an hour.
MAN Call the cops!
CASSIDY Ah fine, whatever! Your loss.
JOHNNY Hey, there a problem buddy?
MAN Yeah, yeah, there's a problem. I'm getting scammed here, that's a problem.
CASSIDY Look, I'm sorry.
MAN What'ya think, I'm an idiot?
CASSIDY Hey man if you don't wanna buy 'em you don't have to buy 'em.
MAN Those are fake necklaces, and you're a rip-off artist.
CASSIDY They're real.
MAN Call the cops.
CASSIDY If you don't want 'em, I'll sell 'em to somebody else...
KATE Hey, lemme see those. My father owns a jewelery store, I think I can spot a fake. How much?
CASSIDY Sixty bucks.
KATE I'll take the one on the end.
MAN Whatever.
CASSIDY Thanks.
KATE Yeah. Can I get my money back?
CASSIDY Hey! Why'd you help me?
KATE Just one girl watching another girl's back I guess.
CASSIDY Or, you're stranded here, and for some reason you didn't want that guy calling the cops.
CASSIDY I'll give ya a ride into town, you buy me a drink.
KATE What?
LOCKE Kate.
KATE John! What are you doing? Did they capture you?
LOCKE Yes, but, only temporarily. I came to say goodbye.
KATE Goodbye?
LOCKE I'm leaving with them.
KATE The hell is going on, I mean, what are they doing to you, are you brainwashed? Where did Jack go?
LOCKE Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate. He's gonna have to stay behind like you.
KATE You can't trust them. If they told you that they're going to take you home, they're lying—
LOCKE I don't want to go home, Kate. I want you to know, I made a strong case for you. I told them that you were a good person. Reliable, smart, honest. And then they told me who you were and what you had done. Let's just say forgiveness isn't one of their strong suits. Good luck.
KATE John, where are you going?
LOCKE Coming out!
KATE Hey, just... Where is Jack, and where is Sayid, have you seen Rousseau?
KATE John, please, what's happened to you?
LOCKE I'm sorry, Kate.
SAWYER The hell's wrong with you?
HURLEY Don't look at me and pretend we're not talking. I'm not supposed to be here.
SAWYER Good, then scram.
HURLEY Dude, you need to know that... there's been some chatter. After Paulo and Nikki and everything. Well, tomorrow there's gonna to be a vote.
SAWYER A vote for what?
HURLEY To decide whether or not to banish you.
SAWYER Banish me?! Where?!
HURLEY Well, there's debate about that, but the consensus was half a mile down the beach.
SAWYER Consensus?
HURLEY I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it. To, like, make amends.
SAWYER I don't do amends.
HURLEY Might wanna ask yourself, about all the good stuff that comes from being a part of this... society. I mean you can't even feed yourself. You use our latrine, drink the water that Steve brings every morning to the trough—
SAWYER Er...
HURLEY What?
SAWYER You know how for three days, ten hours and fifteen minutes I ain't allowed to use nicknames?
HURLEY Yeah?
SAWYER Well, you, Sir Hugo, are rotund, annoying, and you're ruining my damned view. How's that for amends?
HURLEY You're making a big mistake, dude.
SAWYER Banish me...
CASSIDY How 'bout you tell me your name?
KATE It's Lucy.
CASSIDY And what's your real name? Next time somebody asks you, don't think about it.
KATE I didn't thi--
CASSIDY Not even for a second.
CASSIDY So, why Lucy?
KATE She's a saint. Memorized them all in Sunday school so I figured they're probably still all rattling around my brain.
CASSIDY What makes a girl who went to Sunday school scared of cops?
KATE A few months ago, I killed my stepfather, and escaped from the Marshal who arrested me for it.
CASSIDY Why?
KATE Cause he was a bad guy.
CASSIDY So, the hell are you doing in Iowa?
KATE I wanna talk to my mother.
CASSIDY You're gonna have a real hard time doing that. Because if you did what you just said you did, then the Feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.
KATE I'll figure something out.
CASSIDY Oh you will, huh?
KATE What, you wanna help me?
CASSIDY Absolutely.
KATE Why?
CASSIDY I fell in love with the wrong guy. And then I gave him my life savings. He conned me, and embarrassed me. He was a bad guy. So, I'll help you get the meeting with your Mom, Lucy, because one of us deserves something good.
SAWYER I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.
SAWYER Oh, oh, what the... shoo! Come here, come on...
SAWYER Alright, let's do it.
HURLEY Do what?
SAWYER I'm ready to do it. Make amends. Change the vote. I don't wanna be banished, OK? You happy?
HURLEY Dude you stink. What is that, fish?
SAWYER No.
HURLEY Did you try to gut one yourself? How have you not learned that by now? I mean we've been here like, three months.
SAWYER Can we just do this?
HURLEY Do what?
SAWYER Make nice!
HURLEY Apologize for calling me all those names.
SAWYER I'm really sorry I called you rotund.
HURLEY Really?
SAWYER Ah God, you're worse than a girl. Come on, let's, spread the love.
JULIET What the hell am I doing here?
KATE Why don't you tell me.
JULIET I dunno.
KATE Well, I dunno either, so why don't you let go of my wrist.
KATE So what the hell happened?
JULIET I was making a cup of tea. Canister came in through the window.
KATE So what did you do to piss em off?
JULIET You're wasting your time. The knife is too big, you need something smaller, a safety pin or..
KATE We're going back.
JULIET What? They did this to us, why would we go back?
KATE You say "they" like you didn't lock me in a cage and watch me break rocks all day. We're going back to your village because... my friends were probably gassed just like us. And your people are gone anyway. I saw them all pack up and leave.
JULIET What?
KATE Locke came in and said goodbye. They were taking off, going somewhere else.
JULIET Going, going where?
KATE He didn't... exactly tell me. Welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hell's going on.
FEDERAL AGENT Go go go!
EDWARD MARS On the ground!
MARS Get down! On the ground! Let me see those hands. Let me see those hands! Long time no see, Austen.
MARS Who the hell are you?
CASSIDY I'm just selling Bibles!
CASSIDY Hi. They questioned for half an hour. He confiscated my case. He was asking me about selling Bibles and... ah, it's a good thing I know how to lie.
KATE Yeah, now we know what we're up against, right?
CASSIDY Yeah, now we know that there were six guys waiting to take you down, Lucy.
KATE Yeah, it's OK, I'll figure it out.
CASSIDY Figure it out? That Marshal, I don't know what you did to him, but if he ever gets his hands on you, it is going to be you or him.
KATE Look, if you've changed your mind. If you don't wanna help me, I get it.
CASSIDY No, I do wanna help you, but if I'm lying to federal agents, Lucy, so that you can have a chat with your Mom, then I at least need to know that there's a pretty good reason.
KATE He, uh, used to get drunk, and beat up my Mom. So I blew up his house. I made it look like an accident. A gas leak. Took out an insurance policy on the house, for her. Set her up for life. And then she gave me up. Chose him over me. So the reason I need to talk to her is, someone I love, someone who's supposed to care about me, betrayed me. And I wanna know why!
CASSIDY Well, then let's go find out.
JULIET What are you doing?
KATE Whoever dragged us out here left a trail, it'll lead us back to where we came from. Let's go.
JULIET It's gonna rain. Don't you think we should wait 'til morning?
KATE No.
KATE Why?
JULIET Why what?
KATE Why would they handcuff you to me and then drag us all the way out into the jungle?
JULIET Ben has a thing for mind games.
KATE That why he left you behind?
JULIET Do we really have to talk?
KATE Nope.
KATE Come on, if the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.
JULIET I hope you're not dragging me all the way back there with you for him.
KATE Excuse me?!
JULIET I hope you're not going back for Jack. Because I was standing right there, when he told you not to come back. And now that you've ruined his chance to get off the Island--
KATE You done? I SAID ARE YOU DONE?!
KATE I... I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to...
JULIET What the hell is that?!
KATE Get up.
JULIET You dislocated my shoulder!
KATE GET, UP!
KATE Quick, in here! Come on. Get in. Come on, get down, get down.
JULIET What the hell?
KATE Shh... up.
JULIET Are we safe?
KATE You tell me.
SAWYER I ain't kissing no damn baby.
HURLEY Claire's, like, really influential. If she votes for you to stay, you're home free dude.
SAWYER Well, why wouldn't she vote for me? It's not like I ever done anything bad to her.
HURLEY Nah, but you never did anything good for her either. And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?
SAWYER Wel,l I know how he is. He... cries loud and he smells.
HURLEY You see, that's what I'm talking about. You're sarcastic, people don't like that.
SAWYER Alright. So I go over. Do what?
HURLEY Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies. You should go over there, say something nice. Call her Claire. And give her this I know you can do it, dude.
SAWYER Hey, Claire.
CLAIRE Hey.
SAWYER Hey there, little baby ... Aaron.
CLAIRE Is, er, is there anything I can do for you?
SAWYER No. I just came by to say, your baby's... he's not as wrinkly as he was a couple weeks ago.
CLAIRE Yeah, I, I guess he's not. Thanks!
SAWYER Oh, and er, this is for you. 
CLAIRE Thank you.
SAWYER I don't like, blankets. Well, goodnight.
CLAIRE Goodnight.
JULIET Do you think it's gone? Are we safe?
KATE Are you serious? You've never seen that?
JULIET Oh, if you don't believe me, you can always pull my other shoulder out of its socket.
KATE I was, I wasn't trying to...
JULIET Don't flatter yourself. This is the fourth time it's been dislocated.
JULIET Give me your hand.
KATE Why?
JULIET Cause I want you to pop it back in.
KATE No, I'm not gonna...
JULIET You're gonna. Right now it feels like there's broken glass under my skin, and if it weren't for you, I would be on my way home right now.
KATE Jack told me not to come back to protect me. Because he didn't want me to get hurt.
JULIET Is that what you think?
KATE Yeah that's what I think.
JULIET We have cameras on the cages, Kate. All of them. He saw you, you and Sawyer. The reason Jack told you not to come back, wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt, it was because you broke his heart. So, grab my wrist, push up and twist!
SAWYER Why do we gotta be out here so damn early?
DESMOND You asked me to help you catch a boar. Well, this is when they break cover to eat.
SAWYER Looks like they picked a day to sleep in.
DESMOND So what's your angle, brother?
SAWYER My angle?
DESMOND Well, you... haven't spoken three words to me and then, suddenly you want to be my hunting partner.
SAWYER My angle, is that I got hearts and minds to change. And politics is all about bribes. Since money don't mean squat on this Island, I gotta give the people something they like. And people like meat...
DESMOND Shh.
KATE How's your shoulder?
JULIET Awesome.
KATE Then let's get going.
CASSIDY Thank you.
DIANE You're welcome sweetheart.
CASSIDY Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
DIANE No worries.
CASSIDY I'm such an idiot.
DIANE It happens all the time, sweetheart.
DIANE Uh, thank you.
KATE Hi, Mom.
DIANE What are you doing here, Katherine?
KATE You look good.
DIANE I asked you what you are doing here.
KATE I wanna know why you told them what I did to Wayne.
DIANE I thought maybe you came 'cause you wanted to say you were sorry.
KATE I'm not sorry. He hit you, he treated you like a dog, and you...
DIANE You can't help who you love, Katherine. And for good or bad, I loved him. And you burnt him alive. You turned on the gas, and you lit a match. You murdered him in cold blood!
KATE I did it for you.
DIANE No. What you did, you did for yourself. I have to go back to work. Because you are my daughter, I'm not going to tell the two men sitting at the table who've been following me for the last month that you are here. But I swear to God, Katie, if I ever see you again, the first thing I will do is yell for help. Goodbye.
KATE Did he say that to you?
JULIET Sorry?
KATE That I broke his heart.
JULIET He didn't have to.
KATE You don't know anything about him.
JULIET I know where he was born. I know what his parents did for a living. I know that he was married. And who he was married to. I know why he got a divorce. I know how his father died. I know his height, his weight, his birthday, and his blood type. What do you know about him, Kate?
KATE Let's go.
KATE Run, run, run.
KATE Get up, run, run, come on.
KATE Stop.
JULIET Wait, what are you doing?
KATE I know what happens when you step through those things...
JULIET They're off. Kate! We can—
KATE We'll go alongside—
JULIET We don't need to, we can go—
KATE ...Go around...
JULIET ...They're off...... dammit.
JULIET You're gonna wanna be over here.
JULIET Kate, come on!
JULIET Alright. We don't know what it is, but we know it doesn't like our fences...
KATE You had a key.
JULIET They left me behind too, they gassed me! I know that you don't care, but the people I spent the last three years of my life with, they just left me! I thought that maybe, maybe if I could make you think that we were in it together. Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.
SAWYER Ahaha.
CHARLIE Mmm. Ah, its delicious.
SAWYER Just a little DHARMA-A1 and paprika. I hope you'll remember this little barbecue at your meeting later.
CHARLIE Oh what meeting?
SAWYER Hurley told me about the vote.
CHARLIE Vote? Since when did anyone around here vote?
SAWYER You son of a bitch. There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.
HURLEY But, wasn't it nice, being nice.
SAWYER You tricked me into being decent. That's gotta be the lamest con in the history of cons.
HURLEY Wasn't a con, dude. If you're gonna be our temporary leader, you need to do some damage control.
SAWYER Leader? The hell are you smokin'?
HURLEY Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid. You're all we got. And Paulo and Nikki dying, we all looked to you. Then again, you totally tried to steal the diamonds, but we wanted to look to you. Look around, you made everyone happy. Just for today, they can eat boar, laugh and forget that they're totally screwed. And you did that for 'em, dude. You.
SAWYER Well, what if I don't wanna be the leader?
HURLEY Yeah well, I don't think Jack wanted it either. Sucks for you, dude.
JULIET Sayid's in one of those backyards down there. I'll go get him. You should get Jack.
KATE Jack, Jack, hey, wake up, its me.
JACK What happened?
KATE They all left.
JACK What? What?
KATE Because of me. I'm so sorry. I should have listened to you. I never— I wanted to come back to help you. But you didn't need me to. And now because of me you can't go.
KATE I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
JACK They just, left? Even, even Juliet?
KATE No, they left her too.
JACK Why?
KATE You know her better than I do. Now what?
JACK Now, now we go back.
KATE Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
CASSIDY You got it.
KATE So, this guy who ripped ya off. You gonna give me his name? Tell me where I can find him? You almost got arrested for me Cassidy, I wanna help you.
CASSIDY I'm pregnant.
KATE Oh.
CASSIDY It's his, the baby's his. And I still love him.
KATE So call the cops, have him locked up.
CASSIDY Will you ever forgive your Mom for calling the cops?
KATE No, no I won't.
CASSIDY Thanks, Lucy.
KATE My name's Kate.
JACK Hey.
JULIET Hey.
JACK You OK?
JULIET Yeah. You?
JACK Yeah.
SAYID Jack.
JACK Sayid.
SAYID I've checked all the house, everyone's gone, no weapons, no trail...
KATE Hey.
SAYID ...it's like 50 people disappeared into thin air.
JACK We should take what we can find and head out while we still got light.
SAYID She is not coming with us.
JACK Yes, she is.
SAYID Why?
JACK Because they left her behind too.
