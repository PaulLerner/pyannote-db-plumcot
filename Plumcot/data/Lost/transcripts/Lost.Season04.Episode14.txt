hugo_reyes Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Hello, Hurley.
hugo_reyes I think visiting hours are over, Dude.
sayid_jarrah This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me.
hugo_reyes Come with you where?
sayid_jarrah Somewhere safe.
hugo_reyes And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
sayid_jarrah Because circumstances have changed.
hugo_reyes What circumstances?
sayid_jarrah Bentham's dead.
hugo_reyes What?
sayid_jarrah Two days ago.
hugo_reyes What happened?
sayid_jarrah They said it was suicide.
hugo_reyes What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "Bentham"? His name is—
sayid_jarrah Don't say it. We're being watched.
hugo_reyes Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia.
sayid_jarrah I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.
hugo_reyes We're not going back, are we?
sayid_jarrah No. Just somewhere safe.
hugo_reyes Okay then. Hold on a sec.
hugo_reyes Checkmate, Mr. Eko.
sayid_jarrah Where's the freighter?
frank_lapidus I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again.
sayid_jarrah How much fuel?
frank_lapidus Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump.
dr_jack_shephard As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.
hugo_reyes Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!
john_locke Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.
ben_linus That's not my problem, John.
john_locke Hang on, man. Hang on!
martin_keamy Wherever you go... Widmore... he'll find you.
ben_linus Not if I find him first.
john_locke Hey. No. No. Hey. Hey! Hey!
michael_dawson You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go!
jinsoo_kwon You go. Go. I stay.
desmond_hume Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!
dr_jack_shephard Did he say "bomb"?
desmond_hume Don't land!
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing?!
frank_lapidus I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!
desmond_hume No! Don't land! No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!
dr_jack_shephard How long till we can fly again?
frank_lapidus Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!
desmond_hume Give it to me. I'll do it.
frank_lapidus Here! Somebody pump some gas!
dr_jack_shephard I'll handle the fuel.
frank_lapidus Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go!
kate_austen Hey, Sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go.
sunhwa_kwon Jin's below with Michael. I can't—
kate_austen No, no, there's no time! There's no time. We have to go.
sunhwa_kwon I won't leave him!
kate_austen Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin. All right?
frank_lapidus Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island.
michael_dawson Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man.
jinsoo_kwon No, I can find—
michael_dawson Hey, come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to your wife and get her home.
jinsoo_kwon Thank you, Michael.
michael_dawson You're welcome. Go.
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Not yet!
frank_lapidus Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go!
dr_jack_shephard Kate! Come on!
kate_austen Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind.
dr_jack_shephard Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now.
frank_lapidus Let's go!
desmond_hume Give me a minute! No! Wait!
sunhwa_kwon Where's Jin?
jinsoo_kwon 자기야! 자기야! 여기야! 여기야! 나 아직 여기 있어!
sunhwa_kwon It's Jin! No! Jin! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
frank_lapidus We can't do it!
sunhwa_kwon We have to! We need to go back!
dr_christian_shephard You can go now, Michael.
michael_dawson Who are you?
sunhwa_kwon Jin! Aah!
sunhwa_kwon Jin!
sunhwa_kwon Go back lower! We have to go find Jin!
dr_jack_shephard Sun, there's nobody down there!
sunhwa_kwon You can't see anything from here!
frank_lapidus We didn't get enough fuel! We can't go back!
sunhwa_kwon Go lower! I know he's there!
sayid_jarrah Sun, I'm—Sun, I'm so sorry. He's not—
sunhwa_kwon He's down there! I know he's down there!
frank_lapidus We gotta go!
sunhwa_kwon No! I'm not leaving him!
sayid_jarrah Can't get to him!
sunhwa_kwon No, we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around!
dr_jack_shephard Sun! Sun! It's gone!
dr_jack_shephard He's gone.
kate_austen Shh. Shh.
dr_jack_shephard Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.
frank_lapidus You got it.
sunhwa_kwon No! No! No! No!
sunhwa_kwon 어, 엄마.
MRS.PAIK#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 얘, 누가 너하고 얘기하고 싶대! 지연아, 엄마하고 얘기 좀 해볼래?
jinsoo_kwon YEON 엄마, 엄마.
sunhwa_kwon 우리 예쁜 딸!
MRS.PAIK#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 얘, 너 어디 있니?
sunhwa_kwon 런던에 있어요. 일 마무리 하고 오늘 밤에 출발해요.
MRS.PAIK#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 그래, 그럼 여행 안전하게 잘 해.
sunhwa_kwon 그럴게요, 엄마. 집에서 봐요.
charles_widmore All right, guys. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?
charles_widmore Yes.
sunhwa_kwon I'm Sun Kwon... Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of Paik Industries.
charles_widmore Yes, of course. How is your father?
sunhwa_kwon Excellent, thank you.
charles_widmore Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.
sunhwa_kwon Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?
charles_widmore I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Kwon.
sunhwa_kwon Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore... just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them...
sunhwa_kwon Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island.
charles_widmore Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me?
john_locke Why?
ben_linus "Why" what?
john_locke Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?
ben_linus Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses.
ben_linus I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.
john_locke What are you doing?
john_locke I asked you a question!
ben_linus If I were you, I'd duck.
ben_linus I better change.
james_ford Nice day for a swim.
dr_juliet_burke What are you doing here?
james_ford Decided to take a dip.
james_ford Whatcha celebratin'?
dr_juliet_burke I'm not celebrating.
james_ford Is that our boat?
dr_juliet_burke It was.
john_locke What's that for?
ben_linus I'm going somewhere cold.
john_locke Then where is mine?
ben_linus You don't need one because you're not going with me.
john_locke Yes, I am going with you.
ben_linus No, John, you're not.
john_locke Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions—
ben_linus He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences.
john_locke What consequences?
ben_linus Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid.
john_locke Waiting for me?
ben_linus Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.
john_locke What do I tell 'em to do?
ben_linus You'll find your way, John. You always do.
richard_alpert Hello, John. Welcome home.
ben_linus I hope you're happy now, Jacob.
desmond_hume Yeah, what is that?
frank_lapidus Where's the island? Where's the island?! Where the hell's the island?!
hugo_reyes It's gone.
frank_lapidus Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!
dr_jack_shephard There's another smaller island close by they took us to!
frank_lapidus I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing but water in every direction!
frank_lapidus Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel!
frank_lapidus Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves!
sayid_jarrah Desmond! The life raft!
frank_lapidus Hold on!
kate_austen Where's Jack?!
frank_lapidus Kate! Where is he?!
sayid_jarrah Are you okay?
kate_austen Hurley, carry the baby.
frank_lapidus Sayid, are you all right?
sayid_jarrah Yes!
hugo_reyes Jack!
frank_lapidus Where's Desmond?
kate_austen Get the baby.
hugo_reyes I got him.
frank_lapidus Desmond?! Jack! Give me a hand!
sunhwa_kwon Here you go.
dr_jack_shephard Get him to the raft. Get him to the raft. Get him up in the raft. We've gotta get him in the raft.
hugo_reyes Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?
kate_austen Oh, my god.
dr_jack_shephard Oh, come on, Desmond.
dr_jack_shephard One, two, three.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
hugo_reyes Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, you're all right.
hugo_reyes You're all right, man. You're okay.
hugo_reyes Desmond.
dr_jack_shephard That's it. You're all right. That's it.
dr_jack_shephard It's okay. It's okay. We're alive.
kate_austen Hello?
kate_austen Hello? Who's there?
kate_austen Don't move. Don't you touch my son!
kate_austen Claire? How did y—
claire_littleton Don't bring him back, Kate. Don't you dare bring him back.
kate_austen I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
hugo_reyes Is he okay?
kate_austen He's fine. It's a miracle.
hugo_reyes I can't believe he did it.
kate_austen Who did what?
hugo_reyes Locke. He moved the island.
dr_jack_shephard No, he didn't.
hugo_reyes Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, Dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.
frank_lapidus God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! There's a boat! You see it?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Does it see us?
desmond_hume I think it does!
sayid_jarrah Hey!
hugo_reyes AND DESMOND Hey!
frank_lapidus Is it turning? It's turning! Hey! Hey!
dr_jack_shephard We're gonna have to lie.
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard We're gonna have to lie.
sayid_jarrah Lie about what?
dr_jack_shephard Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island.
frank_lapidus Jack... now, I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?
dr_jack_shephard Your freighter... those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the bottom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there—someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind?
kate_austen Jack, we can't. We can't pull it off.
dr_jack_shephard Just let me do the talking.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 Aponta adiante, lá! Lá!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 Uma jangada. Cheio de gente! São oito deles!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 De onde eles vieram? De onde eles vieram?
henrik Ei, aqui! Dá uma olhada aqui!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 Depressa! Pega uns cobertores e a caixa de primeiros socorros. Traga pra aqui agora.
henrik Uma jangada com pessoas, Ms. Widmore! Ms. Widmore, venha à proa!
penelope_widmore Throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern!
desmond_hume Penny? Penny! Penny!
penelope_widmore Are you okay?
desmond_hume I'm—I'm fine. I'm fine. H—how did you find me?
penelope_widmore Your phone call... I have a tracking station.
desmond_hume I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode14 Não, não, não. Não faz isso. Não faz isso. Tá bom, tá bom, tá bom. Chega pra lá. Chega, chega.
desmond_hume Uh... this is—this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.
kate_austen Hi.
penelope_widmore Hi.
desmond_hume Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hi.
desmond_hume This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is—this is Penny.
dr_jack_shephard It's nice to meet you, Penny.
penelope_widmore Hi.
dr_jack_shephard But we need to talk.
hugo_reyes What's this place called?
sayid_jarrah Membata.
hugo_reyes Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?
sayid_jarrah Because it's the only way to keep them safe.
dr_jack_shephard How long till we'll hit land?
frank_lapidus Well, if the wind's not too brutal... eight, nine hours. Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.
dr_jack_shephard Well... it's been a pleasure, Frank. I hope we never see each other again.
frank_lapidus Roger that, Doc.
penelope_widmore Bye, sweetheart.
desmond_hume Are you sure about this, brother?
dr_jack_shephard Are you sure?
desmond_hume As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.
dr_jack_shephard Don't let him find you, Desmond. And I'll see you in another life, brother.
desmond_hume Aye. I guess you will.
dr_jack_shephard All right. Let's go home.
ben_linus Hello, Jack.
ben_linus Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?
dr_jack_shephard Yes, he did.
ben_linus When did you speak to him?
dr_jack_shephard About a month ago.
ben_linus And Kate?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too.
ben_linus And what did he say to you?
dr_jack_shephard He told me... that after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back.
ben_linus Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark.
dr_jack_shephard Why are you here?
ben_linus I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.
dr_jack_shephard Are you... Sayid—I don't even know where Sayid is. Hurley... is insane. Sun blames me for... and then Kate... She won't even talk to me anymore.
ben_linus Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you.
dr_jack_shephard How?
ben_linus I have a few ideas.
ben_linus Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too.
