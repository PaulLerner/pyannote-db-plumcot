HURLEY Dude, I don't know about this.
CHARLIE See, you're looking at this all wrong. He would want us to do this.
HURLEY He would want us to ransack his tent and take his stash? Yeah, that sounds exactly like Sawyer.
CHARLIE Well, he stole all this in the first place. I mean, people need food. They need medical supplies. They need -- shocking amounts of pornography.
DESMOND Charlie.
HURLEY Oh, Desmundo.
DESMOND I need you to come with me.
HURLEY You guys find Eko?
DESMOND Both of you.
CHARLIE What happened?
LOCKE Eko is dead.
SAYID We found his body in the jungle -- buried him yesterday.
CHARLIE How did he die?
LOCKE The island killed him.
CHARLIE What do you mean "the island killed him?" What do you mean "the island killed him?"
LOCKE You know what it means. With the doctor gone, the camp's on edge enough without people having to worry about what's out here in the jungle. They're going to look to you two to see how to react.
LOCKE So when I tell everyone what happened I need you to help keep things calm.
HURLEY Dude, you okay? Hey guys, what's wrong with Desmond?
SAYID What is he doing?
LOCKE There's someone else out there.
CHARLIE Where's Claire?
SUN She just went for a walk. I offered to watch the baby.
CHARLIE Claire!
DESMOND I've got her.
CHARLIE Is she okay? Claire! What happened?!
DESMOND Just stand back; give me some room!
CHARLIE Claire.
DESMOND Get back, Charlie; I know what I'm doing.
CHARLIE Is she breathing? She's not breathing.
CHARLIE You want me to help you?
DESMOND Come on; come on.
CHARLIE Claire? Claire.
CHARLIE Claire!
DESMOND Are you alright? Come on; you're okay. Let's get you back to the tent.
CHARLIE Charlie's here!
DESMOND It's alright, Charlie. Alright, let's get her back to her tent.
CHARLIE Is she okay? Let me help.
DESMOND I got it, Charlie.
CHARLIE Hey, I'll take her.
CHARLIE Where are you going? Hey, how did you know? How did you know she was drowning?!
HURLEY I'll tell you how he knew -- that guy sees the future, dude.
CLAIRE She's beautiful.
DESMOND Aye, thanks.
CLAIRE What's her name?
DESMOND Penny, well, Penelope. How are you feeling?
CLAIRE Still a little shaken up. I mean, I go swimming almost everyday -- the undertow just grabbed me. I mean, if -- if you hadn't...
CHARLIE Claire? I thought you were only going to be 5 minutes. Aaron's starving.
CLAIRE Yeah, um, sorry, I... Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you so much for being there.
DESMOND It's my pleasure.
HURLEY Locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing.
CHARLIE There's nothing to know. I don't buy this precognitive insanity rubbish. Look, if the bearded wonder could predict the future he wouldn't have ended up here, would he?
CHARLIE Well, whatever happened to him -- we're going to have to find out what it is.
HURLEY You do realize he's going to know your plan before you even come up with it, dude.
CHARLIE In that case, we're going to have to get him really bloody drunk.
CHARLIE Beautiful evening.
DESMOND Aye.
HURLEY Say it, dude.
CHARLIE This morning -- I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful. Thank you for helping Claire not drown.
DESMOND No harm done.
CHARLIE Excellent. Brought a peace offering -- you know, make the truce official.
DESMOND Thanks, but no. I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late.
CHARLIE This'll be good for us, brother. Alright, that's fine. We'll take our drink and go somewhere else.
DESMOND What kind of whiskey is that?
CHARLIE It's, uh -- it just says MacCutcheon.
DESMOND Alright then, let's have it. No, the bottle, brother. I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink.
CHARLIE Alright, let's drink.
DESMOND Cheers. 
CHARLIE Cheers.
DESMOND AND CHARLIE ...she was only the farmer's daughter.
CHARLIE Desi.
DESMOND Cheers.
HURLEY Hey, do you know any songs about drinking and fighting and girls with one leg?
CHARLIE Well, girls with one leg and a heart of gold. So, Desi, let me ask you something.
DESMOND Anything, pal.
CHARLIE How'd you know Claire was drowning?
DESMOND I could hear her calling for help.
HURLEY Oh no you didn't. You were like a mile away.
DESMOND Well, I suppose I've -- I've got good hearing.
CHARLIE You hear the lightning, as well?
DESMOND Excuse me?
CHARLIE The lightning. Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
DESMOND Thanks for the drink, pal.
CHARLIE Hey, I don't know what you're doing -- you best tell us. Oi! You think because you turned some key that makes you a hero? You're no hero, brother. I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one. Yeah...
DESMOND You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!
CHARLIE Hurley.
HURLEY Dude.
DESMOND You don't want to know! And I don't want to know!
CHARLIE Get him off!
DESMOND You don't want to know!!
LOCKE Desmond!
DESMOND I'll see you in another life, brother.
DESMOND I love you, Penny.
PENELOPE Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Des, are you alright? Stay there, hang on.
PENELOPE I'm just getting ice. You alright? Sweetie, you okay?
DESMOND What's happening?
PENELOPE Well, what's happening is the result of combining ladders, painting a ceiling, and alcohol. Are you okay? You nauseous?
DESMOND This is my flat?
PENELOPE Mmm-hmm, although, if you want me to feel at home you might start calling it our flat. How many fingers, Des? Love, look at me. What's wrong?
DESMOND Absolutely nothing.
PENELOPE Here, let me.
DESMOND Thanks.
PENELOPE Oh, hang on. You've got paint on your neck.
DESMOND Have I?
PENELOPE How's that concussion?
DESMOND Well, my severe head injury is a small price to pay for the pleasure of having you move into my humble -- is rat trap accurate?
PENELOPE Uh-uh. Voila! You know you don't really need a job from my father, Des.
DESMOND It's not about the job. I want him to respect me.
PENELOPE And respect you he shall. But if for some reason he's too daft to see how brilliant you are it's not the end of the world.
DESMOND What did you say?
PENELOPE Here you go, love. You alright?
DESMOND Yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- just had a bit of a deja vu, that's all.
DESMOND Good afternoon, uh, I'm here to see Mr. Widmore.
RECEPTIONIST And you are?
DESMOND Hume, uh, Mr. Desmond Hume.
DELIVERY MAN Hello, love. Got a parcel here for 815.
DESMOND Excuse me, what did you say?
DELIVERY MAN I said "delivery for 815."
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Hume, Mr. Widmore is ready for you.
DESMOND Thank you.
WIDMORE Penny didn't tell me you were an actor, Desmond.
DESMOND No, it was actually set design for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
WIDMORE Impressive. You didn't graduate from university.
DESMOND No, sir. I had to look after my 3 brothers after my father--
WIDMORE Any military experience?
DESMOND No, sir. She's beautiful -- your boat.
WIDMORE My foundation is sponsoring a solo race around the world.
WIDMORE Something wrong?
DESMOND No. No, sir.
WIDMORE Well, Desmond, I'm going to see to it that you have a position in our administrative department. Not the most glamorous duty but it's a start. I'll speak to human resources.
DESMOND With all due respect, sir, I haven't come here to interview for a position in your company.
WIDMORE You haven't?
DESMOND No, sir. I came here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. We've been together 2 years now and Pen's moving in and I love her. Your permission would mean everything to me.
WIDMORE I'm impressed, Hume -- a very noble gesture.
WIDMORE You know anything about whiskey?
DESMOND No, I'm afraid not, sir.
WIDMORE This is a 60 year MacCutcheon, named after Anderson MacCutcheon, esteemed Admiral from the Royal Navy. He retired with more medals than any man before or since -- moved to the highlands to see out his remaining years. Admiral MacCutcheon was a great man, Hume. This was his crowning achievement.
WIDMORE This swallow is worth more than you could make in a month. To share it with you would be a waste, and a disgrace to the great man who made it -- because you, Hume, will never be a great man.
DESMOND Mr. Widmore, I know I'm not...
WIDMORE What you're not, is worthy of drinking my whiskey. How could you ever be worthy of my daughter?
CHARLIE I said maybe / You're gonna be the one who saves me? / Maybe / And after all / You're my wonderwall
CHARLIE Thank you very much. Fiver! Thank you very much.
DESMOND I know you? How do I know you?
CHARLIE Thank you, you can leave your number if you want.
DESMOND How do I know you?
CHARLIE I don't, uh...
DESMOND Where do I know you from?
CHARLIE Look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.
CHARLIE Hey, can I get some help?
DESMOND You're Charlie.
CHARLIE Yeah, name's on the sign. 
DESMOND Who -- they -- they. It -- it was in the hatch. I remember seeing you. There was a -- there was a computer. There was a button. We -- we were on an island.
CHARLIE We are on an island, mate. This is England.
DESMOND No, it was real, man. I remember!
CHARLIE Hey, alright. This is why we don't do drugs.
DESMOND No this -- I remember this. This all happened before! Today -- th -- th -- this happened today. This -- I remember that he said I wasn't worthy -- and then I -- and then I -- and then I came down and I -- and I took off my tie and I -- and then I lost my tie and Penny said where was it and then it started to rain and...
DONOVAN Your thesis is a bit neat. The wild card part which is unpredictability -- run the same test 10 times -- you get 10 different outcomes. It's what makes life so wonderfully...
DESMOND Donovan!
DONOVAN Case in point, who could have known that a drenched Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?
DONOVAN You've looked better, Des; not much, but I...
DESMOND I need to ask you something.
DONOVAN By all means, do.
DESMOND What do you know about time travel?
DONOVAN Are you bloody insane?
DESMOND Just tell me if it's possible?
DONOVAN Which part? The island full of mysterious hatches? Or the computer which keeps the world from ending?
DESMOND You know what? Forget you're my best mate, right? As a physicist -- is it possible that I've somehow managed to go back in time and I'm now living my life over again? It's not funny, Donovan.
DONOVAN Penny's father berates you for not being a great man, and voila, you've dreamed a future where you push a button to save the world.
DESMOND These things are not in my head, brother. I remember things.
DONOVAN Alright, then -- what happens next?
DESMOND It doesn't work like that. I don't remember everything, just -- just bits and pieces.
DONOVAN How wonderfully convenient.
DESMOND Wait, I remember this. I know this song. The jukebox...
DONOVAN Des, you're worrying me now.
DESMOND I remember this night. Graybridge come back from 2 goals down in the final 2 minutes and win this game. It's a bloody miracle. And after they win, Jimmy Lennon's going to come through that door and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat because he owes him money.
DONOVAN Seriously...
DESMOND Watch, please! Just watch. They'll score the first goal right now. No, no, they came back. They won. Jimmy Lennon ... cricket bat.
DONOVAN There's no such thing as time travel, Des. From what I understand true love can be just as unlikely. So, if you love Penny, stop messing about and marry her.
PENELOPE You smell like the pub.
DESMOND That's because I was at the pub.
PENELOPE You didn't get the job.
DESMOND Nope.
PENELOPE What did my father say?
DESMOND Your father was lovely. We just both agree that I wasn't exactly qualified.
PENELOPE Well, I say we celebrate. I say we celebrate that fate has spared you a miserable existence under the employ of Widmore Industries. Let me take you out tomorrow. Let's go for lobsters on the pier. My treat.
DESMOND I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate.
PENELOPE Well, the occasion is I love you.
DESMOND Why? Why do you love me?
PENELOPE Because you're a good man. In my experience they're pretty hard to come by.
PENELOPE Hey, Des, where are you?
DESMOND I'm right here.
MS. HAWKING Never done this before have you?
DESMOND Is it that obvious?
MS. HAWKING I can always tell the first timers. Well, then, may I ask your price range?
DESMOND I'm not a man of means...
MS. HAWKING Oh...
DESMOND I hope to -- one day...
MS. HAWKING I have just the thing. This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still has the sparkle of life.
DESMOND I'll take it.
MS. HAWKING I'm sorry?
DESMOND It's perfect. I'll take it.
MS. HAWKING No you won't. Give me the ring. Give it here.
DESMOND I don't understand.
MS. HAWKING This is wrong. You don't buy the ring. You have second thoughts; you walk right out that door. So, come on, let's have it.
DESMOND I don't know what you're on about.
MS. HAWKING You don't buy the ring, Desmond.
DESMOND How do you know my name?
MS. HAWKING Well, I know your name as well as I know that you that don't ask Penny to marry you. In fact, you break her heart. Well, breaking her heart is, of course, what drives you in a few short years from now to enter that sailing race -- to prove her father wrong -- which brings you to the island where you spend the next 3 years of your life entering numbers into the computer until you are forced to turn that failsafe key. And if you don't do those things, Desmond David Hume, every single one of us is dead. So give me that sodding ring.
MS. HAWKING Oh, you're going to be difficult about this, I can see.
DESMOND Who are you?
MS. HAWKING Do you like chestnuts?
DESMOND What?
MS. HAWKING Thank you.
MS. HAWKING That man over there is wearing red shoes.
DESMOND So, what then?
MS. HAWKING Just thought it was a bold fashion choice worth noting.
DESMOND This isn't really happening, is it?
MS. HAWKING Sorry?
DESMOND I've had a concussion. You're my subconscious.
MS. HAWKING Am I?
DESMOND You're here to talk me out of marrying Penny. Well, it won't bloody work.
MS. HAWKING Oh, yes it will.
DESMOND No, there is no island. There is no button. It's madness. I love her. She loves me. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her.
MS. HAWKING No, Desmond, you're not.
DESMOND Oh, my God. You knew that was going to happen, didn't you? Then why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you do anything?
MS. HAWKING Because it wouldn't matter. Had I warned him about the scaffolding tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi. If I warned him about the taxi, he'd fall in the shower and break his neck. The universe, unfortunately, has a way of course correcting. That man was supposed to die. That was his path just as it's your path to go to the island. You don't do it because you choose to, Desmond. You do it because you're supposed to.
DESMOND I'm going to meet Penny in an hour. I've got the ring; she'll say yes; I can choose whatever I want.
MS. HAWKING You may not like your path, Desmond, but pushing that button is the only truly great thing that you will ever do.
DESMOND How much for the ring?
DESMOND Hi.
PENELOPE Hey, am I late?
DESMOND Right on time.
PHOTOGRAPHER Eh, take your photo, lovebirds?
DESMOND No thanks, mate.
PHOTOGRAPHER Come on, something to show the grandkids.
PENELOPE Oh, come on, Des, let's do it -- for all those grandkids.
PHOTOGRAPHER Yeah, you're gonna do it? Alrighty. Let's see what we've got for you here, eh? Ah, beautiful desert scene?
PENELOPE Nah.
PHOTOGRAPHER No, not the desert, alright. Ah, I know, the Alps.
DESMOND Ah, I love the Alps.
PENELOPE Oh, I hate the Alps.
PHOTOGRAPHER Yeah, not the Alps. Ah, here we go -- beautiful marina scene.
PENELOPE Yeah, let's do that.
PHOTOGRAPHER That's the one, innit? Alright, you guys get in position.
PENELOPE Take your coat off; it's boiling. There are palm trees.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1-2-3. Instant classic. Only 5 quid.
PENELOPE Here you go, love.
PHOTOGRAPHER Here you go, mate. Out of 20. You're a lovely couple -- small price to pay for the memories, right?
DESMOND I couldn't go through with it.
PENELOPE What was that?
DESMOND I can't do this.
PENELOPE You can't do what?
DESMOND Us. This. This relationship.
PENELOPE What are you talking about?
DESMOND How can I? I - I can't look after you. I haven't got a job. I don't have any -- I can't even afford 5 quid for a bloody photograph. You deserve someone better.
PENELOPE I know what I deserve. I chose to be with you. I love you.
DESMOND Love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough.
PENELOPE What's this about, Des? Where's this coming from?
DESMOND It's all happening too soon -- you moving in. You're painting rooms; you're changing things. I don't even like red. Why would you leave your flat, your expensive flat--
PENELOPE Don't do that! Don't you pretend you don't care. And don't you dare rewrite history. I left my expensive flat because you were too proud to live there, remember? If you want me to go -- if you want me to leave then don't make this about what I do or don't deserve. And have the decency to admit that you're doing this because you're a coward.
DESMOND I'm sorry, Pen, but this -- we're not supposed to be together.
BARTENDER What'll it be?
DESMOND Just give me a pint of your cheapest. I'm celebrating.
BARTENDER Oh, what's the occasion?
DESMOND I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life. And the worst part is I'm pretty sure I've made it before.
BARTENDER That's what they call deja vu, mate.
DESMOND Do they now?
DESMOND I had the wrong night. I was right. I was off by a night. I heard the song and then -- I remember this. I'm not crazy. I can still change things. I can still change it.
DESMOND Jimmy Lennon.
JIMMY Where the hell's my money?
DESMOND Hey, duck brother!
DESMOND Oh, no. Oh.
DESMOND Please, let me go back. Let me go back one more time. I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time. I'm sorry, Penny. I'll change it. I'll change it.
CHARLIE How'd you know Claire was drowning?
CHARLIE How'd you know Claire was drowning?
DESMOND I could hear her calling for help.
CHARLIE You hear the lightning, as well?
CHARLIE Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
CHARLIE I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one. Yeah, a cow...
DESMOND You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key! You don't want to know!
CHARLIE Get off!
DESMOND You don't want to know what happened to me! You don't want to know!
DESMOND You don't want to know. No matter what you do...
CHARLIE What the hell are you doing?
DESMOND You can't change it. You can't change it no matter what you try to do. You just can't change it.
CHARLIE He's wankered. Let's get him to his tent. Alright, Des, come on. Give me your arm. Come on stand up. Stand up. Okay, okay.
DESMOND You're a good man, Charlie. Listen, I'm sorry I tried to strangle you, alright?
CHARLIE Oh, fair play, mate. Sorry I called you a coward.
DESMOND No, you're right, pal.
CHARLIE Desmond, you are going to tell me what happened to you.
DESMOND When I turned that key my life flashed before my eyes. And then I was back in the jungle and still on this bloody island. But those flashes, Charlie -- those flashes -- they didn't stop.
CHARLIE So, you're telling me you saw a flash of Claire drowning this morning -- that's how you knew how to save her?
DESMOND I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie, I was saving you. This morning you dove in after Claire. You tried to save her but you drowned.
CHARLIE What are you talking about? I didn't drown.
DESMOND When I saw the lightning hit the roof you were electrocuted. And when you heard Claire was in the water you -- you drowned trying to save her. I dove in myself so you never went in. I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but the universe has a way of course correcting and -- and I can't stop it forever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because no matter what I try to do you're going to die, Charlie.
