EKO Here, eat. It's okay, Yemi.
NUN Eko?!
NUN Alright Eko. Go.
NUN Did you hear me? Go! Confess that you have stolen.
EKO Yemi was hungry.
NUN That is not an excuse. You have sinned, Eko! Hunger does not matter. Now go. Ask God for forgiveness.
NUN Confess!
SAYID How long has he been like this?
HURLEY Couple of days now.
SAYID Eko. Can you hear me? What happened to him?
CHARLIE Before or after we saved him from the polar bear cave?
HURLEY Come on. Locke will want to know you guys are back. Stay alive dude, ok?
YEMI What are you doing here?
EKO I have come to give my confession.
YEMI Hello, Eko.
EKO Hello, brother.
EKO I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country.
YEMI You mean drugs.
EKO You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
YEMI My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
YEMI No! Stop! No more! No more!
EKO Yemi! Yemi! No! No! No! Help me get to the plane.
SOLDIER Father? Are you okay, Father?
YEMI Eko! Eko, wake up!
YEMI It is time to confess. To be judged, Brother. I will be waiting. You know where to find me.
HURLEY You guys smell smoke?
SAYID Get him clear!
CHARLIE Eko! Help!
CHARLIE Pick him up!
HURLEY Eko. Eko, come on!
CHARLIE Pick him up!
HURLEY We gotta get you outta here!
CHARLIE Cover him up. Cover him with this!
HURLEY Come on, Eko.
CHARLIE Careful...careful!
HURLEY It's hot, Eko! Careful!
CHARLIE Lay him down... lay him down.
CHARLIE You're ok. You're alright.
EKO My... brother. My... brother.
CHARLIE You're alright. It's ok.
EKO My... brother. Yemi.
CHARLIE It's alright. I'll be back.
EKO Yemi...
LOCKE Charlie! Is everyone ok?
CHARLIE Yeah! We're good.
LOCKE Where's Eko?
CHARLIE Hurley and I pulled him out... over...
CHARLIE He was right there! Eko? Eko?
BEN Good evening, Jack.
JACK Good evening, Ben.
BEN I was hoping you might join me for a walk. What?
JACK Well, you say that like...you're not going to just throw a bag over my head and drag me out of here if I say no.
BEN Then don't say no. Why don't you put this on. I'll wait outside.
JACK Does it hurt?
BEN Sorry?
JACK Your neck, does it hurt? Any numbness in your fingers and toes, like pins and needles when your foot falls asleep, but permanent?
BEN Why are you asking me these questions, Jack?
JACK Because, Ben, you have a tumor on your spine. An aggressive tumor... that... is going to kill you. I don't know when those x-rays were taken that I saw, but unless they were very recent... you're not going to be taking walks much longer.
BEN I have no idea what you're talking about.
JACK Ok. My mistake then. I'm ready whenever you are.
BEN Stay here.
BEN As we prepare to send Colleen on her way, I'd like to take a moment...
JULIET I hate funerals. He let you out?
JACK Gave me a new shirt, too.
JULIET Bye, Jack.
BEN Why did you show him my x-rays?
JULIET I didn't tell him they were yours. But I guess you did.
LOCKE I think I know how to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer.
SAYID Can I ask why he's being included in the conversation?
DESMOND Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?
LOCKE Tell him what you told me.
DESMOND The computer in the hatch wasn't only for pushing the button. I'm pretty sure... it could be used to communicate with other stations.
SAYID This is fascinating. But you just told me the hatch exploded.
LOCKE One of them did.
SAYID You want to try and communicate with the others.
LOCKE Yup.
HURLEY No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere. Eko's gone.
CHARLIE There's no trail.
HURLEY Not that we, like, know what a trail looks like.
LOCKE When you pulled him out of the tent, did he say anything?
CHARLIE Nothing coherent. Just mumbling 'My brother, my brother.'
LOCKE Sayid, pack your gear. We're going to that computer.
CHARLIE Wait! What about Eko?
LOCKE We'll catch up to him. We're all going to the same place.
SOLDIER You're home, father.
AMINA Father? Oh! I was looking for Father Yemi.
EKO Father Yemi is...is gone. He was called away quite suddenly. An emergency at the refugee camp... down South.
AMINA I am Amina. I work at the clinic. This is my son Daniel. He is the altar boy here. Are you taking his place?
EKO Yes.
AMINA Will Father Yemi still go to London?
EKO London?
AMINA He was leaving at the end of the week. He was going to continue his studies.
EKO I will take his place there, too.
MAN No! Don't! Please! No!
DANIEL Shhhhhh. Confess.
LOCKE Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station. There's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody want to come along?
HURLEY What do you mean 'Anybody want to come along?'
LOCKE I mean, if you'd like to join us, it's a free island.
HURLEY Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone. Or he'd take Sayid or Kate.
LOCKE Yeah, well. I'm not Jack. The more the merrier.
NIKKI I'll go.
LOCKE Great!
PAULO What?
LOCKE Anybody else want to come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes. Bring water.
PAULO You're not serious.
NIKKI What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
DESMOND Would you mind if I asked you a question, Brother?
LOCKE Shoot.
DESMOND Are we off to poke at a computer, or are we going after your man Eko?
LOCKE Two birds, one stone. Eko's heading for the plane that crashed on top of the entrance to the Pearl station.
DESMOND Well, that's quite a coincidence.
LOCKE Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
DANIEL You're not supposed to do that. That's holy water.
EKO I'm washing away my sins.
DANIEL Father Yemi wouldn't...
EKO I am not Father Yemi.
EKO Wait there!
EMEKA ... where is Father Yemi?
EKO Who wants to know?
EMEKA Perhaps you did not hear me. I said, where is Father Yemi?
AMINA The shipment is late! I just got off the telephone. He assured me it would arrive on Friday.
EKO What shipment?
EMEKA You should explain our arrangement to the new priest.
AMINA We receive shipments of vaccines from the Red Cross. We are allowed to keep 20 percent. The rest we give to Emeka and his men.
EMEKA In exchange for protection. So you see Father, everybody is happy! Huh? Hmmm? Everybody's happy. Everybody benefits! So, I hope you will continue to honor our arrangement.
EKO I am not afraid of you.
EMEKA I'll be back for the vaccine on Friday, Father. You don't want more lives on your conscience.
LOCKE Hello, Eko!
JULIET You want to guess what's for lunch?
JACK I'm not... I'm not big on mysteries.
JULIET Of course you're not.
JACK You people have cheeseburgers?
JULIET You have no idea what I went through to make this for you. I killed the cow, processed the meat, baked the bun. And the fries... try rendering animal fat.
JACK No ketchup?
BEN I'd like to talk to him.
JULIET Ok. So talk to him.
BEN Alone. Please.
JACK I'm fine with her being here.
BEN And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack, but it's private. Doctor-patient confidentiality.
JULIET Sure. Of course.
JACK Mind if I eat?
BEN We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.
JACK Break me?
BEN Wear you down till you were convinced we weren't your enemies. Get you to trust us. And then of course we'd lead you to believe that you were choosing to do... whatever we asked you to do. All of this of course assumed that you would get... invested.
JACK Invested in what?
BEN Has it not occurred to you that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?
JACK Why are you telling me this?
BEN I'm telling you this, Jack, because my wonderful plan... got shot to sunshine when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying.
JACK All of this... you brought me here to operate on you. You... you want me to save your life?
BEN No, I want you to want to save my life. But we're beyond that now, so... all I can ask is that you think about it. Do you believe in God, Jack?
JACK Do you?
BEN Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. And if that's not proof of God, I don't know what is.
LOCKE Hey! Are you sure you are all right? We can stop for a bit and catch our breath.
EKO I'm fine.
LOCKE You're heading for the plane wreckage aren't you? Charlie heard you call out for your brother before you left the camp. Is that what you're doing out here, looking for Yemi?
EKO Do not speak my brother's name again!
LOCKE What are you so afraid of, Eko?
AMINA You need to come back in two days. Father! What can I do for you?
EKO Yes, is that... the vaccine that you spoke of? How often do the shipments come?
AMINA Every six months, if we are lucky. What makes you so interested in our shipments of vaccine, Father?
EKO You agreed to give most of it to the militia?
AMINA The vaccines fetch a high price in the black markets. Whatever you are thinking, do not cross these men. Before father Yemi, we got nothing. We owe whatever vaccines we have to his work. You remind me of him, you know. You're a good man, too.
WARLORD I hear you have some vaccine to sell.
EKO I do. But it has to be done by Sunday. I'm leaving the country.
WARLORD No problem.
LOCKE The hatch is over here by the plane. Why don't you take everybody down.
SAYID And you?
LOCKE I'll be there in a minute.
PAULO What's Eko looking for?
NIKKI His brother's body is in that plane.
LOCKE So, what exactly did you see back there? I saw it once, you know.
EKO And what did you see?
LOCKE I saw a very bright light. It was beautiful.
EKO That is not what I saw.
EKO My brother's gone!
LOCKE You set the plane on fire. Yemi's body could have burned... or, not to mention animals... or...
LOCKE So, you don't want to come down there with us?
EKO No. I will wait here.
LOCKE Well...oh, I forgot, I found this when I was looking for you.
EMEKA Hello, Father. I hear you have a shipment of vaccine for sale. If you thought you could do this without me knowing... you don't know who I am.
EMEKA You know, you're lucky Father, I'm a superstitious man. I don't relish taking the life of a holy man. That is why today, I'm only going to cut off your hands.
EMEKA No! Don't! Please! No! No!
EKO You do not know who I am!
Narration I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the Orientation Film for Station 5 of the DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or, The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
LOCKE Well?
SAYID The wiring is only one-way. It's a closed system. A dead end.
NIKKI Hey, guys? What are these other TVs for?
LOCKE Sorry?
NIKKI All these TVs... this guy says that there's 6 stations. Uh, here, check it out.
Narration ...is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
NIKKI Projects. More than one. So, maybe some of these TVs are connected to the other hatches.
LOCKE Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.
SAYID Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds. See if we can get another picture.
PAULO Ahhhh. The uh, toilet still works.
SAYID Anything yet?
LOCKE Nothing.
SAYID What about now?
SAYID John?
LOCKE Yeah, we got something.
NIKKI Wow! What is it?
LOCKE That's a good question.
PAULO Hmmm. Those are computers! Great! That's what you're looking for. Now we can get out of here.
LOCKE I guess he'll be expecting us.
JACK You don't trust me anymore?
JULIET I trust you just fine. Just thought I'd put a movie in.
JACK You know what, I'm going to pass on the movie.
JULIET You'll like this one Jack. It's "To Kill A Mockingbird". It's a classic.
JACK Juliet, I don't want to watch a movie right now!
JULIET I'll turn the sound down then.
JULIET I felt like I should apologize. Say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you here. And for everything that's been done to you. And your friends. You have to know we were desperate. It was only so that we could save his life.
JULIET Ben. He's a great man.
JULIET I know you find that hard to believe but... he is.
JULIET You probably feel like you don't have a choice. But you do, Jack. Free will is all we've really got, right?
JULIET Anyway, just wanted to put in my two cents.
JULIET I told you before, you can trust me. I want you to trust me, now, when I tell you that doing the surgery is absolutely the right thing for you to do.
JULIET It's the right thing because he deserves to live.
JACK Turn the movie off.
JULIET Jack...
JACK Turn it off! Now.
JULIET Alright. It's off.
JULIET Think about what I said. Please.
DANIEL Where are you going?
EKO London.
DANIEL Are you a bad man? My mom says you're a bad man.
EKO Only God knows.
EKO I see you have your vaccine.
AMINA Do you expect me to be grateful? I know what you are planning to do.
EKO Those men! I helped--
AMINA Those men will be replaced by other men.
EKO What are they doing? What is the meaning of this?
AMINA They are boarding up the church. We can no longer use it.
EKO This is Yemi's church. You have no right to do this!
AMINA It is no longer sacred! And one day you'll be judged for what you did! If I were you, I would start making my peace now. I would go to London and begin to repent. Because you owe God for every life you've taken. And you truly believe this is Yemi's? You owe him one church.
EKO Yemi!
EKO Wait! Yemi!
EKO Yemi! You say you want to hear my confession! Why? Why now, eh? Show yourself! Where are you! Where!
YEMI Are you ready, Eko?
EKO Yes. I am ready, Yemi.
EKO I ask for no forgiveness, Father. For I have not sinned. I have only done what I needed to do to survive.
EKO A small boy once asked me if I was a bad man. If I could answer him now, I would tell him that... when I was a young boy, I killed a man to save my brother's life. I am not sorry for this. I am proud of this.
EKO I did not ask for the life that I was given. But it was given, nonetheless. And with it... I did my best.
YEMI You speak to me as if I were your brother.
EKO Who are you?
EKO Who are you!? Who are you!?
EKO Who are you?
EKO The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. The Lord is my shepherd...
EKO Oh!
LOCKE Eko!
LOCKE Ohh...Eko. It's ok. It's ok.
SAYID What did he say, John?
LOCKE He said, 'We're next.'
