DESMOND Efren Salonga?
DESMOND Ef—Efren Salonga!
DESMOND Efren Salonga?
DESMOND Efren Salonga!
DESMOND Efren Salonga!
DESMOND Efren Salonga!
DESMOND Efren Salonga?
SALONGA Who are you?
DESMOND Are you the doctor?
SALONGA Yes. What's the matter with you?
DESMOND You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?
SALONGA Yes, yes!
DESMOND Because there's a lot of blood, man!
SALONGA How much blood?
DESMOND I'm coming, Penny!
DESMOND It's okay, Pen. We've got a doctor.
PENNY Where have you been?!
DESMOND It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, here you go.
DESMOND Okay. Just breathe, Penny, okay? J—just breathe.
PENNY Oh! 
DESMOND Breathe.
PENNY I can't breathe.
DESMOND You're doing great.
PENNY I can't—
DESMOND You're doing great, okay. Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay.
PENNY Oh, make it come out!
DESMOND Just be strong.
SALONGA Hold it. Hold it.
PENNY I can't! I can't! 
DESMOND Yes, you—yes, you can, Penny.
SALONGA Push! Push!
DESMOND Okay, push now, Penny. Push. Now!
DESMOND Come on, Penny. That's it.
SALONGA Push!
DESMOND It's coming. Come on, Penny.
SALONGA Push! Harder!
DESMOND I can see the head!
SALONGA Harder!
DESMOND I can see the head!
SALONGA One more time! Push!
DESMOND I can see it. It's just coming.
DESMOND It's coming! It's coming! You've got it!
SALONGA Last time! Yeah!
DESMOND Oh my God, Penny.
SALONGA You got it!
DESMOND You did it. Oh, my God, Penny. You did it.
SALONGA It's a boy!
DESMOND I love you, Penny. I love you.
DESMOND Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, my God. He's so beautiful. Oh, my God.
PENNY I love you.
DESMOND I love you.
DESMOND I love you.
DESMOND Look. Right out there.
DESMOND Beyond where you can see, there's—there's an island, and it's a very special island. I left it a long time ago. I never thought I'd see it again.
DESMOND It's called Great Britain. And the most beautiful part of the island is Scotland, and that's where your daddy's from. There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs, and... and it's where your mummy and daddy... fell in love.
PENNY It's also where he broke her heart.
DESMOND Yeah, well, I... I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it.
PENNY You also left out the bit about his grandfather—the man who sent a boat to the Island to kill all Daddy's friends.
DESMOND We'll be in and out. He'll never know we're here, Penny.
PENNY Don't underestimate him, Desmond. If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do.
DESMOND But this has nothing to do with your father, Penny. We are here because of Daniel Faraday. What he told me—that everyone on that island is in danger, and I am the only one that can help them. I have to do this, Penny.
FARADAY Are you sure that's what he said?
MILES Yeah, Sawyer said to meet at the creek, so unless he got torched by a flaming arrow, that's where he and everyone else should be.
FARADAY Hey, how's your headache?
CHARLOTTE Worse, but considering we're running for our lives, I'm not gonna complain.
FARADAY You have any dizziness or double vision?
CHARLOTTE Both, actually. Why do you look so worried? Is it because you know what's happening to me?
FARADAY Listen to me. Nothing is gonna happen to you. Nothing. I won't let it.
MILES Hey, we're here!
MILES Some rendezvous. It's just us.
FARADAY Well, we should probably wait, see if they show up. They could be right behind us.
CHARLOTTE Yeah, or they came and left.
MILES Or they're dead.
FARADAY Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude... not exactly what we need right now. People are scared enough as it is. Miles—Miles?
MILES Wait! Don't move!
MAN Aah!
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE Who's in charge here?
MILES He is.
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE You just couldn't stay away, could you?
DESMOND Did he finish his breakfast?
PENNY Yeah. Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end...
PENNY ...unlike his father.
DESMOND Look, honey, all I have to do is find his mother, tell her he's still on the Island, and then I'm done with this for good.
PENNY Why now? I mean, if he told you all this on the Island, why didn't you remember it until two days ago?
DESMOND I don't know. Look, I don't understand how any of this works any more than you do. It... Look, I know it happened. Daniel Faraday knocked on the hatch door and told me to go to Oxford... everyone was in danger, and I was the only one that could save them. I know how insane it sounds.
DESMOND I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done... forever. I promise.
PENNY If you're gonna promise me something, Des, can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again?
DESMOND Why in God's name would I ever go back there?
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE There were twenty of you at the beach, but only five of you here. Where are the rest of your people?
MILES Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines.
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE We didn't put them here. You did.
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE Once we leave here, I will be out of control of what happens to you. But if you cooperate now, things will go much easier for you. So where are the rest of your people?
FARADAY I don't know.
LOCKE Who are these people?
SAWYER Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that, with Frogurt on fire and all.
JULIET They attacked us on the beach.
LOCKE This is a 30-caliber M1 Garand rifle. It looks new.
SAWYER Who cares about the rifle? Where the hell you been?
LOCKE If you've been going through what I have, James, maybe the more appropriate question would be, when the hell have I been?
SAWYER What happened to your leg?
LOCKE I got shot.
SAWYER By who?
JULIET We can swap stories later. We told the rest of our group that we would meet them at the creek. If there's any chance of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving.
SAWYER Fine, seeing as we have no rope to make sure these two don't try to kill us again. Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.
CUNNINGHAM Quare non sunt vestitus eis? (Why don't they have uniforms?)
JONES Tace! (Be quiet!)
SAWYER What?
JULIET Cognoscitis qui sumus? (Do you know who we are?)
SAWYER What language is that?
JULIET They're speaking Latin. That one asked why we aren't in uniform, and this one told him to shut up.
LOCKE And how is it that they know how to speak Latin, Juliet?
JULIET The same reason I do. Because they're Others.
MILES Hey.
FARADAY Yeah.
MILES We just walked over a fresh grave.
FARADAY What?
MILES Four U.S. soldiers, dead just under a month. Three of them were shot. One died of radiation poisoning.
FARADAY Miles, hey, hey. Did any of them happen to mention what year it is?
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE We're here.
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE Richard! We're back.
[Out of the darkness of the tent's interior steps Richard Alpert, looking the same as ever and wearing a blue button-down shirt and blue slacks.
YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE Caught these three by the creek. This one's their leader.
RICHARD What's your name?
FARADAY What's your name?
RICHARD My name is Richard Alpert. I assume you've come back for your bomb.
ARCHIVIST No, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not finding a record of any Faraday.
DESMOND No, that—that's impossible. 'Cause I know her son was a professor here. His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database.
ARCHIVIST Sir, there's no record of any Faraday ever having been employed here at Oxford.
DESMOND I visited him. I went to his lab. It was in an attic. It was... it was above the physics department.
ARCHIVIST The archives go back quite far. Perhaps there was a clerical error. You don't happen to recall the year it was in which you last visited?
DESMOND The year? ...No. I'm not exactly sure.
ARCHIVIST May I ask why you're seeking this information?
DESMOND Sorry I wasted your time.
CUSTODIAN Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.
CUSTODIAN I wondered when someone'd figure out we weren't just fumigating here.
CUSTODIAN You a professor?
DESMOND No. Not exactly.
CUSTODIAN Well... at least you're honest.
DESMOND So why'd you tell me not to touch it?
CUSTODIAN Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made run through this bloody thing down to the incinerator so that no one would find out what he was up to.
DESMOND You mean Daniel Faraday.
CUSTODIAN Yeah. You're not the first one to poke around here, asking about him and his work. Rumor had it, he was trying to send rats' brains back in time. Ridiculous, innit?
DESMOND Aye.
CUSTODIAN Look, I'll forget you broke my lock if you tell your mates that all you found was rubbish left behind by a madman.
DESMOND Fair enough.
DESMOND Faraday—the university says there's no record of him.
CUSTODIAN Well, can you blame 'em? I mean, after what he'd done to that poor girl?
DESMOND What girl?
FARADAY Hey, take it easy.
CHARLOTTE It's all right, Dan. I'm fine.
MILES We are so dead.
FARADAY Hey. No, no, no. We are not so dead. We're gonna be fine. We just need to keep it together until there's another flash. All right? Then all this disappears.
MILES And when's that gonna happen?
FARADAY Could be five minutes. Could also be 5,000 years.
MILES That's—that's just awesome.
CHARLOTTE What is going on, Dan? Why are they doing this to us?
FARADAY I'm not sure. But they must think that we're with the American military. And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive is to let them keep thinking it, all right? Let—
RICHARD Sorry. Am I interrupting? Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal where the rest of your squad is.
FARADAY And why would I do that? So you can kill them, too?
RICHARD We didn't start this, friend. Your people attacked us. You come to our island to run your tests, you fire on us, and what, you expect us not to defend ourselves?
FARADAY I don't know anything about that. We are scientists.
ALPERT So what? So they sent you here to recover it?
FARADAY If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes. And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns that the housing has been compromised. Is that right?
FARADAY You need to listen to me. You have an unstable device that's capable of destroying this entire island, and it's broken. If you don't allow me to render it inert, all of us are gonna die. All of us.
RICHARD How do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission? That I'll take you out to the bomb, and you'll just detonate it?
FARADAY Because... I'm in love with the woman sitting next to me. And I would never... I would never do anything to hurt her.
RICHARD All right. Take care of your bomb. But you try anything else, and you will hurt her.
SAWYER So who taught you Latin?
JULIET Others 101. Gotta learn Latin—language of the enlightened.
SAWYER Enlightened, my ass.
LOCKE I suggest you talk to us. Once we get back to the creek and meet up with the rest of our people, there's gonna be a lot of anger directed at you for attacking them.
CUNNINGHAM The rest of your people are either captured or dead.
LOCKE What? What makes you say that?
CUNNINGHAM That idiot shouted out, "Meet at the creek." We knew exactly where they were going. We sent a group after them.
SAWYER Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language.
JULIET James, wait.
JULIET Nos non sumus hostes vobis. 
CUNNINGHAM Itaque nos liberate. 
SAWYER What the hell are you sayin'?
JULIET Duce nos ad vestra castra. Si placet. 
CUNNINGHAM Quare hoc faciam? 
JULIET Estne... Ricardus ibi? Ricardus Alpert? 
LOCKE Did you just say "Richard Alpert"?
JULIET John, please. Duce nos ad vestra castra. Non necesse est alium mori. Si placet. 
CUNNINGHAM All right. Okay, we need to head east another couple of kilometers until we hit the ridge—
SAWYER Shoot him!
SAWYER Shoot, damn it!
SAWYER Are you crazy?! What were you thinking? Why didn't you shoot him?!
LOCKE Because... he's one of my people.
ABIGAIL And who might you be?
DESMOND Uh, my name's Desmond Hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.
ABIGAIL I'm Abigail Spencer. Theresa's my sister.
DESMOND Oh, right. Um, can I have a word with her?
ABIGAIL You want to speak to Theresa?
DESMOND Yeah, I got her name from a—a gentleman I met at Oxford University...um... Daniel Faraday.
ABIGAIL Daniel Faraday? Well, why didn't you say so? Please, you must come in.
DESMOND Thanks.
ABIGAIL He didn't tell you, did he?
DESMOND No. No, he didn't. Can she hear us?
ABIGAIL No. Theresa's away right now.
DESMOND "Away"? What do you mean?
ABIGAIL Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3, wants to know where her dolly is. Yesterday, she was talking to our dad. He died five years ago.
DESMOND I'm sorry. Um, this was a mistake. I... I shouldn't have come.
ABIGAIL Of course. Why would you want to stay? Daniel certainly didn't.
DESMOND He left her like this?
ABIGAIL Went running off to the States, never to be heard from again. He abandoned her. What kind of a man does that? I seriously don't know what we would've done if it hadn't been for Mr. Widmore.
DESMOND Uh, I'm sorry. Who?
ABIGAIL Daniel's benefactor. He funded his research, and he took responsibility for the result of it. He's been taking care of Theresa ever since this happened to her. Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore, God bless him.
MILES A hydrogen bomb? Seriously?
FARADAY Back in the '50s, the U.S. Government tested H-bombs in the South Pacific.
MILES Lucky us.
CHARLOTTE You didn't have to say that.
FARADAY Say what?
CHARLOTTE That you loved me. I mean, there are plenty of other ways you could've convinced him you weren't gonna blow up the entire Island.
FARADAY I said what I said because I meant it, Charlotte.
ELLIE Right, then. Let's go.
FARADAY Back soon. I promise.
RICHARD Whatever your, uh, your superiors told you, I want you to know the truth. A month ago, we found 18 members of an Army battalion right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp. We gave them the opportunity to leave the island peacefully. They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill 'em. All of 'em.
FARADAY Forced?
RICHARD Yeah.
FARADAY By whom?
RICHARD Y—you answer to someone, don't you? You follow a chain of command, right?
FARADAY Yeah.
RICHARD Yeah, well, so do I.
JONES Richard! Richard!
ALPERT What the hell happened to you?
JONES Cunningham and I — a group of them surprised us. We were outnumbered, but I escaped.
ELLIE Outnumbered, eh?
JONES Shut up, Ellie. Who's this?
RICHARD He's gonna help us take care of our problem. You'd better get going.
JONES Wait. He's one of them. You can't actually trust him.
RICHARD Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. Go.
RICHARD H—how did you escape?
JONES I ran.
RICHARD And it never occurred to you that they might follow you?
JONES Follow me? Their leader is some sodding old man. What, you think he can track me? You think he knows this island better than I do?
LOCKE How did you know Richard would be here?
JULIET Richard's always been here.
LOCKE How old is he?
JULIET Old. Why are you so interested in Richard, John?
LOCKE I'm interested in him because he was about to tell me how I could save us.
JULIET "Save us"?
LOCKE Yeah. But before he could finish, we were interrupted by that flash of light. And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off.
SAWYER I hate to bust up the "I'm an Other, you're an Other" reunion, but Faraday — the guy that's actually gonna save us — is being death marched into the jungle right now.
LOCKE Good luck with that.
SAWYER You're not gonna help me save him?
LOCKE No. I'm gonna go down and finish my conversation with Richard.
SAWYER That's gonna get us all killed. You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here.
LOCKE Fair enough. I'll give you ten minutes head start.
SAWYER What about you? You wanna stay here in Crazytown or help me rescue the geek?
ELLIE Why do you keep looking at me?
FARADAY No, no, I'm—I'm not. I—
ELLIE You are.
FARADAY You know what? You're right. I'm—I'm sorry. It's just... you look so much like... someone I used to know.
ELLIE Someone other than the girl you just professed your love for? Well, aren't you the Romeo.
FARADAY Far from it, believe me.
ELLIE I don't believe you, by the way. You may have Richard fooled, you can't really expect me to believe that you, a British woman and a Chinese man are all members of the United States military. Who are you and what are you doing on our island?
FARADAY You wanna know who I am?
FARADAY I'm your best chance at disarming that bomb.
ELLIE Right, then, disarm it.
ELLIE What are you doing up there?
FARADAY I'm examining it.
FARADAY Back up.
ELLIE What?
FARADAY Get back, get back. It's unsafe. We need to move.
ELLIE I swear, if you try anything...
FARADAY If I try anything—what, you're gonna—you're gonna shoot me? Is that right? Yeah, that would be perfect because, of course, rifle fire right next to—what would you call this—hydrogen bomb? Yes, fantastic idea. Really... inspired. Okay, listen to me. Do you people have any access to lead or concrete?
ELLIE For what?
FARADAY There's a crack in the casing. It needs to be filled with lead. You need to take it off this platform carefully and bury it.
ELLIE You brought me all the way out here to tell us that we have to bury it? You told Alpert you could disarm that thing.
FARADAY You don't need to worry. You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off.
ELLIE How do you know that?
FARADAY I need you to trust me.
ELLIE I don't trust you.
FARADAY Just bury it. Bury it, and everything will be fine. Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this.
ELLIE How can you be so sure?
FARADAY You wanna take care of this bomb?
ELLIE How?!
FARADAY You bury it!
ELLIE How do you know that?
FARADAY Because 50 years from now, this island is still here!
FARADAY There you— 
ELLIE What did you just say?
FARADAY Whoa. Take it easy. I can explain myself a little better. I know how this sounds. Believe me, it's... oh, it's hard to explain. 50 years from now, me and my... me and my friends—that's where we're from, okay? And—here's the key—everything's fine. I'm not saying it's perfectly fine, but there hasn't been any atomic blast, all right? There has not—
SAWYER Drop the gun, Blondie.
FARADAY It's okay. She's okay. You can put your gun down.
SAWYER She puts hers down first.
JULIET Why don't we all put our guns down?
SAWYER I said, drop it!
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
ELLIE Are they from the future, too?
SAWYER You told her?
MELANIE Sir! Sir, you can't—
MELANIE Mr. Widmore. I'm so sorry. He charged right past me.
WIDMORE That's all right, Melanie. Mr. Hume is a... colleague of mine.
WIDMORE Please leave us.
DESMOND I know you have questions for me. I'm not gonna answer them. I've come here to ask you something. And once you've told me everything I need to know, you'll never see me again. Understand?
WIDMORE All right.
DESMOND I need to know where I can find Daniel Faraday's mother.
WIDMORE What makes you think I would even know the answer to that?
DESMOND Because even before you put Faraday on your little boat and sent him off to the Island, you spent ten years funding his research. So I figure, you must know something regarding his next of kin.
WIDMORE Desmond, I haven't seen or heard from my daughter for three years. Just answer me this. Is she safe?
DESMOND Where's Faraday's mother?
WIDMORE She's in Los Angeles. This is an address for her.
WIDMORE I suspect she won't be pleased to see you. She's a very private person.
WIDMORE Wait, Desmond.
WIDMORE Deliver your message... but then get out of this mess. Don't put Penny's life in danger.
DESMOND Danger?
WIDMORE You're getting yourself involved in something that goes back many, many years. It has nothing to do with you or my daughter. Wherever you were hiding... go back there.
DESMOND Thanks for the advice.
LOCKE Richard Alpert!
JONES Hey. Hey!
LOCKE I'm looking for Richard.
JONES Don't move.
LOCKE Richard Alpert!
JONES On the ground now.
LOCKE Richard, I need to talk to you!
JONES Shut—your—mouth!
RICHARD That's enough! Who are you?
LOCKE My name is John Locke.
RICHARD Is that supposed to mean something to me?
LOCKE Jacob sent me.
RICHARD Put the gun down.
JONES What? Richard, you can't seriously trust him.
RICHARD I said... put the gun down, Widmore.
LOCKE Your name is Widmore? Charles Widmore?
WIDMORE What's it to you?
LOCKE Nothing. Nice to meet you.
PENNY ...and the fishy suddenly peeked out, but it saw the bear so that it ran away again. Where—?
DESMOND Hi.
PENNY Hi.
DESMOND Good day?
PENNY Yeah. He wanted to go fishing in the Thames. We were unsuccessful. And you? Did you find Faraday's mum?
DESMOND Ugh. There was no one to find. She, um... she died a few years ago.
PENNY Why are you lying to me?
DESMOND What? I'm not.
PENNY Where is she?
DESMOND She's in Los Angeles.
DESMOND Look, Pen, you've got nothing to worry about. You know, this was a mistake. No, I... I made a promise that this would be done in a day, and now it's done. It's not our problem anymore.
PENNY And what happens if you wake up tomorrow and remember something else?
DESMOND Then I'll forget it.
PENNY And the next day?
DESMOND I'll forget it. It doesn't matter, Pen. You're my life now—you and Charlie. I won't leave you again... not for this... not for anything.
PENNY You'll never forget it, Des. So I guess we're going with you.
RICHARD I gave you this?
LOCKE Yes.
RICHARD After you were shot in the leg and I... wandered out of the jungle to patch you up?
LOCKE That's right.
RICHARD Then why don't I remember... well, any of this?
LOCKE Because it hasn't happened yet.
RICHARD I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say, John Locke.
LOCKE I expect you to tell me how to get off the Island.
RICHARD That's very privileged information. Why would I share it with you?
LOCKE Because you told me that I had something very important to do once I get there. And because I'm your leader.
RICHARD You're my leader?
LOCKE That's what you told me.
RICHARD Look, I... certainly don't want to contradict myself, but... we have a very specific process for selecting our leadership, and it starts at a v—very, very young age.
LOCKE All right. All right. What year is it right now?
RICHARD It's 1954.
LOCKE All right. May 30, 1956—2 years from now—that's the day I'm born—Tustin, California, and if you don't believe me, I suggest you come and visit me.
LOCKE Oh, no.
RICHARD What's wrong?
LOCKE It's about to happen again. You need to tell me now, Richard. How do I get off the Island? Please! Tell me!
SAWYER You all right?
JULIET Yeah. I think so.
FARADAY Charlotte!
FARADAY You okay?
CHARLOTTE Yeah, I'm fine.
MILES Yeah, me, too. I'm great, too.
CHARLOTTE Ahh.
FARADAY Charlotte.
FARADAY Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! No, no, no. Look it. Hey. Look at me, look at me.
FARADAY It's okay. It's okay. Charlotte!
