CHARLIE Are we rescued?
REDSHIRT Saved?
SAYID Perhaps it's them.
CHARLIE You see anything?
KATE No.
CHARLIE Maybe it's a trap?
HURLEY What do you mean a trap?
SAWYER You hear that? 
VOICE Damn it.
DESMOND You. 
KATE Okay, okay, just wait one second, okay. I'll be right back. Everybody needs to know what's going on, Jack. There's a boat...
JACK Just tell them Desmond's back until I find out the rest, okay.
JACK So, before you ran off, I guess you just forgot to mention that you still have a sailboat. Why'd you come back?
DESMOND Do you think I did it on purpose? I was sailing for two and half weeks, bearing due West and making 9 knots. I should have been in Fiji in less than a week. But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No, it was here—this, this island. And you know why? Because this is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snow globe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink.
DESMOND Are you still pushing it?
JACK Yeah, we're still pushing it.
MASTER SERGEANT Set of keys; one pocket watch, gold plated; one photograph (the same picture Desmond had in the Hatch); one book, Our Mutual Friend. Why didn't you bring that inside?
DESMOND To avoid temptation, brother. I've read everything Mr. Charles Dickens has ever written - every wonderful word. Every book except this one. I'm saving it so it will be the last thing I ever read before I die.
MASTER SERGEANT Nice idea, as long as you know when you're going to die. Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume your sentence is hereby complete and you are now and forever dishonorably discharged from the Royal Scotts Regiment of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Long live the queen. Enjoy your sodding book.
WIDMORE You want a ride?
DESMOND Not with you.
WIDMORE Get in the car.
DESMOND Did you bring me a present?
WIDMORE Actually, two presents. One of these boxes contains your past, Hume. The other, your future. Go ahead, open it.
DESMOND You're a bastard, you know that?
WIDMORE The fact that she never received your sentiments is good for her. Good, because as far as she's concerned you've forsaken her. And that's the way it's going to stay.
DESMOND Is it now?
WIDMORE Penelope's moved on, Hume. She's getting married. This is for your new life—away from my daughter. The conditions are simple—no contact, no calls, no posts. You just run away, Desmond.
DESMOND And what makes you think I would just run away?
WIDMORE Because you're a coward.
SAYID On the way to the funeral I told you that Michael had been compromised by the Others, and then you asked me how we might take advantage of that. I believe fate has given us our answer—the boat.
JACK The boat?
SAYID This camp Michael is leading you to across the Island—that is where they will set their trap. While Michael leads you by land, I can approach far more quickly by sea. And I can go ashore undetected.
JACK Go ashore and do what?
SAYID Scout them—their numbers and positions, their weapons. Then I'll go to the nearest beach and start a signal fire with these . They burn with a dark, black smoke. You and your team will come to meet me at the signal and we will go in together.
JACK We're not even sure if Michael's been turned by them.
SAYID He has been turned.
JACK I'll have to tell Kate, and Hurley and Sawyer what we're doing.
SAYID No. Michael cannot sense we know he is lying. All we have is the element of surprise, Jack. Right now it's only your responsibility to keep it secret.
JACK Black smoke, huh?
SAYID This time they will know that we are coming.
EKO Hello, John. Where have you been?
LOCKE I've been thinking.
EKO About what?
LOCKE That in a minute that computer's going to start beeping, and when it does you're going to let it go. You're going to let it run down to zero, past zero. And you're not going to push the button.
EKO But I am going to push the button. Why wouldn't I?
LOCKE Because you don't want to be a slave.
EKO I am a slave to nothing.
LOCKE You're a slave to that , just like I was. So I'm going to tell you again—don't push it.
EKO Do not tell me what I can do.
LOCKE You cannot push that button.
LOCKE No, it's not real. We're only puppets—puppets on strings. As long as we push it, we'll never be free.
EKO Well, you're free now, John. Do not come back.
LOCKE No.
HURLEY No way. I'm not even going to kill someone.
SAWYER Ain't that the point?
HURLEY I thought the point was to get Walt back?
JACK What's the matter?
KATE All that stuff we found in the medical station—costumes, make-up, fake beards—what if these people just want us to think they're hillbillies?
MICHAEL Listen, I was there. I saw them. They are hillbillies. They live in huts; they eat fish; they're probably more scared than we are. And they have no idea we're on our way.
SAWYER Alright, enough jibber-jabber, let's roll.
SAYID I need your boat.
DESMOND I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal.
SAYID I'm not going out there. I need to get to the North shore of the Island, and quickly.
DESMOND Going to see the hostiles, are you?
SAYID What?
DESMOND You know what, ignorance is bliss. The boat's all yours, brother, for all the good it'll do you.
SAYID I don't know how to sail.
DESMOND Then I suggest you find someone who does.
DESMOND Just give me which ever one has the most caffeine in it, brother. Damn, um, I'm sorry. I've just arrived and I spent all my American money on a taxi.
LIBBY I've got it.
DESMOND That's not necessary.
LIBBY It's just 4 bucks.
DESMOND I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those do you?
LIBBY Depends on what it's for.
DESMOND I was joking.
LIBBY No you weren't.
LIBBY So, a sailing race around the world?
DESMOND I have 8 months to get into the best shape of my life. I'll tell you what, miss, I'm going to win.
LIBBY And what do you get if you do?
DESMOND What really matters is who I win it for. 
LIBBY Charles Widmore.
DESMOND He tried to buy me off. And when I didn't take his money, he took away the only thing in the world that I ever truly cared about.
LIBBY Who is she?
DESMOND His daughter. I was unsuitable on several levels.
LIBBY And what's the 42 grand for?
DESMOND It's a wee bit complicated. As of yet, I don't actually have a boat. Sorry, did I say something wrong?
LIBBY I have a boat. It was my husband's but he got sick. He wanted to sail the Mediterranean—he never—he passed away about a month ago.
DESMOND I'm sorry.
LIBBY I want you to have it.
DESMOND I can't take your boat, miss.
LIBBY But you have to. He'd want you to.
DESMOND What was your husband's name?
LIBBY David.
DESMOND And what did he name his boat?
LIBBY Elizabeth. He named it after me.
DESMOND Then I thank you, Elizabeth. And I shall win this race for love.
JIN 뭐라는 거야?
SUN Would you excuse us, please?
SAYID I'll be at the shore.
SUN 당신이 배로 사이드를 섬 반대쪽으로 데려다 주기를 원해요. 마이클을 도와주기 위해서야. 
JIN 안 돼. 이제 당신을 두고 갈 수 없어. 
SUN 날 두고 당신 혼자 가라는 얘기가 아니에요. 나도 같이 갈 거에요. 
KATE Don't even think about it. It's a trap—a net. Rousseau's got them all over the Island.
SAWYER How the hell would you know that?
KATE I tripped one with Jack. We ended up—never mind. What?
SAWYER When the Doc told me you all got caught in a net I thought he meant, uh—something else.
KATE Since when did you and Jack start talking about me?
HURLEY Did that bird just say my name?
SAWYER Yeah, it did. Right before it crapped gold.
JACK Sorry, man. I guess I forgot to load that one. Want to give me the mag?
CHARLIE John. What happened to your face?
LOCKE Nothing, I'm fine.
CHARLIE Hey, uh, if you're feeling a little sorry for yourself you may want to have a drink with your mate from the Hatch. I hear he's a little despondent, as well.
LOCKE What?
CHARLIE Oh, that's right; you weren't there for the dramatic arrival at the funeral. I think he's pushed your button too many times, if you ask me.
LOCKE Desmond?
CHARLIE Yeah, Desmond. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
SAYID I'm sorry if what I said was confusing, but I asked Jin to come.
SUN You need someone to translate. And you need at least two people who know how to sail.
SAYID Desmond managed by himself.
SUN And look where he ended up.
DESMOND You're wasting your time, sister. I shot myself with that stuff every 9 days for 3 years. He's lovely. Is the father here on the Island?
CLAIRE No. Nope, he's been gone a long time. Sort of walked off the moment he got a bit scared by the situation.
DESMOND Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad—thought he was doing what was best for you.
CLAIRE He was doing what was best for him.
DESMOND How did you find me?
PENELOPE The landlord at your flat told me you ran here everyday.
DESMOND How did you find me?
PENELOPE I have a lot of money, Desmond. With enough money and determination you can find anyone. Did you read your beloved book—the one you were saving?
DESMOND Not yet.
PENELOPE I thought you might have read it while you were away.
DESMOND I was in prison, not away.
PENELOPE Why didn't you write to me?
DESMOND When are you getting married, Pen?
PENELOPE We haven't set a date yet.
DESMOND I'll be back in a year.
PENELOPE What if you were back, right now?
DESMOND I'm going to win this race, Pen—his race. And in a year, I'll be back.
PENELOPE Desmond, what are you running from?
DESMOND I have to get my honor back, and that's what I'm running to.
LOCKE So what did one snowman say to other snowman?
DESMOND Smells like carrots.
LOCKE Hello, Desmond.
DESMOND Hello yourself, box man.
LOCKE Do you mind?
DESMOND Oh, I insist. So you managed to fix the computer, then, did you?
LOCKE World's still here, ain't it?
DESMOND I'm not so sure about that, brother.
LOCKE Refresh my memory, Desmond. How long did you say that you were down there in the Hatch?
DESMOND 3 years.
LOCKE Desmond, what if I told you that for all that—all those years that you and all the men before you were down there pushing that button—what if I told you that it was all for nothing?
DESMOND I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that?
LOCKE I found another hatch—another station on the Island. They called it the Pearl, and I saw a film there—an orientation film. And it said that everything that was happening in our hatch wasn't real—that it was a test—a psychological experiment.
DESMOND You're lying.
LOCKE You want to take a walk? I'll make the popcorn.
DESMOND You're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button!
LOCKE Well, I have. Except, unfortunately, someone else decided to start. So you're going to sober up. We're going to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we're going to find out what happens if that button doesn't get pushed.
SAWYER DHARMA nutri-bar?
HURLEY No thanks; I'm not hungry.
SAWYER You serious?
JACK Hey, you alright?
MICHAEL Yeah, just getting some more firewood. Not feeling too hot.
JACK You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll give you a hand.
MICHAEL Hey, thanks for coming out here—risking your neck for my boy.
JACK Live together, die alone, man.
MICHAEL Yeah.
JIN 내가 오지 말라고 했잖아. 
SUN 뱃멀미 하는 거 아니에요. 
JIN 알아. 보여줄 게 있어. 
SAYID I don't know what is more disquieting—the fact that the rest of the statue is missing, or that it has 4 toes?
EKO John!
LOCKE Neat trick.
EKO John! John! Can you hear me? Open up.
DESMOND Are you sure about this, brother?
LOCKE I'm more sure about this than anything in my entire life.
EKO Don't do this! John!
DESMOND Alright then, box man. We wait.
INMAN Are you him?
DESMOND What?
INMAN What did one snowman say to the other?
DESMOND What are you talking about? Who are you?
INMAN I'm Inman. Kelvin Inman.
DESMOND What, what happened to my boat?
INMAN I found you washed up on the beach. There was no boat.
DESMOND What was all that about, then?
INMAN Just saving the world.
MARVIN CANDLE Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor.
INMAN How many times are you going to watch that thing?
DESMOND Why are there missing parts?
INMAN Radzinsky made some edits.
DESMOND Who's Radzinsky?
INMAN He was my partner.
DESMOND And what happened to him?
INMAN Just make sure you put that back behind Turn of the Screw when you're done with it.
DESMOND Why do you wear that suit?
INMAN So I don't get infected out there. Give yourself a shot of this every 9 days. You were out there a while before I found you. Hope it's not too late.
EKO John!
DESMOND Who is he, box man—the man out there pounding on the door?
LOCKE His name is Mr. Eko.
DESMOND Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture?
LOCKE Because he's a priest.
EKO Open the door, please. John! Can you hear me? Open up.
DESMOND We locked out a priest?
EKO Charlie, do you know how they got the Hatch door open?
CHARLIE No, but if you hum it, I could probably play it.
EKO How did they open it—the door that says "quarantine"?
CHARLIE They blew it up, why?
EKO Charlie, I need your help.
CHARLIE Oh, now I'm back in your good graces, Father?
EKO Charlie, John has locked me out of the Hatch. And I believe he is doing this because he is going to stop pushing that button. And, Charlie, I am absolutely certain that if he is successful, in 90 minutes everyone on this island will die.
CHARLIE Alright, I'm in. I'm in.
EKO Thank you. Come, come quickly.
SAWYER So, these Others, you think they're left over from the DHARMA folk?
MICHAEL I don't know, man.
SAWYER My theory, they're aliens. That's why they use the fake beards—their heads are made of pathetic.
HURLEY Prosthetic, dude.
SAWYER You can't even spell and now you're correcting me? What do you think, Freckles?
KATE Just keep moving, we're being followed.
SAWYER What?
KATE Just keep smiling. There's at least two of them across the river. In about 5 seconds I'm going to turn the tables on them. 
SAWYER Wait a second.
KATE You in?
KATE He's getting away!
KATE He's dead. We have to find the other one.
JACK No!
KATE I'm going. Sawyer.
JACK I said no!
SAWYER Are you crazy?! We let him go they'll know we're coming! He'll...
JACK It doesn't matter if we catch him now! They've already been warned.
SAWYER What do you mean "warned"?
JACK Why don't you tell them, Michael?
KATE Jack.
MICHAEL I don't know what you're talking about.
JACK Stop lying! Tell them.
MICHAEL Tell them what?
JACK I know what you're doing, Michael! Now tell them the truth! Tell them!
MICHAEL It was the only way. They gave me a list.
JACK What list?
MICHAEL It had your names on it. I had to bring all 4 of you back, or they said I'd never see my son again!
JACK Who are they?
MICHAEL It's like I said—they live in a camp with huts. I swear, that's it.
KATE You let Henry go?
HURLEY Did you kill them? Ana Lucia and Libby? Did you?
MICHAEL I had to, man. I, God, I couldn't find any other way. And Libby was a mistake. I, I didn't have time to think.
HURLEY But if you did have time—you still would have killed her, right?
MICHAEL I'm sorry. You understand—I am sorry. I'm sorry. I—my son!
HURLEY I'm going back.
JACK No, Hurley. Hurley, you can't!
HURLEY We're all going to get killed and you knew it! You let us come anyway.
JACK It's too late to go back now, Hurley. We already caught them following us once. If they don't believe that we trust Michael, they'll kill us all! I'm sorry that I didn't say anything. But you have to know that I would never bring you out here if I didn't have a plan.
SAWYER What plan?
SAYID 
JIN Sayid! Here.
SAYID That's the rock Michael described. We're here.
EKO Hurry, please.
CHARLIE Hurley showed me. It's around here somewhere. It's definitely around, uh...
EKO We're running out of time, Charlie.
CHARLIE Here it is! Told you. Careful. Careful. Dynamite is very unstable. You don't want to end up like Dr. Arzt.
CHARLIE Careful. Eko, hey, Eko. Listen, what if we hurt them? Or blow up the computer?
EKO You can leave now, Charlie.
CHARLIE John, it's Charlie. Let's work this thing out, John. John! Eko is very upset, John. Just open this door and we can talk about it. John, you should know Eko is going to blow open the blast door.
LOCKE Blow it open with what?
CHARLIE With dynamite from the old ship in the jungle.
DESMOND It would take an atom bomb, brother. Tell him not to bother.
LOCKE You're sure it'll hold?
DESMOND Aye, I'm sure.
DESMOND Maybe you should do it?
INMAN Come on, Des, you've seen me do it a hundred times.
DESMOND How do you even remember where you left off from?
INMAN Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly. You should have seen Radzinsky do this. He had a photographic memory. I mean, this whole baby was his idea.
DESMOND Yeah, right, Radzinsky. Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown. Radzinsky created this great invisible map. More and more tales about your former partner. Yet for some reason, you never want to tell me what bloody well happened to him.
INMAN See that brown stain, there? That's Radzinsky. He put a shotgun in his mouth when I was asleep. The bitch of it was, I only had a 108 minutes to bury the poor bastard.
DESMOND Well, if you don't want me to go crazy, next time let me go out.
INMAN Well, you want to go out there with the quarantine and the hostiles?
DESMOND I haven't been outside for 2 bloody years! Yes, I want to go! I was in the army for God's sake!
INMAN Oh, right, Her Majesty's Army, correct? Tell me, Desmond, why'd you leave that nice old lady's army? Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out because you couldn't follow orders.
DESMOND Why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh?
INMAN Because men followed my orders. Ah, but then thank God I joined the DHARMA Initiative. Namaste, thank you, and good luck. 
DESMOND Please, Kelvin. Let me go out, huh? Just once.
INMAN Sorry, Des. You stay here. You push the button. That's an order.
CHARLIE John! Seriously, you're about to be detonated.
CHARLIE Hey, what if John's right. What if it's just some colossal joke? You know, it's just some old computer connected to nothing? Maybe it's just a bunch of wires?
EKO Is that a joke?
CHARLIE I'll see myself out.
EKO John, this is your last time to end this. Open the door, and I will forgive you.
LOCKE Forgive me for what?
CHARLIE Hey, hey, Eko. Wait. Just wait a second. I don't think it's a good idea, Eko. We're in a very confined area.
CHARLIE Oh, bollocks.
DESMOND Kelvin! Hey, Kelvin.
INMAN I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
DESMOND What is this?
INMAN This is the only other way out, partner.
DESMOND What are you talking about?
INMAN Failsafe. Turn this key and this all goes away.
DESMOND What's behind that wall, Kelvin? Huh? What was the incident?
INMAN Electromagnetism, geologically unique. The incident—there was a leak. So now the charge builds up and every time we push the button it discharges it before it gets too big.
DESMOND Why make us do it—push the button? If we, if we can just...
INMAN Here's the real question, Desmundo—do you have the courage to take your finger out of the dam and blow the whole thing up, instead?
DESMOND I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother.
LOCKE They're not my friends.
DESMOND I can't hear anything. Maybe we should open it.
LOCKE No, no; it's a trick.
DESMOND A trick? They could be hurt! Is your doctor around?
LOCKE Our doctor is God knows where. And he sure as hell doesn't care about anything happening down here.
DESMOND Can I ask you a question, brother?
LOCKE Absolutely.
DESMOND Is the reason you're letting that clock there run all the way down to the very last tick—is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun to find out what you really believe, John?
LOCKE I looked down the barrel of the gun and I believed. I thought it was my destiny to get into this place. And someone died—a kid. Because he was stupid enough to believe that I knew what I was talking about. And the night that he died for nothing, I was sitting right up there, all alone, beating my hand bloody against that stupid door—screaming to the heavens asking what I should do. And then a light went on. I thought it was a sign. But it wasn't a sign. Probably just you going to the bathroom.
KATE Jack.
HURLEY What are they?
KATE It's handwritten. It's all filled, the whole book. They're journal entries.
KATE 0400 S.R. moves ping-pong table again. 0415 Takes a shower. What is this?
SAWYER Hey, Doc, what did you say Sayid's signal's going to be when the coast is clear to hit that beach party?
KATE That means he found them, right?
JACK That's miles from here. Where were you taking us?
MICHAEL What?
JACK Sayid said that he'd light the signal so that we could meet him at the shore. Why aren't we going to the beach?
MICHAEL We are headed to the beach.
JACK We're nowhere near the beach!
MICHAEL Look, I had to.
JACK What?!
KATE Sawyer!
JACK Run!!! Go, go!
MICHAEL Wait!
DESMOND Tell me about this other hatch you found—this Pearl.
LOCKE What do you want to know?
DESMOND Details.
LOCKE The Pearl is a psychological station full of TV monitors. And two men sat in viewing chairs and filled notebooks with observations on what happens in here. And then they put the notebooks in pneumatic tubes and send them back to their headquarters so they could evaluate us—as an experiment. What?
DESMOND What if you've got it backwards?
LOCKE Backwards?
DESMOND What if the experiment wasn't on the two men in here, but on the two men in there? I want to see that tape, John.
LOCKE No, you can't. There's no way to see it down here.
DESMOND Well, was there anything else in that station? Was there a computer?
LOCKE Yeah.
DESMOND So what did it do?!
LOCKE Nothing! It didn't do anything. It printed out numbers. Lots and lots of numbers.
DESMOND What printout, where is it?
LOCKE Here, reading material for the next 19 minutes. Knock yourself out.
INMAN You've been shaving everyday for the last 3 years. You need to live a little, let go.
DESMOND I'm never going to let go, brother.
INMAN Oh, that's the spirit. Bye, Des.
DESMOND Goodbye?
INMAN Yeah, goodbye. See you in a couple hours.
INMAN Well, gosh, I didn't think you had the stones to come after me. I was a spook for 10 years, Des. I know when I'm being followed.
DESMOND What are you doing with my boat?
INMAN I'm fixing it.
DESMOND You were leaving?
INMAN Well, I mean, not yet. It's still about a week away. You wrecked it pretty good, Des. What do you think? Want to come with me?
DESMOND Come where?! What about the button?!
INMAN Screw the button, man. Who knows if it's even real?
DESMOND That's not what you said when you were going on and on about dams and electromagnetics and failsafes!
INMAN Well, I was drunk.
DESMOND Why did you lie to me?!
INMAN I lied to you because I needed a sucker to save the world after I left!
DESMOND You crazy old bastard! You stole my life!!
INMAN Oh, come on.
DESMOND What else did you lie to me about?! What else? Tell me?!
DESMOND How could you do this to me?! Get up.
DESMOND Oh my God. Oh my God.
LOCKE What are you doing?
DESMOND When did you come here?
LOCKE What?
DESMOND The Island—when did you come here? How long ago?
LOCKE 60-65 days.
DESMOND The date—what was the date?
LOCKE September 22nd.
LOCKE It was September 22nd.
DESMOND I think I crashed your plane.
SAWYER Son-of-bitch...
MR. FRIENDLY Everybody just calm down.
KATE It's fake. I know that your beard is fake.
MR. FRIENDLY Sorry, missy, I didn't get you.
MS. KLUGH She says she's knows your beard's fake, Tom.
MR. FRIENDLY Well, thanks for pointing that out, Kate. I can't tell you how much this thing itches. And thanks for telling them my name, Bea.
GALE Hello again. Where's your beard?
MR. FRIENDLY I think they know.
GALE Alright, let's take care of business, shall we?
CHARLIE Eko? Eko! It's Charlie. Wake up.
DESMOND We need to push the button.
LOCKE No, we don't!
DESMOND Do you not hear me, brother? I crashed your bloody plane?
LOCKE How did you manage to do that?
DESMOND On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics. And when the last one came down this whole place started to shake! And that screen? That screen filled up with "system failure," System Failure! And I know what they are. 92204—September the 22nd, 2004, the day your planed crashed! It's real! It's all bloody real!! Now, push the damn button!!
LOCKE I know what I saw! It's a lie; it's not real! None of it is real!
DESMOND You don't want to push the button? Then I will.
LOCKE No!
DESMOND You killed us. You killed us all.
LOCKE No. I just saved us all.
CHARLIE Hey, Eko, wake up. Hey, can I get some help? Can you help me?
DESMOND I'm trying, brother.
PENELOPE Dearest Des, I am writing this letter to you as you leave for prison. And I've hidden in the one place you would turn to in a moment of great desperation. I know you go away with the weight of what happened on your shoulders. And I know the only person who can ever take it off is you. Please don't give up, Des. Because all we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you, Pen.
DESMOND It's all gone. It's all gone!!
LOCKE I've done everything you wanted me to do? Why did you do this?! Why?!
DESMOND 3 days before you came down here, before we met, I heard a banging on the Hatch door, shouting. But it was you, John, wasn't it? You said there isn't any purpose—there's no such thing as fate. But you saved my life, brother, so that I could save yours.
LOCKE No, no, no, none of this is real! Nothing is going to happen. We're going to be okay.
DESMOND I've got to go. And you've got to get as far away from here as possible.
LOCKE Go where?! Stop!
DESMOND I'm going to blow the dam, John. I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing. But it's all real. Now I've got to go and make it all go away.
LOCKE Wait, Desmond.
DESMOND I'll see you in another life, brother.
CHARLIE Eko! Eko! Wake up! Can you move? Okay, come on.
CHARLIE Eko, on your feet.
EKO Charlie.
CHARLIE No.
EKO John!
LOCKE I was wrong.
PENELOPE All we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you.
DESMOND I love you, Penny.
BERNARD Charlie, are you okay?
CHARLIE It's hard to tell exactly. But, my ears, you know?
BERNARD Where's Locke—Eko?
CHARLIE They're not back yet?
GALE I'm not happy about the arrangement that was made with you Michael, but we got more than we bargained for when Walt joined us, so I suppose this is what's best. And you let me go, set me free—you lived up to your word. We live up to our word, too. Do you know how to drive a boat?
MICHAEL Yeah, I can drive a boat.
GALE Good, then you're going to take this boat and follow a compass bearing of 325, and if you do that exactly, you and your son will find rescue.
MICHAEL That's it? I follow the bearing and me and my son get rescued?
GALE Yes.
MICHAEL How do you know I won't tell people about where I was?
GALE Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But it won't matter. Once you leave, you'll never be able to get back here. And my hunch is you won't say a word to anybody because if you do, people will find out what you did to get your son back.
MICHAEL My friends—I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.
GALE A deal's a deal.
MICHAEL Who are you people?
GALE We're the good guys, Michael. Alright, she's all yours.
MICHAEL What? What, am I stupid? Where's my son?!
GALE Walt's inside.
GALE Bon voyage, Michael.
MICHAEL Walt!
WALT Dad! Dad!
MICHAEL Come here, come here . You okay?
WALT Yeah.
MICHAEL You sure? Okay, I've got you now. It's going to be okay now. We're going home, Walt. We are going home.
MS. KLUGH Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
HURLEY What?
MS. KLUGH Go back. Your job is to tell the rest of your people they can never come here.
HURLEY But what about my friends?
GALE Your friends are coming home with us.
MS. KLUGH Go.
CLAIRE What happened out there, Charlie?
CHARLIE You want to hear the part about me nearly being killed by the flaming fireball—or the flying fork?
CLAIRE I want you to be serious.
CHARLIE Nothing happened.
CLAIRE Well, something happened. I mean that noise, and the sky turned that weird violet color.
CHARLIE Did it?
CHARLIE Ow, ow.
MAN #1 Quem quebrou isso, hein?
MAN #2 Não se preocupe. Tá quebrado. Destruí sua defesa. Essa será sua última vez que verá "o" torre. 
MAN #1 Parte do plano, meu amigo. Tudo parte do plano. 
MAN #2 Ah, então seu plano deve ser perder. Agora, por favor. 
MAN #2 O quê? 
MAN #1 Há quanto tempo tá fazendo isto? 
MAN #1 É isso, não é? A gente não percebeu de novo. Eles vão matar a gente! 
MAN #2 Fica quieto! Nós não o perdemos! 
MAN #1 Fala! Fala de novo que não é um alarme falso. Fala, fala de novo. Fala que eu... 
MAN #2 Cala a boca e chama ajuda!! 
PENELOPE Hello.
MAN #1 Ms. Widmore?
PENELOPE Yes.
MAN #1 It's us. I think we found it.
