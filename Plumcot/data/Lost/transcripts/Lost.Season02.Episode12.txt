claire_littleton Thanks.
charlie_pace Has he been asking about me?
claire_littleton Charlie -- don't.
charlie_pace I'm sorry. I should have told you about the statue -- what was in it. I just wish things could get back to the way they were before.
claire_littleton There is no before, Charlie. We were strangers on a plane and we became friends.

karen I just needed to see her again. Isn't she brilliant?
charlie_pace She's beautiful, Karen.
karen I named her Megan. Where's Liam? He's not here.
charlie_pace Karen, look, it wasn't his fault. We were leaving the club in Dresden -- I was in a cab -- he, he was in a van with the gear and they blew a tire on the way to the airport. He missed his flight. He's on the next plane, alright? He'll be here soon.
karen But he's okay?
charlie_pace He's great. He's a dad.
charlie_pace Oh, for the -- Liam. Unbelievable. Liam?
charlie_pace Liam, wake up! Oi, what the hell's wrong with you? What the hell are you doing?

liam_pace I'm cool. I'm cool. I just needed to get right, that's all. Don't worry, I left you some.
charlie_pace Get right? Why don't you get up? Take a shower, get dressed, get to the hospital.
liam_pace Alright. Alright, I'm on it. Alright.
charlie_pace Oh, by the way -- you have a daughter. Her name's Megan.
liam_pace After mum?
charlie_pace Yeah, after mum. Now clean yourself up. You're a sodding father now.
kate_austen Easy. That's good. That was good. Okay, one more.
hugo_reyes Uh, Sawyer, when you were over there across the Island how well did you get to know those Tailies?
james_ford Well enough, why?
hugo_reyes That Libby chick seems pretty cool. I mean, is she?
james_ford Well, you got a little love connection brewing over there, Jabba?
hugo_reyes Nah, just asking.
james_ford I hear you asking.
hugo_reyes Forget it.
kate_austen What's with you? You're acting like you're in junior high.
james_ford Well, what do we have here? It looks like Ana Lucia is getting the 20 dollar tour. That's the third time I've seen them walking out of the jungle. What do you suppose they're doing out there?
kate_austen Why don't you just do your exercises, Sawyer.
charlie_pace Bloody hell.
charlie_pace Hey! Hey! Somebody help me! I ca-- help!
charlie_pace Help! The baby!
charlie_pace Aaron! Aaron! I'm coming! I'm coming, Aaron! Okay. Just hang on.
charlie_pace I've got you. It's alright. It's okay. You're okay now. You're safe. You're safe. It's okay.
charlie_pace Mom? Claire?
mrs_pace PACE He's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in terrible danger. He's in danger. You have to save him. He's in danger. You have to save him. Danger. You have to save him. He's in danger.
claire_littleton You have to save the baby. Charlie, only you can save him. The baby. You have to save the baby, Charlie.
hugo_reyes Charlie? What are you doing?
charlie_pace What?
hugo_reyes What are you doing, man?
charlie_pace What's going on?
hugo_reyes It's the middle of the night. What are you doing with the baby?
charlie_pace I don't know.
claire_littleton Help! Somebody took my baby!! I don't know, Aaron's gone.
hugo_reyes It's okay! We're over here!
claire_littleton Is he alright?! Is he okay?!
charlie_pace Claire. I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. He's okay, though. I, I had this dream --
hugo_reyes Stick? I don't know, dude. Don't you need 21? I think you should hit.
james_ford But I've got a 6; I'm going to bust.
hugo_reyes How do you know that?
james_ford Well, I don't, but you've got to assume that I'm going to bust.
hugo_reyes Why?
james_ford Well, well, look who's off to the laundromat? Well, go on. I'm sure you've got a load you need to drop in, don't you, Jethro?
hugo_reyes I'm kind of waiting for my moment.
james_ford Well, your moment is now, Hoss. Hey Libby!
libby_smith Hey yourself.
charlie_pace Hey, John, can I talk to you for a second?
john_locke Yeah, what is it, Charlie?
charlie_pace I take it you heard about what happened last night.
john_locke If you mean you taking the baby out of Claire's tent in the middle of the night -- yeah, I heard.
charlie_pace This whole thing was a big misunderstanding, John. I was sleepwalking. I don't how or why --
john_locke Is there something you want from me, Charlie?
charlie_pace I was hoping you could speak to Claire for me. You know, put in a good word.
john_locke Are you using?
charlie_pace What?
john_locke Heroin. Are you using again?
charlie_pace Kate sees a horse -- nothing. Pretty much everybody's seen Walt wandering around the jungle. But when it's Charlie it must be the bloody drugs, right?
john_locke It's funny, you didn't answer my question.
charlie_pace You remember the plane, John? We burned it, Eko and me. We burned the whole thing -- the heroin, the statues -- it's all gone. Destroyed.
john_locke All of them?
charlie_pace All of them.
john_locke Trust is a hard thing to win back. Claire needs time. You should leave her and the baby alone for awhile.
charlie_pace Can you do this? You look green.
liam_pace Sod off. I'm fine.
commercial_director All right, let's give this another go, shall we?
charlie_pace Get it together, alright. Lest you forget, we need this.
commercial_director Tea. So, you lads ready?
charlie_pace Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.
commercial_director Let's try not to blow it this time, eh.
charlie_pace Thank you. You good?
commercial_director We've only 20 minutes until we're in overtime. Now get it right.
commercial_director Alright. Camera. Rotate on the 8 count.
all@ Rolling.
commercial_director Hold the product up!
all@ Bubbies diapers, take 53.
all@ Playback.
commercial_director And, action.
commercial_director Cut!
charlie_pace It's alright.
commercial_director That's it. We wrap.
charlie_pace Oi, no! Oi, mate, hang on. Wait, what are you doing?
commercial_director Let's not waste anymore time, shall we? You were only hired as a favor to your lawyer. I wanted Dirt Spigot.
charlie_pace Come on, mate. Give us another chance.
commercial_director You want another chance? Take my advice; ditch that one . He's a bloody disaster.
charlie_pace I'm not ditching anyone. He's my brother.
commercial_director Right. Well then, I guess you're fired.
libby_smith Is this washer and dryer newer than everything else in here?
hugo_reyes It washes clothes. That's all I need to know.
libby_smith Ah, finally, someone who keeps it simple. Oh, hey, look at this. I got it in some of the abandoned luggage. You think I can pull this off? Let me give you a hand -- when a girl asks that kind of question, she's looking for validation.
hugo_reyes Do I know you from somewhere?
libby_smith You mean other than the flight?
hugo_reyes Flight?
libby_smith Okay, turn around.
hugo_reyes Huh?
libby_smith Turn around. I want to try it on. Turn around.
hugo_reyes Oh, oh, sure, go ahead.
libby_smith No peeking. I cannot believe you don't remember stepping on my foot.
hugo_reyes I did?
libby_smith Yes, you did. And it was hard. I know that because I remember you were the last one on the flight, and you were all sweaty, and you had headphones on -- and crunch. You stepped on my foot. Okay, turn around. What do you think?
hugo_reyes It's awesome.
libby_smith Thanks.
charlie_pace What are you doing?
mr_eko I'm marking trees.
charlie_pace Why?
mr_eko Because these are the ones I like.
charlie_pace Did you tell Locke you gave me one of those statues from the plane?
mr_eko Why would I do that?
charlie_pace He knows, man. Bald wanker knows something.
mr_eko Something wrong, Charlie?
charlie_pace Apart from me losing my mind? No, everything's just peachy.
mr_eko Why would you say you are losing your mind?
charlie_pace How about the fact that I've been sleepwalking? Stealing babies from their cribs? Oh yeah, and then there's the vivid dreams that make me feel like I'm completely awake until, of course, I wake up.
mr_eko What are your dreams about?
charlie_pace Variations on Aaron being in mortal peril -- trapped in a piano, drifting out to sea, there's the flying dove, and Claire and my mum dressed as angels telling me I need to save the baby. What?
mr_eko Have you ever considered that these dreams mean something?
charlie_pace Like what?
mr_eko What if you do need to save the baby?
charlie_pace I have to talk to her.
kate_austen Hey, you know, now's not a good time. Okay?
charlie_pace No, I have to talk to her. She'll want to hear this.
kate_austen Okay, you know what, so tell me and I will tell her.
charlie_pace Kate! No. Claire!
kate_austen I said not now!
charlie_pace Claire! Wait, please, Claire! Listen to me. Aaron's in danger.
claire_littleton What are you talking about?
charlie_pace The baby's in danger! Look, I've been having these dreams. I know what they mean now.
kate_austen Charlie.
charlie_pace Kate! Claire, listen, we have to baptize Aaron.
claire_littleton What?
charlie_pace We can do this! Eko's a priest! We can do this!
kate_austen It's time to go.
charlie_pace No, wait! I'm not finished! Claire, look, we have to baptize Aaron!
kate_austen I said it's time to go. Now!
dr_jack_shephard Here. For when it rains.
ana_lucia_cortez Thanks.
ana_lucia_cortez So when are you going to tell me what happened in the jungle?
dr_jack_shephard I already did. Pull it tighter; it'll sag.
ana_lucia_cortez You told me what that guy said. You didn't tell me what made you turn around -- what made you come back.
dr_jack_shephard He had a gun at Kate's head.
ana_lucia_cortez You hittin' that?
dr_jack_shephard What?
ana_lucia_cortez Plane crash -- you both survive -- nice beach -- she's hot, you're hot. It's what people do.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not hittin' that.
charlie_pace Hey.
liam_pace Karen kicked me out, man.
charlie_pace What? What happened?
liam_pace She, uh, she thinks I'm dangerous.
charlie_pace Why would she think that?
liam_pace Because I dropped her. I dropped Megan.
charlie_pace Oh. Hey, Liam, sorry.
liam_pace I've got no money. I've got nothing. What are we going to do?
charlie_pace We'll get through this.
liam_pace Yeah, how's that?
charlie_pace I'm writing again. I've got a new song. It's about 2 brothers.
liam_pace 2 brothers who should be butchers.
charlie_pace Don't say that! It's a good one. I feel like this might be the one. Alright, listen to this, okay. Funny now, you finally see me standing here/Funny now, I'm crying in the rain. All alone, I try to be invincible/Together now , we can be saved. Nice, man.
liam_pace This could work.
charlie_pace It's good, right?
liam_pace We could make it work. Write all night just like the old days.
charlie_pace Alright.
liam_pace So, baby brother, have you got any?
john_locke I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.
charlie_pace You followed me?
john_locke How long have you been coming out here?
charlie_pace John, you've got the wrong idea, man.
john_locke You said you destroyed them all, and yet here they are. How is that the wrong idea?
charlie_pace I came out here to finish the job. I'm going to get rid of these right now.
john_locke Yeah, that's very convenient now that I found you.
charlie_pace What are you doing?
john_locke There was a time when I let you choose whether or not you were going to do this to yourself. Now I'm making that choice for you.
charlie_pace Oh, you don't believe me? Give them to me. Give them to me right now; I'll destroy them! Look! I'll throw them in the sodding wind. Look, John, I know I lied, alright. Just wait, wait, wait! Remember all those talks we had, you and me? You said everything happens for a reason -- this island tests us. That's what this is, John, a test. This is my test. That's why these are here.
john_locke These are here because you put them here, Charlie.
charlie_pace Wait, John, wait. What are you going to do? Are you going to tell Claire? You can't. If she sees them, I'm done. She'll never trust me again, and she has to, John. It's about the baby, alright? Aaron's in danger. You have to believe me.
john_locke You've given up the right to be believed, Charlie.
claire_littleton Hey.
john_locke Hi. How's our boy?
claire_littleton Oh, he's good. Hey, John, can I ask you something?
john_locke Sure.
claire_littleton Do you think Aaron and I could stay in the bedroom in the Hatch for a while?
john_locke A pretty loud alarm goes off every hour and a half. It's not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night.
claire_littleton Oh, yeah, sure.
john_locke How about if I move my stuff down here for a couple of nights -- set up right next to your tent?
claire_littleton That would be great, thanks.
john_locke Consider it done.
claire_littleton Hey, John, you don't know anything about baptism, do you?
john_locke Not a whole lot, why?
claire_littleton Charlie came by my tent before and told me Aaron had to be baptized -- he was in danger.
john_locke My understanding is that baptism is about making sure that children get into heaven -- should anything happen. Call it spiritual insurance. There isn't any danger, Claire. Charlie is just -- Charlie just feels like he has to save the baby because he can't save himself. I'll see you tonight.
sayid_jarrah Charlie, can you give us a hand?
charlie_pace Now's not a good time, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Here, let's lift this.
sayid_jarrah Fire! Fire! Grab tools, containers for sand, anything you have. If we don't stop it now, it's going to burn right through the camp.
john_locke Stay here with Aaron.
sayid_jarrah We need to cut a fire break right here! Form a bucket line!
john_locke Some of you people down to the water! We'll hand them up, wait here.
charlie_pace Liam! My piano. What's going on? Liam, where's my piano?
liam_pace I sold it.
charlie_pace You what? Hey, wait, I don't have to --
liam_pace Get off me.
charlie_pace Where's the money?! Is it up your sodding arm?!
liam_pace I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.
charlie_pace Two days? Well, happy anniversary!
liam_pace Well, how long have you been clean?!
charlie_pace Where's the money?
liam_pace She was going to leave me, Charlie. She was going to take Megan.
charlie_pace What did you do, Liam?
liam_pace Karen's got an uncle in Australia. He's going to get me a job. There's a rehab clinic in Sydney. I just needed the money to get us there. I have to do this. I have to take care of myself for them -- for my family.
charlie_pace I'm your family!
charlie_pace Wait. Will you just wait?
liam_pace I can't, Charlie.
charlie_pace What about the band? What about the song?
liam_pace Try to understand. I have to go. I have to. Look, I'll give you a call when things settle down for me.
charlie_pace For you? What about me? What about my family? What about my family?!
claire_littleton Charlie, what are you doing?!
charlie_pace I'm doing what I have to do.
claire_littleton He's got my baby!! Stop it!
charlie_pace No, Claire, it's alright! It's not --
claire_littleton Charlie, stop! Help! Somebody help! He's got my baby!!
claire_littleton Help! Come on, Charlie, please. Stop it.
charlie_pace I just wanted to save him!
john_locke Charlie! Give me the baby.
charlie_pace Eko, tell them! Tell them, Eko! Tell them what you told me -- that the baby has to be baptized!
mr_eko This is not the way.
john_locke Charlie, come on, give him to me.
charlie_pace Who the hell are you, John?! Aaron's not your responsibility! Where were you when he was born?! Where were you when he was taken?! You're not his father! You're not his family!
john_locke Neither are you, Charlie.
charlie_pace I have to do this. I need to. I'm not going to hurt him.
claire_littleton You're hurting me, Charlie.
charlie_pace Claire. I'm sorry, Claire.
dr_jack_shephard You need stitches. Try to be still.
charlie_pace I started the fire, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I know.
charlie_pace I was desperate. She --
dr_jack_shephard I need to know you're never going to do anything like this again. Ever.
charlie_pace I know what this looks like -- what people think. It doesn't matter now, but I didn't use. I wanted to. I really wanted to. But I didn't.
dr_jack_shephard That's not what I asked, Charlie.
charlie_pace It's not going to happen again.
claire_littleton Charlie told me you were a priest.
mr_eko Yes.
claire_littleton He said that you told him that I had to have --
mr_eko I did not tell Charlie to do what he did. I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.
claire_littleton But, do you think the baby has to be baptized?
mr_eko Do you know what baptism is?
claire_littleton It's what gets you into heaven.
mr_eko It is said that when John the Baptist baptized Jesus the skies opened up and a dove flew down from the sky. This told John something -- that he had cleansed this man of all his sins. That he had freed him. Heaven came much later.
claire_littleton I haven't been baptized. Does that mean that if you do it to Aaron and something happened to us that we wouldn't be together?
mr_eko Not if I baptize you both.
