john_locke Hello, Jack. I was hoping you'd come.
john_locke I think we have some catching up to do.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley. This was your idea. You alright with me talking with him alone?
hugo_reyes It's all you, dude.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, let's catch up.
dr_jack_shephard Look just like him.
john_locke Does it bother you?
dr_jack_shephard No, what bothers me is I don't have any idea what the hell you are.
john_locke Sure you do.
dr_jack_shephard Why John Locke?
john_locke Because he was stupid enough to believe that he'd been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.
dr_jack_shephard He had to be dead before you could look like him.
john_locke That's right.
dr_jack_shephard Who else have you looked like?
john_locke Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
dr_jack_shephard The third day we were here I saw... I chased my father through the jungle... my, my dead father. Was that you?
john_locke Yes, that was me.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
john_locke You needed to find water. This may be hard for you to believe, Jack, but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.
dr_jack_shephard To help me? To do what?
john_locke Leave. But because Jacob chose you, you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead. We don't have to be trapped anymore. We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.
dr_jack_shephard If we can just fly away whenever we want, why are you still here?
john_locke Because it has to be all of us.
john_locke What?
dr_jack_shephard John Locke was the only one of us that ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this island.
john_locke John Locke was not a believer, Jack. He was a sucker.

dr_jack_shephard What is it?
john_locke You can come out!
john_locke You following us, Claire?
claire_littleton Yeah.
john_locke Why?
claire_littleton 'Cause he's my brother.
john_locke Looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do. I'll leave you to it.
dr_jack_shephard Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th--
claire_littleton Did he tell you? That he was the one pretending to be our father?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, he told me.
claire_littleton You know, I pretty much gave up hoping that you'd ever come back. Now that you're here...
claire_littleton It's... it's good to see you, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, it's good to see you too.
claire_littleton You know, I-I never really had much in the way of family, so it...really means a lot that you're coming with us.
dr_jack_shephard Actually, I haven't-I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
claire_littleton Yeah, you have.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean?
claire_littleton You decided the moment you let him talk to you, just like the rest of us. So, yeah, whether you like it or not, you're with him now.
hugo_reyes Has he got a submarine?
james_ford Keep your voice down, damn it. Yeah, Widmore's got a sub. We can use it to get off this rock.
hugo_reyes Are we gonna tell Sun?
james_ford Kate's telling her now. Thought we might want to avoid huddles.
hugo_reyes What about Sayid?
james_ford Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin--
james_ford Who the hell's Anakin? Look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothing to no one.
claire_littleton Hey.
hugo_reyes Hey, Claire.
claire_littleton Hey, Hurley.
hugo_reyes You look great.
john_locke It's so nice to have everyone back together again.
james_ford Want an apple?
james_ford Hey, Schaub, I'm the one who brought her in. Wanna give us a minute?
james_ford Katherine Anne Austen. You're wanted for arson, assault on a federal officer, murder in the first degree.
james_ford Funny, you don't strike me as the murdering kind.
kate_austen That's because I'm not.
james_ford You be sure and mention that to feds when they get here.
kate_austen There something you wanted?
james_ford You remember me? The airport? We were on the same flight from Sydney.
kate_austen Yeah, I remember.
james_ford Well, don't you think it's weird--you and me being on the same flight, having that little meet-up in the elevator? And a week later--boom, of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine. Almost like someone's trying to put us together.
kate_austen Are you hitting on me?
james_ford It'd never work, sweetheart. I'm a cop, you're a murderer.
kate_austen I already told you, I'm not a murderer.
james_ford Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.
kate_austen So, why didn't you arrest me?
james_ford I did arrest you.
kate_austen No, in L.A.X., the elevator, you saw I was wearing handcuffs.
james_ford I didn't see any handcuffs. All I saw was a pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.
kate_austen You know what I think? I think you let me go because you went to Australia, and you didn't want anyone to know you were there. Should I tell that to the feds when they get here?
james_ford Oh, I like you.
kate_austen Mm.
miles_straume Jim, got a live one. Come on.
james_ford Sorry, duty calls.
miles_straume We caught a multiple homicide at a restaurant. Victims were a lowlife named Keamy and three goons on his payroll. Korean female GSW at the scene, and her boyfriend witnessed it, but he doesn’t speak English.
james_ford Any suspects?
miles_straume Yeah, an ATM surveillance camera grabbed this jabroni fleeing the scene.
james_ford All righty. Put a name to that face. That's our bad guy.
kate_austen He's different now.
dr_jack_shephard Guess we're all different now.
kate_austen So what did Locke say to you?
dr_jack_shephard Said that he wants to leave, and we all have to go together.
kate_austen And do you believe him?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure yet.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Hands up. Stop right there.
zoe Where's the man in charge?
hugo_reyes Who's she?
james_ford That's Widmore's number two.
john_locke What can I do for you?
zoe You took something from us, and we want it back.
john_locke I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
john_locke It's okay.
zoe Do you have fix on my position?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Roger that.
zoe Show them what we're capable of.
zoe You have until nightfall to return what you took; or next time, we won't miss.
zoe Call me when you're ready for us to pick him up.
john_locke Well...here we go.
claire_littleton Uh, hi. I have an appointment with the Western Pacific Adoption Agency.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Fifteenth floor, and sign in, please.
claire_littleton Sure.
desmond_hume Hey there. How are you? Uh, we met at the airport. The, uh, the baggage claim.
claire_littleton Oh, yeah, right.
desmond_hume Nice. I'm Desmond. Desmond Hume. Um, I never got your name. Uh... "Claire Littleton." So--So how you doin'?
claire_littleton Um, I'm okay. Better now. I actually had a bit of a scare, ended up in the hospital.
desmond_hume Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...
claire_littleton Oh, no. All good now, so... Oh, by the way, uh, you were right. It's a boy.
desmond_hume I have a nose for these things. Look, um...excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but I couldn't help noticing you're going to an adoption agency...alone.
claire_littleton Uh...yeah. You're right. It is personal.
desmond_hume No, I just meant that you should have some--some legal representation.
claire_littleton What, are you a lawyer?
desmond_hume No, no. But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my to see one. You know, adoption contracts are complicated; and, you should be careful because you could find yourself in a situation that's irreversible.
claire_littleton Yeah, I-I don't have money for a lawyer.
claire_littleton What floor?
desmond_hume Um...I'm--I'm going to 15 as well. Look, this, um, this attorney I'm seeing--she's excellent. Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor. So...why don't you just come and meet her? You know, I think she could really help you.
desmond_hume Look, I promise you it won't cost you a cent. Please. It'd be my absolute pleasure.
claire_littleton Uh, sure.
desmond_hume Great, this way.
desmond_hume Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to see Miss Verdansky, please.
receptionist Oh, yes, Mrs. Hume, she's expecting you. Have a seat.
desmond_hume Great.
claire_littleton Hey, um...thank you.
desmond_hume You're very welcome.
ilana_verdansky Desmond!
desmond_hume Ah, Ilana. Uh, Claire, this is Ilana. Ilana, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Claire Littleton.
ilana_verdansky Claire Littleton, um...
desmond_hume I was hoping you'd be able to help her, um...
ilana_verdansky I'm sorry...Claire Littleton from Australia?
claire_littleton Um, do I know you?
ilana_verdansky No, but this is a quite a coincidence. We've been looking for you. Desmond, do you mind if I speak with Miss Littleton alone for a few minutes?
desmond_hume No, absolutely fine. Go right ahead.
john_locke Listen up, everyone.
claire_littleton Hey. What's going on?
hugo_reyes People trying to kill us again.
john_locke All this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected, but these people have forced our hand, claiming we stole something from them, trying to provoke us into a confrontation. Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Gather your things, we're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane. James, I need your help with something.
john_locke There's a boat moored just a few hours down the shore from here. I want you to get it and meet the rest of us on the other side of these bluffs. We'll all sail over to the other island together.
james_ford How come we're not all heading for it together?
john_locke The bigger the group, the slower it moves.
james_ford All right. I could use another pair of hands.
john_locke Take whoever you want.
james_ford How about it, Freckles? Know anything about sailing?
kate_austen I know enough.
john_locke Good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?
james_ford Give me a hand with something? Listen up, 'cause I’m only gonna say this once. We're not going to that rendezvous point to pick up Locke. I got a deal with Widmore.
dr_jack_shephard What kind of deal?
james_ford Just listen. First chance you get, double back, hoof it to this spot. There's an old dock. Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.
dr_jack_shephard What about Sayid and Claire?
james_ford Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts. She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill Kate. And I ain't gonna let that happen again. It's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?
dr_jack_shephard But, how am I supposed to get us away from--from Locke?
james_ford You figure it out.
james_ford Ready to roll?
kate_austen What was that all about?
james_ford Guy talk.
john_locke I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.
sayid_jarrah I thought you weren't going to give him back.
john_locke I'm not. You're gonna kill him. And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid? You do still want what you asked me for, right?
sayid_jarrah Yes, I do.
john_locke Then, go do what I said.
desmond_hume So what did he offer ya? If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...I think I have a right to know what you're getting in exchange for it.
sayid_jarrah He told me I could get something back I lost.
desmond_hume And what did you lose?
sayid_jarrah The woman I loved.
desmond_hume And where is she now?
sayid_jarrah Dead.
desmond_hume And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?
sayid_jarrah I died...and he brought me back.
desmond_hume So, what will you tell her?
sayid_jarrah What do you mean?
desmond_hume This woman--when she asks you what you did to be with her again...what will you tell her?
noor_abed_jaseem Sayid. What's going on?
sayid_jarrah Everything will be okay for you now. I took care of it.
noor_abed_jaseem What do you mean? Where are you going?
sayid_jarrah I have to leave.
noor_abed_jaseem Did you hurt someone?
sayid_jarrah Nadia, I'm leaving. And I'm never going to be able to come back again.
noor_abed_jaseem What did you do, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Stall them.
noor_abed_jaseem Who is it?
miles_straume LAPD.
noor_abed_jaseem May I see some identification?
miles_straume Can you open the door, please. Mrs. Jarrah, I'm Detective Straume. I need to ask you some questions. You have a few minutes?
james_ford That's good, stay down. Sayid Jarrah, you're under arrest.
james_ford Thar she blows. You ready to get wet?
kate_austen Ah. You sure this is a good idea?
james_ford You see a bridge?
kate_austen Going back to get Locke.
james_ford Course not. It's a terrible idea, which is why we ain't doing it.
kate_austen What?
james_ford We're gonna ditch Locke. You, me Jack, Hurley, Sun and that pilot that looks like he's stepped off the set of a Burt Reynolds movie.
kate_austen When were you planning on telling me this?
james_ford Now.
kate_austen Wait, you didn't say Claire.
james_ford She ain't coming. The Claire you came back for is gone.
kate_austen I promised I would bring her back.
james_ford That was before she started drinkin' Locke's kool-aid. She's dangerous, you really want her around Aaron? Let's go. We ain't got much time.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Claire.
claire_littleton Jack.
dr_jack_shephard How long have you been with Locke?
claire_littleton Ever since you left.
dr_jack_shephard So you trust him?
claire_littleton Yeah.
JACKS#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Why?
claire_littleton 'Cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.
john_locke Sun. Have you seen Sayid? He was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back. Oh, the silent treatment?
"You#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 did this to me!"
john_locke I'm sorry, Sun, but I didn't do anything to you. James should be on his way by now. Just keep everyone moving to the beach, I'll catch up with you there.
cindy_chandler Where are you going?
john_locke I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, wait up.
hugo_reyes Yeah?
dr_jack_shephard Sun.
dr_jack_shephard We have to go now.
frank_lapidus Go where?
dr_jack_shephard There's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.
hugo_reyes Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan, or he'll be really pissed.
dr_jack_shephard This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go!
john_locke Sayid. Where have you been?
sayid_jarrah Doing what you asked.
john_locke Then, what took you so long?
sayid_jarrah I just shot an unarmed man. I needed a moment.
john_locke Did you kill him, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Of course, I did. Go and check, if you like.
john_locke Come on, we have a boat to catch.
frank_lapidus Hope you know where you're going. Because that smoke thing runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.
hugo_reyes There they are!
kate_austen Hey.
james_ford Alright, let's go. Everybody on board, let's go!
frank_lapidus Sailin' home on this, huh?
james_ford Won't work, not without a bearing. For three years the only DHARMA folk ever got on or off this Island was by sub, so that's what we're doin'. Nice job, doc.
hugo_reyes Uh oh.
claire_littleton Where are you going?
kate_austen Claire...it's okay.
dr_jack_shephard Kate.
kate_austen We're leaving the Island.
claire_littleton Then, uh, why aren't you waiting for John?
kate_austen Because that's not John, and whoever he is, he's not one of us. Claire, come with us. I can get you back to Aaron.
james_ford Wait a damn minute-
kate_austen Sawyer shut up. She is coming or I'm not. Come with us Claire.
claire_littleton John promised me-
kate_austen No I'm promising you. I was there when he was born, and I never should have raised him, it should have been you. I came back to get you so you can be with him again. It's the only reason I came back to the Island, Claire. So please come with us. Let's go home.
james_ford Alright, get on the boat before Locke gets here.
claire_littleton He finds out we're gone, he's gonna be mad.
dr_jack_shephard It's your mom. Hey. Yeah, we just got here. Thank you. Uhh, I don't know, I'll have him home as soon as I can, maybe like 5 o'clock?
dr_jack_shephard Actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards, so...maybe more like 7? Alright. Yeah, yeah I'll drop him off.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. You know, hearing your grandfather's will being read, I know it's not the most fun, but it'll be over soon, I promise, and it's okay to be sad.
david_shephard I'm sad for you, Dad.
ilana_verdansky Mr. Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard Hello.
ilana_verdansky And you must be David.
david_shephard Hi.
ilana_verdansky We're set up in the conference room. I've got a surprise for you. Do you believe in fate?
ilana_verdansky This is Claire Littleton. Claire, this is Mr. Shephard and his son David.
dr_jack_shephard Hello. I'm Jack Shephard.
claire_littleton Hi, it's uh, it's really nice to meet you.
dr_jack_shephard You found her.
ilana_verdansky Actually, she found us.
dr_jack_shephard Uh. You were in my father's will. Do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?
claire_littleton I...he was my father too.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry, excuse me. This is the, um, this is the service. Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard. No-no it's not a very good time. Yes, they can go ahead and prep him. I'm 20 minutes away. I'm, so sorry, there's been an emergency at the hospital. And, um, we're going to have to reschedule.
frank_lapidus I know I'm a little late to the party, Captain, but, you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?
james_ford My plan, Chesty, is to land on Hydra Island, get ourselves nice and cuddly with Widmore until we get a chance to jump on that sub. Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face and make 'em take us home.
frank_lapidus I like that idea...I saw some canned food down in the galley. Anybody else starving?
james_ford Freckles, take the wheel a minute?
kate_austen Sure...Be nice.
james_ford Yeah, yeah.
james_ford Didn't think you'd show up, doc.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry?
james_ford Taking orders ain't your strong suit. Nice to see you finally came around.
dr_jack_shephard This doesn't feel right.
james_ford What doesn't feel right?
dr_jack_shephard Leaving the island.
james_ford Wanna tell me why not?
dr_jack_shephard Because I remember how I felt last time I left...like a part of me was missing.
james_ford They got pills for that, doc.
dr_jack_shephard We were brought here because we're supposed to do something, James. And if Locke--that...that thing--wants us to leave; maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.
james_ford Get off my damn boat.
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford You got a decision to make and you make it now. Either you’re with us, you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself, or you're going in the water.
dr_jack_shephard James, this is a mistake. And I know there's a part of you that feels that. The island's not done with us yet.
james_ford Yeah, well, I'm done with this island. So, if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it...Get off my damn boat.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.
kate_austen Jack? Jack?! What did you say to him?
james_ford He changed his mind.
kate_austen What do you mean he changed his mind? What did you say to him?
james_ford He ain't coming with us.
kate_austen We have to go back and get him.
james_ford We're done going back, Kate.

david_shephard So, all these years, you had no idea your dad had another kid?
dr_jack_shephard Nope. None.
david_shephard Wow. I can't believe he never even mentioned her.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.
david_shephard Is that where you get it from?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, probably... All right, uh, you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
david_shephard Yeah, sure...Good luck, Dad.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
surgeon Car v. ped.
dr_jack_shephard How bad?
surgeon Bad. But, here's the kicker--the victim was already in a wheelchair, pre-existing spinal condition.
dr_jack_shephard Dural sac's obliterated.
surgeon That's why we called you. We're in a bit over our heads here.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I got this. We're ready to cut?
surgeon Say the word.
dr_jack_shephard Scalpel.

dr_jack_shephard I think I know this guy.
john_locke Nice day for a swim... Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
james_ford Everybody stay close. Camp's over here. Not gonna have much time before Locke figures out we made off with his ride.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Hands up!
james_ford Hey! Whoa!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode13 Drop your weapons!
james_ford Whoa! Take it easy!
zoe Drop them now! ... It's all right. We know him. Who else is with you?
james_ford Nobody. You wonder where Locke is, he's still back on the main island.
zoe Turn the fences off. Ford just showed up on a boat with five of his friends.
jinsoo_kwon Sun?
sunhwa_kwon Jin? Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Sun!
sunhwa_kwon I love you!
jinsoo_kwon I love you, too.

john_locke Jack. You all right? Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. You're with me now.
