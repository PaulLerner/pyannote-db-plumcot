hugo_reyes 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed and dead, 16, 23, 42...
kate_austen Hurley, you okay?
hugo_reyes Huh? Yeah, awesome. I just have to pee. Great idea, dude, go look into the burning death hole.
kate_austen What is it?
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't matter what it is. We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so we could be safe. That plan is not going to work. We'll never get everyone down in time.
kate_austen Water.
john_locke It's shallow. It sounds like a puddle.
kate_austen 40 feet down?
john_locke 50 tops. If we could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage -- rig up a harness...
dr_jack_shephard John, we're leaving now.
hugo_reyes Yes, good idea. Let's do that.
john_locke We all went through a lot to get here, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard The ladder's broken. You going to lower 40 people down there one by one? They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do, so let's forget about the harnesses.
kate_austen Jack?
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke Why don't we all just calm down here.
dr_jack_shephard Look, if you want to go exploring in the morning that's fine, but tonight we're done. I'm going to go get the dynamite that we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves. How about you pack it up, John?
john_locke Sure, of course.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
john_locke Why don't you want to go down there, Jack?
emt Female, late 20's, no ID, she coded twice on the way over here.
nurse Where's the other one?
emt Right behind us. They're on their way -- Fire Department had to use the jaws.
intern What do we got here?
nurse Female, late 20s...
intern What the hell is that?
dr_jack_shephard Piece of the steering column. All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady. Page my father.
intern Already did.
dr_jack_shephard Tell me.
emt Her tire blew, car jumped the divider, went head-on with an SUV.
nurse BP's dropping.
dr_jack_shephard Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?
emt Yes, alone.
dr_jack_shephard Where's the driver of the SUV?
emt #2 Adam Rutherford, 57, chest trauma, no breath sounds.
dr_jack_shephard Tube Mr. Rutherford while I...
intern I can't intubate, you've got to.
nurse Dr. Shephard, her BP's 80 over 60.
nurse #2 Dr. Shephard, his breathing's deteriorating.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, need a syringe -- big one. You, hold pressure.
nurse 88 over 52, no radial pulse.
dr_jack_shephard I know. I know -- sac's flooded. Where's that...
nurse Right here. Got it?
dr_jack_shephard Yep.
nurse #2 Doctor, we're losing him.
nurse BP stabilizing.
nurse #2 Time of death 815am.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, get me a blood gas and a C-spine. Get her up to ICU and keep her immobilized.
sarah_shephard I want to dance at my wedding.
intern Did you hear that?
nurse Sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay. Just relax.
intern What did she say?
dr_jack_shephard She said she has to dance at her wedding.
charlie_pace Okay, no one is out there. No one is coming.
N.D.#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 Survivor But the -- but the French woman said...
charlie_pace The French woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know. I mean, I mean, it was all bollocks. It's a ghost story. She set the fire herself. What?
sayid_jarrah Nothing.
shannon_rutherford Has anyone seen Vincent -- the dog? Anyone seen him? Has anyone seen the dog?
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 No.
sayid_jarrah Where are you going?
shannon_rutherford I lost the damn dog.
hugo_reyes Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man?
john_locke Why wouldn't I light the fuse?
hugo_reyes Ah, maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling "don't do that?"
john_locke Well, you've got a point there. I guess I was just excited to get inside. I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went all the way out to the Black Rock -- and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch. And we did it so that we could get inside, Hugo.
dr_jack_shephard And to save everybody's lives.
john_locke And to save everyone's lives.
dr_jack_shephard Or, maybe it was just our destiny, right, John?
john_locke Maybe.
kate_austen Guys, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.
shannon_rutherford Vincent!
sayid_jarrah This is not a good idea.
shannon_rutherford I saw him 5 minutes ago. Besides, you're the one who said there isn't anyone out here.
sayid_jarrah I said we didn't see anyone. The dog will come back on his own. He always does.
shannon_rutherford Watching that dog was the one thing anyone has ever asked me to do. If something happens to him...
sayid_jarrah When was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted.
shannon_rutherford I can't tell that kid that I lost his dog because I was exhausted.
sayid_jarrah I'll circle around behind him.
shannon_rutherford Okay.
sayid_jarrah Vincent!
shannon_rutherford Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, where are you?! Sayid! Sayid!
shannon_rutherford Walt?
shannon_rutherford What are you doing here?
sayid_jarrah Shannon! What is it? What?
kate_austen Why do you want to get down there so bad?
john_locke -ly. Why do I want to get down there so badly. Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?
kate_austen Why, because you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine?"
john_locke Well, look at the bright side. The damage is done.
kate_austen The bright side?
john_locke And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really. Then again, 5 hours ago I was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke. Did you see it, Kate? Then I guess we're both crazy. Wonder what Jack thinks he saw?
hugo_reyes You should go ahead, man -- don't want Locke making time with your girl. Joke, dude.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not really in the mood, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Really? Wow, usually you're, like, Mr. Haha. There you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure the Others are coming to, like, eat us all -- and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but you do get to sleep in every morning.
dr_jack_shephard Uh-huh. And the numbers?
hugo_reyes What?
dr_jack_shephard "The numbers are bad" -- that's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.
hugo_reyes Yeah, that's kind of a long story.
dr_jack_shephard I've got time.
hugo_reyes You'll think I'm crazy.
dr_jack_shephard Try me.
hugo_reyes Awhile ago I was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy, Leonard -- and all the time I knew him all he ever said were these numbers -- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 -- over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So, when I got out -- well, actually a couple of months after I got out -- I was buying a frozen burrito and I thought, hey, I should play the lottery. And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head so I played them. And I won 114 million dollars. That's when it started happening -- my grandpa died, my house caught on fire, the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor -- well, actually meteorite. Okay, so tonight I see the same freaking numbers on the hatch thing -- just written on the side -- and that's why I tried to stop it -- because that thing is cursed, man.
dr_jack_shephard You were in a psych ward?
hugo_reyes I'm not crazy.
dr_jack_shephard I'm not saying you are.
hugo_reyes So, what? That's it? That's all?
dr_jack_shephard What do you want me to say?
hugo_reyes How about you believe me, man?
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, they're numbers.
hugo_reyes What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
dr_jack_shephard Bedside manner.
hugo_reyes Yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude.
sarah_shephard What happened to him?
dr_jack_shephard Just try to relax, okay?
sarah_shephard The car that I hit -- the other driver was older.
dr_jack_shephard He died in the ER.
sarah_shephard I can't feel anything.
dr_jack_shephard I know.
sarah_shephard What's happened to me?
dr_jack_shephard You have a fracture-dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae -- your back is broken. Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and that has to be stopped. I'm going to perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible. But even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at "extremely unlikely".
sarah_shephard Oh.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Dr. Shephard, may I have a word, please.
dr_jack_shephard So, what did I do wrong?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD You did something wrong?
dr_jack_shephard You're frowning.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD My face is always this way.
dr_jack_shephard Dad, hey, c'mon, let's hear it.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD You might want to try handing out some hope every once in awhile. Even if there's a 99 percent probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed, folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 percent chance that things are going to be okay.
dr_jack_shephard Her spine's crushed. I tell her that everything's going to be okay -- that's false hope, dad.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Maybe. Maybe, but it's still hope.
shannon_rutherford I know what I saw! It was him! It was Walt!
sayid_jarrah Shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group.
shannon_rutherford I heard whispers.
claire_littleton Where?
shannon_rutherford Everywhere.
charlie_pace What -- what whispers? Who?
shannon_rutherford I don't know -- Them.
sunhwa_kwon Do you think something happened to the raft?
sayid_jarrah Nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband, with Sawyer...
shannon_rutherford Sayid, I know what I saw.
charlie_pace They're back.
dr_jack_shephard Uh, Locke found, uh, a hatch in the ground about a half a mile from here. We left to -- to blow it open so that we could hide inside -- so all of us could hide inside, in case... But that doesn't matter now because it's not going to work. There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
charlie_pace Jack, where's Dr. Arzt?
dr_jack_shephard Um, he didn't make it.
shannon_rutherford Did you see them? Did you see the Others?
charlie_pace Hey, Shannon, there are no Others. We've already had this conversation.
shannon_rutherford What the hell would you know about it -- just because you didn't see anything?!
charlie_pace There's no one out there.
shannon_rutherford You don't know!
charlie_pace You're just making up rubbish!
dr_jack_shephard Hey! Everything's going to be okay. Let's just take it easy. We're going to be alright. We're going to stay here tonight, okay, together. We've still got 4 guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances. We're all going to be safe as long as we stay together. The sun comes up in 3 hours and we're all going to be here to see that happen. I promise. John, what are you doing?
john_locke I'm getting some cable.
dr_jack_shephard What for?
john_locke It's for the hatch. I'm going in.
dr_jack_shephard Do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John?
john_locke I doubt it. In fact, you're right. The safest thing is to stay here -- wait for morning -- wait for these Others, to see if they ever show up -- wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help -- but me, I'm tired of waiting.
kate_austen So, do you believe it?
dr_jack_shephard Believe what?
kate_austen That everything's going to be okay?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I do.
kate_austen Kind of unlike you -- the whole glass half-full thing.
dr_jack_shephard There's a glass?
kate_austen You did a good thing saying what you said -- taking care of everybody and just giving them something to count on. If you weren't here, Jack... I'm going to the hatch. I understand why you can't go. They need you here. I get it. I do. But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. And if he falls and breaks his neck... Live together, die alone, right?
dr_jack_shephard Right.
dr_jack_shephard Your fiance was seriously injured. It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours. I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.
kevin She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.
dr_jack_shephard When is it -- the wedding?
kevin It's 8 months.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'm sure Sarah will have recovered by then.
kevin Recovered - um, what does that mean?
dr_jack_shephard There will be ongoing physical therapy, but if she works really hard...
kevin Well, well, will we be able to, you know, make love?
dr_jack_shephard You need to know that there's a chance Sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.
kevin Like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
sarah_shephard Come here. Come here. I want to tell you a little secret. Come on. Closer. It's okay. I know I'm not going to be dancing anymore. I can still roll around at my wedding. And you're invited, okay.
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to fix you.
kate_austen I expected to find you half way down there by now.
john_locke I was waiting for you.
kate_austen So, you want me to go down first?
john_locke Well, you're lighter. I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy. The shaft might get narrower down there, too.
kate_austen You left out the part where you just want to see if I get eaten by something.
john_locke Yeah, well, that too. Not too tight?
kate_austen Got it. -- Okay. Wait, what do I say if I need to stop?
john_locke Stop.
kate_austen Hmm, okay. Let's go.
john_locke Kate, are you alright?!
kate_austen Yeah, I dropped the light! Maybe we should... Well, okay then. 1, 2, 3, 4. Stop!
john_locke What is it?!
kate_austen John, I think there's something down here!
john_locke Kate, are you alright?!
john_locke Kate! Kate! Kate!
hugo_reyes You're kidding, right? You're going back?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
hugo_reyes What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?
dr_jack_shephard I changed my mind.
dr_jack_shephard Kate! Locke!
dr_jack_shephard Ow, damn it.
desmond_hume You alright, brother?
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. I'm fine.
desmond_hume Take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt? You haven't sprained it then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though.
dr_jack_shephard I wasn't trying to catch up.
desmond_hume Aye, of course you weren't.
dr_jack_shephard What do you know about sprains, anyway?
desmond_hume I was almost a doctor once.
dr_jack_shephard Small world.
desmond_hume You a doctor then? So what's your excuse?
dr_jack_shephard Excuse?
desmond_hume For running like the devil's chasing you. My excuse - I'm training.
dr_jack_shephard Training for what?
desmond_hume For a race around the world. Impressive, I know. So your excuse better be good, brother.
dr_jack_shephard Just trying to work a few things out.
desmond_hume Ah, a girl, right?
dr_jack_shephard A patient.
desmond_hume Ah, but a girl patient. What's her name?
dr_jack_shephard Her name's Sarah.
desmond_hume What'd you do to her then?
dr_jack_shephard Do to her?
desmond_hume You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.
dr_jack_shephard I told her -- I made a promise I couldn't keep -- I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't. I failed.
desmond_hume Well, right. Just one thing -- what if you did fix her?
dr_jack_shephard I didn't.
desmond_hume But what if you did?
dr_jack_shephard You don't know what you're talking about, man.
desmond_hume I don't? Why not?
dr_jack_shephard Because with her situation that would be a miracle, brother.
desmond_hume Oh, and you don't believe in miracles? Right. Well then, I'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. (He may be saying "lift her up".)
dr_jack_shephard Lift it up?
desmond_hume Your ankle. You've got to keep it elevated. It's been nice chatting.
dr_jack_shephard Jack.
desmond_hume Jack, I'm Desmond. Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah?
john_locke I wouldn't do that, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where is Kate? What the hell did you...
sarah_shephard Am I alive?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.
sarah_shephard You smell.
dr_jack_shephard Well, thank you.
sarah_shephard Wow, you really smell.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I -- I went for a run.
sarah_shephard You smell like you ran far.
dr_jack_shephard I showered. I mean, I guess I just didn't cool. I -- I wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a Tour de Stade.
sarah_shephard What?
dr_jack_shephard It is when you run all the steps in every section of a stadium up and down.
sarah_shephard Why would you do that?
dr_jack_shephard I'm -- I'm intense.
sarah_shephard Did you finish?
dr_jack_shephard No, I hurt my ankle.
sarah_shephard That sucks for you. Is Kevin here, my fiance?
dr_jack_shephard I didn't see him.
sarah_shephard I'm, I'm sure he'll be back in awhile.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
sarah_shephard You going to tell me how it went?
dr_jack_shephard Sarah, the -- the damage to your back was extensive. I did everything I could but your spinal column... I just -- I couldn't repair it. You're going to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sarah.
sarah_shephard You're yanking my chain, right?
dr_jack_shephard No.
sarah_shephard Then how come I can wiggle my toes?
dr_jack_shephard Can you feel this?
sarah_shephard Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Can you feel this?
sarah_shephard Yes.
dr_jack_shephard This?
sarah_shephard Yes.
dr_jack_shephard This?
sarah_shephard Yes.
GUNMAN'S#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 VOICE Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?
john_locke Jack, it's okay.
GUNMAN'S#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 VOICE I said drop it!
dr_jack_shephard Where's Kate?!
john_locke She's fine, just put down the...
dr_jack_shephard I'm not putting anything...
GUNMAN'S#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 VOICE Do you want him to die? Put it down.
dr_jack_shephard Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
john_locke Jack, calm down.
GUNMAN'sVOICE#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode01 Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
dr_jack_shephard You.
