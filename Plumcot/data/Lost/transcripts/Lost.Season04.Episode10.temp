JULIET Jack! Jack! Jack? Jack, I need you to wake up. Jack! Can you hear me? You okay?
BERNARD Come on! Come on! I just wanna know why.
JACK What happened?
JULIET Here.
ROSE He knows somethin'!
BERNARD I want the truth!
DANIEL I don't know. That's the truth. I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now.
BERNARD Signal? What, there was a signal when you called them last night.
ROSE That's right.
BERNARD So—so—so what? Now they're just ignoring us?
CHARLOTTE How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?
ROSE Oh, who's talking to you?
CHARLOTTE And in case you haven't noticed, we're not on the bloody boat, are we?
ROSE Just watch your tone, Red.
BERNARD I just wanna know why.
JACK Hey! Everybody just needs to calm down, okay?
BERNARD Jack, these people are lying to us.
JACK I know they're lying. I know it. Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
SUN Unless they run off again.
JACK Listen to me.
ROSE Jack, are you all right?
JACK No, I'm fine. We just have to be patient, okay? I've gotten us this far. I said I was gonna get us off the Island — all of us. I promised that I would.
ROSE Jack? Jack?
BERNARD Jack?
JULIET Jack.
ROSE Is he all right?
JULIET Jack? Jack.
JACK Hello?
JANE Dr. Shephard? Just confirming your 1100 consult with Ms. Berenberg. It was moved up yesterday, and I know how you are with your calendar.
JACK Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.
JANE Thank you, doctor.
JACK Alright. Bye.
JACK Ow. Son of a bitch.
JACK A-Rod.
JACK Morning.
WOMAN Morning yourself. I bought you a razor.
JACK What, you don't like the scruff?
WOMAN Razor's by the sink, Jack.
JACK Morning.
JACK "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?
JACK But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Aha, that's the great puzzle."
KATE You're a natural.
JACK Yeah?
KATE Yeah.
JACK My old man used to read me that story.
KATE Really?
JACK What?
KATE It's just... it's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.
JACK I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. Hey. You okay?
KATE Yeah. Just, I... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind. I'm so glad that you're here.
JACK Me, too.
JULIET Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give—give him some air, guys.
JACK 
JULIET You okay?
JACK Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.
KATE Hey, what happened?
JULIET He passed out.
KATE You fainted?
JACK I'm fine. I'm just, uh... I'm just a little dehydrated.
KATE No, Jack. You're not okay. You're burning up.
JACK I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... just need to get a little rest.
JULIET Jack—
JACK I'm fine.
CLAIRE Oh!
SAWYER You okay?
CLAIRE Yeah, just a bit woozy.
SAWYER How's your head?
CLAIRE It's better. Bit of a headache, but at least I'm not seeing things anymore.
MILES Yeah? What'd you see?
SAWYER Back off, Donger.
MILES I'm just making conversation.
SAWYER Let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.
SAWYER What?
SAWYER Hey. Hey!
MILES Who's Danielle and Karl?
CLAIRE Y—you mean Rousseau? The French woman?
CLAIRE Oh, my God.
MILES Is this your French woman?
SAWYER Karl. How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this?
MILES They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this.
CLAIRE Can we just—can we just get out of here, please? Can we just go?
SAWYER Yeah, yeah, of course. But don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right? Come on. Let's go.
JACK Ahh. I hate being sick.
JULIET What do you think it is?
JACK It's food poisoning.
JULIET What makes you think that?
JACK I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.
JULIET I respectfully disagree.
JACK Do you?
JULIET You want to lift your shirt up?
JULIET If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.
JULIET It's your appendix, Jack. When did the pain start?
JACK Yesterday.
JULIET Has it ruptured?
JACK Not yet.
JULIET Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out.
JULIET Do you remember where the medical station is or don't you?
SUN Yes, I remember.
JULIET These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.
SUN "Clamps"? "Sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like.
DAN I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. Uh...
JULIET I thought you were a physicist.
DAN Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if—if—
JIN No.
SUN We can't trust them.
CHARLOTTE See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. Might as well keep playing the part.
DAN Damn it, Charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your—your attitude — your very bad attitude — it's exactly why they don't trust us. Come on. Juliet, please. Don't blame us for—for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help.
JULIET If either of them tries to run, shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can.
SUN Okay.
DAN Thank you.
JULIET We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, gather as many tarps as you can.
KATE Hey Juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, then why don't we just bring Jack there?
JULIET Because if we move him, there's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die.
SAWYER Don't even think about it.
MILES What?
SAWYER Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. Twenty feet.
MILES What are you, her big brother?
SAWYER No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face unless you say, "Yeah, I getcha."
MILES Yeah, I getcha.
BERNARD Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.
ROSE That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "Why did he get sick?"
BERNARD Why? It's just—it's just bad luck.
ROSE The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, the person that we count on the most suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, and you're chalking it up to bad luck?
BERNARD Well, what are you saying, that—that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose.
ROSE Not here. Here, they get better.
JACK When was the last time you did this?
JULIET An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?
JULIET In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then.
JACK Then you know the incision needs to be two inches lower than where you're shaving.
JULIET I'm just cleaning the area. Thank you.
JACK I wanna talk you through it.
JULIET What?
JACK I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine to numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, help you out.
JULIET And, uh, how are you gonna watch, flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?
JACK We can use a mirror. Kate can hold it.
JULIET If someone's going to be in there, shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? Bernard's a dentist—
JACK No, I want it to be Kate.
JULIET Okay.
JACK Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg. You're in good hands.
MRS. BERENBERG Thank you.
JACK I'll see you tomorrow at 500 a.m.?
MRS. BERENBERG Mm-hmm.
JACK And remember, no solid food. Okay?
MRS. BERENBERG Thank you, doctor.
JACK Have a good evening.
ERIKA Jack? Jack?
ERIKA Will you take a look at this X-ray? Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think.
JACK The L4. Yeah. Yeah.
RECEPTIONIST Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a Dr. Stillman from Santa Rosa Hospital, says it's about a friend of yours.
DR. STILLMAN He's refusing to take his meds, and he's stopped sleeping.
JACK What about his therapy sessions?
DR. STILLMAN Therapy's... been rendered useless.
JACK And why is that?
DR. STILLMAN Because he doesn't think I exist.
JACK Hey Hurley.
HURLEY Hey Jack.
JACK Why aren't you taking your meds?
HURLEY 'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six, we're all dead. We never got off that island.
JACK Hurley ... that is not true.
HURLEY What'd you do today?
JACK What did I do today? I, uh... I woke up, took a shower. Uh, Kate and I fed the baby.
HURLEY I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.
JACK I changed my mind after the trial.
HURLEY Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.
JACK Just because I'm happy doesn't mean that this isn't real, Hurley.
HURLEY I was happy too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie. He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually.
JACK Okay. So what did the two of you talk about?
HURLEY Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message.
JACK A message?
HURLEY He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up. "You're not supposed to raise him, Jack." Does that make any sense?
JACK No, that... doesn't make any sense.
HURLEY Do you think he means Aaron?
JACK Take your meds, Hurley. Just take 'em.
HURLEY Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you too. Soon.
Sun We're here.
DAN Hey. Uh... why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.
CHARLOTTE Okay. Be careful, Dan.
DANIEL Absolutely.
JIN 저 여자는 저 남자가 좋아하는 걸 알까? 
SUN 그럼, 여잔데… 당연히 알지. 
SUN 어서 가요. 
DANIEL Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?
CHARLOTTE Add that one to the list, Dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?
JIN 괜찮아? 
SUN 줄리엣이 날 데리고 온 곳이에요. 여기서 우리 아기를 봤어요. 
SUN 진수씨, 저 사람들이 우리를 도와 줄 것 같지 않아요. 
JIN 자기야, 걱정 마. 내가 한 말 이해 가지? 당신하고 우리 아기는 이 섬에서 꼭 벗어나게 할 거야. 
MILES Whoa! Hey, you want a hand with the baby?
CLAIRE Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
MILES You sure? I'm good with kids.
SAWYER What part of "restraining order" don't you understand?
SAWYER Get behind me, Claire.
LAPIDUS Whoa! Hey!
SAWYER Who the hell are you?
MILES Lapidus?
LAPIDUS Miles?
SAWYER You two know each other?
LAPIDUS You gotta hide, man, right now.
MILES What?
LAPIDUS Keamy's coming back, and if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.
LAPIDUS And he's close, man. You gotta hide now! Go! Hide!
SAWYER Come on.
LAPIDUS Just hide!
SAWYER Come on. Come on. Let's go!
KEAMY Where's the chopper?
LAPIDUS It's about a click back that way.
KEAMY Did you bring the kit?
LAPIDUS Yeah, it's right here. Jeez, man, he looks bad. What the hell happened?
KEAMY You do your job. I'll do mine.
LAPIDUS Okay. It's gettin' dark, man. We gotta leave now.
LAPIDUS Mr. Keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.
LAPIDUS Keamy, we gotta get back, 'cause I'll tell ya right now, I am not flying Faraday's bearings at night. I'm not gonna do it. So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.
KEAMY Fine. You lead the way.
KEAMY Come on.
MAN 1 Okay.
MAN 2 Come on.
MAN 3 Watch it now.
KATE The tent's all set. Everything's ready.
JULIET Good. Thanks. Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there. You wanna help me out?
KATE Um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.
JULIET It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."
JULIET What?
KATE I'm just surprised he's not taken it out of himself by now.
JULIET Jack. What are you doin'?
JACK I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet.
KATE I'll help you.
JULIET They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there.
KATE So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.
JACK Wouldn't be the first time.
JACK Listen, um... if something happens to me—
KATE Shut up, Jack.
JACK Fair enough.
JACK Kate? Kate?
JACK Wake up, Kate. Hey.
KATE Hey. What time is it?
JACK It's late. I just got home.
KATE Were you working?
JACK No. I just... had to stop and get something. I just... took a while.
KATE Hey. What's going on? What's wrong?
JACK The other night, when I was reading to Aaron, you said... that I was a natural. (Sighs) Do you really... do you really think that I'm good at this?
KATE Yeah. You're good at this.
JACK Will you marry me?
KATE Yes. 
KATE Of course I will. Yes.
BERNARD Look, they're back.
JULIET Did you find everything?
DANIEL Yes, ma'am. The entire list. Is he okay?
JULIET For now. Sun, we need to sterilize these. There's a pot of water boiling over here.
JIN Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE Yeah?
JIN 난 알고 있어. 
CHARLOTTE Pardon?
JIN 너 한국말 할 줄 알지? 아까 우리가 너 이야기 할 때 너 웃는 거 내가 봤어. 그리고 너 스테이션에서도 우리 말 엿듣고 있었지? 
CHARLOTTE I'm sorry. Perhaps I can get your wife to translate—
JIN 계속 날 속이면... 니 친구 다니엘을 가만 두지 않겠어. 앞으로 그 친구 손가락 쓰기는 아마 힘들걸? 이해가 되지? 
CHARLOTTE 나한테 원하는 게 뭐죠? 
JIN 헬리콥터가 돌아오면... 내 아내를 데리고 이 섬을 떠나기만 하면 돼. 
CHARLOTTE 당신과 당신 친구는요? 
JIN 넌 선만 헬리콥터에 태우면 돼. 
BERNARD You know, Jack, they found some chloroform at the medical station. I could knock you out. Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?
JACK No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.
JACK Kate.
JACK Just hold it right there.
BERNARD Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision. After that, I would like to be able to tell you you' not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.
JULIET You ready?
JULIET Okay. Here we go.
JULIET Okay, Jack. One more.
JACK Oh!
JULIET Okay, try not to move.
JULIET Just stay still. Spreader.
JACK Kate, I—I can't see it.
KATE Sorry.
JULIET Don't worry about the mirror. Just stay still. Spreader.
JACK That's good. That's good. Yeah. This is it. That's good.
JACK Aah! 
JULIET Knock him out, Bernard.
JACK No! No... not wanna be unconscious.
JULIET You don't want to be out of control.
JACK Kate.
JULIET Kate, you need to leave.
JACK No.
JULIET Bernard!
JACK Kate—
JULIET Kate, you need to go.
JACK —please.
JULIET Bernard!
JACK No!
JULIET Kate, get out of here! Bernard.
JACK Kate...
KATE Jack.
JULIET Kate. Kate, get outta here! Damn it, Bernard! Knock him out!
BERNARD I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.
JACK Laker, Ryan. Patient is male, 36.
JACK Osteoblastoma is present in the posterior area of the lumbar. I am recommending biopsy for—
CHRISTIAN Jack?
ERIKA Jack?
ERIKA You okay?
JACK Uh, yeah. I'm—I'm... I'm okay. I, uh... I just, uh...
JACK The, um, the smoke detector was... was beeping, and I just...
ERIKA Okay. Thank you for keeping us safe.
JACK Erika, um... Do you mind doing me a favor?
ERIKA Yeah, sure.
JACK Can you write a script for... clonazepam?
ERIKA For you?
JACK Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now, and I'm just a little snowed under with all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged. Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? Just...
JACK Thank you.
ERIKA You know, getting engaged is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.
JACK Yeah. You're right.
ERIKA Maybe you should talk to someone.
JACK I'll do that.
ERIKA Good night.
JACK Good night.
KATE Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay for an extra couple hours. Jack's never home before 800 anyway. I could stay for at least an hour. I—I gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Bye.
JACK Hey.
KATE Hey. You scared me.
JACK Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed. Who was that?
KATE That was Noreen.
JACK Noreen?
KATE Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park. What?
JACK Nothing. I just... never heard you mention her before.
KATE Well, now you have.
KATE I'll see you upstairs.
CLAIRE Dad?
BERNARD Hey. Don't worry. It went well. She did good. She said you could go back inside if you want to.
KATE Thank you.
BERNARD Okay.
JULIET He didn't lose that much blood. I got the appendix out and put everything back where it belongs, I think.
KATE So he's gonna be okay?
JULIET He should be fine. We just have to talk him into resting.
KATE Good luck with that.
JULIET I'm sorry I yelled at you.
KATE Don't worry about it. You had enough going on.
JULIET You know, he kissed me.
KATE What?
JULIET The other day, when you came back from the other side of the Island, Jack kissed me.
KATE Oh.
JULIET It was nice... but it wasn't for me. It was for him. I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.
KATE Prove what?
JULIET That he doesn't love someone else.
KATE Thank you, Juliet. Thank you for saving his life.
JULIET I know you're awake.
JACK Hey.
KATE Hey. You're home early. Where's Veronica?
JACK I sent her home. The baby's asleep.
KATE Good.
JACK Why was she here?
KATE Sorry?
JACK The nanny. She only works 'til 400. I came home at 600.
KATE I had to run some errands, so... I asked her to stay a couple extra hours. What's going on, Jack? Why are you home so early?
JACK I went to see Hurley.
KATE Today?
JACK Last... Friday.
KATE Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.
JACK Because he's crazy, Kate, and I didn't wanna upset you. Where were you today?
KATE I'm gonna ask you... to trust me. Trust me. Just leave it be.
JACK Where were you?
KATE Jack, don't.
JACK No, I heard you on the phone last night. Who were you talking to?
KATE Just let it go.
JACK No, no, I wanna know.
KATE No, Jack.
JACK I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.
KATE It doesn't matter, Jack. Please.
JACK No, tell me. Tell me!
KATE I was doing something for him.
JACK For who?
KATE For Sawyer. I made him a promise. It... 
JACK What?
KATE It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.
JACK Then why won't you tell me?
KATE Because—because he wouldn't want me to.
JACK But he's not here, is he? No. No, he made his choice. He chose to stay. I'm the one who came back. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one who saved you.
KATE Jack. You can't—you can't do this. If you have problems, you need to figure them out. All right? 'Cause I can't have you like this around my son.
JACK Your son? You're not even related to him!
KATE Hey, sweet pea. Hey.
MILES Morning.
SAWYER It's way too early for Chinese. Where's Claire? Ladies' room?
MILES Nope. She just walked off into the jungle.
SAWYER What? When?
MILES In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.
SAWYER You let her go alone?
MILES She wasn't alone.
SAWYER Well, who was she with?
MILES She called him "Dad". I'd have followed them, but I have a restraining order.
SAWYER Claire! Claire!
SAWYER It's okay. It's okay. I've got you.
SAWYER Claire! CLAIRE!
SAWYER CLAIRE! CLAIRE!!!
