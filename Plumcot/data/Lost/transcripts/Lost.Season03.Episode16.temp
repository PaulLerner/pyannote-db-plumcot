SAYID It's getting late. This is a good place to make camp.
JACK I'll get some firewood.
KATE I'll go with you.
KATE You wanna talk about it?
JACK Talk about what?
KATE About the week... you spent over there with them.
JACK Well, after you left, I'd, uh, I'd made a deal with them. If I took care of Ben, that they'd let me off the Island. So I just, kept my head down, did what I was supposed to. Didn't ask any questions.
KATE And that's it.
JACK That's it.
JULIET OK. Let's have it.
SAYID I want to know what you people are doing on this Island. Why you're terrorizing us. Making lists. Kidnapping children. I want to know everything. But the first thing I'd like to know is, who are you?
JULIET Hi. I'm Juliet Burke, I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.
GUARD I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
JULIET Thank you.
RACHEL Well. I think they're taking this whole corporate secrecy thing a little too seriously.
JULIET I'm never gonna fit in with these people.
ETHAN Hey there, Dr. Burke. If you pop the trunk, I'll get your bags.
JULIET Thank you.
RICHARD Ah, you managed to find us.
JULIET I didn't even know they had an airport out there.
RICHARD I know it surprises everyone. Hi. You must be Rachel. Richard Alpert.
RACHEL Nice to meet you.
RICHARD Thank you for letting us borrow your sister for a few months.
RACHEL Just promise me you'll bring her back in one piece.
RICHARD Well, we'll do our best. Uh, so listen, it's, er, a security thing. We have to take you in the rest of the way, so, whenever you're ready' we'll be waiting right over here, but please do take your time. Pleasure to meet you.
RACHEL Thanks.
RICHARD Thank you.
RACHEL It's better this way.
JULIET Is this a mistake? I shouldn't go. What if you get sick again?
RACHEL I won't. Cancer's gone. And, I'm 100% preggers thanks to you.
JULIET I'll be back...
RACHEL Yes, I know.
JULIET ...before you give birth, I promise.
RACHEL I know. Don't worry about us, OK?
JULIET OK.
RACHEL You spent your whole life working to get here. So... don't blow it!
JULIET I love you.
RACHEL I love you.
JULIET OK.
RACHEL Go make us proud.
SAYID Who are you?
JULIET If I told you who I was, if I told you everything that I know, you'd kill me.
SAYID What do you think I'll do if you don't?
JACK Leave her alone.
SAYID Sooner or later she'll answer my questions.
JACK She'll answer your questions when she's ready. And you'll wait until she is. She's under my protection.
CHARLIE Claire? Claire? Claire? Oh, oh, what is it? Oh, it's OK. Shh, shh, its OK. Claire? Hey. Claire. You OK?
CLAIRE Charlie? What's, what's going on?
CHARLIE Didn't you hear Aaron?
CLAIRE Is he OK?
CHARLIE Nah, he's OK. Are you alright?
CLAIRE Yeah, I just, feel a little bit off. I didn't sleep well. I can't believe I didn't hear him crying!
CHARLIE Maybe you're coming down with something. Look, why don't you let me take Aaron, and, you get some more rest.
CLAIRE Yeah, do you mind?
CHARLIE Absolutely.
CLAIRE I won't sleep long.
JULIET I guess it's no use asking them to wait up, huh?
JACK They'll come around. Just give them some time.
JULIET My people kept Sayid chained to a swing-set for three days, then I dragged Kate into the jungle, handcuffed myself to her and lied about it. How much time do you think they need?
JACK We'll be back at our beach in a couple of hours, they'll probably be over it by then. You nervous?
JULIET Hell, yes.
RICHARD I know that, uh, six months sounds like an eternity, but you're gonna be amazed at how time flies once you're there.
JULIET I can't wait to find out where there is.
ETHAN Dr. Burke? Wanna have a seat? I'd like to take some of your vitals. If that's OK with you.
JULIET Yeah, sure.
RICHARD You know, everyone at the company's really excited about you coming down Dr. Burke. And I think your research is really gonna have a major impact on us.
JULIET What is that?
RICHARD That, is orange juice, with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.
JULIET You want me to drink it?
RICHARD Oh yes , you're gonna wanna be asleep for the trip, Dr. Burke.
ETHAN It can be , kind of intense.
JULIET Er, OK, I was fine with signing all over your paperwork. Fine with agreeing to not talk to anyone in my life for six months. Fine with the fact that no one in the medical community has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience.
RICHARD Why were you fine?
JULIET What?
RICHARD Why were you fine with those things? It seems like, er, quite a leap for a job opportunity. I mean, we're not paying you that much. I think you're fine because deep down a part of you knows that the place we're taking you to is special.
JULIET Special huh.
RICHARD Let me ask you something, Juliet. You took a woman, your own sister, whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy, who was sterile. And you made her pregnant. You created life where life wasn't supposed to be. That's a gift, Juliet. You have a gift. And don't you think you're meant to do something significant with it? Where we're going, you can do just that.
JULIET Where exactly are we...
RICHARD I can't tell you that. But what I can tell you is that, you'll see things there that you never imagined. Now, no one is forcing you to do anything, so if you change your mind, we're happy to take you back to—
ETHAN Um, you probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.
ETHAN Good morning. No, no, its OK. You'll be hoarse for a few hours but it gets better as the day goes on. Sorry I had to, strap you in, but the last leg is always a little bumpy. Watch your head. Give me your hand.
ETHAN We're here.
JULIET Here where?
BEN Hello, Dr. Burke. My name is Benjamin Linus. I'm really looking forward to working with you. Watch your step here.
CHARLIE Hey, wow, that's too much water, its going to be all soggy.
HURLEY It's oatmeal dude, it's supposed to be soggy.
SAWYER Well if it ain't three men and a baby... I counted Hugo twice. Oh what, come on, I used your name.
CLAIRE Hey. Does anybody know where there's any aspirin?
DESMOND Claire, you don't look so good.
CHARLIE What are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.
CLAIRE Yeah. No, I know, I just... my head's pounding.
SAWYER I got you covered, two aspirin coming right up.
CLAIRE Thank you.
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
SUN Jack? It's Jack!
SAWYER The hell is she doing here?!
HURLEY Hey.
JULIET Hey.
HURLEY So. You're, like, one of them, huh?
JULIET I'm Juliet.
HURLEY I don't remember you from the dock. Where you put bags on our heads. After you shocked us.
JULIET I had the day off.
HURLEY So I hear you're a doctor.
JULIET I'm really more of a researcher.
HURLEY Uh-huh.
JULIET They send you over here to keep an eye on me? OK.
HURLEY The last one of you guys that came over here. Ethan. He kidnapped Claire, and... Charlie got upset. We buried him over there.
ETHAN She's gone, Juliet, she's dead.
GOODWIN It's OK. You tried. You go ahead and take off. I'll talk to Ben.
BEN It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant. She knew she was taking a risk.
JULIET I think it happens at conception. And if that's the case, there's nothing I can do about it, at least not here.
BEN I'm not sure I understand.
JULIET The only way to see if I'm right is to take a woman off the Island, back to Miami.
BEN No, you're not taking anybody off the Island.
JULIET In that case, there's nothing more I can do. I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben. And I'm sorry I couldn't help you. My sister's giving birth in three months, and I haven't even been able to call her. It's time for me to go home.
BEN Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet. She'll be dead before then. Her cancer is back.
JULIET Where did you get this?
BEN Mikhail. I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, I just didn't see what good it would do.
JULIET What good it would do?! I could have gone home, I could have been with her!
BEN You still can. You can go home, Juliet. Be with her in her final days, or you can stay here and help me with our problem.
JULIET Why would I stay?
BEN Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer.
JULIET I'm supposed to take that on faith?
BEN You've been here for six months. You've done extensive work-ups on all of us, have you seen even a trace of cancer?
JULIET That's here. And being that you won't let me my sister here, I'm going to need more—
BEN Jacob said he would take care of it himself. Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him. Every woman on this Island needs you. If you choose to stay, I promise you, we will save Rachel's life.
SUN Trust her? She's one of them.
JACK Not anymore. They left her behind.
CHARLIE Oh yeah, where'd they go?
JACK I told you, I dunno.
SAWYER Well, maybe we better ask her.
JACK She doesn't know either.
SAWYER Well, here's a wacky idea. Let's stick our resident Iraqi on her. Let him do what he does, then see what she says.
SAYID No, I don't do that anymore.
SAWYER Well ain't that convenient.
SAYID But I don't trust her, Jack. If she's so innocent, why won't she answer my questions?
CHARLIE Hey.
JACK Just give her some time, she's afraid.
SAYID How much time?
JACK Look, the fact that I trust her should be enough.
SAYID It's not.
DESMOND Where did Locke go?
JACK He went with them. Right after he destroyed the sub, the sub that was gonna take me off this Island.
HURLEY What?
SAWYER They were gonna let you go?
JACK Yeah.
SAWYER Said who?
JACK Ben.
SAWYER Ben. Whose life you saved.
KATE Sawyer, lay off.
SAWYER You should have let that bug-eyed bastard die.
KATE He did it for us.
SAWYER Sounds like he did it for him.
KATE James.
JACK Something you wanna ask me, Sawyer?
SAWYER Yeah Jack, I wanna ask you why you're fighting every one of us and sticking up for one of them.
JACK Look, I spent every moment over there trying to find a way off this Island—
CHARLIE Claire?
JACK —I was trying to help all of us. I was trying to get us rescued.
CHARLIE Claire... Jack! There's something wrong with Claire!
JACK Put her head back, put her head back. Let's get her up. How long's she been like this?
CHARLIE Er, she started feeling bad this morning.
JACK Before she got back, was she showing any symptoms at all?
CHARLIE No, she was fine.
JACK What about water, has she been drinking enough water?
CHARLIE I think so, yeah.
JACK Alright, keep that head up.
JULIET What happened to her?
JIN 무슨 상관이야?
SUN He said, what do you care?
JULIET Kate! I need your help. I need you to go and get Jack.
KATE Look, he's busy right now.
JULIET Please, I have to talk to him.
KATE You wanna tell me why you need Jack?
JULIET Because I think I know what's wrong with Claire.
KATE Why?
JULIET Because I did it to her.
SAWYER Giving you a bad feeling in your stomach? Yeah, me too.
JULIET Claire's immune system is turning on her. She's having a latent reaction to a medication in her bloodstream.
JACK What medication?
JULIET It was designed to keep her alive during the late stages of her pregnancy.
JACK Designed by who?
JULIET By me. For some reason, the women here can't have babies. The mother's body turns on the pregnancy, treats it as a foreign invader. I saw it happen over and over. Every pregnant woman on this Island died.
JULIET That is, every pregnant woman until Claire.
JACK What did you do to her?
JULIET One of our people infiltrated your camp, and began taking blood samples, right after your plane crashed.
KATE Ethan.
JULIET Even though Claire didn't conceive on this Island, we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers, so we tried to save her life.
JACK By kidnapping her?
JULIET No! That wasn't supposed to happen. She was our control case. I had developed a serum that I thought would reverse what was happening to her, Ethan was administering the injections. But then... you found out that he wasn't on the plane.
HURLEY The census, I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest — he wasn't on the plane.
JULIET So... he improvised.
ETHAN Hello there.
JULIET He kidnapped her, on his own. That was never the plan. Look, I know how this sounds, but without those injections, Claire would have died. Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal, and if I don't treat her quickly, her immune system could shut down entirely. Jack! I can fix this. I just need the serum. Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies near the caves where you used to live. If I go right now I can be back before its too late.
JACK Do it. Get moving.
GOODWIN Where are you?
JULIET In bed, with you.
GOODWIN Uh-huh. And where were you?
JULIET I was just realizing... that tomorrow I will have been on this Island for three years.
GOODWIN Hm, well, then I better bake a cake.
JULIET Stay here.
GOODWIN What have you got there?
JULIET Karl developed some X-rays for me.
GOODWIN What's wrong?
UNNAMED OTHER Morning, Juliet.
BEN Hi.
JULIET Can I come in?
BEN Of course. I was just finishing Carrie. I still don't know why you picked it, but boy is it depressing—
JULIET You have a tumor.
BEN What?
JULIET When you told me about your back pain, I said that I would take some X-rays to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc. But that's not your problem. Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your L-4 vertebra. You're surprised.
BEN Well, you just told me I have cancer, Juliet, of course I'm surprised.
JULIET No, I told you that you had a tumor.
JULIET Why are you scared?
BEN I'm not scared.
JULIET Why are you scared, Ben? You said no one on this Island ever had cancer, you told me that.
BEN I know what I told you, Juliet—
JULIET You told me you could fix it. You said that, you said that you cured my sister, you lied to me!
BEN No, I did not lie to you!
JULIET If you can cure cancer Ben, then why do you have it?
BEN I don't know.
JULIET I want to talk to her. I want to talk to Rachel, I want to talk to her, now!
BEN It's not going to happen Juliet, but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.
JULIET You never cured her!
BEN I did!
JULIET You're a liar!
BEN No, Juliet—
JULIET YOU LIED TO ME!!!
BEN I told you the truth!
BEN I gave you my word.
JULIET I know. I wanna go home. I wanna go home, Ben, please. Can't you please just let me go home?
BEN No.
SAYID Step away from the case!
JULIET Listen to me, Sayid.
SAYID Step back.
JULIET It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire. Jack knows all about it.
SAWYER Jack ain't here right now is he?
JULIET I'm telling you the truth.
SAYID You said earlier if you told me everything you knew, I'd kill you. I'm going to test the validity of that statement.
SAWYER He means talk.
JULIET We don't have time for this.
SAWYER We cleared our schedules. We got all the time in the world.
JULIET You know it's interesting... that you two are now the camp's moral police. I'm curious, Sayid, how long was it before you told everyone on that beach exactly how many people you've tortured in your life. Do they know about Basra? And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James, was to gather everyone in a circle, and tell them about the man you shot in cold blood the night before you got on the plane. So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous. I'm taking that medication back to Claire. And you're gonna let me. Because if she doesn't get it, she's gonna die. And the last thing, that either of you need right now, is more blood on your hands.
BEN Goodwin. Ethan. There might actually be survivors. And you're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go! So I guess I'm out of the bookclub?
BEN Juliet. Juliet! I was looking for you this morning. You and I need to talk.
JULIET Now?
BEN We have some time. It's important. Take a walk with me.
BEN Mikhail? We're here. He never has his walkie on.
JULIET What are we doing here?
BEN There's something I need to show you. Mikhail! It's Ben. I'm here with Juliet, we're approaching the house. Don't shoot us...
MIKHAIL Well hurry up then.
MIKHAIL Did you see it?
BEN A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. Of course we saw it. What do you have so far?
MIKHAIL Oceanic Flight 815. Left Sydney Australia headed for Los Angeles, 324 people onboard including the flight crew.
BEN I want detailed files on every single passenger.
MIKHAIL Already working on it.
BEN Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park please?
BEN Yesterday you called me a liar. I was hurt by that.
BEN Hello, Richard, can you hear me?
BEN Notice today's date, this is live. OK, Richard.
JULIET Oh my god. Oh! Oh my god!
BEN A little over two years ago, to everyone's complete surprise, Rachel's cancer went into complete remission. Shortly after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. His name is Julian. OK, thank you Richard. You'll wanna get back here as soon as you can; we may have some new visitors.
JULIET Oh, god! No! No!
BEN I'm not a liar, Juliet.
JULIET I want to go home.
BEN That's not our agreement, you need to stay here until your work is finished.
JULIET It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.
BEN Then we'll find more mothers. Who knows, maybe there's even one on that plane.
CHARLIE Wait, what're you doing? She's not touching Claire — she's the one who did this to her.
JACK She can help her, Charlie.
CHARLIE Says who? Her? How can you even trust her?
JACK I do trust her. You trust me? Do you trust me?
CHARLIE Yeah.
JACK Give us a couple of minutes here, OK?
JACK How long before this takes effect?
JULIET We should see results in a few hours.
JACK Juliet. If this doesn't work, if something happens to her. I'm not going to be able to protect you anymore. You'll be on your own.
JULIET I'm already on my own, Jack.
CLAIRE What happened?
JACK Got a tarp. A couple of blankets. Some airline pillows. Its not much, but it'll get you started. Claire's awake. There's a... a lean-to that we've been using for shade. And, everyone says that it'll be alright if you set up camp there. For now.
JULIET Thank you.
JACK They're good people. They're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But eventually they're gonna need some answers.
JULIET Why don't you? You keep talking about them. Why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?
JACK You were there. You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded. In that moment, I saw it in your eyes. You wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world. That makes you one of us.
BEN Let's go over it again.
JULIET I know what to do.
BEN Let's go over it again. Just to be sure.
JULIET I drag Austen out into the jungle, handcuff myself to her, then tell her I was gassed, just like she was.
BEN And if she catches you in the lie?
JULIET I'll admit to it. Tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.
BEN Good. What then?
JULIET They'll take me back to the beach.
JULIET I know you want me to go there, but after everything we've done to them, its going to be a problem.
BEN We've activated the implant in Claire, she should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours. By the time you get to that camp, you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.
JULIET I'll need supplies.
BEN Pryce is already on his way. He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop-point. Tell Jack that you can save her. He trusts you... are you alright?
JULIET I'm fine.
BEN See you in a week.
