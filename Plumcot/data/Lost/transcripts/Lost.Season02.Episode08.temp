MATTHEW So how're you doing?
ANA LUCIA Well, the family with the screaming baby moved.
MATTHEW You must be thrilled.
ANA LUCIA Actually, it's too quiet now.
MATTHEW So, how's Danny -- you two trying to work things out?
ANA LUCIA There's nothing to work out. He left.
MATTHEW You okay with that?
ANA LUCIA I guess you could say I'm one of those people that's just better off alone.
MATTHEW So, how was the firing range?
ANA LUCIA Good.
MATTHEW How did it feel to hold a gun again?
ANA LUCIA Very good.
MATTHEW All these steps count, Ana. You've come a long way since we met 4 months ago.
ANA LUCIA Did she say -- you know, when I can come back to work?
MATTHEW She left the final determination up to me.
ANA LUCIA Right.
MATTHEW Do you think you're ready?
ANA LUCIA What do you think?
MATTHEW Welcome back to the force, Officer Cortez.
MICHAEL Sayid! Sayid, no!
MICHAEL Hey, hey!
ANA LUCIA Don't move! Nobody move!
ANA LUCIA Nobody move! Nobody! Does he have anything else on him?
EKO What?
ANA LUCIA He just had a gun to your neck -- check to see if he had anything else on him?
MICHAEL Hey, put it down.
ANA LUCIA Stop.
MICHAEL Are you crazy? Don't point that at me?
ANA LUCIA I said stop!
MICHAEL What is your problem, huh?!
BERNARD Ana!
JIN 야, 너 미쳤어?
ANA LUCIA Get back! Get back, both of you!
MICHAEL Are you crazy?
LIBBY Ana.
ANA LUCIA Now!
LIBBY Ana!
ANA LUCIA We need to tie him up.
EKO I'm not tying him up.
ANA LUCIA He tried to kill you.
EKO No.
ANA LUCIA You, you do it. Tie him. Use the vines from the stretcher.
MICHAEL Hey, if we take that thing apart we won't be able to...
ANA LUCIA Shut up!
LIBBY Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor or he'll die.
ANA LUCIA I know what I'm doing.
CAPTAIN I hope this is all of it.
RAGGS That's all we've got right now.
CAPTAIN Okay.
RAGGS Thanks, Captain.
CAPTAIN Come on in.
RAGGS Hey, look who's here. Good to see you Ana Lucia, welcome back.
ANA LUCIA Thanks, Raggs.
RAGGS I'll get you those IRs, Captain.
CAPTAIN Today.
RAGGS You've got it.
CAPTAIN How are you?
ANA LUCIA Good. Fine.
CAPTAIN Good. Your assignment.
ANA LUCIA Evidence? You're putting me behind a desk?
CAPTAIN Is that a problem?
ANA LUCIA I want patrol.
CAPTAIN I don't care what you want.
ANA LUCIA Just put me in a car.
CAPTAIN You were in an officer involve shooting -- no.
ANA LUCIA 
CAPTAIN Both.
ANA LUCIA I need to be back on the street. Please.
CAPTAIN I put you in a car -- everyone's going to know I pulled strings. You don't want me to treat you like my daughter? Don't ask for favors.
ANA LUCIA Then transfer me.
CAPTAIN You don't get the transfer, but I'll give you the car. Happy?
RAGGS Sorry to bother you Captain -- Ana, there's a call for you in the bullpen, they say it's real important.
ANA LUCIA Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.
CAPTAIN They got you a cake, try and act surprised.
ROSE Jack, nice to see you out of the Hatch. You could use more sunshine.
JACK I'll take that under advisement.
ROSE A little fruit might do you good, too. Good for the constitution -- at least that's what they say.
JACK Well, if that's what they say. 
ROSE Mmmm?
JACK Where'd you get these?
ROSE Well, now just because you're a little excited -- no reason to talk with your mouth full.
HURLEY Past the hanging tree, double or nothing.
KATE You sure?
HURLEY Dude, double or nothing, there's no way you're hitting it that far.
CHARLIE Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.
KATE Double's 10 thousand bucks.
CHARLIE Oh, that's nothing to someone who's worth 150 million dollars. He'll build you your own course, if you'd like.
KATE What are you talking about?
HURLEY Ignore him, he's an idiot.
HURLEY Crap!
JACK You hooked it. Try keeping your left arm straight.
KATE You giving me tips?
JACK Kate, I'm -- I'm a doctor.
KATE So, you think you could do better?
JACK Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.
KATE And what's golf?
JACK Golf is accuracy.
KATE Well, why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate.
CHARLIE Oooh, fighting talk.
JACK You're kidding, right?
KATE 3 holes, no handicap, we play for bragging rights. What are we waiting for?
LIBBY Ana, let's just get to their camp. It was an accident; they'll understand.
ANA LUCIA They'll understand? I killed one of them. If those two move, shout.
LIBBY Wait, what are you doing?
SAYID Untie me.
ANA LUCIA I'm not-
SAYID Untie me!!!
LIBBY Ana.
ANA LUCIA What are you doing?
EKO I'm taking him back to his camp.
ANA LUCIA Don't leave, please. If that were you, he'd let you die.
EKO I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me.
BIG MIKE So'd the shrink give you any good drugs?
ANA LUCIA Not that kind of shrink.
BIG MIKE Did you miss me?
ANA LUCIA Boy, did I.
BIG MIKE I heard about you and Danny. Want me to go kick his ass for you?
ANA LUCIA Nah. It's better this way. What are we doing in Westwood?
BIG MIKE I thought a change of scenery would be nice -- a nice safe neighborhood for your first day back.
ANA LUCIA This was her idea, wasn't it?
BIG MIKE She is the Captain.
ANA LUCIA Yeah.
POLICE RADIO VOICE 809, please respond to a domestic disturbance call at 2210 South Veteran.
ANA LUCIA This is 8 Adam-16.
BIG MIKE That's not our call.
POLICE RADIO VOICE Go ahead Adam-16.

BIG MIKE Ana Lucia!
ANA LUCIA Hands on the ground!
BIG MIKE Ana Lucia! He is down. Holster your weapon. Now.
LIBBY Hey, I think you should let him go.
ANA LUCIA No. He's going to come after me.
LIBBY You don't know that.
ANA LUCIA I killed someone he loves.
ANA LUCIA Sit down. Now.
MICHAEL I'm bringing him water. You going to shoot me? Shoot me.
ANA LUCIA Don't even think of untying him.
SAYID Who is that woman?
MICHAEL Her name is Ana Lucia. She was on the plane -- tail section -- they all were. We were bringing them back.
SAYID Where is Walt?
MICHAEL They took him -- the Others.
SAYID What do you mean they took him?
MICHAEL From the raft -- the night we left.
MICHAEL Hey, man. Hey, we're going to get out of this, man.
JACK Guess you're first.
KATE Lucky me.
JACK You know the lady's tee at my golf club back home is about 10 feet closer so if you...
KATE Shut up, Jack.
JACK Nice.
KATE You're up.
KATE Wow, you really put it in there.
KATE We have more balls; you could always just take a drop.
JACK I'm good. Got it.
JACK You may want to move. What?
EKO Where is the doctor?
JACK I got him. I got him.
KATE Where are we headed?
JACK Bathroom. He's burning up. We've got to get him in the shower -- bring his fever down.
KATE What can I do?
JACK Okay, go through the medical stash; there's a bottle of Ofloxacin...
KATE Ofloxacin.
JACK Ofloxacin -- little white pills. Bring the alcohol and some gauge patches, and strip that bed and make sure it has clean sheets on it. Kate?!
KATE Uh, yeah, yeah.
LOCKE What happened?
JACK John, the button.
LOCKE Hello.
EKO Hello.
BERNARD Hey, what are we doing here, Ana? I mean, their camp has got to be close. I just want to get back to my wife.
ANA LUCIA How long have I kept you alive out here, Bernard? That's right. So cut me some slack.
LIBBY Hey, we just want to know what you're doing. What's the plan?
SAYID She has no plan. She only has her guilt and a gun.
ANA LUCIA You want a plan? Do you have any ammo, back at your camp?
MICHAEL What?
ANA LUCIA Ammo -- for the gun -- do you have any back at your camp?
MICHAEL Yeah, a couple boxes.
ANA LUCIA Alright, I want it -- at least half. And I'll need a pack -- a big one -- a blanket, some medicine, clothes -- jeans and socks -- you getting all this?
MICHAEL Yeah, I got it.
ANA LUCIA Alright, you bring all of that stuff back to me and I'll let your friend go.
MICHAEL I'm not leaving them.
LIBBY Michael, you should.
MICHAEL No. We stay together.
JIN Go. 사이드를 절대로 다치게 할 수는 없어.
MICHAEL I'll be back, man.
LIBBY Ana, what are you doing? You can't live out here alone.
ANA LUCIA I'm already alone.
BIG MIKE I'll sign us out.
ANA LUCIA What, you talking to me, now?
BIG MIKE I just want to go home A-L.
ANA LUCIA Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice.
BIG MIKE So does that mean every time we run into some yo-yo with a TV in his hands, you're going to draw down?
RAGGS Hey, Ana Lucia -- your guy -- we got him.
CAPTAIN His name is Jason McCormick. We picked him up on an assault on an elderly woman in Echo Park. His fingerprints matched a partial from your crime scene. We questioned him and he confessed. The D.A. is ready to file charges -- all he needs is for you to I.D. him.
ANA LUCIA It's not him.
CAPTAIN He confessed.
ANA LUCIA I don't know him.
CAPTAIN Can you guys give us a minute? Why are you doing this?
ANA LUCIA Because it's not him.
CAPTAIN He put 4 bullets into you -- hollow points through your vest -- he tried to kill you. You want a list of his priors? You want to put this guy back out on the street?
ANA LUCIA It's not him.
LOCKE What happened? Out there -- what happened?
EKO There was an accident.
LOCKE What kind of accident?
EKO A girl was shot and killed.
LOCKE What did she look like?
EKO She was tall with blonde hair. There was an Arab man...
LOCKE Shannon. You said there were 5 of you from the tail section?
EKO 4.
LOCKE 4 -- why didn't the rest of them come back with you? And Michael, Jin?
EKO They cannot come back right now.
LOCKE Can you take me to them?
EKO No.
KATE Here you go. What's happening? Why is he shaking?
JACK He's septic. The infection's gotten into the blood stream. If the anti-biotics don't bring the fever down he'll go into shock. Hold him up.
KATE Okay, I've got him.
JACK Swallow it, swallow it, swallow it.
KATE I'll do it.
JACK No, no, I've got it.
KATE I can do it. Sawyer? Hey, you have to listen to me, okay? The only way that you are going to get better is if you take this pill. So I want you to swallow it, okay? Okay, here we go. Now swallow, swallow. Good, good.
JACK Nice job. I never learned the whole whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.
ANA LUCIA What are you doing?
BERNARD I'm going, Ana. I don't want to be a part of this. I know everything you've done for us, and I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. But I'm going.
ANA LUCIA What about you?
LIBBY I just don't think you're the best judge of character. I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.
ANA LUCIA Alright, you want to go? Go. Leave. You -- go.
ANA LUCIA Get out of here. Go.
SUN Michael!
MICHAEL Hi. Listen, it's alright. Jin is okay.
SUN Where is he?
MICHAEL He's fine; and I'll explain. But right now, I need to find Jack.
JACK Where are they? I said, where are they?
LOCKE Jack, it's not his fault...
JACK Shannon's dead! I'm not... You're going to take me back out there, right now.
LOCKE This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back.
JACK Half-dead with a bullet hole in his shoulder, John! Are you going to talk to me or are you just going to sit there?
EKO Anything I say will only make you angry. So, yes, I will sit here.
SUN Jack! Jack! Jack!
JACK Michael. 
MICHAEL We've got a problem, man.
JACK You remember how to get out there, right?
MICHAEL Yeah, I think so.
LOCKE We should stop and think about this, Jack.
JACK Think about what, John? Shannon's dead, Sayid's being held at gunpoint. You want to sit and hope that situation resolves itself -- be my guest. You know how to use this?
MICHAEL Yes, sir.
EKO Stop! Please. What do you want?
JACK Excuse me?
EKO Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you are going out with all these guns? What do you want?
JACK I want all of our people back here safely. Your friend murdered-
EKO Ana Lucia made a mistake.
JACK What did you say?
EKO Ana Lucia made a mistake.
JACK Ana Lucia.
EKO I will take you there. But only you, and no guns.
JACK Let's go.
ANA LUCIA Where are you from? Where are you from?
SAYID I'm from Iraq.
ANA LUCIA Do you have any kids?
SAYID Why are you asking me if I have children?
ANA LUCIA I'm curious.
SAYID I do not. Do you have children?
ANA LUCIA No.
SAYID Are you going to kill me? That's what you're thinking about, isn't it?
ANA LUCIA Should I?
SAYID Almost 40 days ago on this very Island I tied a man to a tree and tortured him. I tortured him as I've tortured many men -- men whose voices I still hear in the night. Should you kill me? Maybe you should. Maybe you were meant to.
ANA LUCIA I'm a cop... I was a cop. One night my partner and I responded to a burglary call. We were the first ones there. I covered the front and he went around the back. I was there a minute and then this kid comes right through the front door -- I tell him to put his hands up -- and he says I'm making a mistake -- that he's a student and he wants to show me his I.D. I believed him. I just -- I let him reach. All I remember was a pop. By the time I hit the ground I thought I was dead. I feel dead.
SAYID What happened to him -- the man who shot you?
ANA LUCIA Hey, Jason.
JASON I know you?
ANA LUCIA I was pregnant.
SAYID What happened to him?
ANA LUCIA Nothing. They never found him. Go ahead, pick it up, I deserve it.
SAYID What good it would be to kill you if we're both already dead?
KATE Hey! Hey, can you hear me? You're going to be okay. You're going to be alright. You're home.
