james_ford Want some cocoa?
kate_austen Where'd you find cocoa?
james_ford I didn't. Pretend.
john_locke How's the leg?
jinsoo_kwon Still hurts.
john_locke You should leave the bandage off for a while. The air'll do it some good.
jinsoo_kwon I'll try that.
john_locke You mind if I sit down?
john_locke I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs?
jinsoo_kwon You mean the cave? The one with the names on the wall?
john_locke Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. Kwon is one of them.
jinsoo_kwon Does that mean me or Sun?
john_locke Well Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together.
jinsoo_kwon But, Sun is not here...
john_locke You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it.
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 OFFICER Alright Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch.
jinsoo_kwon Money?
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 OFFICER I'm sorry, federal law says we have to confiscate the $25,000.
jinsoo_kwon Confiscate?
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 OFFICER It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork.
jinsoo_kwon And... the money...
SECURITY#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 OFFICER You can exit right over there, sir.
jinsoo_kwon 가자.
sunhwa_kwon 괜찮아요?
jinsoo_kwon 식당에서 만나기로 한 약속도 놓쳤잖아!
sunhwa_kwon 그 돈은 뭐에요?
jinsoo_kwon 나도 몰라. 우리 바로 떠나기 전에 아버님이 시계하고 같이 전해주라고 주신거야. 아버님께 질문할 입장도 아니고, 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야.
desk_clerk May I help you?
sunhwa_kwon Paik.
desk_clerk A reservation for Paik...
desk_clerk Yes, I've got it right here. I've got a beautiful oceanview room for you on the eighth floor.
jinsoo_kwon Two room. Two! No marry.
desk_clerk Oh...
jinsoo_kwon Kwon. Jin-Soo Kwon.
desk_clerk I'm sorry, I apologize... yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir.
desk_clerk Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon... welcome to Los Angeles.
john_locke I'm leavin' for a little while. I got an errand to run.
sayid_jarrah When will you be back?
john_locke Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone.
sayid_jarrah I don't feel anything.
john_locke Excuse me?
sayid_jarrah Anger. Happiness. Pain. I don't feel it anymore.
john_locke Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's coming.
james_ford What're you doin', Hoss?
jinsoo_kwon I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back.
james_ford What thing?
jinsoo_kwon Locke. And you're just sitting around here listening to whatever he tells you...
james_ford I ain't listenin' to nobody! I already told you I have a deal with Widmore, so if you just--
jinsoo_kwon It doesn't matter who you have a deal with! I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife.
james_ford Find her where?
jinsoo_kwon Go back to the temple. And if she's not there I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun so stop trying to--
seamus Is this the guy?
zoe Yeah. Let's take him.
miles_straume Play your card, captain.
ben_linus Now what?
ilana_verdansky We wait.
ben_linus Wait... for what?
ilana_verdansky For Richard to come back.
ben_linus You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!
ilana_verdansky Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back.
miles_straume Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, I'm not sure Hurley can track anything...
frank_lapidus Hey, don't talk about bacon.
ilana_verdansky Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait.
dr_jack_shephard How are the tomatoes?
sunhwa_kwon Dead.
dr_jack_shephard I remember when you first planted this here. Feels like a hundred years ago...
dr_jack_shephard You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you?
sunhwa_kwon I don't care if he comes back.
dr_jack_shephard What about us... being candidates?
sunhwa_kwon What about it?
dr_jack_shephard Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And there was a mirror. And all around it there were... there were hundreds of names written down.
sunhwa_kwon I don't care. I don't care about Alpert, or being a candidate.
dr_jack_shephard Sun... there was a reason why we were--
sunhwa_kwon I don't want to hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone!
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨... 뭐하는 거에요?
jinsoo_kwon 이 시계를 전하러 이렇게 멀리까지 왔는데... 식당엘 가 봐야겠어.
sunhwa_kwon 들어오지 않을래요? 이런 얘기 여기서 하고싶지 않아요.
sunhwa_kwon 지금 열한시 반이에요. 이 시간에 누가 식당에 있겠어요?
jinsoo_kwon 그래도 가보긴 해야지.
sunhwa_kwon 진수 씨. 그 사람, 우리 아빠 직원이에요. 그렇게 걱정할 필요가 없어요.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 상관이야. 자긴 여기 쇼핑만 하러 온 거 아니야?
sunhwa_kwon 나에 대해서 그렇게밖에 생각 못해요? 내가 그냥 여기 쇼핑하러 온 것 같아?
jinsoo_kwon 아닌가?
sunhwa_kwon 왜? 단추 채우라고 하지 그래? 기내 안에서 했던 것 처럼?
jinsoo_kwon 사람들이 많았잖아. 누군가 우리를 보고 있을수도 있고.
sunhwa_kwon 우릴 보는 사람은 아무도 없어. 그래서... 단추를 채우라는 거야, 말라는 거야?
jinsoo_kwon 아니.
sunhwa_kwon 그럼... 이거는요? [Subtitle What about... this one?
jinsoo_kwon 아니지.
sunhwa_kwon 이것도?
jinsoo_kwon 그건... 당연히 아니지.
john_locke Sun...
john_locke I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Bad day?
sunhwa_kwon What are you doing here?
john_locke I found your husband.
sunhwa_kwon What?
john_locke I promised you I would reunite you two... took me a little longer than I thought it would... but he's with my people, back at my camp across the island. I can take you to him right now.
sunhwa_kwon I don't believe you. You killed those people at the temple.
john_locke Those people were confused. They were lied to. I didn't want to hurt them. Any one of them could have chosen to come with me. And I'm giving you that choice, Sun... right now. I would never make you do anything against your will. I'm asking you. Please. Come with me. Jin is waiting.
john_locke Sun!
john_locke Sun, wait!
sunhwa_kwon 좋은 생각이 있어요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭔데?
sunhwa_kwon 우리 도망가요.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐?
sunhwa_kwon 농담 아니야. 같이 도망가요.
jinsoo_kwon 돈도 없이 어떻게?
sunhwa_kwon 내 앞으로 된 계좌가 있어요.
jinsoo_kwon 아니, 이게 다 처음부터 계획한거야?
sunhwa_kwon 화났어요?
jinsoo_kwon 아니... 그렇지만 그건 말도 안돼.
sunhwa_kwon 내가 묻는 말에만 대답해요. 날 사랑해요?
jinsoo_kwon 자기 잘 알잖아, 내가 얼마나 사랑하는지.
sunhwa_kwon 좋아요. 당신이 알아야 될 게 있어요.
jinsoo_kwon 누구지?
sunhwa_kwon 글쎄요. 사인을 걸어놨는데?
jinsoo_kwon 잔다고 그냥 보내.
martin_keamy Miss Paik? Hi. I'm, uh... Martin Keamy.
martin_keamy I'm a friend of your father's.
martin_keamy Mind if I come in? I believe you got something for me...
ben_linus Sun? Sun, can you hear me?
ben_linus What happened? You alright?
sunhwa_kwon 그 사람 어디 있어요?
ben_linus I'm sorry, what?
sunhwa_kwon 날 쫓아 왔는데... 그 사람... 분명히 왔어요. 그 사람...
ben_linus Slow down. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you?
sunhwa_kwon Locke.
john_locke Sayid! Sayid, hey! What happened?
sayid_jarrah We were attacked.
john_locke By whom?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
john_locke Where is Jin?
jinsoo_kwon Hey! Hey!
zoe Well... that was weird, huh?
jinsoo_kwon Where am I?
zoe It's called Room 23. The DHARMA Initiative was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here. But... you know all about the DHARMA Initiative... don't you, Mr. Kwon?
jinsoo_kwon Why did you bring me here?
zoe Relax. You're safe.
jinsoo_kwon I'm leaving.
zoe Sorry, but we went to a lot of trouble getting you here off of the other island. And I can't let you leave.
jinsoo_kwon What do you want from me?
zoe These are grid maps that the...the DHARMA people used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Whoever signed these could really help me out. I know... I know the writing's diffcult to read but... but sure looks like it says Jin Soo-Kwon. So, is it you or isn't it?
jinsoo_kwon You want answers to your questions? Then get me your boss. I want to talk with Charles Widmore.
zoe Well... then you're in luck, Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like to talk to you too.
john_locke You a good swimmer?
sayid_jarrah Good enough.
john_locke Wrap this in plastic, you don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger.
john_locke Something wrong, Claire?
claire_littleton Um... what, what you said to Jin... about the names on the wall? Told him you needed them all to get off the island?
john_locke Yes I did.
claire_littleton So... was my name on the wall?
john_locke No.
claire_littleton Then... it doesn't matter if I get on that plane then. I mean you don't, you don't need me--
john_locke No. That's not true, Claire. I need you.
john_locke And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us.
claire_littleton Now when we go home, Aaron's not going to know me. Stranger to my own son. He thinks Kate's his mother. Was her name on the wall?
john_locke No, Claire... it isn't. Not anymore. But I need Kate.
claire_littleton Why?
john_locke Because I'm three people shy of getting off this island and Kate can help me get these people on that plane. But... once she does... then whatever happens, happens.
james_ford What's up with the guns? You two goin' somewhere?
john_locke We're taking a boat ride over to the other island.
james_ford What do you need a boat for? Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water?
john_locke Do you think if I could do that I would still be on this island?
james_ford No, 'cause that would be ridiculous... what the hell are you goin' over there for anyway? Thought you were tryin' to avoid Charlie Widmore.
john_locke They took one of our people, James. So I'm going to get him back.
martin_keamy Is this for me? Wow this is really nice. Hmm. Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money. Where's Mr. Kwon?
sunhwa_kwon No English.
martin_keamy Sit down.
omar_idris I checked his room, he's not there.
martin_keamy Check the bathroom.
omar_idris Come on, let's go.
martin_keamy Mr. Kwon! Why don't you come and join us? Look, thank you for the watch, okay, but you're also supposed to give me an envelope with money in it. Twenty-five thousand dollars. Yeah?
jinsoo_kwon 그럼 어떻게 해?
sunhwa_kwon 우리 돈을 좀 주면 안될까?
jinsoo_kwon 놈한테 돈을 주자고?
martin_keamy Stop it. I feel like I'm in a damn Godzilla movie. What's that guy's name, the uhhh Russian guy, speaks like nine different languages, uhhh uhhh Danny's friend?
omar_idris Mikhail.
martin_keamy Mikhail. He speak Korean?
omar_idris Think so.
martin_keamy Go get him. Now put your damn clothes on.
sunhwa_kwon 그 돈은 세관에서 압류당했지만, 나한테 돈이 있어요.
mikhail_bakunin She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs.
martin_keamy It's not my problem.
sunhwa_kwon 같이 은행에 가면 내가 돈을 찾아줄게요.
mikhail_bakunin She wants you to let them please go to the bank, they will get it for you.
martin_keamy You take her to the bank, I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant, then we'll meet there.
mikhail_bakunin 진수는 나중에 보기로 하죠.
jinsoo_kwon 저희... 두 사람에 대해서는 미스터 백께 비밀로 해주십시오. 부탁드립니다.
martin_keamy What's he whining about?
mikhail_bakunin He wants you to promise that you won't tell her father that they are involved.
martin_keamy Oh. Hey, don't worry about that. Okay, your secret, it's safe with me. Okay? Just bring me the money and then we could all live happily ever after, right?
ben_linus What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes and she was already unconscious when I found her. Why won't you believe me?
ilana_verdansky Because you're speaking.
dr_jack_shephard You got a pretty descent size bump, might be a slight concussion. You can understand what I'm saying?
dr_jack_shephard But you can only speak Korean.
sunhwa_kwon 맞아요.
miles_straume She hits her head and forgets English? Are we supposed to buy that?
frank_lapidus Asks the man who communes with the dead.
dr_jack_shephard It might be aphasia. It's um, a condition that's caused by trauma and it affects the language center of your brain. It's usually temporary. Sun, You're gonna be okay.
miles_straume What are you smiling about?
richard_alpert Pack your bags, we're leaving.
MEN#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 DON'T MOVE!!
seamus Let me see your hands!
john_locke Easy, friend, I come in peace.
charles_widmore Do you know who I am?
john_locke Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am?
charles_widmore Obviously you're not John Locke. Everything else I know is a combination of myth, ghost stories, and jungle noises in the night.
john_locke I think you know more than that judging by these pylons.
charles_widmore Why did you come here?
john_locke You took one of my people, Jin Kwon.
charles_widmore I have no idea what you're talking about.
john_locke A wise man once said that war was coming to this Island, I think it just got here.
dr_jack_shephard Where exactly are we going, Richard?
richard_alpert Where's Locke?
ben_linus What?
richard_alpert You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be?
ben_linus Hydra island.
richard_alpert Which is exactly where you landed the plane that you flew back here, right?
frank_lapidus That's right.
richard_alpert This man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. You wanna know where we're going, we're gonna stop him.
miles_straume This is your fault isn't it?
hugo_reyes Sorta.
ilana_verdansky How are we gonna stop him from getting on the plane?
richard_alpert We have to destroy it.
sunhwa_kwon 뭐라고요? 비행기를 없애버린다고요? 그럼 이 섬에서 어떻게 탈출하려구요?
richard_alpert Why isn't she speaking English?
dr_jack_shephard She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke.
richard_alpert He came back here?
richard_alpert What, what did he want? What did he say to you? Do you understand me?
sunhwa_kwon 그래, 다 이해했어 이 바보야! 내가 널 도와서 이 섬을 빠져나갈 유일한 방법을 없앨거라고 생각한다면 넌 미쳐도 한참 미쳤어! 난 이 세상을 구하러 온게 아니라 내 남편을 다시 찾아서 다시 돌아가려고 여기 온거야. 내가 중요하다고 이 여자가 그랬어.
sunhwa_kwon 만약에 사실이라면, 넌 내가 꼭 필요해! 하지만 이것만은 알아둬, 난 여기서 한발짝도 움직이지 않을거야!
hugo_reyes I don't think she wants to come.
sunhwa_kwon 무슨 문제라도 있어요?
mikhail_bakunin Miss Paik would like to know if there is a problem.
BANK#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLERK I'm sorry, I'm showing that your account was closed. The balance is zero.
mikhail_bakunin 당신 계좌가 끊겼답니다.
sunhwa_kwon 아니, 그럴 리가 없어요. 나 밖에는 이 계좌에 대해서 아무도 아는 사람이 없어요.
mikhail_bakunin If she may ask, who closed the account please?
BANK#unknown#Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLERK Looks like her father, Mr. Woo-Jung Paik had access. The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts at our main branch in Seoul.
mikhail_bakunin 아버님께서 지시하셨습니다.
sunhwa_kwon 왜? 뭐 때문에요?
mikhail_bakunin 정말 몰라서 물어요?
omar_idris Go on, get in.
martin_keamy What's going on?
omar_idris I bumped his head on the door.
martin_keamy Come on Omar, you gotta be more careful than that.
martin_keamy I got this. You go get the Arab guy.
omar_idris Hey...I'm an Arab.
martin_keamy Just go pick him up
martin_keamy Sorry about that. Omar is loyal but he lacks attention to detail. You don't really understand a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothing? Right. Just hold still okay. I'm gonna strap you in here just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realise how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. That other twenty five that you were supposed to deliver, that was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, now anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.
jinsoo_kwon Thank you.
martin_keamy I'm sorry. Some people just aren't meant to be together.
charles_widmore What the hell were you thinking?
zoe I'm sorry, I know, I know we panicked.
charles_widmore This was not supposed to happen for days. We had a timetable.
zoe See, he was leaving their camp.
charles_widmore Well you should have let him leave and taken him in the jungle.
zoe Well maybe you should put a mercenary in charge instead of a geophysicist.
charles_widmore What's done is done. I need you to get the package from the submarine and take it to the infirmary. Can you do that for me please Zoe?
zoe Yeah. Sure.
charles_widmore Mr Kwon, my deepest apologies for everything that's been done to you. My name is--
jinsoo_kwon I know who you are. Why did you bring me here.
charles_widmore We searched the Ajira plane, discovered your wife's luggage and found this inside. I thought you might want to have it. Go ahead, turn it on.
charles_widmore Her name is Ji Yeon. Your daughter. I understand you've never seen her before. I have a daughter too. I know what it's like to be kept apart. I understand the one thing you want is to be reunited with your wife and daughter. But it would be short lived. If that thing masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island, your wife, your daughter, my daughter, everyone we know and love - would simply cease to be. I came here to make sure that doesn't happen.
jinsoo_kwon How?
charles_widmore Come with me. I think it's time for you to see the package.
jinsoo_kwon What package?
charles_widmore It's not a what. It's a who.
jinsoo_kwon 죽이지 말아주세요. 제발 살려주세요!
sayid_jarrah Who are you?
jinsoo_kwon No English.
sayid_jarrah I don't know why you're here and I don't really care.
jinsoo_kwon No! Free! Free! Free!
sayid_jarrah Good luck.
mikhail_bakunin Martin! Martin! Who did this to you?
martin_keamy Look behind you, you idiot.
jinsoo_kwon 총 내려놔.
mikhail_bakunin 흥분하지 마. 알았어. 누가 이런거야?
jinsoo_kwon 버리라고 그랬지. 어서! 선, 저리 가. 귀 먹었어, 이 새끼야? 안 버리면 쏜다! Do you hear me? Drop it or I'm going to kill you.]
mikhail_bakunin 그러진 못 할걸. 죽이려고 했다면 벌써 쐈겠지. you would've shot me already.]
jinsoo_kwon
sunhwa_kwon 나 임신했어...
dr_jack_shephard Brought you a couple of things. Thinking about a patient that I had during my residency. Car crash, banged his head, when he woke up he couldn't talk. The guy was frustrated, I mean, who wouldn't be. Then one of the nurses said "just because he can't speak, doesn't mean that he can't write". Think you can give it a try?
dr_jack_shephard Take a little longer to get your point across, but at least you have your voice back. Went back out to your garden to see if he was there. He wasn't. I found this.
dr_jack_shephard That's one stubborn tomato. Guess no-one told it it was supposed to die.
dr_jack_shephard Don't worry about it. Not the first person to tell me to leave them alone.
dr_jack_shephard Locke - what did he say to you?
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't you go with him?
dr_jack_shephard You trust me?
dr_jack_shephard Sun, come with us and I'll help you find Jin. I'll help you find him and I'll get you both on that plane and as far away from this island as you can get. I promise.
james_ford Where'd you go?
kate_austen What?
james_ford Looked like your brain took a little stroll.
kate_austen Why aren't you worried, James?
james_ford I am worried. Just really good at pretending I ain't. But I got a feeling this is almost over. 'Cause if Locke rode over there on a boat with Sayid, then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water.
kate_austen What if he didn't?
james_ford Well then we're screwed six ways from sun--
james_ford Oh Hell.
kate_austen He's alone.
james_ford Thought you went over there to find Jin?
john_locke They said they didn't have him.
james_ford And you believed that?
john_locke No.
james_ford Where's Sayid? You lose him too?
john_locke When you were over there James, you mentioned that Widmore had someone guarding a room on his submarine. Guarding something that he didn't want you to see?
james_ford Yeah, so?
john_locke I don't like secrets.
seamus The guy can hardly stand.
zoe Well what do you expect?
seamus How much did you give him?
zoe Obviously I gave him too much but we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse. Come on, get him up.
seamus Let's go Mr. Hume.
