charlie_pace You're insane mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
hugo_reyes Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by The Flash.
charlie_pace But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
hugo_reyes Er, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
charlie_pace Oohh vibration, whatever would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
hugo_reyes Well, no smashing allowed.
charlie_pace No flying, no smashing, any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite...
charlie_pace The hell?
hugo_reyes Charlie!
jinsoo_kwon 가만히 있어!
desmond_hume Don't, don't touch it.
hugo_reyes Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
desmond_hume Just breathe, just breathe huh.
desmond_hume Don't try to talk mate. We've gotta get back.
jinsoo_kwon No, you help!
desmond_hume I can't help! I'm sorry mate.
hugo_reyes Hey, here it is.
charlie_pace Superman can fly around the entire planet...
desmond_hume Hey. Where's the wire?
hugo_reyes D'you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
desmond_hume Listen to me, there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. Do you know what I'm talking about?
hugo_reyes This is future crap, isn't it?
desmond_hume The cable, do you know where it is?! This is important.
hugo_reyes Why?
charlie_pace Superman can...
desmond_hume Because someone's coming.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 God tests our faith in many ways. So, as you well know, we have our own test here. A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit. This challenges both one's patience and his faith. For some, it may last a week. Those we are less sure about, a month. Personally, Desmond, I never thought you'd last. And so now I stand corrected. For whatever reason, your path has led you here. And now you're one of us. Welcome, brother.
desmond_hume Thank you, brother.
desmond_hume Morning, Jack. Must be nice to wake up in your own bed.
dr_jack_shephard Yep, home sweet home.
desmond_hume Listen, I was wondering if I could borrow your first-aid kit. Er, twisted my ankle.
dr_jack_shephard You want me to take a look at it?
desmond_hume Nah, you're alright. I've taped my share of ankles.
dr_jack_shephard Right.
desmond_hume Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard Something wrong Hurley?
hugo_reyes Nah, uh uh, just, keeping Desmond here company. 'Cause, we're friends.
dr_jack_shephard Bring that back when you're done with it, OK?
desmond_hume Absolutely.
desmond_hume What the hell was that? Do you want him to get suspicious?
hugo_reyes Suspicious of what? Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it? That's why you got the first-aid kit, someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me?
desmond_hume No. It's just a precaution.
hugo_reyes Look, dude. You want me to take you to the wire, I want an explanation.
desmond_hume I saw a sequence of events. Things that are gonna happen.
hugo_reyes What'd you see?
desmond_hume It was, it was like a sorta jigsaw puzzle. Only I didn't have the picture in the box, so I dunno how the pieces fit exactly, but... but one of the pieces, the first one...
desmond_hume ... It was you, pulling the cable out the sand.
hugo_reyes So what are the other pieces?
desmond_hume If I tell you that, it'll change the picture in the box.
hugo_reyes So what? Isn't that the point? Preventing something bad?
desmond_hume Not this time.
hugo_reyes So you're not trying to stop something from happening, you actually want it to happen.
desmond_hume More than anything.
james_ford Hey Freckles, you home?
kate_austen Thought you weren't allowed to use nicknames.
james_ford Well, you weren't around when I lost the bet, so you're—
james_ford ...Exempt.
kate_austen What's up?
james_ford Uh, I wanted to ask you something.
kate_austen Yep.
kate_austen I'm up here.
james_ford Uh ... so did you tell him?
kate_austen Did I tell who what?
james_ford You know, did you tell the Doc? About you and me.
kate_austen No. But he knows. He saw us on one of those surveillance monitors.
james_ford I thought you said the camera was broken?
kate_austen Well they had another camera.
james_ford Perverts.
kate_austen Anyway, he knows.
james_ford Well, now that... that's out of the way, maybe a little afternoon delight?
james_ford It means sex.
kate_austen I know.
james_ford Come on, Freckles, wait, now look, you need me to make ya a mix tape?
kate_austen Yeah, why don't you do that.
hugo_reyes Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. What do we need Jin for?
desmond_hume Because he was there with us.
hugo_reyes On the beach, when I find the cable.
hugo_reyes Here it is!
desmond_hume That's right.
hugo_reyes In one of your puzzle flashes.
desmond_hume Aye.
hugo_reyes So, if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about.
desmond_hume That'd be the long and short of it. But I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
hugo_reyes Watch the master.
jinsoo_kwon Camping?
hugo_reyes Yeah, you know, like sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach. Marshmallows.
jinsoo_kwon Camping.
jinsoo_kwon Yes.
hugo_reyes Everybody likes marshmallows.
desmond_hume Good man. Get food, water.
hugo_reyes Where are you going?
desmond_hume We need one more.
charlie_pace How daft do you think I am? This isn't a camping trip. You've had another one of your visions, haven't you? What was it this time?
desmond_hume Someone's coming to the Island.
charlie_pace Coming? As in someone who's not already here, how the hell is that gonna happen?
desmond_hume Can't tell ya.
charlie_pace It's got nothing to do with me?
desmond_hume Well, you're a part of it, yeah. As are Jin and Hurley.
charlie_pace Right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.
desmond_hume Well, that's not gonna happen. Not this time.
charlie_pace Can I bring my guitar?
desmond_hume Absolutely.
charlie_pace Alright, I'm in. You had me worried there for a second.
hugo_reyes This is it.
desmond_hume But, how can you tell?
hugo_reyes 'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle.
desmond_hume Where is it then?
jinsoo_kwon 이거지?
hugo_reyes Way to go, dude!
hugo_reyes Here it is!
hugo_reyes Just one thing, last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death-trap things.
desmond_hume Cut her down!
desmond_hume We're not going in the jungle, well, not yet. It's getting late, so we'll, er, we'll camp here the night.
jinsoo_kwon Camp.
charlie_pace So when do they get here? Your mysterious someone.
desmond_hume Soon.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 You do realize you are free to talk again, Brother Desmond.
desmond_hume Used to being quiet, I suppose.
desmond_hume Moriah. I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here, interesting.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 And why is that brother?
desmond_hume Well, Moriah's the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. It's not exactly the most... festive locale, is it?
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 And yet God spared Isaac.
desmond_hume Well, one might argue then, God may not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Well, then it wouldn't have been much of a test, would it brother? Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 2 Brother Desmond. Brother Desmond. I met this man waiting at the gates, he says he needs to have a word with you.
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Sorry, sir.
desmond_hume Forgive me, brother.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen The oatmeal's awesome.
dr_jack_shephard It is, huh?
kate_austen It's strange, huh?
dr_jack_shephard What's that?
kate_austen Being back. Not... looking for a way out of a cage. Not... finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again. I almost don't know what to do with myself.
dr_jack_shephard Well, enjoy it, I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough.
kate_austen Well, my big dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes, in the ocean.
dr_jack_shephard Be careful.
kate_austen I'll try.
dr_jack_shephard Erm, can I borrow that spoon?
kate_austen Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Thanks. Good night.
kate_austen Yeah, good night.
james_ford What, my doorbell busted again? What the hell are you doing?
kate_austen Shut up and don't talk.
james_ford You crying?
kate_austen I said shut up.
james_ford You got it.
jinsoo_kwon '하느님, 감사합니다. 저는 갈고리 손인줄 알고 무서웠어요.' 그러니까 그 남자가 웃으면서 이 말 했지. '걱정 마세요, 소녀 아가씨. 내 갈고리 손은 니 애비 머리 속에 아직도... shout 박혀 있다!'
hugo_reyes Dude, I love the part about the bird. It was a bird right?
jinsoo_kwon You.
hugo_reyes Me? OK, erm, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra..
jinsoo_kwon Chupa...?
hugo_reyes Yeah, like a bear with spines...
desmond_hume Thanks.
charlie_pace Who's that?
desmond_hume Her name's Penny.
charlie_pace That's not bad, Des. Not bad at all. So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?
desmond_hume Because I'm a coward.
charlie_pace Sorry.
desmond_hume You and me both pal. You know, I tried to run away from her, and she, she tracked me down. With enough money and determination, you can find anyone, she said. And I used to wake up at nights, thinking if she actually meant it, that she never gave up, that maybe she's spent the last three years looking for me.
hugo_reyes What's that?
charlie_pace Is that a helicopter?
jinsoo_kwon Rescue!
hugo_reyes Uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?
desmond_hume No.
hugo_reyes We gotta go out there.
charlie_pace Out there?
hugo_reyes Well, yeah.
charlie_pace In what?
hugo_reyes Well, we gotta do something.
jinsoo_kwon Look.
desmond_hume Oh my god.
jinsoo_kwon Pallet.
hugo_reyes Nah, dude, it's not a food drop, you saw the beacon thing, someone like ejected.
charlie_pace Yeah, but that was a helicopter, you can't eject from a helicopter.
hugo_reyes Well, maybe they jumped. All that matters is that they're here.
charlie_pace They, how do we even know it's a person?
hugo_reyes 'Cause he said someone was coming.
charlie_pace Where you going?
desmond_hume Out to where it fell. Come on, let's go.
charlie_pace No, whoa, slow down. We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
desmond_hume Yes we are.
charlie_pace Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death-trap? Now, it's going to be light in two hours, we'll wait until then.
desmond_hume She can't wait.
charlie_pace She?
desmond_hume They. Whoever it is... could be hurt. We have to go, all four of us, now.
charlie_pace Why?
desmond_hume Because that's the way its supposed to happen.
charlie_pace Right, well, I guess, it's supposed to happen without me.
desmond_hume We'll leave at first light then. Together.
charlie_pace Terrific.
desmond_hume Is your sister in?
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Leave. Now.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Let him be, Derek.
desmond_hume Hello, Ruth.
ruth So you're a monk now, are ya?
desmond_hume Well, technically, I'm still what they call a novice, 'til the abbey...
ruth Why are you here, Desmond?
desmond_hume Well, now that my initiation's done, I felt like I owed you an explanation.
ruth Desmond. You can never begin to explain what you did. You left one week before the wedding, everything was planned, bought and paid for. You just disappeared completely.
desmond_hume I had a calling.
ruth We dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup.
desmond_hume OK, yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe, and I... I raised my eyes, and I asked, am I doing the right thing, and that's the last thing I remember. And when I woke up, I was lying on my back in the street, and I dunno how I got there, and... there was this man standing over me, Ruth. And he reached out his hand, and he said to me, "Can I help you brother?". And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied round his waist, and... I looked at him... and I knew. I knew... I was supposed to go with him. I was supposed to leave everything that mattered behind, sacrifice all of it... for a greater calling.
ruth Well, it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep wouldn't you? Next time you want to break up with someone, Des, don't join a monastery. Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared.
dr_jack_shephard You a doctor or a carpenter?
dr_juliet_burke What, your dad never taught you to use a hammer?
dr_jack_shephard No, my dad taught me how to drink.
dr_juliet_burke Oh, at least it's something.
james_ford Hope I'm not interrupting. You two arguing over who's your favourite Other?
dr_jack_shephard What do you want, Sawyer?
james_ford Well, what I wanted, Doc, was to inform you there's been some developments since you were AWOL. So tell me...
james_ford ...How's your backhand?
dr_jack_shephard So where'd you get the table?
james_ford Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo. We don't play every hundred and eight minutes, the Island's gonna explode!
james_ford Finally, something I can beat you at.
dr_jack_shephard You know, considering I haven't played since I was 12, I wouldn't be too proud. What's that, 18th point?
james_ford It's kinda strange, huh? Being back.
james_ford Something funny?
dr_jack_shephard Er, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night.
james_ford She did huh.
dr_jack_shephard She did.
dr_jack_shephard Nineteenth point.
james_ford So you guys ate together, huh?
dr_jack_shephard No, Juliet and I had dinner together last night.
james_ford Huh.
dr_jack_shephard Best two out of three?
james_ford You got it.
charlie_pace So what's next?
desmond_hume Next?
charlie_pace Yeah, you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky. Now what? Maybe I can help you find--
desmond_hume That's it, there is no next. We find the beacon.
charlie_pace Why you lying to me mate?
desmond_hume Look, mate. I've saved your life three times now. If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. Let's move.
hugo_reyes Dude, seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.
desmond_hume Actually you're not. And if you don't get a move on, we're not gonna make it before nightfall—
charlie_pace Hey.
charlie_pace Look at this.
jinsoo_kwon 이건 도대체 어디서 난 거야?
charlie_pace It can't be Rousseau's. If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now.
desmond_hume Don't move.
hugo_reyes What are you doing? Ow. Ah, ahh!!!
hugo_reyes Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?
jinsoo_kwon Walkie-talkie!
hugo_reyes No, dude. That's a satellite phone.
hugo_reyes Crap, it's dead.
charlie_pace Shocker.
desmond_hume Oh my god.
hugo_reyes Is that you? And who is she?
charlie_pace That would be Penny.
kate_austen What's this?
james_ford Your mixtape.
james_ford Well, you gonna take it or ain't ya?
kate_austen The best of Phil Collins, huh?
james_ford Don't get picky. And if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it.
kate_austen Thanks, James.
james_ford So why'd you jump me last night?
kate_austen What?
james_ford Was it 'cause you saw the Doc hanging out with Juliet?
kate_austen It is not like that.
james_ford It's not? You ain't gotta use me Freckles, all you gotta do is ask.
charlie_pace You think it's her, don't you?
desmond_hume Who?
charlie_pace Your girl. Penny. You think its actually her who bailed out the helicopter.
desmond_hume Earlier I hoped it. Now I know it.
charlie_pace Why didn't you tell us?
desmond_hume Would you come if I had?
charlie_pace Of course. Why wouldn't I?
desmond_hume I didn't wanna tell you because... I didn't want anything to change.
charlie_pace Fair enough. Look, if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued, why would we want to change anything, right?
desmond_hume Right.
desmond_hume Right.
hugo_reyes Thanks for the heads up about bringing an umbrella, dude.
desmond_hume Well it's a grand old team to play for, and it's a grand old team to see. And if you know your history, it's...
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Brother Desmond. What are you doing?
desmond_hume Well, I believe I'm... getting pissed on our lovely wine.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over a hundred quid. We've only bottled a hundred and eight cases this year.
desmond_hume Well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it?
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 We've also taken a vow of charity.
desmond_hume Right.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Something tells me, Desmond, that you're not cut out to be a monk.
desmond_hume Well... ah, you know, I, I've had a tough week. I'm sorry for the wine. I'll take the penance.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond.
desmond_hume Brother Desmond.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Not any more.
desmond_hume Are you firing me?
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 I am indeed.
desmond_hume You can't do that, I heard the call.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you were meant to end up. I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond. Bigger plans—
desmond_hume Oh aye, I'm sure he does.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 He does! You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward.
desmond_hume Hey. What am I supposed to do now?
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Whatever comes next.
jinsoo_kwon Who's Penny?
hugo_reyes She's a chick Desmond used to date. And now he thinks she fell from the sky. So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued... Dude, even if I spoke Korean, it wouldn't make any sense.
desmond_hume Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. She might be hurt.
hugo_reyes I'm moving as fast as I can. In case you haven't noticed dude, I'm not exactly the Flash.
charlie_pace The Flash is pathetic.
hugo_reyes You got something against the fastest man alive?
charlie_pace You're insane, mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
hugo_reyes Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by the Flash.
charlie_pace But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
hugo_reyes Uh, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
charlie_pace Oohh vibration, and what would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
hugo_reyes Well, no smashing allowed.
charlie_pace No flying, no smashing... any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite ballet slippers...
charlie_pace The hell?
desmond_hume Ahh, Charlie, duck!
hugo_reyes Dude.
jinsoo_kwon This way.
desmond_hume No, the beacon fell this side of the rise.
jinsoo_kwon No, there.
hugo_reyes How about we split up? Me and Charlie go that way, you and Jin go round, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there.
charlie_pace Uh, you and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.
charlie_pace You said "duck."
desmond_hume Sorry.
charlie_pace You shouted "duck." You knew, even before we set off. You knew all this time, didn't you?
desmond_hume Aye.
charlie_pace Well, then why didn't you say anything?
desmond_hume Because if I'd told you the truth, you wouldn't have come!
charlie_pace Oh, and you needed me to come. 'Cause I was part of your vision. You thought that the only way you could get your girl back was if I took an arrow in the head. You would have sacrificed me!
desmond_hume If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.
charlie_pace What's that supposed to mean?
desmond_hume It means it's bloody pointless. I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? Its just gonna keep happening again and again, maybe that's the point, eh? Maybe it's a test.
charlie_pace Test?
desmond_hume Like God testing Abraham, except I failed, because I changed what I saw.
jinsoo_kwon 빨리 와, 찾았어!
jinsoo_kwon 우리 하는 말 들려요?
hugo_reyes Hey! Hey, can you hear me?!
jinsoo_kwon Hello! 괜찮아?
hugo_reyes Dude, she's not moving.
desmond_hume I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 I was afraid you'd leave without saying goodbye.
desmond_hume No.
desmond_hume I nearly took this with me.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 If you're not in a hurry, Brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours; he can give you a ride. That is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 All 10 cases are ready to go. Desmond there is just getting the last one.
penelope_widmore Thank you, and my father sent the check in advance.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Please thank him for his generous donation. Always a pleasure to see you.
MONK#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Goodbye Desmond.
penelope_widmore I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not, we'll put the rest in the front. Is that alright?
desmond_hume Absolutely.
desmond_hume You better drive safe, Miss. This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year.
penelope_widmore Is that so?
desmond_hume Aye, it's 'cause the monks are lazy.
desmond_hume Yeah, its easier making grape jelly than wine.
penelope_widmore And how do you know so much about monks?
desmond_hume Cause I'm an ex-monk.
penelope_widmore Really?
desmond_hume As of last night. I was fired.
desmond_hume Oh, it wasn't that funny.
penelope_widmore I'm sorry, I've never, I... I didn't know monks could be fired.
desmond_hume Oh, they can. You know, I was told under no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up. It's just a... step along a path. You know, God allegedly has bigger plans for me.
penelope_widmore Something tells me you don't entirely believe that.
desmond_hume I suspect that's because I don't.
penelope_widmore Well, maybe they're right. I mean, just think, if you hadn't got fired, we wouldn't have met, and then, how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle?
desmond_hume Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
penelope_widmore Not yet.
penelope_widmore I mean, of course, if an ex-monk already has plans, then...
desmond_hume You know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers.
penelope_widmore Well, in that case I'm Penelope. Penny.
desmond_hume Desmond. Very nice to meet you, Penny.
hugo_reyes She's alive!
desmond_hume Stand back! Get away from her! I'm here, I'm here, Penny.
charlie_pace Just, be careful.
desmond_hume Just get off, Charlie! Sorry Penny, I'm sorry.
WOMAN#unknown#Lost.Season03.Episode17 Desmond...
