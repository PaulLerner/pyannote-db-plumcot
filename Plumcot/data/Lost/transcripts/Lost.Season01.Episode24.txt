charlie_pace Claire, everybody's leaving.
claire_littleton Okay, well, I can't go anywhere, alright? I've got the baby, and I'm so tired, I can't carry him -- now he's wet, there's sand everywhere, I don't have anymore nappies.
charlie_pace Why don't you let me help.
claire_littleton No, nobody ever taught me how to do this, okay?
charlie_pace Claire, it's going to be okay.
claire_littleton Oh, why do people keep telling me that? Are they the ones with the baby?
sayid_jarrah We've got to get there before sundown. Once you reach the caves, stay there. The rest of us will be right behind you.
charlie_pace Sayid. I need a gun. Look, I know Jack gave them to you. I want one right now. I have to protect Claire.
sayid_jarrah Rousseau said the Others wouldn't be here until nightfall.
charlie_pace Rousseau is certifiable. What if they show up before then and-
sayid_jarrah The last time you handled a sidearm-
charlie_pace I killed a murderer. I did us all a favor.
sayid_jarrah Charlie, you're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons.
charlie_pace But you're not here all the time. You can't protect Claire. Look, I need a gun!
sayid_jarrah If you really want to help Claire, get her packed, carry her child to the caves. That's what she needs.
hugo_reyes How exactly does something like this happen?
danielle_rousseau Are you on the same Island as I am?
hugo_reyes I guess that explains it.
dr_leslie_arzt Hold on, wait, hold on. Hold, wait. What are we a couple miles inland? A tsunami probably swept it here, huh, right?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, hey, where are you going?
danielle_rousseau Explosives are in the hold of the ship.
dr_jack_shephard Rousseau, wait.
danielle_rousseau I did what you asked. You need dynamite, you don't need me.
john_locke Let her go, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Who's going to lead us back?
john_locke I'll lead us back.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it. You heard her -- the explosives are in the hold. Let's go.
dr_leslie_arzt Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite, not explore some ghost ship, you think I'm go-
dr_jack_shephard Alright, just stay out here.
hugo_reyes Uh, I'm going to stay out here and hang with Arnzt.
john_locke Slaves. This ship must have been in route to a mining colony -- probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa -- Mozambique.
kate_austen Jack, John, over here.
dr_leslie_arzt And then my 3rd wife, she says, get this, she says, "I didn't sign up for this." Now you tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean? What, am -- am I boring you?
hugo_reyes Huh?
dr_leslie_arzt You know what? I'm -- I'm sorry, I'm so... I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough to be part of your merry little band of adventurers.
hugo_reyes What?
dr_leslie_arzt I know a clique when I see it. I teach high school, pal-y. You know, you people think you're the only ones on this Island doing anything of value. I've got news for you. There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash. And we are all people, too.
hugo_reyes O-kay.
kate_austen You know what? We could probably get it open if I just-
dr_jack_shephard No, no, no, we should take it outside.
kate_austen Why? We don't even know if it's...
dr_jack_shephard You're not prying open a crate that says explosives on the side with a pick axe, Kate.
john_locke Yeah, I agree with Jack -- take it outside, open it there.
kate_austen Okay.
dr_jack_shephard I got it. You mind showing us the way?
dr_leslie_arzt And it's not just the teenagers, either. You know, the gym teachers -- you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria? No. They do not.
hugo_reyes Dude, this is all in your head.
dr_leslie_arzt Really? Then you explain to me why Kate gets the best pieces of wreckage to build her shelter? And the Korean guy? Does he catch fish for everybody on the Island? No, he does not. He doesn't. And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here. Now, would mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs because I can't figure...
dr_leslie_arzt What the hell are you people doing?! Wait, wait, stop, stop, right where you are. Alright, I want you to put that down carefully. Put it down carefully. Put it gently, gently. Damn it, carefully, gently, gently. Alright, now get out of there. Come away from there. C'mon, get out. Move away from it.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell are you doing?
dr_leslie_arzt Shhh. Be quiet. Do any of you have any idea what happens to dynamite in 90+ degree heat, huh? So you know? Any of you? It sweats nitroglycerin. Whoa, hey, what you doing? Did I ask you to come closer? Dynamite is nitroglycerin stabilized by clay. Nitroglycerin is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man. Hey, Kate give me your shirt. Now, princess, give me your shirt. I need to wrap the dynamite. Just throw it to me, right here. Be careful, c'mon, hurry up. Okay, good, now back up, back up, back up. Just back up. Get out of my way. Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin? Probably not -- because he blew his freaking face off. His lab assistant came into the room, saw that his mentor detonated, and he said, "Huh, I guess this stuff does work." Alright, we're not going to take any more of this stuff than we need because nitroglycerin is extremely temperamental, so we-
hugo_reyes Dude.
sunhwa_kwon 반으로 자를까요? 여기요. 어머 어떡해 미안해 미안, 뜨겁죠?
jinsoo_kwon 괜찮아, 괜찮아. 됐어. 화장실이 어디 있어?
sunhwa_kwon 저쪽... 저쪽에 있네요.
airport_cop COP Sorry for the inconvenience.
sayid_jarrah I'm sure you are.
airport_cop COP Sir, your bag was unattended.
sayid_jarrah Am I free to go?
airport_cop COP Yes, sir.
sayid_jarrah Good, I have a plane to catch.
hawaiian_shirt SHIRT Hey, could you hand me a paper towel there, bud? A paper towel -- this one's broken.
hawaiian_shirt SHIRT Oh, oh, you don't speak English. Sorry.
hawaiian_shirt SHIRT 아, 페이퍼 타올이 여기 있네.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐라고요?
hawaiian_shirt SHIRT 자네의 장인이신 백 회장님 밑에서 일하고 있지.
jinsoo_kwon 여태까지 날 미행한거야?
hawaiian_shirt SHIRT 물론. 그리고 자네가 도망가려는 것도 알고 있지. 자네는 남은 시계를 캘리포니아에 있는 백 회장님 친구에게 전하라고. 만약 그렇게 못하면 자네는 그녀를 잃게 되겠지. 넌 자유의 몸의 아니야. 여태까지 그래왔고 앞으로도 계속.
walt_lloyd Dad, look!
michael_dawson How does a place this big never get discovered?
james_ford Don't know, but you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there.
michael_dawson Yeah, you build your resort. I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever.
walt_lloyd What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay?
michael_dawson I hope so, buddy. At least until we can get them some help.
james_ford Redemption song is all I'll ever have...
michael_dawson You singing Bob Marley?
james_ford No. Why, you like Bob Marley?
michael_dawson Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?
shannon_rutherford Damn it!
sayid_jarrah Do you really need all that?
shannon_rutherford Yeah, I do.
sayid_jarrah Why do you have to bring so much?
shannon_rutherford Don't you have a hike to lead?
shannon_rutherford I'm fine.
sayid_jarrah These belong to your brother.
shannon_rutherford I need these things. I can't just leave them. What are we doing? Hiding? As if they won't find us. It's just -- it's too much. It's too much.
sayid_jarrah It won't be too much if I carry it for you. Now come on, I have a hike to lead.
kate_austen You okay?
hugo_reyes That was messed up.
kate_austen Yeah.
hugo_reyes He just...exploded in front of us. He was just trying to help. This is because I came.
kate_austen What?
hugo_reyes I'm kind of bad luck.
kate_austen Hey, it was an accident.
hugo_reyes An accident, yeah.
dr_jack_shephard Locke, we should think about this.
john_locke Alright.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe this isn't the best way.
john_locke It's the only way, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard How many do we need to blow the Hatch?
john_locke Two should take care of the hinge, three to be safe.
dr_jack_shephard Safe?
john_locke I'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it. You ever play "Operation"?
dr_jack_shephard Sure. Don't touch the sides.
john_locke I -- I always got nailed on the funny bone. Bzzzt!
dr_jack_shephard You like to play games, John?
john_locke Absolutely.
charlie_pace Okay, I know we're in a rush to escape to the caves, so I solved the turniphead transport issue. This is just a blanket from the plane. And then there's a piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo. Here you go. It's a Bjorn.
claire_littleton A bjorn?
charlie_pace Bjorn -- it's Dutch for baby carrier.
claire_littleton Yeah, thanks.
charlie_pace That's okay.
claire_littleton Thank you.
charlie_pace Oh, that's okay.
claire_littleton Thanks. I'll just put him in there.
charlie_pace It's really...
danielle_rousseau Sayid! Where is he?
charlie_pace Rousseau! What?
danielle_rousseau Sayid? Where is he?
charlie_pace He already left.
danielle_rousseau I need him now.
charlie_pace Jack and Kate...
danielle_rousseau There's no time. Where is Sayid?
charlie_pace Alright, just calm down, okay. I'll get him for you. Stay here, alright.
claire_littleton Okay.
charlie_pace Sayid! Sayid!
claire_littleton What happened out there?
danielle_rousseau What is his name? The child. What is his name?
claire_littleton Oh, I haven't named him yet.
danielle_rousseau May I hold him?
claire_littleton Why do you need Sayid?
danielle_rousseau You don't want me to hold him.
claire_littleton No, I just fed him. I don't think it's a good idea, okay?
danielle_rousseau Please.
claire_littleton Why did I do that? Why did I scratch you?
lily What's going on?
charlie_pace My flight, my flight to LA leaves in a couple of hours -- so I've got to get moving, you know.
lily You want to do one more bump for the road?
charlie_pace It's all gone. We did it all last night. I have some champagne.
lily You've got to have some left.
charlie_pace Mm-mm. No. It's done. I'll look you up next time I'm in Sydney, okay? I'll send you an autographed copy of my CD and then you can listen to it whenever you want.
lily I don't want your piece of crap CD from your piece of crap band.
charlie_pace Last night in the bar you said you were a fan.
lily Fine. I'm a huge fan. Drivethru is the best damned band ever. Now just give me a bump because I know you've got some.
charlie_pace Shaft. Drive Shaft.
lily What's that in your hand?
charlie_pace Nothing.
lily Holding out on me?
charlie_pace Holding out on you? No, I'm not holding out...
lily Give it to me.
charlie_pace Give you what? I'm not holding anything.
lily Give it to me.
charlie_pace I've got nothing in my hand!
lily Give it to me!
lily Get up.
charlie_pace Get off.
lily Get up. Let it go. Let it go.
charlie_pace What are you, crazy?
lily Let it go.
charlie_pace Get off!
lily Let it go!
charlie_pace Get off me.
lily You're pathetic. You're pathetic.
charlie_pace Sayid! Sayid, Rousseau's on the beach. She needs you.
sayid_jarrah Rousseau? What for?
charlie_pace I don't know.
sunhwa_kwon Help! Someone! Help!
charlie_pace My god!
sayid_jarrah What happened?
sunhwa_kwon Her head.
claire_littleton Where -- where is my baby?
charlie_pace Oh, my god.
claire_littleton Is he alright?
sayid_jarrah Rousseau, was she alone?
claire_littleton Did she take my baby? Did she take my baby?!
sayid_jarrah Claire, which way did she go?
claire_littleton I don't know! She took my baby!
charlie_pace This is your fault! You brought her into the camp! If you had just given me a gun!
sayid_jarrah Do not hit me again. You want to waste time assigning blame? There's plenty to go around. She has a head start. If we leave now we can catch her.
charlie_pace How are we going to do that?!
sayid_jarrah Because I know where she's going.
claire_littleton I want my baby!
dr_jack_shephard We can carry all the sticks in my pack. The more insulation we stuff in the better.
john_locke I think we should split them up.
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke It's not smart to keep it all together. So, we split them up. If we need 3 sticks to blow the hinge then we should bring 6 -- 3 and 3 -- failsafe, in case one of us...
dr_jack_shephard You and me, then.
kate_austen No, I'm -- I'm taking one.
dr_jack_shephard It's not going to happen, no.
kate_austen This is why I came.
dr_jack_shephard Then, you wasted a trip.
kate_austen I need to do this.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, no one owes anyone anything.
kate_austen I'm carrying one.
dr_jack_shephard We're done here.
kate_austen This is not your decision.
dr_jack_shephard Kate, yes it is.
john_locke We'll draw straws. They're coming. We don't have time to argue about who gets to risk their life, so -- we'll let fate decide.
kate_austen Works for me.
dr_jack_shephard What about you? You want to carry some dynamite, too? What?
hugo_reyes You got some... Arnzt on you.
john_locke Short sticks carry the packs. Looks like it's me and you, Kate.
walt_lloyd So, what's this stuff even do?
michael_dawson Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening. And if there's anything out there, we'll see it on this radar screen here.
michael_dawson Here we go. C'mon, someone find us.
walt_lloyd Those are the messages everybody wrote.
james_ford Sure are.
walt_lloyd They're private.
james_ford Yep. I, for one, never knew how much Tracy missed her hubby and 2 kids back in Fresno. Yet she's sleeping next to good old Scott to keep her warm at night.
walt_lloyd That's Steve. Scott's dead.
james_ford Whatever. It's alright, Kazoo, we've got to keep ourselves entertained. Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a 160 million dollars to leave to his mom.
walt_lloyd How would you like it if I read yours?
james_ford You can't read mine because I didn't write one.
walt_lloyd Why not?
james_ford Because the only one I ever wrote is to the man I'm going to kill.
walt_lloyd Why you going to kill him?
james_ford Because I need to.
walt_lloyd Why?
james_ford Because!
charlie_pace Are you bloody joking?! Why would she go for the black smoke?! Isn't that where the Others are supposed to be?!
sayid_jarrah The Others are precisely why she would go there. Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago. They took something from her, and now she believes she has something that they want.
charlie_pace She's making a trade?
sayid_jarrah I believe she is, yes.
charlie_pace That's insane. She's insane.
sayid_jarrah Don't try to apply reason to her actions. She's a mother who lost her child, just like Claire. This isn't about revenge. Don't make it personal.
claire_littleton I'm coming with you.
sayid_jarrah That's not a good idea, Claire.
claire_littleton This is my baby, okay?! I let her take him!
charlie_pace Hey, hey.
claire_littleton Don't tell me what to do, okay!
charlie_pace Calm down!
claire_littleton I am going to come with you! This is my fault and I'm coming and you can't stop me!
charlie_pace It's alright, Claire.
claire_littleton Get him back, Charlie. Get Aaron back.
charlie_pace Aaron?
claire_littleton Please, get him back.
charlie_pace Claire, I will get him back. Promise.
michael_dawson Hey, you want something to eat? I guess that's a no, then. If you're worried about Vincent, he going to be okay, man. Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time. -- Alright, I've got to call work, right over there. Don't go anywhere, okay?
michael_dawson No, I live in a studio apartment. I've got to be out the door in the morning for work by 5am. Who's going to watch him? How's he going to get to school? What's he going to do after school? I can't do this, ma. -- You know, I was -- listen, I was thinking -- I was thinking maybe you could take him. -- Look, ma, if it's a question of money, I... What am I supposed to do with him?! He's not supposed to be mine! He was never part of the plan. Yeah, I -- thanks a lot. Hey, man, I was, uh...
walt_lloyd I need new batteries.
michael_dawson Hey, want to try?
walt_lloyd What?
michael_dawson C'mon, come here. You drive for a while.
walt_lloyd Really?
michael_dawson Absolutely. Okay now, look, the most important part of this boat is the rudder. It's how you steer. You turn it gradually -- nothing sharp, okay. Push it this way.
walt_lloyd Where are we going?
michael_dawson Look, so, we're going approximately North by Northeast. So, hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane, or we hit some land.
walt_lloyd What do I aim for?
michael_dawson See that cloud on the horizon, right there?
walt_lloyd Yeah.
michael_dawson You aim for that.
walt_lloyd Yep.
michael_dawson Okay.
walt_lloyd Got it. -- How come you and my mom didn't stay together?
michael_dawson We tried. It just didn't work out, so -- our lives, our interests -- we just went in different directions.
walt_lloyd How come I never saw you?
michael_dawson Because your Mom didn't want me to. She did what she thought was best for you.
walt_lloyd She was wrong.
jinsoo_kwon Rudder!
michael_dawson Hey, we hit a log! We lost the rudder.
jinsoo_kwon Rudder! Rudder!
michael_dawson We're losing it! It's sinking!
michael_dawson Stop the boat. Stop the boat. Just pull the sail down. Right.
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Sawyer! Sawyer! Give me the rope.
jinsoo_kwon Rope!
michael_dawson Sawyer!
james_ford It's sinking!
james_ford I can't reach it!
jinsoo_kwon 다시 던져봐.
michael_dawson Got it?
jinsoo_kwon 먼저 묶고!
michael_dawson Tie it around the rudder, we'll pull you in!
michael_dawson C'mon, buddy. You just saved our asses, buddy.
michael_dawson Here's your shirt. You should put that back on before you burn.
kate_austen Sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, luck of the draw.
john_locke The sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take. If we want to get back to the Hatch we're going to have to hustle.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, this is how we do this. I'll lead -- Kate, you're right behind me, then Hurley. John, you bring up the rear. If you start to see me heading the wrong way-
john_locke We should stagger our formation -- keep a safe distance from each other.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, we stagger. If anyone hears anything or sees anything...
hugo_reyes Like the security system that eats people?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, like that. You two, you take your packs off, you put them down and you run. You got it?
kate_austen Got it.
john_locke Yes, sir.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, let's do this.
sunhwa_kwon He died bravely.
shannon_rutherford What?
sunhwa_kwon Your brother.
shannon_rutherford Yeah. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon Do you think all this -- all we've been through -- do you think we're being punished?
shannon_rutherford Punished for what?
sunhwa_kwon Things we did before -- the secrets we kept, the lies we told.
shannon_rutherford Who do you think is punishing us?
sunhwa_kwon Fate.
claire_littleton No one's punishing us. There's no such thing as fate.
sayid_jarrah Are you okay?
charlie_pace I'm fine, keep going.
sayid_jarrah We're losing the light. Try to keep up.
charlie_pace I'm coming. Sayid! Sayid! -- Sayid!
sayid_jarrah Over here.
charlie_pace Sayid?!
sayid_jarrah You can barely breathe. We're going to rest.
charlie_pace Rest? She's out there right now...
sayid_jarrah In another mile you're going to collapse. We're going to take a break.
charlie_pace Is this where Boone fell?
sayid_jarrah The plane was up there.
charlie_pace Where did it come from?
sayid_jarrah Based on the maps inside -- Nigeria.
charlie_pace Anyone on board?
sayid_jarrah Two men dressed as priests.
charlie_pace Priests?
sayid_jarrah Drug runners in disguise. The plane was loaded with heroin. Alright, now we go.
hugo_reyes So, dude? What do you think is inside of that hatch thing?
john_locke What do you think is inside it?
hugo_reyes Stacks of TV dinners from the 50's, or something. And TVs with cable, some cell phones, clean socks, soap, Twinkies -- you know, for dessert, after the TV dinners. Twinkies keep for, like, 8000 years, man.
john_locke I like Twinkies, too.
hugo_reyes C'mon, really, what do you think is inside?
john_locke Hope. I think hope's inside.
hugo_reyes Whoever named this place Dark Territory? Genius.
kate_austen Yeah, I saw it. We've got to get out of here.
dr_jack_shephard Locke! What are you doing?
dr_jack_shephard Locke!
dr_jack_shephard Locke!
kate_austen Jack! Jack!
kate_austen Oh, my god.
dr_jack_shephard I need the dynamite. No, no, it's in my pack. Just go get it! Hurry, go! John, John.
john_locke Let me go. Just let me go. I'll be alright.
dr_jack_shephard No!
john_locke Let me go. I'll be alright.
kate_austen Hang on. I've got it.
dr_jack_shephard Careful unwrapping it.
kate_austen Alright.
dr_jack_shephard Now throw it in.
john_locke No!
kate_austen It'll blow us up.
dr_jack_shephard Just hurry, I can't hold him!
john_locke Don't do this, Kate!
dr_jack_shephard Throw it in -- now, Kate!
michael_dawson Hey, your wife -- wife made this for you?
jinsoo_kwon Sun.
michael_dawson She sounded it out, huh -- so you could learn English?
jinsoo_kwon Yes.
michael_dawson Yeah, I wish she had made one for me. So what words are in here? English words -- what can you say?
jinsoo_kwon Ah, starboard, aft, port, sail, eat.
michael_dawson Yeah, right. She did you well. I hope you know how lucky you are, man. Back in business? Alrighty. Oh, hey, it's yours.
jinsoo_kwon You.
michael_dawson What?
jinsoo_kwon You.
michael_dawson Um, thank -- you. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon I made you some tea.
claire_littleton I'm fine. Thanks.
sunhwa_kwon Aaron is a beautiful name. What does it mean?
claire_littleton I don't know what Aaron means.
sunhwa_kwon They will bring him back.
claire_littleton Don't say that.
sunhwa_kwon They will.
claire_littleton How do you know that?
sunhwa_kwon Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back.
charlie_pace There!
sayid_jarrah Charlie, wait.
sayid_jarrah Charlie! See, let me see.
charlie_pace It's bleeding.
sayid_jarrah We need to put pressure on it.
charlie_pace Okay. Ow.
sayid_jarrah There.
charlie_pace Ow. Animal, what is she...
sayid_jarrah Keep the pressure on, like this.
charlie_pace Ow! Ow! Ow!
sayid_jarrah She's been here for 16 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. It's too deep. It's bleeding too much. You're going to have to go back.
charlie_pace No, I'm not going back! You're going to have to fix it.
sayid_jarrah I'm not a doctor.
charlie_pace You're a soldier! What do people do when you get wounded?! I'm not going back without that baby, Sayid.
sayid_jarrah Don't move.
charlie_pace Gunpowder?
sayid_jarrah Remove the towel and tilt your head back. Remove the towel.
charlie_pace This is because I hit you, isn't it?
sayid_jarrah This is not going to be pleasant. You ready?
charlie_pace Yeah.
sayid_jarrah 1-2-3.
hugo_reyes Oh, man.
hugo_reyes I need my car. 20 minutes? Look, I can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday is tomorrow.
charlie_pace Some of us have a bloody flight to make!
hugo_reyes Excuse me, coming through. Excuse me.
hugo_reyes No, no, no!
hugo_reyes Excuse me, coming through, excuse me, excuse me. Look out, excuse me.
hugo_reyes Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. Or, today -- I don't know. I don't really get the whole time change thing, but I've got to make that flight.
ticket_agent AGENT I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You're confirmed for seat 20G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.
hugo_reyes What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.
ticket_agent AGENT Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?
hugo_reyes Fine, whatever. I'll buy the one next to it.
ticket_agent AGENT Alrighty. Here are two together.
hugo_reyes Book it.
ticket_agent AGENT Uh-oh.
hugo_reyes Uh-oh, what uh-oh?
ticket_agent AGENT It appears that your flight is already boarding in the Oceanic international terminal. Well, this is the domestic terminal. I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.
hugo_reyes Excuse me, sorry. Sorry, this is an emergency. I've got to cut through. Excuse me, dude. Dude?
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
hugo_reyes You've got to let me in. No, you don't understand...
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
hugo_reyes This is...
security_agent AGENT Back of the line.
security_agent AGENT Next.
dr_leslie_arzt Now? You're taking the computer out now?
hugo_reyes Hey, old guy! I'll give you 500 bucks to borrow your scooter.
old_scooter_man SCOOTER MAN I just had a hip replacement. I need this thing.
hugo_reyes Okay, 1600 bucks.
hugo_reyes Hey, hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! I've got to get on this flight!
gate_attendant AGENT Sir, the jetway's closed.
hugo_reyes Please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane.
gate_attendant AGENT Alright, one second. Hunter, this is Jenna, we've got one more... ta. This is your lucky day.
hugo_reyes 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16...
kate_austen You say something?
hugo_reyes Nope.
kate_austen I thought I heard 23.
hugo_reyes Does that mean something to you?
kate_austen What?
hugo_reyes That number? 23?
kate_austen The guy who called the Feds on me, back in Australia, did it for a 23,000 dollar reward. Mean something to you?
hugo_reyes Nah, it's just a number. We better catch up -- can barely see them.
john_locke We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard If we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there, John?
john_locke What was what about?
dr_jack_shephard You asked me to let you go.
john_locke That's right.
dr_jack_shephard That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go.
john_locke It wasn't going to hurt me.
dr_jack_shephard No, John, it was going to kill you.
john_locke I seriously doubt that.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John. I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
john_locke I believe that I was being tested.
dr_jack_shephard Tested?
john_locke Yeah, tested. I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, and what does that make you?
john_locke Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
dr_jack_shephard Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
john_locke The Island. The Island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the Island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
dr_jack_shephard Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
john_locke Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
dr_jack_shephard And where does that path end, John?
john_locke The path ends at the Hatch. The Hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch.
dr_jack_shephard No, no, we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive.
john_locke Survival is all relative, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I don't believe in destiny.
john_locke Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
michael_dawson I turned it on a little while ago.
james_ford Sayid said every hour.
michael_dawson Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks. If that battery runs out...
james_ford The man said every hour.
james_ford Nothing.
michael_dawson 5 minutes, no more.
james_ford Aye, aye. You know what I like about you, Mike? You've got the patience of a saint.
michael_dawson Yeah? Why do you say that?
james_ford I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago.
michael_dawson You would, huh?
james_ford A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.
michael_dawson Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?
james_ford My daddy never got a chance to beat me. He shot himself when I was 8.
michael_dawson Is that why you want to die, man?
james_ford What?
michael_dawson Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out. Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else? The way I see it, there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die.
james_ford Well, I ain't no hero, Mike.
james_ford Is that what I think it is?
michael_dawson Something's out there.
gate_attendant AGENT I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers -- well, no one seems to know where it is right now. And unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.
john_locke There's not another flight until tomorrow.
gate_attendant AGENT Yes, I'm aware of that, sir, but there's nothing I can...
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 Look, I can get Michelle, we can carry him on. Would you mind if we carry you on?
john_locke No, that'll be fine.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 Here we go. Here's your seat.
JD#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 I'll get your bag, sir.
MICHELLE#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 If you need anything just press the call button.
john_locke Okay. Thank you.
john_locke Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.
hugo_reyes Me? Oh, okay. Got it.
dr_jack_shephard Be careful.
hugo_reyes Can I have the flashlight? Because, uh, the torch with the dynamite thing, not making a whole lot of sense to me.
john_locke Kate, you run the fuse, Jack and I will rig the charges.
kate_austen Okay.
charlie_pace What the hell is that?
sayid_jarrah There's no footprints, no tracks.
charlie_pace This is it? This is the black smoke? Where are they?
sayid_jarrah I don't know.
charlie_pace She's here.
sayid_jarrah Danielle!
charlie_pace You come out, right now!
sayid_jarrah Calm down.
sayid_jarrah Danielle! I can hear you, come out. Please, he needs his mother.
danielle_rousseau They were not here.
sayid_jarrah Danielle, you have to give us the baby.
danielle_rousseau I just wanted my Alex back. I thought if I gave them the baby...
sayid_jarrah It's okay. I know. It's okay.
charlie_pace I've got him. There never were any Others. You started the fires yourself!
danielle_rousseau No, I heard them whispering.
charlie_pace You're a nut job. You heard nothing!
danielle_rousseau I heard them say they were coming for the child. The Others said they were coming for the boy.
charlie_pace You're pathetic.
john_locke Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse.
dr_jack_shephard I'll do it.
kate_austen This is as far as it goes.
john_locke It's far enough. I'll light it. You take cover, there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley!
hugo_reyes Wait just a sec.
kate_austen So, what was that about back there?
dr_jack_shephard What was what about?
kate_austen Putting the dynamite in your pack.
dr_jack_shephard I made a judgment call.
kate_austen We drew straws.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry, I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us, Kate.
kate_austen You had no right to make that choice...
dr_jack_shephard Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me, Kate? That's your call. There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this, if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem. And I have to know that you've got my back.
kate_austen I've got your back.
john_locke Are we ready?
hugo_reyes Wait a sec, wait a sec.
hugo_reyes No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop, we can't do this! Stop! Wait! Stop we can't do this! Stop! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! We can't do this! We can't do this! Stop! Wait! You've got to stop it!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad! Stop! What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad! The Numbers are bad!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! Hurley stop!
hugo_reyes The Numbers are bad!
dr_jack_shephard Hurley! Hurley, you've got to get back!
james_ford It's closer. It's closer. Give me the damn flare gun.
michael_dawson Hold on a sec.
james_ford I'm telling you, it's closer. I'm telling you, look.
michael_dawson I know, okay. I've got one flare.
jinsoo_kwon 아무 것도 안 보여.
michael_dawson Okay, I know. You don't see anything. Okay.
james_ford What the hell are you expecting to see?! In case you haven't noticed, it's dark!
walt_lloyd What is it? Is it a ship?
michael_dawson We don't know, little man. We don't know.
jinsoo_kwon Starboard? Port?
michael_dawson Uh, Port. Port.
jinsoo_kwon 반대로 가는데?
michael_dawson Okay, what the hell am I supposed to do about it?
james_ford Hey, Han, you and Chewie want to slow down a second and talk to me here?! We have to fire the flare.
michael_dawson We don't know what it is. It could be anything -- a piece of floating junk. We don't even know if Sayid's radar works!!
james_ford Have you ever known that guy to fix something up that don't work?
walt_lloyd It's moving away.
james_ford Floating junk that knows how to steer, huh?
michael_dawson We're moving! It doesn't make-
james_ford Look, are you going to give me the damn gun, or am I going to have to take it?!
michael_dawson What are you going to do? Shoot me?
walt_lloyd It's almost gone. -- C'mon.
michael_dawson Please, god.
walt_lloyd It's coming back! It's coming back!
michael_dawson Are we glad to see you!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN What's going on?! What are you folks doing this far out here?!
michael_dawson We were, we were -- the plane crashed! We were on the Island for a month, man!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that?
michael_dawson We were on an Island -- oh, flight 815 -- hey, where are we?!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, it's a good thing we found you.
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah, we survived and there's a whole group of people on the...
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, ain't that something?
michael_dawson Yeah!
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Only, the thing is, we're going to have to take the boy.
michael_dawson What? What'd you say?
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN The boy, we're going to have to take him.
michael_dawson Hey, what the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Just give us the boy.
michael_dawson I'm not giving you anybody.
BEARDED#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode24 MAN Well, alright then.
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad!
michael_dawson No!
walt_lloyd Help me!
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd Help me! Dad! Please!
michael_dawson Waaaaaaaaaaalt! Waaaahahahaaalt! No! Walt!
