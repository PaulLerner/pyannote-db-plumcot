kate_austen You got a prescription for that?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. I wrote it myself.
kate_austen You look terrible.
dr_jack_shephard Well, thanks.
kate_austen What are those?
dr_jack_shephard Antibiotics. I just got a... a stomach bug.
kate_austen You should eat some crackers. Crackers always make me feel better.
kate_austen Why aren't they back from the boat yet, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Well, Sayid said the engine was down. My guess is they're trying to fix it and wondering why the hell they can't get in touch with us.
kate_austen And you're not worried?
dr_jack_shephard No. My gut says we're getting off this island.
kate_austen I thought your gut was sick.
bernard_nadler Help! I need some help! Help!
bernard_nadler Help! I need help! I need some help down here!
bernard_nadler The dog was barking. I didn't see him.
dr_jack_shephard Do you know who this is?
dr_daniel_faraday He was on our boat. He's the doctor.
hugo_reyes We're all gonna die.
james_ford Calm down, Chicken Little. The sky ain't falling just yet.
hugo_reyes This is exactly what he wants—to fight amongst ourselves. You're making a big mistake, dude.
john_locke It's his to make, Hugo. Let's get on with it.
james_ford Right... I'm attackin' Siberia.
james_ford Sorry.
hugo_reyes Can't believe you're just giving him Australia. Australia's the key to the whole game.
james_ford Says you.
martin_keamy Stop here. On your knees. Get on your knees.
martin_keamy Hey. Turn this thing off.
alex_rousseau P-please. There's a baby with them. Just promise you won't—
martin_keamy Turn the fence off.
alex_rousseau Okay. It's off.
AUTOMATED#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 FEMALE VOICE Code 14-J. Code 14-J.
hugo_reyes Who is it?
john_locke I think it's for Ben.
john_locke What's "code 14-J"?
ben_linus Where did you hear that?
john_locke The phone rang. I picked it up. A voice kept repeating, "code 14-J."
ben_linus We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, and we'll have better position on the tree lines.
john_locke What are you talking about?
ben_linus They're here.

ben_linus Hello.
ben_linus No, no, no, no. Wait.
RED#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09
GRAY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Look around! He doesn't have any trail.
RED#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Where did he come from? Fell from the sky?
ben_linus Wait. I can explain. D-do you speak English?
ben_linus Do you speak Arabic?
ben_linus Do you speak Turkish?
GRAY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Do not move!
ben_linus Sure. Sure.
ben_linus Ah. Okay. Okay, okay.
ben_linus This...
GRAY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 What is this?
GRAY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 What is this?
GRAY#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Surrender! Surrender!
ben_linus Oh, so you do speak English.
ben_linus Yah!
james_ford Let me guess. "14-J" ain't the code for the pizza boy.
ben_linus It's an early warning system.
john_locke Warning for what?
ben_linus Somebody tripped the panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured.
ben_linus How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?
john_locke Five minutes.
ben_linus Well, so much for our head start.
james_ford Hold up. If we're hunkerin' down, I gotta grab Frenchie and the kids.
ben_linus Don't bother. They're safe. I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday.
james_ford Away where?
james_ford Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.
ben_linus There's no time!
james_ford I'll make time.
ben_linus It's very important that you survive what's about to happen here, John. So I need you to stay close to me.
john_locke And why would I do that?
ben_linus Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance.
dr_jack_shephard His throat was slit.
dr_jack_shephard Know anything about that?
dr_daniel_faraday No. Uh, he was fine when I last saw him.
dr_jack_shephard Which was when?
dr_daniel_faraday When? "When" is kind of a relative term.
dr_charlotte_lewis We don't know anything about this.
dr_juliet_burke Any luck fixing the sat phone?
dr_daniel_faraday Uh, yeah. Sorry, no. The, uh, the mic was... smashed up pretty good. Best-case scenario, we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch. Beeps and boops.
bernard_nadler Well, yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?
dr_daniel_faraday If I had some strips of ferrous metal, uh, a 9-volt battery clip and some ... wiring.
kate_austen We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane.
dr_daniel_faraday Great.
kate_austen I'll show you where it is.
dr_jack_shephard Bernard, you got a second?
john_locke These people who are coming — you're scared of 'em, aren't you?
ben_linus That's right, John. I am.
hugo_reyes What's going on?
john_locke Get away from the window, Hugo.
hugo_reyes How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
ben_linus He's not.
james_ford Hey! You see if Claire left her house this morning?
doug What's going on? Why do you have that?
james_ford Just get back inside and wait until—
james_ford Get back inside!
james_ford Get inside!
james_ford Claire!
james_ford Claire!
james_ford CLAIRE!
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Good afternoon, sir.
ben_linus Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Of course, sir. Is this your first time in Tunisia?
ben_linus No. But it's been a while.
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Your name?
ben_linus I'm actually a preferred guest. It should be under "Dean Moriarty."
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 May I help you with anything else?
ben_linus Yes. Um, today's date is...
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 October 24th, sir.
ben_linus 2005?
NARJISS#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Yes, sir. 2005.
ben_linus Thank you.
sayid_jarrah I just want to bury my wife in peace.
john_locke Right now, I need you to tell me what's going on.
ben_linus I think the technical term is "shock and awe." They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.
john_locke Well, why did they stop shooting?
hugo_reyes Was that Claire's house?! Claire was there!
john_locke Hugo, get the baby away from the window. Put him in the back room.
john_locke You said I need to survive this. Why?
ben_linus Because there's only one person that can help us now, and that's Jacob, and we have to go to him together.
john_locke What makes you think I can find him? I—I don't even know where the cabin is.
ben_linus I know, but Hurley does.
james_ford Claire! Claire! Claire!
james_ford Claire!
james_ford Are you okay?
claire_littleton Charlie?
james_ford Okay.
claire_littleton Where's Aaron? Where's Aaron?
james_ford He's with us. It's okay. We're gonna move now. Let's go.
james_ford Open the front door!
ben_linus Hugo, you don't want to do that.
james_ford Open the damn door!
james_ford Open the door! Open the damn door!
james_ford Careful.
john_locke Is she all right?
james_ford She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.
james_ford They just started shootin'. Why? Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?
ben_linus Those people were murdered to make you angry, James. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here and throw me to the wolves.
james_ford Yeah, what's wrong with that? Sounds like a great plan to me. What do you say, on three?
ben_linus I wouldn't if I were you.
james_ford Shut up!
john_locke Miles?
james_ford Who the hell let you out?
miles_straume The people who gave me this. They want to talk.
SUBTITLE#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 Tikrit, Iraq
sayid_jarrah You vultures, you followed me to Tikrit? You spy on me?
sayid_jarrah What are you doing here?
ben_linus I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.
sayid_jarrah How did you get here?
ben_linus I came across the Syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might—
sayid_jarrah How did you get off the island?
ben_linus Your friend Desmond had a boat. Remember? The Elizabeth. I followed a heading to Fiji. Then I chartered a plane.
sayid_jarrah Why now?
ben_linus You remember the name Charles Widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world that your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?
sayid_jarrah What does it have to do with me? With Nadia?
ben_linus There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir. He's one of Widmore's men.
ben_linus Bakir was last seen five days ago in Los Angeles, caught by a traffic camera, speeding away from the corner of La Brea and Santa Monica.
sayid_jarrah That's three blocks from where Nadia was killed.
sayid_jarrah Why would these people want to murder her?
ben_linus I don't know. But they did.
john_locke How many of 'em are there?
miles_straume Maybe six. I'm not sure.
james_ford The hell you mean, you ain't sure? You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?
miles_straume They told me they were just security.
john_locke Security for what?
miles_straume For him. Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.
ben_linus Well, Miles, sounds like you're not gonna collect your 3.2 million dollars.
miles_straume Just take it.
ben_linus Why would I talk to them?
miles_straume Because they have a hostage.
ben_linus Well, then they've badly miscalculated, 'cause every single one of my people is prepared to die in service to this island.
miles_straume It's your daughter!
ben_linus Hello?
martin_keamy Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?
ben_linus That's right.
martin_keamy My name is Martin Keamy. I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.
james_ford Who's Charles Widmore?
john_locke Later.
martin_keamy I'd like you to go look out your east window so we can talk about this face-to-face.
martin_keamy To the left. You see me?
ben_linus Yeah, I see you.
martin_keamy All right, Mr. Linus, these are my terms You're gonna step out the front door, put your hands above your head, and you're gonna walk straight to me. Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you that no one else in that house will be harmed.
ben_linus You and I both know that once you have me, there's nothing to stop you from killing everybody else on this island.
martin_keamy What kind of guy do you think I am?
ben_linus Martin Christopher Keamy — former first sergeant, United States Marine Corps, served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, but since then, you've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, specifically in Uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, Mr. Keamy, and we can dispense with the formalities.
martin_keamy Okay, Ben. You got it.
martin_keamy Get down.
martin_keamy Get your ass out here right now... or I'm gonna kill your daughter.
ben_linus I'd like to present a counterproposal.
martin_keamy I'm listening.
ben_linus You and your friends... you turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.
martin_keamy Tell your daddy goodbye.
alex_rousseau Dad... they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother.
ben_linus Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay.
alex_rousseau Please, daddy! Just please, please...
martin_keamy You have 10 seconds, Ben.
ben_linus Okay, listen.
martin_keamy Nine...
ben_linus She's not my daughter.
martin_keamy Eight...
ben_linus I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it—
james_ford I don't see 'em. They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.
john_locke They won't be gone for long. It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes, and then they're gonna come for him.
james_ford Then let's just hand him over.
john_locke I don't think these people have any intentions of letting us walk out of here alive, James, no matter what we do.
james_ford Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.
ben_linus He changed the rules.
john_locke What? Who? What rules?
james_ford You know I'm right.
james_ford Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.
james_ford Hey! Where you goin'?
james_ford Open this damn door! Open up!
ishmael_bakir Walk.
ishmael_bakir Who are you and why are you following me?
ben_linus My name is Benjamin Linus...
ben_linus ...and I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.
ishmael_bakir And what message is that?
ben_linus That should do it.
sayid_jarrah Wait. Where do you think you're going?
ben_linus We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. Get on with your life.
sayid_jarrah I have no life. They took it from me.
ben_linus Go home, Sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours.
sayid_jarrah I spent the last eight years of my life searching for the woman I love. I finally found her and I married her. And I buried her yesterday. So don't tell me this is not my war. Benjamin... Who's next?
ben_linus I'll be in touch.
james_ford Open the damn door! Son of a bitch just left us here. Open the damn door!
claire_littleton What's going on?
john_locke Claire?
james_ford You all right, sweetheart?
claire_littleton Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.
miles_straume Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
ben_linus Excuse me, James.
james_ford 'Scuse you?
james_ford What were you doing in there?
ben_linus Okay, listen to me very carefully I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head straight for the tree line.
hugo_reyes You mean towards the guys with guns?
ben_linus No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.
ben_linus Okay, outside. Outside now!
john_locke What did you do?!
hugo_reyes Did you just call that thing?!
DISTANT#unknown#Lost.Season04.Episode09 VOICE Fall back!
james_ford Go! Go, go!
ben_linus Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.
john_locke Hey, where are you going?
ben_linus I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.
dr_daniel_faraday I can't believe it. Might actually have a signal.
dr_jack_shephard What are you sending?
dr_daniel_faraday "What... happened... to... the... doctor?"
dr_daniel_faraday Okay. They didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor, but your friends are fine, and the helicopter's coming back in—in the morning.
dr_jack_shephard Well...
bernard_nadler He's lying. What the message said was, "What are you talking about? The doctor is fine."
dr_daniel_faraday You know Morse code.
dr_jack_shephard What does that mean, "The doctor is fine"?
dr_daniel_faraday I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard Why are you lying? Why did you say that the helicopters are coming back?
kate_austen Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?
dr_daniel_faraday ...No. No, no.
kate_austen Jack.
james_ford I think your chopper buddies ran that way, if you wanna catch up.
miles_straume Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for—for now.
john_locke Sorry about your daughter.
ben_linus Thank you, John.
john_locke That being said, you lied to me. You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.
ben_linus You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.
james_ford Hang on. "Jacob"? Who the hell's Jacob?
ben_linus He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.
james_ford You know what? I'm done with all this. I never should have followed you wackos in the first place. I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid are comin' with me. You good with that?
claire_littleton Yeah, I'm good with that.
miles_straume I'm coming with you.
james_ford Let's go. You too, Hurley.
james_ford Have you lost your mind?
john_locke Hugo stays with us.
james_ford Not a chance.
hugo_reyes Wait. Leave me out of this.
john_locke I'm sorry, Hugo. We need you to find the cabin.
james_ford He ain't goin' anywhere with you, you crazy son of a bitch.
hugo_reyes Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.
james_ford Hugo.
hugo_reyes It's okay, Sawyer. Please, put your gun down.
hugo_reyes You too.
james_ford You don't have to do this.
hugo_reyes You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.
james_ford You harm so much as one hair on his curly head... I'll kill you.
john_locke Fair enough.
james_ford Let's go. Go. Move.
john_locke Which way?
ben_linus Follow me.

ben_linus Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.
london_doorman At this hour, sir?
ben_linus They're expecting me. Feel free to call up.
london_doorman No need, sir. Good night, sir.
ben_linus Wake up, Charles.
charles_widmore I wondered when you were gonna show up. I see you've been getting more sun.
ben_linus Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?
charles_widmore When the nightmares started.
charles_widmore Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?
ben_linus We both know I can't do that.
charles_widmore Then why are you here?
ben_linus I'm here, Charles, because you murdered my daughter.
charles_widmore Don't stand there, looking at me with those horrible eyes of yours and lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me, when we both know very well I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin — you did.
ben_linus No, that's not true.
charles_widmore Yes, Benjamin, it is. You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night — like a rat — and have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?
charles_widmore I know who you are, boy. What you are. I know that everything you have you took from me. So... once again I ask you Why are you here?
ben_linus I'm here, Charles, to tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... once she's dead... then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.
charles_widmore You'll never find her.
charles_widmore That island's mine, Benjamin. It always was. It will be again.
ben_linus But you'll never find it.
charles_widmore Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.
ben_linus I suppose it is. Sleep tight, Charles.
