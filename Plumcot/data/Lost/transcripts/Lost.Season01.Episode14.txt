michael_dawson Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt!
charlie_pace Hey, Michael, you seen Claire's bags?
michael_dawson You seen my son?
charlie_pace You seen her bags?
michael_dawson Claire's?
charlie_pace Her luggage. It's not been brought back here. No one seems to know what's happened to it.
michael_dawson Uh, sorry man, I don't know. I'm just looking for Walt.
charlie_pace Oh, got it. Sorry, I've not seen him.
michael_dawson Hey, Jack, you see my boy when you were out there?
dr_jack_shephard No, he was at the caves.
michael_dawson Yeah, he took his dog for a walk. I told him to stay close, as usual. You listened to your old man when you were 10, right?
dr_jack_shephard Uh, yeah, yeah, I listened. Maybe a little too well.
hugo_reyes Yo, dudes. Got a new tourney lined up. We're playing for the last of the deodorant sticks. You dogs up for some golf?
michael_dawson I have to go find my kid. Hey, if Walt shows up, you tell him I said stay right here until I get back.
dr_jack_shephard You got it.
michael_dawson Walt! Walt!
hugo_reyes He seems to hate it, doesn't he?
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes Being a dad.
dr_jack_shephard No, it's just a lot of hard work.
hugo_reyes No. He hates it.
michael_dawson Walt!
michael_dawson This is the one. This is definitely my baby's crib.
susan_lloyd Uh-huh, beautiful. It'll look great in the alley we'll be living in. This is 3 months rent.
michael_dawson What? It's not 3 -- look, don't you want the best for this kid?
susan_lloyd I know you're excited, but, Michael, we can't afford this.
michael_dawson Our baby in this crib? C'mon, that's a happy kid. Hey, I talked to Andy, he said he could throw some work my way.
susan_lloyd Construction? What about your art?
michael_dawson No, no, no, no. I'm not giving it up. I'm just going to take a break until you finish law school, pass the bar, get hired by some fancy-ass high paying law firm...
susan_lloyd Somebody's got it all figured out.
michael_dawson Yeah, I'll get back to painting eventually. Meanwhile, you can support me and Walt in a manner to which we'll soon become accustomed.
susan_lloyd Walt, huh?
michael_dawson I'd like to do that, you know, name him after my dad.
susan_lloyd Walter. Walter Lloyd.
michael_dawson Lloyd? Oh, all right. That's why you won't marry me. It's not that you think marriage is too prosaic, you just want him to have your last name.
susan_lloyd Hey, you want me to agree to Walter, or what?
walt_lloyd Man, I suck.
john_locke You can do better than that.
boone_carlyle You might want to take it easy on him.
john_locke See this knot, Walt? I want you to aim for it, right here. Focus on it, alright? Picture it in your mind's eye. You know what that is, right? The mind's eye?
walt_lloyd Like a picture in your head or...
john_locke That's right. Now do it again. But see it. See it before you do it. Visualize the path. See it. See it.
boone_carlyle Whoa.
walt_lloyd Yes!
john_locke I knew you had it in you, Walt.
walt_lloyd It was weird. I actually saw it, in my mind or something, like it was real.
john_locke Who's to say it wasn't?
michael_dawson Hey! What the hell is going on? Give me that.
walt_lloyd But, I was...
michael_dawson Take Vincent and go back to camp.
walt_lloyd But, Mr. Locke was...
michael_dawson Now, little man.
michael_dawson You gave my boy a knife?
john_locke You should have seen what...
michael_dawson Hey, don't tell me what I should have seen, man! If we were back home, I'd call the police on your ass! Encouraging a kid to sneak away from his parent?! Giving him a knife like this?!
john_locke Walt knows his own mind.
michael_dawson Hey, don't talk about my son like you know him!
john_locke You really need to calm down.
michael_dawson You keep playing my son against me, and I'm going to have a-
boone_carlyle The man said calm down.
michael_dawson What are you his attack dog?
john_locke Easy, easy, easy. You're the one that was waving the knife around. He was just trying to make sure you didn't hurt someone. Michael, I know it's been difficult to bond with your son. You know why he's formed an attachment to me? Because I treat him like an adult. You still treat him like a boy.
michael_dawson He's 10 years old.
john_locke He's been through more than most people in their entire lifetimes. Maybe you haven't spent enough time with him to see it, but he's different.
michael_dawson What did you say?
john_locke And we're not back home, Michael. As long as we're here, I think Walt should be allowed to realize his potential.
michael_dawson Stay away from my son. And me.
michael_dawson You're not taking him. You're not taking my son. You can go if you want to, but Walt stays with me.
susan_lloyd I'm trying to have a discussion with you.
michael_dawson No you're not. You're talking about going to Amsterdam, just you and him. How is that a discussion?
susan_lloyd It's an offer, Michael. And that's where the job is.
michael_dawson You said you were happy. What about the legal clinic being a good fit? You said that...
susan_lloyd This is a huge opportunity. You know I've always wanted to do international law.
michael_dawson Am I supposed to be happy for you over here? For your huge opportunity?
susan_lloyd We've talked about taking some time apart.
michael_dawson Look, babe, I thought that was -- hey, we said a lot of things. You said you wanted to live on a boat.
susan_lloyd I still love you. You know, I do, but, Michael, we've been through so much in such a short time. Things...
michael_dawson Babe, we've got problems, right, that's what people have. You want to go to counseling? I'm down with that, let's go, alright? Oh, man, you already took it, didn't you -- the job?
susan_lloyd Yeah, I did. You haven't worked in months.
michael_dawson Construction slows in the winter -- I already told you that.
susan_lloyd I can provide for him. I'll give him everything he needs.
michael_dawson Except for his dad. He's not going with you, so, no!
susan_lloyd You really want to argue with me about this?
michael_dawson Hell yes! There are laws against this kind of thing.
susan_lloyd We're not married, Michael. I'm his mother and I'm steadily employed. Who do you think court's going to side with? -- This is not goodbye forever. I just -- I need some time.
sunhwa_kwon Are you alright?
michael_dawson No, I'm okay. Thanks. I just don't know how to talk him. How to get him to --, you know, understand I'm on his side. Locke says I should stop treating him like a child. I missed his whole childhood, so -- this can't happen.
sunhwa_kwon What?
michael_dawson He can't grow up here. He can't grow up in this place.
sayid_jarrah Once I realized these equations were coordinates, latitude and longitude, I assumed the French woman was trying to determine the location of the Island. But it was incomplete, the notations fragmented.
shannon_rutherford Except for the fish song.
sayid_jarrah MmHmm.
dr_jack_shephard The what?
sayid_jarrah But when I laid the pages down like this I realized it wasn't showing the location of the Island. I think it's a location on the Island. Specifically, here.
dr_jack_shephard So where are we in relation to the triangle?
sayid_jarrah Well, the map is hardly in scale, so I don't know.
dr_jack_shephard We're not even sure it's a map of this Island, are we?
sayid_jarrah We're not, no. But this may be the transmitter sending out the distress call. And its power source.
michael_dawson What are we talking about doing now? Looking for another excuse to get chased down and killed by whatever lives in the jungle? Guys, we can't keep doing this. Building water filtration systems? Playing golf? Making a sweet little home here? We need to get off this Island.
shannon_rutherford You think any of us wants to be here?
michael_dawson No, but I don't think anyone wants to get off as much as I do right now.
dr_jack_shephard So, are you suggesting something?
michael_dawson Yeah, we build a raft.
sayid_jarrah A raft?
michael_dawson Look, don't say it like that, man. We need a little optimism here, okay? And we've got to do something because, let's be honest, no one's coming. Those seats we took off the fuselage, they float. And we've got an axe, and a whole bunch of trees, bamboo. We can do this.
sayid_jarrah The chances of surviving the rough waters? The odds of finding a shipping lane?
shannon_rutherford And I get really sea-sick.
michael_dawson You know what? Great. Stay here. Grow old. Good luck to you, but I'm doing this. My son and I are leaving. Anybody that wants to help us build, God bless you.
walt_lloyd Conardo sepe que machio une oso polar. (This seems to make no sense the way Walt said it, except for Polar Bear.)
michael_dawson Hey, Walt. Hey, c'mon, I need your help with something.
walt_lloyd I'm doing stuff.
michael_dawson You're reading a comic book in Spanish and you don't read Spanish, man.
walt_lloyd I like the pictures.
michael_dawson You like the art, huh?
walt_lloyd I guess so.
michael_dawson You know, when I was your age, I don't know, maybe a little older, I used to trace comic books. I taught myself about perspective. You know what that is -- perspective?
walt_lloyd Hey!
michael_dawson I said I need your help. Let's go.
walt_lloyd Why do I have to come?
michael_dawson Because I've seen what happens when I don't keep an eye on you.
michael_dawson Let me talk to him.
susan_lloyd He's 21 months old. He doesn't use the phone.
michael_dawson I'll do all the talking. I just want him to hear my voice. I miss him.
susan_lloyd I know. Let me call you back, okay? This isn't a good time.
brian_porter We've got to go.
susan_lloyd Shh. It's Michael.
michael_dawson Who's that?
susan_lloyd Let's talk tomorrow, okay? I'll call you from work.
michael_dawson What the hell is going on?
susan_lloyd Michael, listen, I've been seeing someone.
michael_dawson What? Who?
susan_lloyd Does it make any difference?
michael_dawson Who is it?!
susan_lloyd Brian Porter.
michael_dawson The guy who hired you.
susan_lloyd It wasn't like that before.
michael_dawson So when you said you needed time to think about us, you were just lying?
susan_lloyd No! I did, and I realized...
michael_dawson No. I'm coming to Amsterdam.
susan_lloyd Michael don't. It's over between us.
michael_dawson I'm not coming for you! I'm coming for Walt! I'm getting my son back!
MAN#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 Call an ambulance!
kate_austen Charlie?
charlie_pace Hey. These are Claire's things. Who brought them here?
kate_austen I did. Why? What are you doing?
charlie_pace I can't find it. I don't know where it is.
kate_austen What?
charlie_pace Claire's diary. She kept her diary in this side pocket. I know because I saw her put it in there. Someone's taken it.
walt_lloyd What are we looking for again?
michael_dawson Any long piece of metal or plastic tubing. Anything that looks like it would work as a frame.
walt_lloyd A frame for what?
michael_dawson You'll see soon enough. Hey, separate the cushions, the plastic, the tarp. Put everything you find in different piles so we can take stock.
walt_lloyd Am I being punished?
michael_dawson What? You think working with your old man is punishment? No, man, this us taking control of our destiny.
walt_lloyd Feels like punishment.
kate_austen Sawyer? Hey, Sawyer?
charlie_pace You know, I could just go inside and...
james_ford Trick or treat. What are you two selling today?
charlie_pace Where's Claire's diary? Someone took it from her bag.
james_ford Oh, I get it, something goes missing and right away you figure it's got to be me that took it.
kate_austen Do you have the diary or not?
james_ford You mean this one?
charlie_pace Give it to me.
james_ford Now, I'm not sure that's the best idea. Maybe Missy Claire don't want you reading it.
charlie_pace I wasn't going to read it.
james_ford You're not curious what she wrote about you?
charlie_pace You bastard. Did you read it?
james_ford Good literature's kinda scarce around here.
charlie_pace He read it.
kate_austen Just give it to us.
james_ford "Dear Diary, I'm getting really freaked out by that has-been pop star. I think he's stalking me."
kate_austen Sawyer.
james_ford "Diary, the little limey runt just won't let up."
charlie_pace You hit like a ponce.
james_ford Oh, yeah?
kate_austen Alright, enough. You didn't really read it, did you?
james_ford I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.
walt_lloyd Um, I'm going to get some water.
michael_dawson Yeah, okay. Would you bring me some? Please? Please and thank you. We've got to work on that.
shannon_rutherford Boone. Hi. So are you guys just going to keep coming back without any food? Hey, I'm serious.
boone_carlyle Uh-huh.
shannon_rutherford What's going on with you, Boone? Could you be acting any weirder?
boone_carlyle Shannon, you've been a functioning bulimic since junior high. I thought you'd be excited about dropping a size or two.
shannon_rutherford Well, since you're not having any luck with hunting maybe you should help Michael. He's building a raft. I was thinking I would help him out, maybe finally get the hell out of here. Why don't you help me?
boone_carlyle No, thanks.
john_locke Your father doesn't want us spending time together.
walt_lloyd He's not the boss of me.
john_locke But he's your father. And he cares about you. And you need to show him respect. I'm serious, Walt. You're not to come to me anymore.
michael_dawson Damn it! What is wrong with you?!
john_locke I was just coming to see you.
michael_dawson I told you to stay away from my son!
walt_lloyd He didn't. I was just gonna...
michael_dawson Walt, I don't want to hear from you.
john_locke I was just giving him this pencil to give to you. I thought you could use it. Consider it a peace offering.
michael_dawson If I catch you with my son again, I'll kill you.
walt_lloyd You're a jerk.
michael_dawson What'd you say to me?
walt_lloyd Mr. Locke didn't do anything wrong. He's my friend.
michael_dawson He's not your friend anymore. I'm looking out for you.
walt_lloyd You don't care about me. You never cared about me.
michael_dawson What?
walt_lloyd You only showed up after my Mom died. Where were you when I was growing up, huh? Nowhere.
michael_dawson Listen, Walt, it's -- it's complicated.
walt_lloyd I don't even care. You're not my father.
michael_dawson You want to hate me? You want to punish me for something I can't change, fine? But you will listen to me.
michael_dawson Now, you get over there, and you stay there. Now!
nurse Hm, that's really wonderful.
michael_dawson Oh, thanks. For my son. He's going to be 2 next week.
nurse Yeah? I didn't know you had a kid.
michael_dawson Yeah, yeah, um, he lives in Amsterdam with his mom.
nurse Ever go to visit him?
michael_dawson No. No, not yet. I had a little, you know, run in with a car. I never know what to write.
nurse How about a joke?
michael_dawson I don't know. What kind of joke?
nurse How about what's black, white, and red all over?
michael_dawson Yeah, a newspaper, right?
nurse A penguin with a sunburn.
michael_dawson That's really dumb.
nurse Trust me, mother of 4 talking here. He'll get a kick out it.
susan_lloyd Hello, Michael.
michael_dawson Susan.
susan_lloyd I finally called Andy when I hadn't heard from you in over two months. I had to hear about your accident from him. You should have called me.
michael_dawson Yeah, well, considering how our last conversation went...
susan_lloyd I'm so sorry about that.
michael_dawson Hey, did you bring Walt?
susan_lloyd No. No, he's at home.
michael_dawson Oh, with Brian. So what are you doing here anyway?
susan_lloyd I came to see you.
michael_dawson So I look pretty good, huh?
susan_lloyd Not that bad. -- Nurses say you're expected to make a full recovery.
michael_dawson Yeah, after a year of physical therapy. A year!
susan_lloyd I'm covering all your medical costs.
michael_dawson What?
susan_lloyd I've already spoken to the hospital administrator and all your bills are coming directly to me.
michael_dawson What is this about?
susan_lloyd Brian and I are getting married.
michael_dawson How nice for...
susan_lloyd No, you don't have to say anything, just listen. We're moving to Italy at the end of the month. Brian's taking over the firm's Rome offices.
michael_dawson Sounds like Brian's on a roll.
susan_lloyd And he wants to adopt Walt. I know this is hard, but just think about it.
michael_dawson You're kidding me, right?
susan_lloyd Consider what's best for Walt. You can keep holding on if you want, but ask yourself why you're doing that. Is it really for him? Or is it for you?
hugo_reyes Uh, dude? Your kid's gone.
michael_dawson What?
hugo_reyes He just grabbed the dog and took off.
michael_dawson I know where he's gone.
michael_dawson Locke, where the hell is he?
john_locke What?
michael_dawson I'm not in the mood for your games, man. Where's Walt?
john_locke Walt's not here, Michael.
michael_dawson Don't lie to me.
boone_carlyle Hey, man, he's not here. Look around.
michael_dawson I'm not talking to you.
john_locke I told him this morning that he couldn't be around me anymore, trying to respect your wishes.
michael_dawson Well, if he's not...
john_locke Let's go find your boy.
charlie_pace Thanks. You really didn't have to help, you know. I could've managed. I've had my share of manly encounters.
kate_austen I just thought you could use the company. You okay?
charlie_pace Yeah. It's weird. I barely knew her -- barely know her -- Claire. She's been missing over a week and everyday she's gone it feels like bits of me are crumbling or something.
kate_austen I think it's right that you should keep her stuff safe, until she gets back.
charlie_pace Yeah.
walt_lloyd C'mon, Vincent.
walt_lloyd Vincent, cut it out! Cut it out, Vincent! What's wrong?
walt_lloyd Vincent!
walt_lloyd Vincent! Vincent!
susan_lloyd You should have seen him trying to weasel his way out -- anything not to let the case go forward. He was arguing it wasn't his jurisdiction.
brian_porter Oh, you're kidding me.
susan_lloyd I wish I was. Same argument 3rd time in a row. Barkley said it was an immigration issue.
brian_porter Barkley, that's classic.
susan_lloyd He thinks because I'm new to Australian law that I'm some kind of yokel or something. Hey, hello -- homework.
walt_lloyd I told you, I need help.
brian_porter He needs help.
susan_lloyd I'm a lawyer, sweetheart, I can tell when someone's stalling.
walt_lloyd Who cares about birds of Australia, anyway? We're in Australia.
brian_porter You okay?
susan_lloyd I'm feeling kind of flu-ey.
walt_lloyd Shouldn't we be studying birds of Egypt or something?
brian_porter You haven't been sleeping much lately. Maybe you need to take a personal day.
walt_lloyd I picked the Bronze Cuckoo (Walt mispronounces it "Kahuku"). It's funny. Wanna see?
susan_lloyd What about Barkley?
walt_lloyd I mean, it doesn't look funny, just the name.
susan_lloyd Sleeping in late that's too much...
walt_lloyd Hey, Brian, look, look. You're not looking. You're not looking.
susan_lloyd Oh, my god.
walt_lloyd Is it dead?
brian_porter Yeah, poor guy.
walt_lloyd Vincent! Vincent!
brian_porter Michael Dawson?
michael_dawson Yeah, can I help you?
brian_porter Yeah. I'm Brian Porter.
michael_dawson Susan's Brian?
brian_porter Yeah. Can I come in? I need to talk to you.
michael_dawson Susan know you're here, man?
brian_porter Susan died yesterday. Please .
michael_dawson Um...
brian_porter She, uh, it turns out she had a blood disorder. She was only sick for about a week.
michael_dawson I didn't know. I, uh, I hadn't talked to her in a while. Sit down. And, Walt, how's he, uh...
brian_porter He's fine. He's back home with his nanny.
michael_dawson What?
brian_porter I mean, he's fine -- I mean, considering, you know.
michael_dawson You left him home after he just lost his mother?
brian_porter Before she died, Susan, she told me she wanted you to have custody of Walt.
michael_dawson She what?
brian_porter Well, I think she just thought, I mean -- since you're his father.
michael_dawson I haven't been his father in 9 years.
brian_porter Yeah, well, that's kind of the thing, see. Look, I loved Susan very much. And I was honest with her from the beginning, but she -- she wouldn't hear it.
michael_dawson Hear what?
brian_porter That I -- I didn't want to be a father. I just don't know how.
michael_dawson Hey, what the hell are you talking about, man?! You adopted him!
brian_porter Yes, yes, I did, because she wanted that, and I wanted her and... Look, these are two tickets - it's one round trip, the other one-way, Sydney to New York. The envelope has money in it for travel expenses.
michael_dawson She didn't tell you she wanted me to have custody of him. This is your idea.
brian_porter I'm a wreck right now, okay. Don't you understand that?
michael_dawson I'm supposed to give a damn about you?!
brian_porter I just lost the woman I love, alright?! And I can't be his father-!
michael_dawson You son-of-a-bitch, what the hell are you talking about?! You're the only father he knows!
brian_porter It's more than that!
michael_dawson Well, then what?!
brian_porter There's just -- there's something about him!
michael_dawson What the hell are you talking about, man?
brian_porter Sometimes when he's around things happen. He's different somehow.
michael_dawson Over here. What the hell wou...
walt_lloyd Help, please! Help!
michael_dawson Walt!
john_locke This way.
michael_dawson Walt! Walt!
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 Walt should be home from school any minute. Mr. Porter asked me to give you that - some of Susan's effects.
michael_dawson Oh, thanks.
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 There's something else.
michael_dawson What's that?
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 Something I think Walt should have. Excuse me.
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 Walt?
walt_lloyd Yeah?
NANNY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode14 There's somebody here to see you.
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad, help, please.
walt_lloyd Help!
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd Dad!
john_locke C'mon, up here. Michael.
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad.
michael_dawson Hey, Walt.
walt_lloyd Who are you?
michael_dawson I'm a -- I'm your father. Hey, um, I want you to know -- listen, I can't explain how sorry I am about your mom. You should know that we, hey, we loved each other very much when we had you.
walt_lloyd Where's Brian?
michael_dawson Brian's not here. I've come to bring you home with me.
walt_lloyd I'm not going anywhere with you.
michael_dawson Walt, can I? I know this is really hard to understand. All of this. See Brian, Brian loves you very much. And he wants you to stay with him, but it's not his choice. It's mine. I'm your legal guardian. And it's not like he's going to disappear from your life. He'll still call you, write to you, come to see you whenever he can. And you know, you'll still have your dog.
walt_lloyd But Vincent isn't mine. He's Brian's.
michael_dawson Brian said you could have him.
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Hey, Walt!
walt_lloyd Dad! Dad! Where are you dad?
michael_dawson Hang on!
michael_dawson Okay, okay, okay. Let's go. Hey, Walt, just hang in there, okay? I'm coming, man.
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Walt! Throw me the knife. Walt! If he comes near you, use it.
john_locke Michael.
michael_dawson Stay there, buddy.
walt_lloyd Dad!
michael_dawson Are you okay?
walt_lloyd Yeah.
michael_dawson Alright. Whatever you do, you hold onto this tight. Got me?
walt_lloyd Yeah.
michael_dawson Tight!
walt_lloyd What about you?
michael_dawson Don't worry about me. I'll be right behind you, okay? Hold on. Okay, Locke, now! Pull!
michael_dawson Pull him, Locke!
walt_lloyd I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
michael_dawson No, no, no, it's --, it's okay. We're okay. I'm just glad you're safe.
walt_lloyd But, Vincent. He ran off again.
john_locke He found his way back to you once, Walt. He will again.
michael_dawson Hey, I've got a present for you. Since you like to look at pictures.
walt_lloyd What's this?
michael_dawson Go ahead. Every card, every letter I sent you over the last 8 years.
walt_lloyd You wrote me?
michael_dawson Mmhmm.
walt_lloyd I never saw these. Did my mom have these? Why didn't she give them to me?
michael_dawson I don't know. But she didn't throw them away, either, which means, you know, somewhere inside she wanted you to have them.
walt_lloyd So, you drew these?
michael_dawson Just for you. This one I did for your 2nd birthday.
walt_lloyd A penguin -- with a sunburn? That's dumb.
michael_dawson Yeah, I know. That's what I said.
charlie_pace Jack! Sayid. You have to hear this.
dr_jack_shephard What is that?
charlie_pace It's Claire's, her diary.
sayid_jarrah You're reading her diary?
charlie_pace Yeah, I know, I'm bloody scum. Just listen to this. "I had that weird dream again, the one with the black rock I can't get away from. I try to leave it but it won't let me."
sayid_jarrah Black rock?
dr_jack_shephard It's just dreams, Charlie.
charlie_pace No, Sayid mentioned the Black Rock before.
sayid_jarrah The French woman said something about her team returning from the Black Rock. The triangle on the map. Maybe it's the triangle on the map?
charlie_pace Maybe it's where Claire was taken. Maybe she's there?
dr_jack_shephard Maybe. Charlie, we all want to find Claire, but there's no sense going out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
boone_carlyle I don't think that whistle's working, John.
john_locke You can't hear everything, Boone. The sooner you learn that, the better.
boone_carlyle Well, I heard that. Vincent. Vincent is that you? Vincent.
john_locke Claire?
