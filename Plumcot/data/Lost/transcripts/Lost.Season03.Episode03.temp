CLAIRE When did John get back? And what's he doing? Where's he been? Where's everyone else? Don't you think you should go find out?
CHARLIE So you're gone for a whole day after a massive hatch detonation -- you don't call, you don't write? Sorry, am I interrupting something?
CHARLIE What, you can't speak John? You're mute? I am sorry about that. So where are Eko and Desmond? Are they off being mute and building structures, as well? I know; you can't speak. You need to speak? To me? What do you want to--? Sand? You need to speak to the sand? Trees? Yeah, I've heard they're wonderful conversationalists. Hey! I don't understand! Who do you need to speak to? Church? Sky? Island? Island? You need to speak to the island?
CHARLIE I need your help? Since when do you need my help?
CHARLIE I need you to stand guard? Oh yeah, so you can talk to the island. Dangerous. Well, amusing as the mute game invariably is, you are aware, John, that I detest you, aren't you? You do remember repeatedly punching me in the face and accusing me of using heroin when I was not.
CHARLIE What the sodding hell is a sweat lodge?
LOCKE Where you headed?
EDDIE Eureka.
LOCKE I can get you as far as Bridgeville. Come on, hop in. Come on.
LOCKE My name's John.
EDDIE Eddie.
LOCKE Hi, Eddie.
EDDIE Hey.
LOCKE Nasty day to be hitching.
EDDIE That's for sure.
LOCKE You don't mind my asking -- what's in Eureka?
EDDIE I heard there was some work there cutting timber.
LOCKE Oh, is that what you do?
EDDIE That might be what I do. I don't know. All I know is I had to get out of where I came from. Mom's dead. Dad's a drunk.
LOCKE Hey look at that, the rain is passing.
EDDIE What, did you rob a bank?
LOCKE Afraid so.
SHERIFF Can I see license and registration, please?
LOCKE Was I speeding, officer?
SHERIFF Tail light's out. Can you both please step out of the vehicle? What you got back here?
LOCKE Guns and groceries.
LOCKE Now, the transactions logs and the paperwork for all of them is in the red notebook right there in that duffel. So are we free to go?
SHERIFF I could still take you in for picking up a hitchhiker.
EDDIE That's my uncle. I called him. He picked me up.
SHERIFF Get out of here. 
EDDIE So what is with all the guns, uncle?
CHARLIE What's that? You're not taking drugs are you, John? I only ask because of the strict zero tolerance policy you've enacted, and I wouldn't want you to have to start punching yourself in the face.
].
CHARLIE Yeah, I know, I get it. You're going to go in your little magic hut and I'm going to stand out here in case you devolve into a monkey.
CHARLIE Don't come in -- okay. Okay, I get it.
BOONE Hi, John. It's good to see you again. What's that, John? Oh, you're sorry. That's okay. I was the sacrifice the island demanded. Don't worry; you'll speak when you have something worth saying. I'm here to help you find your way again. So you can bring the family back together. Come on, I want to show you something.
BOONE John, you're going to need that.
BOONE John, someone in this airport is in serious danger. You are the only one who can save them.
BOONE Not them, they'll be fine -- for a while.
BOONE I think Sayid's got it.
BOONE Not Hurley.
BOONE Forget it. He's helping himself.
BOONE There's nothing you can do for them. Not yet. First you have to clean up your own mess.
BOONE Come up here, John.
BOONE Clean it up, John.
BOONE They've got him. You don't have much time.
CHARLIE John! What happened? Are you alright?
CHARLIE What are you doing?
LOCKE I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.
CHARLIE Eko's cross.
LOCKE He was dragged this way.
CHARLIE Dragged? By what?
LOCKE By a polar bear.
CHARLIE Sawyer killed the polar bear.
LOCKE He killed a polar bear.
CHARLIE What's that, John? Blood?
LOCKE I'm going to go on alone, Charlie. You go back to Claire.
CHARLIE Well, I'll take my chances.
LOCKE You don't want to go with me, Charlie. Bad things happen to people who hang around with me.
LOCKE Hey, Bobby.
EDDIE What's that?
LOCKE That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.
EDDIE A what?
LOCKE Anybody who wants can go in there, light a fire, get it nice and hot -- meditate.
EDDIE Then what?
LOCKE And then you're supposed to figure out what to do with your life -- you know, what direction to take -- go on in there and figure out if you're a farmer or a hunter.
EDDIE So, which are you, John?
LOCKE Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie. He's looking for some logging work, but I convinced him to come home and have some supper with us first.
MIKE Nice to meet you, Eddie.
EDDIE Nice to meet you.
JAN Any friend of John's is a friend of ours.
MIKE John's a very special guy.
JAN Grab a spot.
MIKE So, you like Geronimo Jackson, huh?
EDDIE Uh, yeah, yeah, they're alright. It's one of my dad's old shirts.
MIKE Your dad has excellent taste. Listen up, people. John brought a guest to supper. So everyone, this is Eddie . Eddie, this is everyone.
EDDIE Nice to meet you.
MIKE John, you want to say some grace?
LOCKE Yeah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the food and the friends. And thanks for the rain today so that Adam will stop grumbling about the drought . And for me, thank you for helping me stop being so angry. And for helping me find a real family -- because they're a hell of a lot better than the one I used to have. So, let's eat. Amen.
JAN Amen, let's dig in.
EDDIE Thank you. Thank you.
CHARLIE Is that the hatch?
LOCKE What's left of it.
CHARLIE What happened?
LOCKE Looks like it imploded.
CHARLIE What's that?
LOCKE It's an active kill -- meaning that whatever was eating this is going to be back for more.
CHARLIE If you want to say polar bear you can just say it.
LOCKE Alright, polar bear.
LOCKE Run!
HURLEY Dude.
HURLEY They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer. And they sent me back to tell everyone else that we can't ever go over there. Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch, Henry -- he was there. He's, like, their leader. So, what do we do?
LOCKE Do what they told you. Go back to the camp and tell the others.
HURLEY You're not going to do anything?
LOCKE I am doing something. Go back to the beach, Hugo.
HURLEY Wait, where are you guys going?
CHARLIE The island told Locke he has to save Eko.
HURLEY Save him from what?
CHARLIE Well, apparently, a bear's got him. It's just made an active kill. You may want to hustle.
HURLEY Bear? What bear?
CHARLIE What's that? More fur?
LOCKE This way.
CHARLIE You know, when I used to get high, I'd watch nature programs on the Beeb. Polar bears are meant to be quite clever. Very clever. They're like the Einsteins of the bear community.
EDDIE She likes you, man.
LOCKE She does not.
EDDIE Oh, yeah, she does.
LOCKE She does not.
EDDIE Yeah, she does.
LOCKE She's, like, half my age, man. You'd be better off with her.
EDDIE Uh-uh, no. Lizzy's too granola for me. What she really wants is a daddy -- like everyone else here. You should take advantage of that.
LOCKE That's not really funny, Eddie.
EDDIE It was a joke. It was a joke. I'm sorry.
EDDIE How come you never talk about your dad, John?
LOCKE Nothing worth talking about.
EDDIE What's going on in that greenhouse over there? Maybe they need a hand with that fertilizer?
LOCKE No, no, no, no. They're okay. They're okay. Come on, we've got orchard duty.
EDDIE What's the big secret, John?
LOCKE Sorry?
EDDIE The greenhouse -- what have you guys got in there? What are you hiding? Because every time I go near it, you and just about everyone else acts all weird.
LOCKE Look, you're a guest here. These things take time.
EDDIE I've been here for 6 weeks.
LOCKE Eddie, nothing's--
EDDIE I'm not blind, man. Did you forget you had a duffel bag full of guns when you brought me here?
LOCKE Mike and Jan welcomed you here with open arms. They feed you. They give you a place to stay.
EDDIE And Mike and Jan fold their hands every night before chow and talk about how we're family. But your family's got too many secrets. Now, I see the fertilizer going into that greenhouse. I know what's going on, and I want in.
LOCKE In on what?
EDDIE Whatever you guys are trying to blow up. What's so funny?
LOCKE I'll talk to Mike and Jan.
CHARLIE You really think Eko's in there? Let's hurry up and do this, maybe the bear's out finishing his lunch.
LOCKE You're not going in there, Charlie.
CHARLIE What?
LOCKE I'm going to do this alone.
CHARLIE You don't get to tell me what I can't do. If I want to go in there, I'll go in there.
LOCKE Why?
CHARLIE What?
LOCKE Why do you want to go in there?
CHARLIE I don't need a reason!
LOCKE Then go back.
CHARLIE You go back. You don't have a good reason to go in there either.
LOCKE I'm going in there because I'm supposed to go in there.
CHARLIE If it all goes to plan, we probably won't even see the bear, will we?
LOCKE And hopefully, he won't smell us. 
CHARLIE Hairspray? Now, I hate to be the one to point this out to you...
LOCKE It's not for me.
HURLEY Bear? Is that you? Who's there?
DESMOND You alone, brother?
HURLEY Uh, yeah.
HURLEY Whoa! Dude! I'm not alone.
DESMOND Beach camp's right over there. Can you get me some clothes?
HURLEY What happened to yours?
DESMOND I woke up in the jungle like this.
HURLEY So, like, the hatch blew off your underwear?
DESMOND Fine, you want to discuss this in great detail right now?! Let's do it.
HURLEY No, no, that's okay. I've got something in here. How do you feel about tie-dye?
LOCKE Hey Kim! Hey, Mike and Jan in?
KIM Yeah, they were looking for you.
LOCKE Good, good. Good timing then, huh?
KIM Go on in.
MIKE Got all the cash?
JAN In the bag.
MIKE What bag?
JAN The one with the money in it!
MIKE What about the bank records?
JAN Leave them.
MIKE Shouldn't we sort out what they can trace?
JAN There is no time, Mike.
LOCKE What's going on?
JAN What does it look like?
LOCKE I don't...
MIKE You screwed up, John. You blew it, big-time.
LOCKE What are you -- what? What are you doing? Are you leaving? Why?
JAN That is why, you idiot!
MIKE John, your friend's a cop.
MIKE Do you know how much jail time we'd get for this much weed?
JAN Nice picture, huh? Got him fresh out of the academy.
LOCKE No -- that -- he was hitchhiking. He told me he was going to Eureka. How could he possibly--?
JAN He was waiting for you, John! He has been here for 6 weeks gathering evidence because you brought him here.
LOCKE Mike, that's impossible.
MIKE He played you for a sucker. Now it's over.
LOCKE No, wait. No, wait, wait. Stop! We don't know what he's told them. He hasn't even been in here yet. If he's still gathering evidence and trying to make a case then it's not too late.
JAN Not too late for what?
LOCKE To protect us. To protect all of us. It's not too late to fix this. I can fix this.
MIKE How are you going to do that, John? Huh?
LOCKE Eko!
EKO John.
CHARLIE Is he okay? Is he alive? Is he alright?
LOCKE He's alive.
CHARLIE Turn him over. Turn him over.
LOCKE Charlie, we've got to get out of here.
CHARLIE Okay, let's get him up.
HURLEY So, when you say "turn the key" you mean like key, key?
DESMOND It was a failsafe key.
HURLEY That seems kind of convenient.
DESMOND I'm sorry?
HURLEY I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time why didn't you, like, use it?
DESMOND I didn't know what would happen.
HURLEY So what did happen?
DESMOND The failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly -- made the hatch implode.
HURLEY You didn't implode.
DESMOND No.
HURLEY You're not going to, like, turn into the Hulk, or something. So is that what made the blender noise? And the sky turn purple?
DESMOND I'm afraid I missed that, brother.
HURLEY Right, you were failsafing. Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated. And Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too, right before they got bags pulled over their heads.
DESMOND Don't worry. Locke's going to go after them. He said so in his speech.
HURLEY What? What speech? All he said was he was going to go save Eko and kill bears.
DESMOND Right. Right, of course. I'm sorry. I'm just a bit shook up.
LOCKE I burned that bear pretty good. I don't think he's going to be coming after us.
CHARLIE Now that we've survived this suicide mission are you going to tell me what you saw?
LOCKE What I saw?
CHARLIE In the spirit tent.
LOCKE I saw Boone.
CHARLIE Boone? What did he have to say for himself?
LOCKE He told me I had to clean up my own mess.
CHARLIE Well, dead as he may be, I agree with Boone. If you kept pushing that button like Eko told you to...
LOCKE We wouldn't have had to save him in the first place. Yeah, Charlie, that's what cleaning up your own mess means.
CHARLIE Spoken like someone who's had a few too many messes to clean.
EDDIE No deer, huh?
LOCKE Nope.
EDDIE You talk to Mike and Jan yet?
LOCKE Yeah, I sure did.
EDDIE What did they say?
LOCKE They said that I should bring you by the greenhouse tonight after supper and that they would explain everything.
EDDIE Cool, that's great.
EDDIE What, did you see something?
EDDIE John? What are you doing?
LOCKE Did you know it would be me?
EDDIE What?
LOCKE In the truck? Did you know it would be me driving? Did they choose me?
EDDIE They? John, I have no idea what you're talking about.
LOCKE I didn't load that one. So how about you just answer the question, Eddie?
EDDIE Yeah, they chose you, John.
LOCKE Why?
EDDIE Because you hadn't been here long, didn't have a criminal record, and psyche profiles said you would be amenable for coercion.
LOCKE Amenable for coercion?
EDDIE Hey! Lower the gun, John. Okay? This isn't personal.
LOCKE What's not personal?!
LOCKE Stop. Stop.
EDDIE I'm sorry, John, but you're not going to shoot me. You're not a murderer. You're a good man. You're a farmer.
LOCKE Nope. Not a farmer. I was a hunter. I'm a hunter.
EDDIE I'm going to walk away now, John.
CHARLIE Hey, John? You hear something?
LOCKE It sounds like a stream.
CHARLIE Yeah.
LOCKE Let's put him down -- maybe get some water in him.
CHARLIE I'll go. You stay here. 
LOCKE I'm sorry. Sorry I ever doubted you. Sorry I gave up on my faith in the island. I messed up. Now our people are captured -- if I'd just listened to you -- if I'd just let you keep pushing the button. I could have gone with them, protected them. I could have saved them.
EKO You can still protect them. You can still save them.
LOCKE I don't even know where they are.
EKO You will find them. After all, you are a hunter, John.
CHARLIE Did you say something?
LOCKE He's awake. Eko? Eko?
CHARLIE Maybe we should just get him back, John.
LOCKE Yeah.
CHARLIE You alright?
LOCKE Yeah, just keep walking.
CHARLIE Hey!
CLAIRE John? Charlie?
PAULO What happened?
CHARLIE We got him.
HURLEY Is he alive?
NIKKI We need Jack.
LOCKE Take him in.
HURLEY Jack's not coming back. They've got him.
CLAIRE What? What are you talking about, Hurley?
NIKKI Jack's gone? I don't understand. Okay, when were you planning on telling us this, Hurley?
PAULO What do you mean "they"? Who's "they"?
LOCKE They are the Others. And, yes, they've taken Jack, and Kate and Sawyer.
PAULO How? What happened?
CLAIRE What about Sun and Jin and Sayid? Are they okay?
LOCKE I don't know. I'm going to find our friends. I don't know how yet, but I will. We're going to find them. All of them. And then we're going to bring them home. But first things first, we've got to look out for Mr. Eko. So, Paulo and Nikki, bring towels and water. Claire, we've got to clean him up so bring all the first aid supplies. 
CHARLIE Not a bad speech.
HURLEY Whoa.
CHARLIE Whoa, what?
HURLEY I just got hit with, you know, deja vu. 
CHARLIE Okay. Well, when that wears off can you get bandages from the kitchen?
