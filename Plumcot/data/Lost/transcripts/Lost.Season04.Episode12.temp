PILOT We got a little chop ahead.
PILOT Put that away, man. You're freaking me out.
COPILOT We need this thing. With the cargo we got back there? Bad mojo.
PILOT Ms. Decker?
MS. DECKER Yes?
PILOT Wanna head back there and let 'em know we're landing?
MS. DECKER Sure. Of course.
MS. DECKER We're coming in for a landing.
MS. DECKER It's a military facility just west of Honolulu. It's completely private. Your—your families are already here. Now there's a lot of press that wanna speak to you, but as far as Oceanic is concerned, you don't have to speak to any reporters.
JACK We'll talk to 'em.
MS. DECKER Is that all right with all of you?
JACK It's fine. We all agreed. We just—we just wanna get it over with.
MS. DECKER Okay. Um, they're referring to you as the "Oceanic Six". That's not the best branding as far as we're concerned, but it's catchy. We'll see you on the ground.
JACK We all know the story. If we get any questions that we don't wanna answer, or that we can't answer, let's just keep our mouths shut. It's okay. They'll—they'll think that we're in shock.
SUN We are in shock, Jack.
JACK Well... then this should be easy.
ROSE It was Sayid and—and Desmond in the helicopter, right? I mean, it had to be. Why else would they have dropped that thingamabob right over us?
SUN Then why wouldn't they just land?
JACK I don't know, but this thing is trackin' the chopper. So if they were on it, they want us to know where they're going.
SUN It's a phone, right? Can't we just call?
JACK Well?
JACK Don't try anything stupid.
FARADAY Understood.
KEAMY Put it down over there.
JULIET Is that from the chopper?
FARADAY Sh shh.
FRANK We're still 5 klicks from the site.
KEAMY I said put it down, Frank. Okay, gear up, boys. Soon as we hit the ground, we deploy to the Orchid. Heads down! Let's do this.
JACK You know what "the Orchid" is?
JULIET No. I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.
JACK Kate. Wanna take a walk?
KATE Absolutely.
JACK I'll get the guns. You get some water, okay?
KATE Okay.
JULIET You can't possibly be serious. You just had surgery, Jack.
JACK I'm gonna be fine.
JULIET If your sutures rip, you're not gonna be fine.
JACK I can't just sit around waiting.
JULIET Recovery is not "sitting around"!
JACK Look, I have to do this.
JULIET Why?
JACK Because I promised those people that I would get 'em off this island. 
JULIET Don't bleed to death, Jack.
JACK I'll see ya in a couple hours.
CHARLOTTE Daniel? What's wrong?
FARADAY Charlotte, did you hear what he said? They're going to the Orchid. They're using the secondary protocol.
CHARLOTTE What are you talking about?
FARADAY We have to get off this island. Right now.
JACK We're catchin' up. The chopper must've landed.
KATE Why don't you take a break?
KATE You're bleeding.
JACK No, I'm not bleeding. I'm... I'm suppurating. It's... discharge. My body's just fightin' the infection around the stitches.
KATE You know when most people are lying and they can't look you in the eye? You do the exact opposite.
MILES Hey, long time no see.
SAWYER Hey, who are you talkin' to up there, Genghis?
JACK Where's Claire?
SAWYER We lost her.
JACK You what??
SAWYER She just walked off in the middle of the night. We looked for her for a day, but she was just gone. I was hopin' maybe she went back to the beach.
JACK She didn't.
SAWYER Well, what are y'all doin' out here? What's that phone for?
JACK The chopper flew over the beach. Someone tossed this out. It must've been Sayid.
SAWYER Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid, 'cause if he's with those animals that just blew up half of New Otherton, you do not wanna tussle with 'em.
KATE What, they tried to kill you?
SAWYER Just like Locke said they would.
JACK So... what? We're supposed to just... turn around and hide? 'Cause it seems like that didn't work so well for you.
SAWYER I'm sorry, Doc, maybe this is déjà vu, but didn't you just do the whole "run through the jungle with a walkie" plan?
JACK That helicopter is our only way off this island.
SAWYER What's with you and "gettin' off the island"? You're like a damn broken record.
KATE Stop it! Are you two fightin' each other now?
JACK Look. I put Sayid and Desmond on that chopper. It was my call. It's my responsibility. I'm going after it whether they're on it or not. You can all head back to the beach.
KATE Jack... no, no, no. You can't go by yourself.
JACK Take care of the baby. Okay?
SAWYER That son of a bitch is stubborn.
SAWYER Hold up! You don't get to die alone.
MS. DECKER Based on the location of the wreckage, our best estimate of the crash site is... here. From there, the survivors were carried by the ocean's current to... here—an uninhabited island in the Lesser Sunda Islands known as Membata. As you've all read in your briefing books, on day 103... a typhoon washed up the remnants of an Indonesian fishing boat, including basic supplies and a survival raft. On day 108, the remaining six survivors, including Ms. Austen's baby which she gave birth to on the island of Membata, used this raft to journey here— an island called Sumba. They then came ashore near a village called Manukangga. This photo was taken by the local fisherman who found them. Once it was discovered who they were, they were transported to Honolulu by the U.S. Coast Guard. As you can imagine, this has been an extraordinarily trying experience. They have, however, agreed to answer a few questions. So, ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of Oceanic 8-1-5.
MS. DECKER Yes.
MALE REPORTER #1 Dr. Shephard! Dr. Shephard! Can you tell us what it was like when the plane hit the ocean? Uh, how you survived.
JACK Um...
JACK It—it all happened really fast. I remember the impact. I remember the—the plane filling up with water. A group of us got to the emergency door, and, um... got out before it went down.
MALE REPORTER #1 And those of you who survived—you swam to the island?
JACK No. We had, uh, cushions. We had some life jackets. We were in the water for over a day before the current took us in. By then, there was only eight of us left.
MALE REPORTER #1 What happened to the other three?
JACK One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle, suffered tremendous internal injuries and died a few days after the crash. A woman, Libby, she didn't make it through the first week. Charlie Pace, he drowned a few weeks before we were able to leave.
FEMALE REPORTER #1 Over here! Over here, please! Considering the ordeal that you've all been through, you look pretty healthy having been on an island for more than a hundred days.
HURLEY Was that directed at me, Dude?
FEMALE REPORTER #1 Well, actually, Mr. Reyes, you were worth more than $150 million at the time of your... death. How does it feel to know you're going to get all that money back?
HURLEY I don't want it back, any of it. That money was bad luck.
FEMALE KOREAN REPORTER 권선화 씨, 섬에서 사망한 사람 중 한 명이 당신의 남편이 맞습니까?
FEMALE REPORTER #2 What did she say?
MALE REPORTER #3 Can somebody translate that?
SUN She asked if my husband was one of the people who died on the island.
SUN The answer is no. He never made it off the plane.
ARABIC REPORTER Are you aware of the situation in Iraq, Mr. Jarrah? Do you have any plans to return?
SAYID There is nothing for me in Iraq.
ARABIC REPORTER Mr Shephard, now that you are home, what are your plans?
JACK I haven't really thought too much about it, uh—my father died in Sydney, I was bringing him home for the funeral when the plane crashed. Even though the body is...—I'd like to put him to rest.
MALE REPORTER #4 Ms. Austen...
MALE REPORTER #4 What was it like giving birth on the island?
KATE Scary.
MALE REPORTER #4 Your son—uh, Aaron? How old is he now?
KATE He's just a little over 5 weeks.
MALE REPORTER #4 So that would've made you about six months pregnant when the U.S. Marshal service apprehended you in Australia for an outstanding murder warrant. Is that correct?
MS. DECKER Uh, I'm afraid Ms. Austen's legal issue is off the table. Next question.
FEMALE REPORTER #1 Mr. Jarrah, given the amazing circumstances surrounding the survival of you six, is it possible there are any other survivors from the crash yet to be discovered?
SAYID No. Absolutely not.
JACK You did good.
MS. DECKER Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman outside. She says she knows you, but she wasn't on the list of family members. Her name is a Noor Abed Jaseem.
SAYID Nadia? Nadia.
SAYID Hey! Over here!
SUN Sayid! Where's Desmond?
SAYID He's fine. He's on the freighter. Listen, I'm going to start taking people back—six at a time. We have to go right now before the helicopter gets back to the boat.
JULIET Why do we have to go to the boat before the chopper gets back?
SAYID Because the men on that helicopter have every intention of killing us all.
SAYID What?
JULIET Jack and Kate just went running after it.
HURLEY So when is someone gonna tell me where we're going?
BEN We're going to a place called the Orchid, Hugo.
HURLEY And what's that?
BEN It's a greenhouse.
HURLEY And why are we going to a greenhouse exactly?
BEN You heard John. We're going to move the island.
HURLEY Right. And how are we gonna do that?
BEN Very carefully.
HURLEY Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?
BEN Because doing it is both dangerous and unpredictable. It's a measure of last resort.
HURLEY Awesome.
LOCKE Allow me.
BEN May I have that mirror, please?
BEN You know, those are 15 years old.
HURLEY What are you doing, Dude?
BEN Communicating.
LOCKE Communicating with who?
BEN Who do you think?
BEN All right. Now we can go.
LOCKE Wait. What was that? What did you tell them?
BEN None of your business, John.
FARADAY Hey, Sayid, listen. If you wanna run off into the jungle after the chopper, you should do that. But in the meantime, we need to get these people off this island.
SAYID I won't be long. If I can catch up with Jack and Kate—
FARADAY I can start ferrying people now. I can get them there safely. By the time you get back, I can have most of these people on our boat.
SAYID I trust you know the bearing. You'd better get going.
FARADAY Thank you. All right, first group in the raft. We can fit six.
JULIET Okay, okay, hold on. Sun is pregnant. You should go first.
KATE Sayid? What are you doing here? Jack thought that you—
SAYID I know what he thought. That's why I'm going after him. How far ahead is he?
KATE I don't know. He's—he's with Sawyer. I left them about an hour ago. Jack's got a sat phone, and they're headed for the helicopter. I can track them. Look, you are not gonna catch up to them unless I go with you.
SAYID Let's go.
KATE Okay. Sun.
SUN Where's Claire?
KATE Get Aaron on the boat, okay?
SUN What?
KATE It's all right. Just... I'll see you there.
KATE Just keep him safe!
SUN Shh.
FARADAY All right, this is just the first trip. Here we go.
MAN Okay.
WOMAN You okay?
FARADAY Okay.
WOMAN Okay.
JIN 이 섬을 벗어나게 해 준다고 내가 약속했지. 
MR. PAIK 어떻게 된 거야? 
UNDERLING 누가 했는지 모르겠지만요, 다른 은행을 다섯 군데나 썼습니다. 
MR. PAIK 당장 가서 윤을 데리고 와! 어서! 
SUN 아버지, 제가 방해한 건 아니죠? 
MR. PAIK 아니다. 항상 사업 상 하는 일인데 뭘. 
SUN 무슨 일이라도 있으세요? 
MR. PAIK 내가 말해 줘도 넌 이해하기 힘든 복잡한 회사 일이야. 그래, 몸은 좀 어떠냐? 
SUN 아버지가 진수 씨를 얼마나 싫어했는지 다 알고 있는데... 새삼스럽게 아이에게 관심있는 척 하지 마세요. 
MR. PAIK 너 지금 뭐라고 했냐? 
SUN 제 뜻 아시잖아요. 진수 씨를 증오하셨잖아요. 
MR. PAIK 너 지금 누구한테 함부로! 난 니 아버지야! 버르장머리라고는 하나도 없이! 
SUN 오세아닉 항공사로부터 상당한 금액의 합의금을 받았어요. 그 돈으로 오늘 아침에 아버지 회사 지분 반을 구입했고요. 이제부터는 저를 동업자로 존중해 주셔야겠죠. 
MR. PAIK 뭐? 너... 뭐 때문에? 
SUN 제 남편 인생도 망가뜨리고, 그런 아버지 때문에 우리가 그 비행기를 탄거라고요. 그러니까 전 아버지 하고 또 다른 사람이 진수 씨 죽음에 책임 있다고 생각해요. 
SUN 우선 이 아이를 낳고 나서 이 회사 미래는 그때 가서 얘기하죠. 우리 회사에 대해서. 
HURLEY Mom? Dad?
HURLEY Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh?
HURLEY Hello?
HURLEY Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?
ALL Surprise! Happy birthday!
CARMEN Happy birthday!
DAVID Happy birthday, Hugo!
CARMEN Hugo, what are you doing with that?
HURLEY I don't know. I thought there might be a prowler or something.
CARMEN Jesus Christ is not a weapon. Okay. Enjoy your party.
MAN Wwhoo! Happy birthday!
HURLEY No way.
KATE Happy birthday, Hurley.
HURLEY Hey, Kate.
KATE Hey.
HURLEY Hey, little buddy.
KATE Say hi. Jack's running late. Sorry.
NADIA Happy birthday, Hugo.
HURLEY Wow, you guys are here.
SAYID Interesting choice of theme.
HURLEY Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, Dude.
DAVID Hey! How's everybody doing? What are you talking about? Building a fire or huntin' boars? I guess not. Uh, listen. Uh, do you mind, uh, excusing us for a little while? I-I wanna show you your birthday present. Hmm? Come on. Bye-bye now.
HURLEY I told you I don't want anything.
DAVID Hugo, it's your birthday. You gotta get somethin'.
HURLEY Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.
DAVID Relax. I got this before you gave us the money. Ta-da! Check it out.
HURLEY You fixed it.
DAVID Yeah. After the crash, I—I worked on it as a memorial to you. When I was fixing it up, it was almost like I was with ya. But now you're back, and it's all yours. Wanna take her for a little spin?
DAVID Is somethin' wrong, son?
HURLEY Is this some kind of joke?
DAVID What are you talking about?
HURLEY 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Did you do this?
DAVID Do what?
HURLEY Those are the numbers! Right there! The numbers I won the lottery with!
DAVID Wow. What—what a coincidence.
HURLEY No. No, not a coincidence. I don't want this. I don't want any of it!
DAVID Hugo? Wait—wait a minute. Hugo, what are you... son! Hey!
DAVID Hugo! Hugo! Hugo, where you goin'? Come on! Hugo!
HURLEY Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah, I get it. It's really dangerous and unpredictable. But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island. Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?
BEN Yes, I suppose they would.
HURLEY Well, isn't that, you know, a problem?
BEN I'm working on it.
HURLEY Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!
LOCKE I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Hugo.
BEN May I have the binoculars, please? You might wanna get down lower to the ground.
LOCKE And why might we wanna do that?
BEN Because we're at the Orchid.
LOCKE What are we waitin' for?
BEN We're waiting, John, because Charles Widmore, the man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you, knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside.
LOCKE I thought you said you had no idea why he was trying to find he island.
BEN I wasn't being entirely truthful.
LOCKE Yeah. When are you ever entirely truthful?
BEN You need to see this.
LOCKE What am I looking for?
BEN Look over there on the left-hand side. Watch the plants at the back.
LOCKE I don't see any—
BEN They're already here.
FARADAY Hey, hey! Hey, we're back!
DESMOND Where's Sayid?
FARADAY He had to go after Jack. You go. They're headed for the chopper.
DESMOND You okay?
SUN Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
FARADAY I'm gonna head back for the next group.
MICHAEL Engine's fixed. Tell Hendricks to try it.
DESMOND Okay, engine should be working.
HENDRICKS Indeed they are.
DESMOND All right, well, take us to the island.
DESMOND But make sure you—you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5. It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5. 
HENDRICKS We've got some kind of RF interference with the the fathometer. I can't see the reef, mate.
DESMOND RF interference? How is that possible? The radio room's down.
HENDRICKS I don't know, but something on this boat is broadcasting. If we don't turn it off, I'm not going any closer than 5 miles off the coast.
DESMOND Then I'll find it.
SAWYER Cut yourself shavin'?
JACK Juliet took out my appendix a couple of days ago.
SAWYER You kiddin' me.
JACK Nope.
SAWYER Well, what else did I miss?
JACK We're here.
LAPIDUS Ah!
JACK Lapidus!
LAPIDUS Yeah! 
SAWYER You know this yahoo?
JACK Yeah.
LAPIDUS "Yahoo"? This yahoo dropped that phone on you guys so you could find me—
LAPIDUS —and I could fly you outta here. So why don't you do me a favor and get in that back compartment? There's a toolbox. See if you can find something to get me outta these things.
JACK You heard the man.
SAWYER Well, all right. Can I get you boys a nice, cold glass of lemonade while I'm back there?
JACK Where are Desmond and Sayid?
LAPIDUS Your buddies were smart enough to keep their asses on the boat because right now that's the safest place to be. Because when the boys that I brought over here come stompin' out of this jungle, you're gonna wanna be long gone.
JACK Where'd they go?
LAPIDUS They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to snatch Linus.
JACK Soon as we cut you free, you'll be able fly us out of here?
LAPIDUS Hell, yeah.
SAWYER Hang on, Shaggy. You said the hit squad's gonna grab Ben Linus?
LAPIDUS Well, I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.
SAWYER What are they gonna do with the people that are with him?
LAPIDUS Nothin' good.
SAWYER Hugo's with Ben.
JACK Son of a bitch.
JACK About ten months ago, I wrote what I wanted to say at my father's funeral on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Sydney airport. I don't remember what I wrote, but whatever it was... he would've hated it.
JACK My father couldn't stand eulogies. "The only good thing about a wake is the free booze", he'd say.
JACK Not much of a wake because I won't even be able to bury him. So... What I wanna say is not for my father. It's for me. Good-bye, dad. I loved you. I miss you.
JACK Thanks very much for coming.
MARGO Thank you.
JACK Thank you.
MARGO Thank you for coming.
JACK Thanks.
MARGO I'll see you back at the house?
JACK Yeah.
MARGO I love you, sweetheart.
JACK I love you, Mom.
MARGO I'm so glad you're home.
JACK I'll see you soon.
MARGO Okay.
KATE You did that well.
JACK Had a lot of practice.
CAROLE Excuse me. May I have a word with you? Mr. Shephard... I'm very sorry for your loss.
JACK Thank you. How did you know my father?
CAROLE I believe I'm the reason he was in Australia when he died.
JACK I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would he have come to see you?
CAROLE Oh, he... he didn't come to see me. I was still in the hospital. I never saw him. He came to see his daughter. My daughter, Mr. Shephard.
JACK My father didn't have a daughter—
CAROLE Yes. He did. If you don't believe me, check his phone records. Would you like to know the—the strangest thing about all this, Mr. Shephard? My daughter was on your plane, too. She was on flight 8-1-5. You were in the air for six hours, probably just a few rows from her and you never even knew she was your sister. she was one of the ones who died when your plane hit the water. Her name was... Claire. I didn't mean to burden you with this, but... you needed to know. I'm... sorry for your loss.
CAROLE Your son is beautiful.
KATE Thank you.
SUN I don't understand. How'd you get back to New York?
MICHAEL Uh, Walt and I, uh, uh... we took Ben's boat and we followed his bearing. A couple of days, we came to an island, you know, with people. I sold the boat... we hopped a cargo ferry back to the States. Didn't tell anybody who we were.
SUN And now you're working for Ben?
MICHAEL I do not work for Ben. I'm trying to make up for what I did. I'm trying to help you out here. Translate what I said.
JIN I understand.
DESMOND Hey! Michael! I need you now!
MICHAEL Oh, my God.
JIN 아기 데리고 위에 가서 기다려. Now.
SAYID What's the matter?
KATE These aren't Jack or Sawyer. They're different tracks, fresh... and they're doubling back behind us.
SAYID Whoever you are, come out now!
RICHARD All right. All right, let's just relax. All right, let's—let's just rel—let's relax.
KATE Stop! Stop!
RICHARD Just relax. Put the guns down. Pl—
KATE I said stop right there!
RICHARD Please just drop your guns.
SAYID Take one more step—
RICHARD I said drop your guns.
LOCKE I see two of them, but not the one who killed Alex.
BEN He's there. Hold on to that for me, will you?
LOCKE What?
BEN Listen to me very carefully, John, because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this. You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there. Once inside, you're gonna turn left. Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left. They're in an alcove against the north wall. Face the wall, reach down with your left hand. You'll find a switch that activates the elevator. The elevator takes you down to the actual Orchid station.
HURLEY Whoa. Wait. What?
LOCKE Okay, I'm sorry, Ben, but maybe I missed the part where you explained what I'm supposed to do about the armed men inside.
BEN I'm gonna take care of them.
LOCKE And how the hell are you gonna do that?
BEN How many times do I have to tell you, John? I always have a plan.
LOCKE Ben! Ben!
BEN My name is Benjamin Linus. I believe you're looking for me.
