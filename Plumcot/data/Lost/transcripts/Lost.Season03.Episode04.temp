DESMOND You've, um, you've got a problem with your roof.
CLAIRE What?
DESMOND Look, maybe you should move down the beach, just for tonight. That way I can fix it -- make some improvements.
CLAIRE That's really nice of you to offer, but, um, Aaron just feel asleep so I should just...
DESMOND No, it'll be worth it. I promise.
CHARLIE Whatcha doing, brother?
DESMOND I was just offering to fix this roof here.
CHARLIE Fine. If there's a problem I'll fix it. I'm quite handy. I was building a church before Eko exploded.
DESMOND Right, well, just trying to help, huh.
CLAIRE Thanks. What was all that about?
CHARLIE I don't know. We're going to have to get that guy another button to push.
JULIET How are you doing today, Jack?
JACK Great.
JULIET You seem frustrated.
JACK Am I going to keep watching cartoons or are you going to tell me why I'm here?
JULIET I hope you like blueberry. If not, I can...
JACK Should I talk to Benjamin?
JULIET Sorry?
JACK Should I talk to Benjamin? Because I'm starting to think that you're just the person who brings me my food.
JULIET You can talk to him all you want. But he won't tell you anything.
JACK You work for him?
JULIET No, I don't work for him.
JACK He's in charge?
JULIET Well, it doesn't work that way over here, Jack. We make decisions together.
JACK Really? Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck he seemed happy to just let you die. I mean, it felt like he made that decision on his own.
JULIET You don't know what you're talking about. I don't answer to him.
BEN Juliet, I need you.
JULIET Can it wait?
BEN The sub is back. We have a situation, so come with me now.
PICKETT Time for work.
SAWYER Sound a little stuffy there, Chinatown. You need to blow your nose?
PICKETT Just give me an excuse.
SAWYER I thought I just did. What do I got to do -- talk about your mother?
VOICE Danny, are you there?
PICKETT Yeah?
VOICE 
PICKETT Hold on. Okay, go.
VOICE 
PICKETT What? Where are they?
TOM She's hurt bad, Juliet.
JULIET Keep her steady.
PICKETT She's going to be fine, right? She's going to be okay?
KATE What happened?
SAWYER We happened.
KATE What?
SAWYER Been on this rock long enough to realize they ain't in the business of shooting each other. We did it. Our team.
KATE You smiling?
SAWYER Damn right I'm smiling. 'Cause we just got our ticket outta here.
KATE What are you doing? Whenever you're ready to fill me in.
SAWYER Shush up, I'm thinking.
SAWYER You know that chick they brought in on the stretcher -- that's broken nose man's girl.
KATE They call him Pickett.
SAWYER Well, Pickett is distracted at the moment.
KATE So?
SAWYER Watch and learn, little lady. There's juice pumping into this box from somewhere. Next time someone comes to pull me out, I'm going to wait until they step in my little swimming hole, then I grab 'em. Zap! They fall back from the shock -- I snag the keys. Bet the bears never thought of that.
KATE You're both going to get electrocuted.
SAWYER Yeah, but I felt the jolt. I can take it. The other guy -- he ain't going to be ready for it. What, you think I'm crazy?
KATE No, I'm actually impressed.
SAWYER Well, wipe the stars out of eyes, sweetheart -- 'cause we're going to do this.
KATE So, what about Jack?
SAWYER What about him? We don't even know if he's here. Hell, we don't even know if he's alive. We gotta take care of us. It's every man for himself, Freckles.
GUARD Alright, Ford. That's enough.
PRISON TOUGH The problem is I was following your hands, not your eyes.
SAWYER The problem is you old and dumb.
SAWYER Who's the punching bag?
PRISON TOUGH Just got here -- name's Munson. Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil, but they never found the money.
SAWYER I'll be damned.
PRISON TOUGH If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights, Munson would be a dead man.
SAWYER That son of a bitch.
SAWYER You get little mints on your pillow at night, too?
MUNSON Sorry?
SAWYER You're here, what, a week? And you're on tote bag duty? I've been here 9 months; I'm still pushing trash.
MUNSON What does that mean?
SAWYER You think the warden's breaking up those fights because you're cute, Costanza? He's making a play for that 10 mil. First step -- butter you up, give you a plum job. Step two -- warden will reach out to your wife -- use her against you. Textbook con.
MUNSON And you're telling me this out of the kindness of your...
SAWYER Advice is free, Murgatroyd. Last 9 months that warden's made my life a living hell. He gets that 10 mil you ain't got? I might just have to kill myself.
WARDEN HARRIS Hey.
SAWYER Well, howdy, warden.
WARDEN HARRIS He bothering you, Munson?
SAWYER So what brings you to the sewing shop, Boss?
WARDEN HARRIS Don't think I can't extend your stay, Ford. All it takes is one call. One call. How about you get that trash?
SAWYER Oh, yeah, the big kahuna.
SAWYER Lunch already?
BEN What do you weigh?
SAWYER What?
BEN What do you weigh?
SAWYER 180, give or take.
BEN How old are you?
SAWYER 32.
BEN Don't lie.
SAWYER 35.
BEN Good.
SAWYER Sayonora, sucker.
SAWYER What did you do?
BEN We turned it off.
KATE Sawyer!
KATE Hey!
TOM 2 days since the sky turned purple. We've been blind. Our comms are all down -- I can't get them back up again. And in case you forgot, Colleen's in critical...
BEN Juliet's taking care of her.
SAWYER Where am I? What the hell are you doing to me? Let me up!
BEN Jason.
SAWYER Let me up!
JASON Bite down on this please.
SAWYER You bite down on it.
BEN It's for the pain.
SAWYER What?!! Wait! Let me up! No!
BEN God, I hate needles.
SAWYER No! What are you doing?!
JASON No, you have to go through the sternum -- the sternum, like in the movie.
MATTHEW I know. I know.
SAWYER No!!!
MATTHEW 1, 2...
DESMOND Don't mind me, brother. I'm just going to take one of your clubs. Hurley said it would be alright.
PAULO Hurley, huh? Does this mean you're off to save the day?
DESMOND So, uh, I can take one of these?
PAULO Take the five iron; I never use it. That way when you die in the jungle, doing whatever you're doing, I don't have to go looking for it.
DESMOND Thanks, mate. You know, you might want to square your shoulders a bit more.
PAULO You play golf?
DESMOND I'm Scottish. Cheers. 
SAWYER What the hell?
BEN Shhh.
BEN Hey. Hey, come on. Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on.
SAWYER What are you doing?
BEN Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop.
SAWYER Come on, what are you doing?
BEN Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it.
SAWYER What's your problem?
BEN Come on, come on, come on.
SAWYER Did you just kill that bunny?
BEN You know what a pacemaker is?
SAWYER What?
BEN They stick them in the tickers of people who've had by-pass work whose hearts need just a little jump -- a kickstart. The rabbit had a small pacemaker set to deliver its kickstart should it get too excited, or anxious, or frightened -- or should it try to escape. Assuming you were telling the truth about your age and weight your resting heart rate should be about 70 beats per minute. Your active heart rate, however, that would be about 140 -- which is the point at which your pacemaker will cause your heart to explode. Which is how I know that you're going to start behaving now. The watch monitors your pulse. If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps, you're going to want to relax yourself. Do some deep breathing, some yoga.
SAWYER If you want me dead, why don't you just shoot me and get it over with?
BEN Because we're not killers, James. Oh, and one other thing -- Kate...
SAWYER You touch her, I swear...
BEN You tell her what we did, what we put in you -- that we're watching you -- you tell her any of these things -- we'll put one in her, too.
KATE Sawyer? Sawyer, are you okay?
TOM That's so you can clean yourselves up. And Kate, if any of that doesn't fit, just give me a holler, okay? 
KATE What happened? What did they do to you?
SAWYER Nothing, they just asked me questions. It ain't important.
KATE Talk to me. What happened?
SAWYER Look, I told you. Nothing happened. So quit asking.
KATE Turn around.
KATE What's that?
SAWYER It's just my watch. It's busted.
KATE When did you get a watch?
SAWYER Look, I don't tell you everything! Just leave me alone, damn it. Put some clothes on.
CASSIDY Hello, Sawyer.
SAWYER It's James Ford. And I know you know that because you got it right when you pressed charges.
CASSIDY You're mad at me?
SAWYER Well, look where I am.
CASSIDY What did you want me to do? You conned me.
SAWYER Something you want?
CASSIDY Yeah. Yeah, there is.
SAWYER Come on, I got license plates to make.
SAWYER What's this?
CASSIDY This is your daughter.
SAWYER What do you want?
CASSIDY Well, first I wanted you to know.
SAWYER Then what? You think I'm going to take one look at this picture and turn into Father Knows Best?
CASSIDY We're living in this little place in Albuquerque. It's near the University...
SAWYER Why are you telling me this?
CASSIDY I just thought you could write her a letter. Her name's Clementine.
SAWYER What the hell am I going to write, "Dear Goo-goo, Ga-ga?" She's a baby. She ain't mine.
CASSIDY Sawyer, she is...
SAWYER I ain't got no daughter.
KATE I've been checking out my cage and I think if I climb to the top I can squeeze through those bars. They're spaced farther apart up there.
SAWYER Don't bother.
KATE What are you talking about?
SAWYER I'm talking about being smart. I think we should chill out here a while -- get the lay of the land.
VOICE Under control...
ANOTHER VOICE Yeah?
VOICE ... it was a mistake bringing those two here.
JACK What did you do to Sawyer?
JULIET Nothing.
JACK I heard him yelling. You've got blood on your clothes.
JULIET Jack. Jack!
JACK What did you do to him?!
JULIET It's not his blood.
JACK Then whose blood is it?
JULIET It's the blood of a woman who's dying. Jack, I, I need your help.
KATE It's Jack. Jack!
SAWYER Doc!
KATE Jack!
SAWYER Doc! Doc!
KATE Jack! Jack!!
BEN Have you lost your mind? You bring him here?
JULIET He's a doctor. He can help.
BEN Well, this is not why...
JULIET Do you want her to die? Come on.
JACK What happened?
JULIET Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
JULIET Those aren't hers. Come on.
PICKETT What's he doing in here?
JULIET Danny, he's here to help.
PICKETT Tell him who did this. He ought to know that.
JULIET Danny.
JACK I need him out of here.
JULIET Danny, get out.
TOM Come on, Danny. Let's go.
JULIET Go.
PICKETT No way; she's my wife.
TOM Danny, they got it. 
JULIET I got the bullet out, but she's still bleeding.
JACK Right upper quadrant; it's swelling badly.
JULIET No, I padded it.
JACK I need you to clamp under the liver so I can get a look back there.
JULIET I'm not a surgeon.
JACK I know. But I need you to do this.
JULIET Here.
JACK She's got a retro-hepatic caval bleed. It's behind the liver, that's why you missed it. I need lap pads -- as many as you got. Alright, another one.
JACK The crash cart, now. Juliet, I need paddles.
JULIET It's broken. We've had... Jack, we haven't had anything happen before. We didn't -- we have -- I don't...
JACK Time of death ... she's gone.
PICKETT They did this! They did this!
TOM Danny, wait. Danny, wait, no.
SAWYER Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Hoss. Take it easy. Take it easy!
PICKETT Shut up!! Do you love this guy?
KATE What?
PICKETT I said do you love him?!!
KATE Stop!
PICKETT Do you love him?! Do you love him?!!
KATE Leave him alone!!
PICKETT Do you love him?!
KATE What are you doing? Stop!!
PICKETT Do you love him !
KATE Yes! I love him!! I love him!! Please. 
PICKETT Lock him up!
MUNSON I need to talk to you.
SAWYER Sorry, I'm busy.
MUNSON It's important. Please.
MUNSON You were right. I loved her. I thought she -- I really thought she...
SAWYER 10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, Killer -- tends to change things. That's why you never get attached -- because once you care, that's when they can come at you.
MUNSON What did your's want? I saw you the other day with a woman. What did she want?
SAWYER Something I ain't got. That all? You had yourself a good cry? You mind if I go back and see if George gets his farm?
MUNSON I need you to move it. The money.
SAWYER The money you didn't steal?
MUNSON We both know I did. Lila's hired a PI. She's going to find it. Do this for me. You have to.
SAWYER No. It's too dangerous. I'll be a walking target.
MUNSON If you don't help me the warden will get it all. He'll win. Please. Please.
KATE Are you okay?
SAWYER Dandy. Guy hits like a girl. No offense.
KATE Why did he do that?
SAWYER Hell if I know. These people ever make any sense to you?
SAWYER What are you doing? What are you doing?
KATE What does it look like?
SAWYER Hang on a second, Freckles.
SAWYER I told you, the time ain't right.
KATE You're the one that said we had to go.
SAWYER Well, that was before...
KATE Before what?! I don't know what they did to you. But I know you're scared enough to lie about it. And that scares me more than anything that they have done to us before.
SAWYER Wait. Wait! What are you doing?
KATE I'm getting you out of here.
SAWYER Don't.
KATE I'm not leaving you, Sawyer. I can get it open.
SAWYER No. You're already out. You've got to go. You've got to leave me!
KATE What?
SAWYER Run!
KATE What did they do to you?!
SAWYER Will you go!!
KATE What is that thing?
SAWYER Run. Just go. It's every man for himself.
KATE Why didn't you fight back?! Tell me the truth for once in your life!
SAWYER If you really love me -- go.
KATE I only said that so he'd stop hitting you. 
SAWYER Run. Hurry! What the hell are you doing? Kate?! Damn it, Freckles, go. Every man for himself.
KATE Live together, die alone.
TOM You know Danny wants to kill him.
BEN Danny can wait.
TOM Should I bring Shephard back?
BEN No, I want him to sit with her for a while longer.
JULIET I'm, I'm sorry they -- they, uh, had to put handcuffs on you. Um, I'm a fertility doctor. I'm not used to death.
JACK What was her name?
JULIET Cole; it was short for Colleen. I shouldn't have, uh -- I should have come to get you sooner.
JACK It wouldn't have mattered. There wasn't any more that you could have done. She was -- she was dead before you put her on the table.
JULIET Are you just saying that to make me feel better?
JACK I don't care about making you feel better.
JULIET I'm going to take you back now. Um, I'm sorry for bringing you here.
JACK Who's x-rays are those? Outside? Those are spinal x-rays. They belong to a man about 40 years old. And whoever he is, he has a very large tumor on his L-4 vertebrae. And I just happen to be a spinal surgeon. So, you tell me, Juliet, who am I here to save?
HURLEY Is that -- art?
DESMOND Nope. Just an experiment.
HURLEY Okay. You want some fruit salad?
DESMOND Thanks, I'm not hungry. You might want to wait a minute.
HURLEY Why's that?
BEN Good morning. Let's go for a walk.
WARDEN HARRIS I have to be honest, Ford. When they first brought you here, I thought you were nothing more than a dumb hick. Now I know better. You're a dumb hick that knows how to steal.
SAWYER Can we just get this over with?
WARDEN HARRIS Yeah, let's. You remember Agent Freedman from the Treasury Department?
AGENT FREEDMAN So, what have you got?
SAWYER 10 million's in a red Bronco parked in a Stor-Quik facility in Sawgrass, right off 441, unit 23C. That's where your money is.
WARDEN HARRIS As agreed, the last 6 years of your sentence have been commuted.
AGENT FREEDMAN As soon as the truck is recovered and the funds confirmed, your commission will be processed. Now, how would you like that?
SAWYER Set up a new account. It don't matter what bank, just make it in Albuquerque.
AGENT FREEDMAN Okay.
SAWYER Put it in the name of Clementine Phillips.
AGENT FREEDMAN Okay, Clementine Phillips.
SAWYER And I want it so there's no way she can ever find out who the money's from.
WARDEN HARRIS Who's Clementine Phillips?
SAWYER We done?
WARDEN HARRIS Congratulations, Ford, you just lied and cheated your way out of prison. You're a free man.
BEN Not much further, James -- just at the top of the next rise.
SAWYER What's up there?
BEN Something I want you to see.
SAWYER That little place you always wanted, George?
BEN Sorry?
SAWYER What, don't you read? It's from Of Mice and Men. You'd like it -- puppies get killed.
SAWYER Bring me up here to kill me? Make that thing you put inside of me blow up my damn heart?
BEN Your heart's not going to blow up, James. The only thing we put inside you was doubt. Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor, but nothing more. Look. We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker.
SAWYER How do I know that's the same bunny? That you didn't just paint an 8 on another one?
BEN You don't.
SAWYER You son-of-a-bitch.
BEN The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you.
SAWYER What the--?
BEN You ever been to Alcatraz -- take the tour? Right now you're standing on a small island roughly twice the size of Alcatraz. And that over there -- that's your island -- the one you've come to know and love. I just wanted you to know there's nowhere to run.
SAWYER You did all this just to -- just to keep me in a damn cage?
BEN We did all this because the only way to gain a con man's respect is to con him. And you're pretty good, Sawyer. We're a lot better. Funny thing is, us telling you about the pacemaker wasn't what kept you in line. It was when I threatened her. You work so hard to make her think you don't care -- that you don't need her, but, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. It don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell you, I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick."
SAWYER What the hell are you talking about?
BEN It's from Of Mice and Men. Don't you read? Come on, let's get you back to your cage.
