john_locke Is that all of them?
dr_jack_shephard All 6 of them. And there's uh, 1 box of ammo.
john_locke At least we don't have to worry about running out any time soon. Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place. Oh, I had to take them from Charlie -- his heroin stash. I figure it might have therapeutic value, if it ever came to that.
dr_jack_shephard You're just going to leave it all in the statues?
john_locke You want to break 7 Virgin Maries, be my guest. I'm superstitious.
dr_jack_shephard John, the combination.
john_locke I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room, rather than this being an issue of trust.
dr_jack_shephard Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.
john_locke Alright, but I think we should agree, Jack, that if either of us need to open this door, we consult each other first.
dr_jack_shephard Absolutely.
john_locke Right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down?
dr_jack_shephard Nope, I got it.
john_locke Alright. And, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too.
dr_jack_shephard Why would I need to do that?
james_ford Well, well, now look who had to relocate to the suburbs. Ain't that just like a woman? She keeps the house and you get the cheap-ass apartment. Man, I thought these people hated me, but I've got to hand it to you -- stealing a baby, trying to drown it -- now, that's a new low. You even made Locke take a swing at you. Hell, that's like getting Gandhi to beat his kids.
charlie_pace Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now?
james_ford What?
james_ford What the hell do you think you're doing?
dr_jack_shephard You stole these from the Hatch.
james_ford You stole them from me.
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford They were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine.
dr_jack_shephard These belong to all of us, Sawyer -- to the group. You don't have a stash anymore.
james_ford Seriously, Doc, you don't want to do this. Just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened.
dr_jack_shephard Are you threatening me?
james_ford Last chance, Doc.
james_ford What do you want -- right now?
cassidy_phillips Just you.
james_ford Oh, damn it!
cassidy_phillips What is it?
james_ford I'm going to be late to that meeting I told you about.
cassidy_phillips Meeting, huh? You got another date you could just say so.
james_ford I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time -- but I appreciate the permission. Back in flash, gorgeous. You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
cassidy_phillips Are you serious?
james_ford What?
cassidy_phillips You're not serious. You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash? And you go to pick it up and the lock just happens to break?
james_ford Give me that.
cassidy_phillips It's not even real. Newspaper? Are you trying to con me? What, I ask you what all the money's for and you do some song and dance about an investment or something? And then I say, "Oh, hey, I've got some money."
james_ford Look, you got me. Good for you. No harm, no foul.
cassidy_phillips You should have done your homework. I didn't take anything from him in the divorce. I'm not even worth your trouble.
james_ford Well, shame on me.
cassidy_phillips I want you to show me what you do. Show me what you do -- what you really do.
james_ford And what do I do?
cassidy_phillips Show me how to con people, Sawyer.
kate_austen I like what you've done with the place.
james_ford Maid's day off. You want to move?
kate_austen I heard Jack took your pain killers.
james_ford Well, I guess me and the Doc are on the outs. One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.
kate_austen Maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the Hatch. I know you're hard up for new reading material.
james_ford Well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair , I lost my damn glasses on the raft. You want to read it to me? What, you got an appointment or something?
kate_austen Alright, "10 Ways To Tell If He's A Sensitive Man".
james_ford This ought to be good.
john_locke Morning.
kate_austen Hey, John.
james_ford Now, there's a sensitive man.
kate_austen Claire asked him to sleep down here.
james_ford Come on. Locke's got himself needs -- just like anyone else.
kate_austen Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.
james_ford I guess that's why El Jacko and Ana-Lulu didn't ask me to join their revolution. What, you didn't hear about their little army? I guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the Doc.
hugo_reyes Hey, man. You gonna put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up? Lime in the coconut? The song?
sayid_jarrah What do you want, Hurley?
hugo_reyes So, I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the Norwegian plane.
sayid_jarrah Nigerian.
hugo_reyes Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this.
sayid_jarrah That is a short wave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire with a red wire -- make it stronger.
sayid_jarrah We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver and all we got was the French woman's message on a loop. Why would I bother?
hugo_reyes Come on, man, I mean, it's worth...
sayid_jarrah It's worth nothing. It's a waste of time.
hugo_reyes Just trying to cheer you up, dude.
sayid_jarrah I don't need cheering up.
hugo_reyes Okay, man. Sorry. No problem.
ana_lucia_cortez Hey. Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
ana_lucia_cortez You get the combo? Nice. I didn't think it would be that easy convincing your pal to give it up. That's the nice thing about you people -- you're not scared enough.
dr_jack_shephard Not scared enough?
ana_lucia_cortez Same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army. Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.
dr_jack_shephard Trust me, Ana. No one thinks we're safe.
ana_lucia_cortez So, Jack, what's the combo? I was just kidding.
sunhwa_kwon Oh, Vincent! What are you doing out here? 거기 조심해, 밟으면 안 돼.
james_ford Oh, man. It's really coming down. Get under here, Freckles.
kate_austen I like the rain.
james_ford Yeah, me too, if I'm under here.
kate_austen That's Sun.
james_ford Is she alright?
kate_austen She's breathing.
james_ford Go get Jack. -- Go get Jack!
kate_austen Okay.
john_locke What happened?
james_ford Where's Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Was she conscious at all? Did she say anything?
james_ford Nothing. Not a word.
jinsoo_kwon 자기야, 자기야!
dr_jack_shephard She's okay. She's okay.
jinsoo_kwon 어떻게 된거야?
dr_jack_shephard She's going to be alright. You need to let me take care of her, alright, please. Where'd you find her?
james_ford I heard her scream. Found her out in the jungle about a half a click from here.
kate_austen She was out cold and her hands were tied.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean, her hands were tied?
ana_lucia_cortez They're back.
john_locke They told us they would leave us alone.
dr_jack_shephard Well, John, it looks like they broke their promise.
john_locke We don't even know what happened.
dr_jack_shephard Do we need to know?
ana_lucia_cortez Where'd you find her?
kate_austen Just outside her garden.
ana_lucia_cortez We should take a look around -- with guns.
john_locke No.
dr_jack_shephard No?
john_locke If we arm up we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, we'll wait for Sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened. Then we're going to do something about it.
john_locke Sounds like a plan.
kate_austen They usually don't leave any trail.
james_ford It's worth a look. Let me ask you something. This whole scenario make sense to you?
kate_austen What do you mean?
james_ford Think about it. First off, how'd she get away? The woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds soaking wet.
kate_austen She was fighting for her life. People are capable of almost anything...
james_ford You couldn't get away. You versus Sun -- hot oil death match -- my money's on you, Sheena.
kate_austen Thanks for your vote of confidence.
kate_austen It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.
james_ford No it's not. This one's black, different weave. It's all in the details -- and they're wrong.
kate_austen Well, if it wasn't them, then who? What are you saying, one of us did it? Who the hell would want to go after Sun?
james_ford Not much upside to scaring the crap out of 46 people -- unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.
cassidy_phillips Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer. A 5 year old could tell that.
james_ford They ain't going to be looking at the necklaces. They're going to be looking at the price tags. It's all in the details, Dimples.
cassidy_phillips What if we get caught?
james_ford We ain't going to get caught. Anybody goes to the cops, the only thing they're going to remember is a guy that looks like he's been in a bar fight. -- You're scared, huh?
cassidy_phillips A little bit.
james_ford Well, here's the good news, baby -- everybody's scared. The thing they're scared of most is missing an opportunity.
james_ford Hey, you guys want to buy some necklaces?
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 Where'd you get them?
james_ford Where do you think? You want to buy them, or not? Oh, forget it.
cassidy_phillips Hey, how much?
james_ford 100 a piece.
cassidy_phillips For any of them?
james_ford Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.
cassidy_phillips I'll take the 1200 dollar one and the 1300 dollar one. Thanks.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 Hey, wait.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 #2 Hang on, man. I'll buy some of those.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 Yeah, me too. It's Gina's birthday next week.
GUY#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 #2 They love their jewelry.
dr_jack_shephard The pulse is good. Strong. We just need to watch her. She's going to be okay, man.
kate_austen That bump on her head -- do you think she fell or that someone hit her?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
kate_austen Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia? It's just -- the Others, I -- I was out there with you. I heard that man say that if we stayed away they'd leave us alone. And we've left them alone. So why would they attack us a few days later?
dr_jack_shephard Well, if it wasn't them then who was it?
kate_austen Like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia?
ana_lucia_cortez I got a couple more people interested in joining up.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, who?
ana_lucia_cortez Uh, the big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott.
dr_jack_shephard You mean Steve, Scott's dead.
ana_lucia_cortez Scott, Steve -- the point is, after what happened people are finally willing to do something.
dr_jack_shephard Where were you this morning?
ana_lucia_cortez Lots of places.
dr_jack_shephard During the rain storm.
ana_lucia_cortez You think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed? Now, where would you get an idea like that?
claire_littleton Jack! Jack, Sun's awake.
dr_jack_shephard Hey. How's your head? Any pain, dizziness?
sunhwa_kwon Just a little bit.
dr_jack_shephard Do you remember anything?
sunhwa_kwon I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up. Then it started raining and there was a bag over my head and I was being dragged.
dr_jack_shephard How many were there?
sunhwa_kwon I don't... I didn't see anything.
jinsoo_kwon 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 나한테도 말해봐!
sunhwa_kwon 당신한테 말한 것 그대로에요. I kicked and I fought, and I just ran as fast as I could and then I fell...
jinsoo_kwon 이렇게 당하고만 있을 수는 없어! 저 놈들을 잡아야 돼!
sunhwa_kwon 여보, 제발...
jinsoo_kwon 아니야! Gun. Gun! -- Gun.
kate_austen Hey, what's going on?
james_ford It looks like the good folks of Island Town are about to form a posse -- get themselves armed up. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack didn't find that horse of yours and start leading the charge in a big white hat.
kate_austen The guns. This is all her play to get her hands on the guns. Locke -- you need to go and tell him that they're coming.
james_ford I need to tell him?
kate_austen Sawyer, please.
cassidy_phillips So what's next?
james_ford Next?
cassidy_phillips Next play.
james_ford I'll show you the pigeon drop.
cassidy_phillips We already did that - twice. And the Tulsa Bag Scam and the Lookie-Loo. I want to do a big one.
james_ford You want to do a big what?
cassidy_phillips A big con.
james_ford It's called a long con.
cassidy_phillips Okay, a long con. How does it work?
james_ford It works by getting someone to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea, it's your idea. But none of that matters because the one thing you need for the long con we ain't got -- money.
cassidy_phillips I have money.
james_ford Sorry, Cassidy, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.
cassidy_phillips Remember what I told you, that I didn't get anything from the divorce?
james_ford Mmmhmm.
cassidy_phillips I kind of lied.
james_ford Kind of lied how much?
cassidy_phillips 600 grand.
james_ford Well, hell baby, with that kind of money let's go find an island somewhere and sit on a beach drinking Mojitos 'til we go toes up.
cassidy_phillips Sawyer, for the first time in my life I'm actually happy. And it's not really about the action and the money. It's about doing this with you. Come on, one long con? And then the mojitos.
james_ford I'll think about it.
cassidy_phillips Why don't you think about it in here?
james_ford Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doing. What are you doing?
john_locke I'm alphabetizing.
james_ford Oh, sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle and you figure it's a good time to start the damn Dewey decimal system. Good thinking.
john_locke How can I help you, James?
james_ford Well, actually, John, I'm here to help you -- give you the heads-up.
john_locke Heads-up?
james_ford Seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs. You should know he's not alone. The whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose. I'm guessing everybody's going to want to play Cowboys and Indians. And once those guns are out and about -- something tells me they ain't never going back in.
john_locke Why are you telling me this?
james_ford Because it'll piss off Jack. If I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto.
john_locke But that won't work. The door will just slow him down. If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in. Will you help me?
james_ford Help you what?
john_locke Move the guns.
james_ford Move them where? Fine, you don't want to trust me -- lots of luck.
john_locke But I can't leave the Hatch unmanned.
james_ford Sure, you move the guns and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.
john_locke How long 'til they get here?
james_ford Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours.
diane_janssen Steak sandwich, two beers.
james_ford Thank you.
gordy Aw, shucks, you got a beer for me?
james_ford You want one? Ask the lady.
gordy Well, hell, I do want one. And could I get a plate of chicken salad -- white meat only -- and please, god, no celery, okay, sweetheart?
diane_janssen That's how we make it here, darlin'.
gordy So, tell me you got her.
james_ford Yeah, I got her.
gordy All 600 grand?
james_ford All 6.
gordy You fell for her. Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding me.
james_ford Look, it's got nothing to...
gordy Hey, I found that bitch.
james_ford Her name is Cassidy.
gordy Well, I waited 6 months while you and Cassidy played house. Now, if you think--
james_ford I ain't doing it.
gordy You know what's making you stupid right now? It's your damn hormones. You think you're in love, but you're not. You know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James. You're a con man, just like me. And it's not what you do, it's what you are. Do I make myself clear?
james_ford I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.
gordy No, you're going to do it -- because that girl, she doesn't know you one bit. But when she finds out who you are -- who you really are -- she's going to hate your guts.
james_ford Yeah, well -- enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.
gordy Wait a minute, you don't walk away now. You owe me. You don't want to pay me? I'll put one in your ear, James. You and your little friend, Cassidy.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing here?
james_ford One second, I'm like this close to the high score on Donkey Kong.
jinsoo_kwon 뭘 기다려? 총을 빨리 꺼내자.
james_ford Now, what can I do you for?
dr_jack_shephard Where is Locke?
james_ford I don't know. I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.
james_ford Uh-oh, it looks like we've got ourselves a break-in. Who's going to call the cops?
dr_jack_shephard Where are they?
james_ford Don't look at me. I was just pushing a button. Oh yeah, I believe these are yours.
jinsoo_kwon No. 소이어는 신경 쓰지 마, 응? 그만 해.
dr_jack_shephard John, where are they? You moved the guns. Where are they? We had an agreement!
john_locke An agreement that you were about to violate, Jack. Yes, I moved the guns.
dr_jack_shephard Where? Where? Where, John?
john_locke Oh, are you going to start handing them out? How many? Who gets them? How much time before there's an accident? Another accident. I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot and now he's... He could be dead for all I know -- and that, that was my fault. I take responsibility for that and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns, too.
dr_jack_shephard I want 2 guns, John!
john_locke I'm sorry, Jack! That's the way it's going to be, Jack!
dr_jack_shephard 2 guns! Now tell me where they are, right now!
dr_jack_shephard You gave him the guns?
john_locke No. I hid them.
james_ford That's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are. You were so busy worrying about each other you never even saw me coming, did you? How about you listen up because I'm only going to say this once. You took my stuff. While I was off trying to get us help -- get us rescued -- you found my stash and you took it, divvied it up -- my shaving cream, my batteries, even my beer. And then something else happened, you decided these two boys here were going to tell you what to do and when to do it. Well, I'm done taking orders. And I don't want my stuff back. The shaving cream don't matter. Batteries don't matter. The only thing that matters now are guns. And if you want one you're going to have to come to me to get it! Oh, you want to torture me, don't you? Show everybody how civilized you are. Go ahead, but I'll die before I give them back. And then you'll really be screwed, won't you? New sheriff in town, boys! You all best get used to it.
cassidy_phillips What's going on? Where were you? Sawyer what happened?
james_ford You see that black car?
cassidy_phillips Who is it?
james_ford His name's Gordy, my partner.
cassidy_phillips What partner?
james_ford If I don't walk out the front door with that briefcase in the next 2 minutes we're both dead.
cassidy_phillips What happened? That's the guy from the Mercado deal? What...?
james_ford There is no Mercado deal! I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get go. Cass -- you were the long con.
cassidy_phillips Son of a bitch. Go to hell. Go to hell.
james_ford You've got to understand! Everything that's happened between us in the past 6 months, all of it -- that was real.
cassidy_phillips Get out! You get out!
james_ford Listen. You can hate me all you want later, but right now you've got to listen to me. He's going to kill us -- because I told him I wasn't going to take your money.
cassidy_phillips Oh my god.
james_ford Look, this is him. Okay, this is what we're going to do. I want you to go out back through Evan's yard. There's a rental car parked out front. Go to Sioux City. I want you to check in at the Sage Flower Motel, off highway 29. Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.. It'll all be over.
cassidy_phillips Let me just pack a few things.
james_ford There's no time. Remember when you said I was all you ever wanted? Well, now you know better. I love you.
cassidy_phillips I love you, too.
james_ford Go. Go.
kate_austen How'd you do it?
james_ford How'd I do what?
kate_austen Locke said that he left you in the Hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn. So, how'd you get them?
james_ford A magician never tells his secrets.
kate_austen You played us. You played me. All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia -- you knew I'd go to Jack. And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.
james_ford Now, how in the world would I know all that?
kate_austen Did you have anything to do with Sun?
james_ford What kind of person do you think I am?
kate_austen What kind of a person do I think you are? I don't think this has anything to do with guns, or with getting your stash back! I think you want people to hate you!
james_ford Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.
kate_austen Why do you have to do this?
james_ford You run. I con. Tiger don't change their stripes.
hugo_reyes Hey, check this out. I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book.
sayid_jarrah I want to show you something.
hugo_reyes Cool, you fixed it!
sayid_jarrah We'll see. Hold on to this. Don't expect anything. The chances of getting a signal are slim at best.
hugo_reyes Static's good, right?
sayid_jarrah No, reception is good.
hugo_reyes Wait, what's that?!
sayid_jarrah It's Rousseau's signal.
hugo_reyes Oh, crap.
sayid_jarrah But this radio has a wider bandwidth.
hugo_reyes Hold it, stop! Do you hear that?!
RADIO#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANNOUNCER That was the old classic "Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'" by Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, featuring Cootie Williams on the trumpet. Up next on WXR, the Glenn Miller Orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade".
hugo_reyes Whoa, you hear how clear that is? It's got to be close, right?
sayid_jarrah Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere. They can travel thousands of miles. It could be coming from anywhere.
hugo_reyes Or, anytime. -- Just kidding, dude.
james_ford He never saw you, huh?
charlie_pace No, he was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.
james_ford Figured you'd want your friends back.
charlie_pace If I wanted them I would have taken them before I told you where they were. That's not why I did it.
james_ford It's not, huh?
charlie_pace I wanted him to look like a fool -- to feel like a fool.
james_ford Well, well, it looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.
charlie_pace Sun can never find out what I did to her. Never.
james_ford Don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now.
charlie_pace Sawyer, this idea -- all of this -- what we did -- what made you... How does someone think of something like that?
james_ford Now go.
james_ford 1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, 3-Mississippi, 4-Mississippi, 5-Mississippi.
james_ford I'm not a good person, Charlie. Never did a good thing in my life.
