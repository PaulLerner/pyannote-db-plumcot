dr_christian_shephard Look here and here. You can see it's rotting out the spinal area, and plus all this extra dural growth -- I'm surprised it hasn't caused permanent ischemia.
angelo_busoni Digli di smettere di bisbigliare. Non sono un idiota.
gabriela_busoni He says you don't need to talk in whispers. He knows he doesn't have a chance.
dr_christian_shephard Your father appreciates candor.
gabriela_busoni We both do.
dr_christian_shephard Well, then tell him I'm very sorry but he's not a candidate for surgery.
gabriela_busoni Papà, lui è come gli altri. Non lo farà.
dr_christian_shephard The way the tumor is situated on the spine, it's just not possible to remove it.
angelo_busoni Non ci proverà? Perché?
gabriela_busoni He wants to know why you won't try.
dr_christian_shephard Because what your father is looking for is not a surgical procedure. What he is looking for is a miracle.
angelo_busoni Signore, non sono venuto fino a qui per lei. Sono venuto qui per suo figlio.
gabriela_busoni He said, "I did not come all this way for you, sir. I came for him .
dr_jack_shephard Ms. Busoni, I, uh...
gabriela_busoni You fixed someone with a crushed spinal column -- an impossible surgery -- and now she walks, yes? I consulted many medical journals before making this trip here.
dr_christian_shephard Then you should know it's a very different case under very different circumstances.
gabriela_busoni But a miracle, right?
dr_jack_shephard Look, everything that my father's saying -- the risks, the unlikelihood -- he's absolutely right.
gabriela_busoni But will you try?
dr_jack_shephard I'll have to admit him in the next couple of weeks, run some tests.
angelo_busoni La ringrazio... tantissimo.
dr_jack_shephard Locke!
dr_jack_shephard John.
michael_dawson Stay in there. Stay...
dr_jack_shephard Michael, what are you...?
michael_dawson Stay in there, Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Hey, whatever's going on...
michael_dawson Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son, and nobody is going to stop me, okay?! Okay, that is my right! That is a father's right!
dr_jack_shephard There's another way to go about this...
michael_dawson Get in the damn room!
dr_jack_shephard You going to shoot me, Michael?!
michael_dawson No, but I'll shoot your damn computer. Nothing is not what you think it is anyway. You don't understand, man. You don't have any idea. Now get in there!
dr_jack_shephard Michael, Michael, listen, we can do this together, okay? I'll come with you.
michael_dawson No, I have to do it. Now. I have to do it alone.
john_locke What happened?
dr_jack_shephard Michael knocked you out. Look over here
john_locke Why would he...?
dr_jack_shephard He went after Walt. You feel nauseated, sick?
john_locke No, I'm okay.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Give me a boost up.
john_locke It's no use. I bolted it shut from the inside.
dr_jack_shephard You what?
john_locke No point in changing the combination if you can get in through the air vent.
dr_jack_shephard That's really good thinking, John. You want to tell me why you let Michael in here?
john_locke He wanted a gun -- for shooting practice.
dr_jack_shephard Shooting practice?
john_locke The button. How long was I out?
dr_jack_shephard 20 minutes.
john_locke We're on shift for the next 4 hours. There's nobody coming down here.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, well, better hope Sawyer shows up to get his band-aid changed.
kate_austen Morning.
james_ford Did you just throw a banana at me?
kate_austen Couldn't find any rocks.
james_ford There are nicer ways to wake a man up, Freckles.
kate_austen Come on, it's time to go get your bandages changed.
james_ford Why can't you do it for me?
kate_austen Because I'm not your nurse, and Jack's got the bandages.
james_ford Of course he does. You want to give me a hand?
james_ford Thanks.
kate_austen Come on.
james_ford This place still creeps me out.
kate_austen You'll get used to it. Where is everybody? Jack! John!
james_ford Maybe they went out for ice cream.
kate_austen Shhh. Jack!
dr_jack_shephard In here, in the armory. Michael locked us in here.
james_ford What'd he say?
kate_austen I got it.
james_ford Hope you got the combo, Doc.
john_locke Right two times to 25.
james_ford 25, got it.
john_locke Left two times to 29. Right once to 40.
james_ford Howdy, boys.
john_locke What are you doing, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Going after him. .
james_ford Hey, what...? What happened?
john_locke Michael went after Walt.
james_ford Went after Walt?!
dr_jack_shephard Pulled a gun on me, put us both in there, and went after Walt. Hey, what are you doing?
james_ford What does it look like? I'm coming with you.
dr_jack_shephard You're still on antibiotics.
james_ford It's a good thing I'm traveling with my doctor, then.
gabriela_busoni How is he?
dr_jack_shephard I thought you'd gone home.
gabriela_busoni My home is a hotel room. I like it more here.
dr_jack_shephard I think you need to find a better hotel.
gabriela_busoni You didn't answer my question.
dr_jack_shephard His counts aren't where I'd like them to be.
gabriela_busoni You've been doing tests for a month now, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard I'm thorough.
gabriela_busoni I have a confession to make. I don't believe in miracles.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I guess I'm not too sure about them, either.
gabriela_busoni I bet your wife feels differently. Your wife, she's the woman you fixed, isn't she?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
gabriela_busoni I'm thorough, too. She must be a very special person to let you work until 430 in the morning.
dr_jack_shephard I completely lost track of... I've got to... Will you excuse me?
gabriela_busoni Yes, of course, go. And Jack, thank you.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, of course.
gabriela_busoni Good night.
dr_jack_shephard Good night.
sarah_shephard Hey, how is he?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, sorry to wake you.
sarah_shephard I had to get up anyway. So how is he?
dr_jack_shephard About the same. Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to... I just got...
sarah_shephard Hey, that's the price of being a miracle-worker.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you going?
sarah_shephard I have to go to the gym and then I've got some papers to grade. I didn't want to say anything until I knew either way, but, um, I was late, so, I got a pregnancy test.
sarah_shephard Don't worry. It's negative.
dr_jack_shephard Do you, um, want to talk about it?
sarah_shephard What's to talk about?
dr_jack_shephard Sarah, I...
sarah_shephard See you later, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Well?
john_locke Well, I can't tell you it's definitely Michael's, but it looks like his boot print.
kate_austen There's one over here, too.
john_locke That sounds like a trail.
kate_austen You got a gun for me?
dr_jack_shephard You're not coming.
kate_austen Excuse me?
dr_jack_shephard You're not coming. Someone has to be here to take care of the button.
kate_austen So why should that person be me? I can track, carry a gun...
dr_jack_shephard You're not coming! You're staying. Alright?
dr_jack_shephard Let's go.
james_ford What'd she do to you?
dr_jack_shephard What?
james_ford Kate, what'd she do?
dr_jack_shephard She didn't do anything.
james_ford Right, yelling at her because she wanted to help get Mike back makes a lot of sense.
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you go back and see if I hurt her feelings?
james_ford I'm just saying.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I know, you love her.
james_ford What'd you say?
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke Does any of this look familiar from when you were coming back?
james_ford Well, yeah, there's my favorite leaf. How could I forget this place?
dr_jack_shephard What's wrong?
john_locke When you came across the island what side was the ocean on? You came from the east, Michael's heading north.
james_ford What the hell's that supposed to mean?
dr_jack_shephard It means he's not going back to where you came from. He's heading somewhere else.
sunhwa_kwon 오늘 햇볕이 너무 따가워요.
jinsoo_kwon 필요 없어.
sunhwa_kwon 알아요. 그래도 그냥 쓰고 있어요.
jinsoo_kwon 무슨 일이 있나봐.
sunhwa_kwon Hello, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Hey. Cool hat, dude.
sunhwa_kwon Is Kate alright?
hugo_reyes Uh, yeah. I guess Michael took off.
jinsoo_kwon 뭐라고 하는 거야?
sunhwa_kwon What do you mean he took off?
hugo_reyes He stole some guns and he went all commando. He said he was going after Walt. Later dudes, gotta get to the hatch.
sunhwa_kwon 지금 뭐 하는 거에요?
jinsoo_kwon 금방 떠났다니까 충분히 따라잡을 수 있을거야.
sunhwa_kwon 당신 아무데도 못 가요. 못 간다니까? 여기서 한 발짝도 움직이지 마! 당신이 뗏목 타고 나갔을 때... 내가 얼마나 걱정했는 줄 알아요? 살아있는지, 죽었는지도 모르고... 정말 미쳐버리는 줄 알았어! 다시는 그러고 싶지 않아요.
jinsoo_kwon 마이클은 내 친구야.
sunhwa_kwon 나는 당신 아내에요.
james_ford Hey, Doc, you want to slow down -- take a break a minute?
john_locke Good idea.
dr_jack_shephard He still heading north?
john_locke Yep.
dr_jack_shephard Do you think he's lost?
john_locke Doesn't seem to be. Trail's as straight as the interstate. The path of a man who knows where he's going. Where are you going, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard What?
john_locke Well, let's say we catch up with him -- Michael. What are you going to do?
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to bring him back.
john_locke What if he doesn't want to come back?
dr_jack_shephard I'll talk him into coming back.
john_locke This is the second time he's gone after Walt. He knocked me out, he locked us both up. Something tells me he might be past listening to reason.
dr_jack_shephard What? You think we should just let him go -- write him off?
john_locke Who are we to tell anyone what they can or can't do?
dr_jack_shephard It's not too late to go back. The tumor's aggressive, but your father could lead a very normal life for at least another year.
gabriela_busoni Go back? Go back where? Home? Have you changed your mind, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard No. No.
gabriela_busoni Is that it? Even if you don't succeed, you're giving us a chance. That's all we wanted.
dr_jack_shephard I'll come out and check on you before I scrub in.
gabriela_busoni Okay.
dr_christian_shephard Am I interrupting?
gabriela_busoni No, I was just leaving. I'll see you in the morning.
dr_jack_shephard I'll see you in the morning.
dr_christian_shephard ITR reports need to be signed by you as Chief Resident.
dr_jack_shephard What?
dr_christian_shephard Careful. There's a line, son. You know it's there. And pretending it's not -- that would be a mistake.
dr_jack_shephard Guess you would know.
dr_christian_shephard It may be okay for some people, Jack. But not for you.
james_ford Are you sure Mike went this way?
john_locke Why do you ask?
james_ford Oh, I don't know, Mr. Clean, I probably would have gone around Mt. Vesuvius.
john_locke Why'd you pick that name?
james_ford Ain't it obvious? All you need's an earring and a mop.
john_locke No, your name. Why'd you pick Sawyer?
james_ford What do you mean, pick?
john_locke After the census Hurley gave me the flight manifest. Your name is James, right? James Ford.
james_ford What's it to you?
john_locke Just an interesting name to choose, is all. Who'd you get it from?
james_ford Who says I got it from anybody?
dr_jack_shephard Michael!
john_locke Jack, get down.
dr_jack_shephard Michael!
john_locke Jack! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard Michael! Michael!
john_locke Jack.
dr_jack_shephard What? He's close.
john_locke Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone you want them coming back?
james_ford Personally, hell, yeah.
dr_jack_shephard You said these people were two days across the island.
james_ford Yeah, and they took Cindy less than a mile from our camp.
john_locke Over here.
dr_jack_shephard Shell casings. How many?
john_locke 3, Michael's.
james_ford You boys deaf? I heard at least 7 shot. You heard it, Daniel Boone, what's your count?
john_locke Yeah, 7 sounds about right.
james_ford It's getting dark. Which way did Mike go?
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard You out here for Michael, or -- is this pay back for getting shot?
james_ford Why are you out here, Doc? You got your reasons and I got mine.
dr_christian_shephard Jack. Jack!
dr_jack_shephard I had it!
dr_christian_shephard I know, son.
dr_jack_shephard I got it! I got it all! I mean, I had it!
dr_christian_shephard He was a sick old man on a table for 7 and half hours. His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.
dr_jack_shephard I've got to go tell her.
dr_christian_shephard Yeah, well, I've already done that. Lest you forget, I am still Chief of Surgery.
dr_jack_shephard Where is she?
dr_christian_shephard Maybe you should go home.
dr_jack_shephard Where is she?
dr_christian_shephard She's gone. Jack, go home.
gabriela_busoni Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Gabriela, my father told me that you'd gone. I, uh -- I, uh --
gabriela_busoni Thank you. Thank you for trying.
dr_jack_shephard I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
gabriela_busoni It's okay.
dr_jack_shephard I, I'm... I can't.
james_ford What do you mean you lost it?
john_locke He's a man, not a boar. The sign's more subtle. I need light to follow it.
dr_jack_shephard Here, light.
john_locke I think we'd better head back.
james_ford What?
dr_jack_shephard Just find the trail, John.
john_locke I've lost the trail.
dr_jack_shephard You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
john_locke Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running in the jungle toward the sound of gunfire because I don't care about Michael.
dr_jack_shephard Don't turn around on me, John.
john_locke You're not going to get him to come back and you know it.
dr_jack_shephard You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
angelo_busoni You're exactly right, Jack! But if I were you, I'd listen to Mr. Locke.
dr_jack_shephard Who are you?
james_ford He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft.
angelo_busoni Why don't you point the gun down?
angelo_busoni It'd probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides, gentlemen.
dr_jack_shephard Where's Michael?
angelo_busoni Don't worry about Michael. He's not going to find us.
dr_jack_shephard What do you want?
angelo_busoni Why don't you build us a fire, John? I think it's time we all had a talk.
hugo_reyes Geronimo Jackson?
charlie_pace Well, hooo, as an expert in all things musical -- I've never heard of these guys, shocking as that may be. Geronimo Jackson?
hugo_reyes This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.
hugo_reyes So what do you think's the story with that Libby chick?
charlie_pace The story?
hugo_reyes She's kind of cute, right? You know, in a I've-been-terrorized-by-the-Others-for-40-days kind of way.
charlie_pace Yeah, there is that.
hugo_reyes I think I have a chance with her. I mean, it's the classic desert island scenario. If I ever had a shot, this is it.
charlie_pace Do you think Claire's missed me yet?
hugo_reyes Dude, it's been a day.
sayid_jarrah This music is quite depressing.
hugo_reyes We can change it, dude. Did you ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?
sayid_jarrah I'm afraid not. Where's Jack and Locke?
hugo_reyes Oh, they went after Michael.
sayid_jarrah Michael?
charlie_pace Yeah, he's run after Walt again. Everyone's gone to bring him back.
sayid_jarrah Who's everyone?
hugo_reyes Everyone -- Jack, Sawyer, Locke. Oh, and Kate.
angelo_busoni Just sit down, Jack. Nobody's going to hurt you. I come in peace.
john_locke How do you know our names?
dr_jack_shephard You took Walt.
angelo_busoni Walt's fine. He's a very special boy.
dr_jack_shephard Look, you said you wanted to talk. Talk.
angelo_busoni Let me ask you something. How long you been here on the island?
dr_jack_shephard 50 days.
angelo_busoni Oooo, 50 days. That's what -- almost 2 whole months, huh? Tell me, you go over a man's house for the first time, do you take off your shoes? Do you put your feet up on his coffee table? Do you walk in the kitchen, eat food that doesn't belong to you? Open the door to rooms you got no business opening? You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said "Since the dawn of our species man's been blessed with curiosity." You know the other one about curiosity don't you, Jack? This is not your island. This is our island. And the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it.
dr_jack_shephard I don't believe you.
angelo_busoni You don't believe what?
dr_jack_shephard I think you've got one guy up there with a gun. I think there's more of us than there are of you. I think if you had any real strength, you wouldn't have had to send a spy -- Ethan.
angelo_busoni That's an interesting theory. Light 'em up!
angelo_busoni We've got a misunderstanding, Jack -- your people, my people. So listen carefully. Right here, there's a line. You cross that line, we go from misunderstanding to something else. Now, give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
dr_jack_shephard No.
john_locke Jack, maybe...
dr_jack_shephard No!
angelo_busoni I hoped it wouldn't come to this. Bring her out, Alex!
angelo_busoni She was following you. Like I said -- curiosity.
angelo_busoni Don't. -- Jack, the decision you gotta make right now is this -- can you live with the fact that I shot this woman right in front of you when you could have saved her life by giving up and going home? Or are you going to give me your guns, turn around and walk away. It's your call, Jack.
james_ford You touch a hair on her head, I'll...
angelo_busoni Shut up! I'm going to count to 3. 1, 2...
dr_jack_shephard Stop.
angelo_busoni Now them.
angelo_busoni Give me the other one, too.
james_ford You and me ain't done, Zeke.
kate_austen Jack, I, uh...
dr_jack_shephard You alright?
kate_austen Yep.
sunhwa_kwon 혼자 여기서 뭐해?
jinsoo_kwon 잠이 오지 않아서...
sunhwa_kwon 사람들은 돌아 왔어요?
jinsoo_kwon 아직... 자기야. 이래라저래라 하는거 내가 제일 싫어하는 거 알지?
sunhwa_kwon 지난 4년 동안, 난 항상 그렇게 살아왔어요. 당신이 싫은 것처럼, 나도 싫어.
jinsoo_kwon 그래. 당신도 그랬을 거야.
kate_austen I was just trying to help, Jack. When you told me not to go, I just... I made a mistake. Hey, could you just talk to me for a second. -- I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
sarah_shephard Hey. How did it go?
dr_jack_shephard He died.
sarah_shephard I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, me too. Who was over?
sarah_shephard My mom.
dr_jack_shephard The bridge game okay?
sarah_shephard Oh yeah, she's on a streak. Did you eat?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. No, it's uh, it's late. I'm fine.
sarah_shephard You don't have to do that.
dr_jack_shephard It's therapeutic -- cheaper than a shrink.
sarah_shephard How did the daughter take it? What's her name, Gabriela?
dr_jack_shephard She kissed me. Yeah, she... she kissed me and I kissed her back. I, I don't know. I don't know how it happened. I made a mistake. I made a mistake and this is my fault. It's my fault that you and me... I haven't been here. Sarah, I mean, we don't even talk anymore. I hate what's happening to us and I promise you that things are going to be different. I'm going to, I'm going to work less. I'm going to be here for you. Okay? I'm going to fix this. We're going to go back to the way things were. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix this.
sarah_shephard Jack. Jack, I'm leaving you.
dr_jack_shephard What?
sarah_shephard I was already leaving you. That's why my mother was here. She was helping me pack. I've been seeing someone -- someone else. I have to... I can't stay.
dr_jack_shephard Sarah.
sarah_shephard You, you will always need something to fix. -- Goodbye.
john_locke See ya, James.
james_ford Don't beat yourself up, Freckles. If he'd told me to stay behind, I'd have done the same damn thing.
john_locke What's the matter? What's the matter with your little foot? Hi. Hi.
claire_littleton Who's that?
john_locke Uh-oh, you don't like old Uncle Johnny.
claire_littleton What is he doing to your toe?
ana_lucia_cortez Hey, go away. I barely have enough food to feed myself. Here.
dr_jack_shephard I see you found a new friend.
ana_lucia_cortez Progress. I hear you were out looking for Michael.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
ana_lucia_cortez He ran off looking for his kid again? Not much you can do about that then.
dr_jack_shephard Is it true that you killed one of them?
ana_lucia_cortez One of who?
dr_jack_shephard Them. Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
ana_lucia_cortez I was a cop.
dr_jack_shephard Can I ask you something?
ana_lucia_cortez Shoot.
dr_jack_shephard How long do you think it would take to train an army?
