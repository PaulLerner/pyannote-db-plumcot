james_ford Hell of a book. It's about bunnies.
kate_austen Must be cold without your trunks.
james_ford You bet. How about you come a little closer and warm me up?
kate_austen You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer.
jessica You're incredible Sawyer.
james_ford I love you. Look at you. What do you want, right now?
jessica How could I want anything else?
jessica Oh, uh-oh, baby.
james_ford Oh, what.
jessica I thought you had a meeting.
james_ford Yeah, but it's not until 330.
jessica Baby, it's 328.
james_ford Damn it. Damn it. Baby, why don't you just, uh...
jessica No, just go. You go, okay, I'll stay here -- order room service, get fat.
james_ford Why don't you order a chocolate sundae -- when I get back, I'll use you as a dish.
james_ford You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
james_ford What are you doing in my stuff, son?
dr_jack_shephard This is going to hurt. Ready to tell me what happened?
sayid_jarrah We were trying to find the source of the distress call. I saw the flare from the beach and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle. I switched on my antenna, activated the transceiver, and then -- darkness. Whoever hit me came from behind.
dr_jack_shephard And destroyed the equipment?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Listen, we're going to figure this out, but don't do anything...
sayid_jarrah I will do whatever I need to do to find the man responsible.
shannon_rutherford We need some help over here.
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
boone_carlyle Sawyer.
charlie_pace Morning delivery.
claire_littleton Awww, you're sweet, thanks.
charlie_pace Well, I figured in your condition, with the extra baggage, you know...
claire_littleton Well, I can still walk.
charlie_pace Barely. Anyway, I worry about you out here. You know, it's very -- sunny.
claire_littleton Thus, my hat.
charlie_pace There's plenty of hats in the caves. And we've got a doctor there, as well. That'll come in handy.
claire_littleton I like the beach, Charlie.
charlie_pace Yeah, who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas.
claire_littleton I want to be here -- for when we get rescued.
charlie_pace When we get rescued, right.
boone_carlyle Jack, it's fine. It's just a scrape.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, lot's of scrapes today. I'm running out of peroxide.
boone_carlyle He just jumped me man. I didn't...
dr_jack_shephard Why?
boone_carlyle Shannon has asthma.
dr_jack_shephard Asthma?
boone_carlyle Yeah.
dr_jack_shephard I've never seen her have an attack before.
boone_carlyle Because she had an inhaler. She's sneaks hits when no one's looking. She's been embarrassed about it since she was a little kid. I guess breathing's not cool.
dr_jack_shephard Had an inhaler?
boone_carlyle It ran out a couple of days ago. But I had 4 refills which should have been enough for a couple of months. But she always forgets her medication so I put it my suitcase. Today I see that jackass reading Watership Down.
dr_jack_shephard You're losing me.
boone_carlyle It was in my bags, the stuff that I checked. If he has my book he has my luggage, if he has the luggage he has the inhalers. Her breathing got really rough today, man. If she has an attack, it's not going to be good.
dr_jack_shephard Where is it?
james_ford Hey, Doc. Long time no see.
dr_jack_shephard Where is it?
james_ford Where's what?
dr_jack_shephard The girl's asthma medicine. Shannon -- her inhalers.
james_ford Oh, that.
dr_jack_shephard You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister.
james_ford No, I whooped a thief cuz he was going through my stuff.
dr_jack_shephard Yours? What makes it yours? What, you think you can just take something out of a suitcase and that makes it yours?
james_ford Which I had to move because everybody just wants to help themselves. Look, I don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town, but down here possession's 9/10ths. And a man's got a right to protect his property.
dr_jack_shephard Get up.
james_ford Why, you want to see who's taller?
dr_jack_shephard Get up.
james_ford You sure you want to make this your problem, Doc?
dr_jack_shephard Oh yeah. I'm sure.
kate_austen Hey, what's going on here?
jessica You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal.
james_ford Just trust me, there isn't any time to explain. I'm already late. I miss this meeting, the whole deal's a bust, alright? That's everything I have. 140,000 dollars. There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling platforms. 300,000 dollars buys one share, but as soon as you invest a Government sponsored fund kicks in and triples your money in two weeks. Triples it.
jessica 300,000?
james_ford Yeah.
jessica You've got 140.
james_ford I found an investor in Toronto -- wants in 50/50. In two weeks we'll be splitting almost a million bucks. Jess, this is my chance.
jessica There's another option.
james_ford Yeah, and what's that?
jessica That I give you the 160,000 and we split the profit.
james_ford Yeah, and how in the hell are you going to scare up 160,000 bucks?
jessica My husband.
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to kill him.
kate_austen That's not going to help us get the medicine.
dr_jack_shephard Maybe not, but it'll feel good.
kate_austen So what's stopping you?
dr_jack_shephard We're not savages, Kate. Not yet.
kate_austen Let me talk to Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
kate_austen He says we have a connection.
dr_jack_shephard Do you?
kate_austen Please.
kate_austen What do you want?
james_ford Excuse me?
kate_austen What do you want, Sawyer?
james_ford Freckles, I got so many answers to that question, I wouldn't even know where to start.
kate_austen What do you want for the inhalers?
james_ford Ah, good question. Hang on a tick. What do I want? A kiss ought to do it.
kate_austen What?
james_ford A kiss, from you, right now?
kate_austen I don't buy it.
james_ford Buy what?
kate_austen The act. You try too hard, Sawyer. I ask you to help a woman who can't breath and you want me to kiss you? Nobody's that disgusting. I've seen you, you know.
james_ford Seen me what?
kate_austen With that piece of paper -- the one you keep in your pocket. Seen the expression on your face when you read it and how carefully you fold it up. It means something to you. So you can play games all you want, but I know there's a human being in there somewhere. Give me the medication.
james_ford You think you understand me?
kate_austen Yeah. I think I have...
james_ford Shut up. You want to know what kind of human being I am? Read it. Read it. Out loud.
kate_austen Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who I am but I know who you are and I know what you done. You had sex with my mother and then you stole my dad's money all away. So he got angry and he killed my mother and then he killed himself, too.
james_ford Don't stop now. You're just getting to the good part.
kate_austen All I know is your name. But one of these days I'm going to find you and I'm going to give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me. You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer.
james_ford Now about that kiss... I didn't think so.
sayid_jarrah Locke, where were you last night, around sunset?
john_locke Well, I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar that I was skinning for our dinner. I heard you were trying to send out a distress call. So it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the Island. Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances? And from what I've seen you and Mr. Sawyer share a certain animosity.
sayid_jarrah No, he has an alibi. Just before I was struck, he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we had worked out -- 2 kilometers away. He wouldn't have the time to go...
john_locke Unless he found a way to time delay the fuse on his rocket.
sayid_jarrah How could he possibly have...
john_locke Anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse. Use a cigarette. Just in case there's a next time.
boone_carlyle Just try to breathe. Breathe. Come on Shann work with me.
dr_jack_shephard Give me the inhalers -- now.
james_ford Hell, I wondered when you were going to stop asking nice.
james_ford Well, it's about time, cowboy. Been telling you since day one, we're in the wild. Didn't think you had it in you.
james_ford That all you got?
james_ford I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
jessica Why not?
james_ford Because business between friends is always a little sticky. I don't know you well, but I know your wife. Working with her at the auto dealership, I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.
david Louisiana will invest two thirds of the drilling costs. What is this? A loophole?
james_ford Look, David, you're reluctant. I get it. You got your lumbar yard, you don't need this.
jessica You should do this.
david Jess, I don't even know this guy.
jessica Show him the cash.
david How do I know this is real?
james_ford The money? Hell, how about you hold on to it for a night. Check it out. I want you to feel secure. You know what? Let's not do this. I've got another investor who's already committed.
jessica David?
james_ford This should cover lunch. And I'll see you Monday . David.
jessica David?
david Wait.
claire_littleton Warm fluffy towels. Your turn.
charlie_pace Uh, banoffee pie.
claire_littleton You already said that.
charlie_pace Toffee and cream, mmmm.
claire_littleton Is food the only thing that you miss?
charlie_pace You're pregnant. I mean, do you not crave anything? Pickles, fried ice cream, chocolate?
claire_littleton Peanut butter. I'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter.
charlie_pace I could get you peanut butter.
claire_littleton Yeah, sure you can.
charlie_pace Yes, I can. And when I get you peanut butter you have to vacate this sandy shore of depression and move to the caves. Deal?
claire_littleton Deal.
boone_carlyle Help, she's not breathing! The attacks are getting worse.
dr_jack_shephard Shannon, listen to me. Look at me, look at me. You need to listen now. This isn't just the asthma, it's anxiety. It's in your head.
shannon_rutherford No.
dr_jack_shephard Yes. You know that your medicine's run out and you're panicking. Shannon, Shannon, look at me. We can fight this, together, okay? Nod your head, Shannon. Good. Breathe in through...
boone_carlyle She needs her inhaler.
dr_jack_shephard Boone! Breathe in through your nose, slowly. No, no, no. In through the nose, like this. You can do this Shannon. You can do it. In through the nose. You got your breath. Yeah. Your color's coming back. See, I knew you could do this. Do you feel it?
shannon_rutherford Yes.
dr_jack_shephard It's passing. Okay. Again, in through the nose. Alright, just keep doing that. Keep breathing like that. That's perfect, good job.
dr_jack_shephard Keep her relaxed. Do not let her panic.
boone_carlyle Yeah. Yeah.
hugo_reyes Wow, man. That was awesome. I mean, that was like a -- Jedi moment.
sayid_jarrah Jack, what will happen if she doesn't get the medicine? Then we have to make Sawyer give it to us.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
sayid_jarrah No, not you, me. I served 5 years in the Republican Guard.
dr_jack_shephard I thought you were a communications officer?
sayid_jarrah Part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate. Just give me 10 minutes with him. He'll give us the medicine. Is that a yes?
dr_jack_shephard Yes.
hugo_reyes Food from the plane's been gone for over a week, dude.
charlie_pace What, no secret stash for emergencies? You and Jack have got a bunch of stuff in that cave.
hugo_reyes Sorry, man. No peanut butter. No peanuts. No nothing.
charlie_pace Yeah, but, there's got to be something. I mean, look at you.
hugo_reyes Look at what?
charlie_pace No, no. Listen.
hugo_reyes Fat guy hoarding the food, is that what you think?
charlie_pace No. It's just we've been here for two weeks and you've not really...
hugo_reyes Slimmed down much?
charlie_pace All I need is a bag of peanuts.
hugo_reyes I have no food, alright?! And for the record, I'm down a notch in my belt. I'm a big guy, it's going to be a while before you're going to want to give me a piggy back ride, okay?
charlie_pace Sorry. Sorry, that was bad form.
hugo_reyes Yeah. I'm used to it.
charlie_pace So, not even a bag of...
hugo_reyes Dude.
charlie_pace Okay. Alright, I'm sorry.
michael_dawson Aaah, damn, stupid...
sunhwa_kwon Michael -- the sick girl.
michael_dawson Yeah. Asthma.
sunhwa_kwon Yes, asthma. I think I can help her.
sayid_jarrah Good morning.
kate_austen What are you doing? Jack!
dr_jack_shephard This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.
kate_austen If you do this!
james_ford Well, ain't you the brave one, jumping a guy while he's napping. Uh-oh, I'm in trouble now, ain't I?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing. Now, all I want is the asthma medicine. Just tell me where the inhalers are and we'll stop.
james_ford Stop what, Chico?
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't have to be this way.
james_ford Yeah, it does.
sayid_jarrah We do not have bamboo in Iraq, although we do have something similar -- reeds. But their effect is the same when the shoots are inserted underneath the fingernails.
james_ford You know what I think, Ali. I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life.
sayid_jarrah Unfortunately for us both, you're wrong.
james_ford That's it? That's all you got? Splinters? No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf...
dr_jack_shephard Sayid. Sayid!
james_ford No. Don't stop now. I think my sinuses are clearing.
dr_jack_shephard What the hell is wrong with you?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps losing an eye will loosen your tongue?
james_ford Okay, okay.
sayid_jarrah Where is it?
james_ford The only person I'll tell is her.
dr_jack_shephard Kate?
james_ford That's the deal.
kilo Tell me Sawyer, do you want to die? Because when a man walks in my place and tells me he left a 160,000 of my hard won dollars in the care of a civilian I've got to ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't the desperate cry for the sweet release of death.
james_ford Deal closed today. See, women are easy -- a few cosmos, a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets, and they think the scam's their idea. Now husbands, they need to touch the money, smell it -- believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away, they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.
kilo Okay, Tex. You got your grift so pat, what'd you need my money for? Where's your seed from the last couple you roped?
james_ford Well, what can I say? I like earning it as much as I like spending it.
kilo Be that as it may, I know a thing or two about making people suffer. Now you have my money, plus 50%, by noon tomorrow or I'll tell you all about it.
kate_austen So I'm here. Where is it?
james_ford Happy to tell you, as soon as I get that kiss.
kate_austen What? Are you serious?
james_ford Baby, I am tied to a tree in a jungle of mystery. I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a gen-u-ine I-raqi. Of course, I'm serious. You're just not seeing the big picture here, Freckles. You really going to let that girl suffocate because you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss? Hell, it's only first base. Lucky for you I ain't greedy.
kate_austen Okay.
james_ford Okay.
james_ford I don't have it.
kate_austen What?
james_ford The medicine. I don't have it, never did.
kate_austen The book -- they said you found it in their luggage.
james_ford The book washed up on shore, went in the drink with the rest of-
kate_austen He doesn't have it.
dr_jack_shephard What?
sayid_jarrah He's lying. Can't you see that? He's been lying from the beginning. He doesn't want us to get off this Island. That's why he attacked me.
dr_jack_shephard Hold on a minute.
sayid_jarrah He destroyed the transceiver!
dr_jack_shephard You don't know that. Sayid!
dr_jack_shephard You hit an artery. Keep still damn it. Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves, my leather backpack. Go.
kate_austen Can you make it stop?
boone_carlyle Whose blood is that? Whose blood is that?
sayid_jarrah Sawyer.
boone_carlyle You went after Sawyer and you didn't even tell me? She's my sister.
shannon_rutherford Boone, don't leave me alone, okay?
boone_carlyle I'm not going anywhere, okay?
shannon_rutherford Okay.
michael_dawson Are these the right ones? I think I found the right tree, but I'm guessing.
sunhwa_kwon Just let me see. Oh yes, good.
jinsoo_kwon 이 놈이랑 뭐하고 있어! 이 놈이랑 왜 몰래 웃는거지? 응? 뭐야! (What are you doing with him? Why are you sneaking around with this man? What’s going on?)
michael_dawson Don't, man. I'm telling you, don't.
james_ford Let go. I know you want to.
dr_jack_shephard Shut up. And stop moving.
james_ford You've been waiting for this, haven't you? Now you get to be the hero again, because that's what you do -- fix everything up all nice. Tell him to let go, Freckles. We already made out, what else I got to live for? Hey, Jack, there's something you should know -- if the tables were turned, I'd watch you die.
james_ford Alrighty. It looks like we're in the oil business.
david We're cool?
james_ford Oh, we're cool.
david We get the money back?
james_ford Week from tomorrow, tripled.
david You're not going to skip town, are you?
jessica David, for god's sake, he left all his money with us. We could've skipped town.
james_ford Smart woman you got there, David. Don't let her go.
jessica Hi, baby. What are you doing up? Are you feeling better?
boy Will you read to me?
jessica In a minute sweetheart. We have company right now.
david You okay?
james_ford Deal's off.
david Excuse me?
james_ford Deal's off, forget it.
jessica What are you doing?
david Hold on, what is this, a joke?
james_ford I'm calling it off, walking away.
david You're not walking out of here. You know what I had to do for this? All this money in one day?!
james_ford Take your hand off me, boy.
jessica Sawyer?
david What's going on here?
jessica This isn't how is was supposed to work. You said that we were...!
david Said? What'd he say Jessica?
kate_austen You're lucky to be alive.
james_ford Jack?
kate_austen Went to the caves to check on Shannon. I read it again, and then again, because I've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication. Why you pretended to have it anyway. The thing that I keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated. Then I looked at the envelope -- America's bicentennial, Knoxville, TN. You were just a kid, 8 maybe 9 years old.
james_ford Kate.
kate_austen This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter. Your name's not Sawyer, is it?
james_ford It was his name. He was a confidence man. Romanced my momma to get to the money, wiped them out clean, left a mess behind. So I wrote that letter. I wrote it knowing one day I'd find him. But that ain't the sad part. When I was 19, I needed 6 grand to pay these guys off I was in trouble with. So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money. And I got them to give it to me. How's that for a tragedy? I became the man I was hunting. Became Sawyer. Don't you feel sorry for me. . Get the hell out. Get out!
boone_carlyle I don't know. It's a miracle. She just showed up with that mixture. She rubbed it on Shannon's chest and 10 minutes later she was breathing.
dr_jack_shephard Eucalyptus -- smart, Jack. Thank you, very much.
claire_littleton What are you doing?
charlie_pace Packing your stuff, you're moving to the caves.
claire_littleton You didn't? Peanut butter? No way.
charlie_pace Just like you ordered. Oh, there is one thing. It's extra smooth.
claire_littleton That's okay.
claire_littleton It's empty.
charlie_pace What? No, no it's not. It's full, full to the brim, with stick to the roof of your mouth, oh, god, makes you want a glass of milk extra smooth. It's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted. You want some?
kate_austen Sayid?
sayid_jarrah I can't stay here.
kate_austen What?
sayid_jarrah I'm leaving. I don't know for how long.
kate_austen Sayid, you can't. We still don't know what's out there.
sayid_jarrah I've worse things to fear than what's in the jungle. What I did today, what I almost did, I swore to do never again. If I can't keep that promise, I have no right to be here.
kate_austen There's nowhere to go.
sayid_jarrah Someone has to walk the shore and map the Island, see what else there is. I can't think of a better person to do it than the only one I trust. I hope we meet again.
