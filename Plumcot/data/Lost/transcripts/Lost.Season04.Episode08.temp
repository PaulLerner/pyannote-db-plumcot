LOCKE Thank you all for your patience. I know it's taken me a few days to... figure out our next move, but I didn't want to do anything until I knew more about our situation. You deserve to know everything that I do, so... no more secrets. As you all know, Miles here and three of his people came to the Island about a week ago. So I brought him up from the boathouse to share with us exactly why they're here.
MILES We're here for him.
HURLEY Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago.
SAWYER Well, all right then. Problem solved. How soon do we turn him over?
LOCKE We can't turn him over.
SAWYER And why the hell not?
BEN Because once they have me, their orders are to kill everyone else on the Island.
CLAIRE Wait. So... what, he's one of us now? You're—you're gonna protect him? He tried to kill you, John.
HURLEY Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.
BEN It's Michael.
HURLEY What?
BEN My spy on the freighter is Michael.
SAWYER I'm sorry. You mean the same guy that killed two women in cold blood to set this little bastard free? And then sold all of us out so he could get off the island? That Michael?
LOCKE Yes, James. That Michael.
GAULT The rules of desertion... still apply to everyone.
GAULT Nobody leaves this ship without my say-so! I'm not beating these men to scare you! I beat them to save your lives! Do you remember what happened to the last two men who took off in this boat?
GAULT You remember what happened to Minkowski? As soon as we get the engines fixed, we're back in the hunt. In the meantime, everybody just hold on. Johnson!
MICHAEL Yes, sir.
GAULT Clean this mess up.
MICHAEL Yes, sir.
SAYID Hello, Michael.
MICHAEL Not now, man. 
SAYID Yes. Right now.
SAYID Why are you on this boat?
MICHAEL I'm here to die.
SAWYER Hey!
SAWYER That's a nice meetin', John, but I thought there wasn't gonna be more secrets.
JOHN What are you talking about?
SAWYER I'm talking about the 3 million bucks your buddy here asked for.
SAWYER Well?
JOHN Yeah. Miles offered his loyalty in exchange for the money. But as I haven't seen a bank on the island, I didn't think it worth mentioning.
SAWYER Somethin' funny?
MILES Linus will find a way to get it.
SAWYER And how will he do that?
MILES He wants to survive. And considering a week ago you had a gun to his head, and tonight he's eating pound cake... I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.
CLAIRE It's fine.
KARL Okay, thanks.
ALEX Bye.
CLAIRE Bye, guys.
ALEX Bye.
BEN Alex?
BEN May I have a word with you?
ROUSSEAU I think we've heard enough from you for one night.
BEN I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to listen to a little more.
ALEX It's okay. What do you want?
BEN This is a map to the Temple.
BEN It's a sanctuary. It may be the last safe place on this island.
KARL How come we don't know about this?
BEN Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it? The rest of our people are already there. If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.
KARL If it's safe, why don't we all go — Hurley, Claire, the baby?
BEN Because the Temple's not for them, Karl. It's only for us. These people that are coming — they know who I am, Alex. They're here to capture me. They'll kill anybody that gets in their way. If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter, they would use you to get to me. We don't have much time.
KARL Maybe he's right.
ROUSSEAU I agree. We should go.
ALEX These people — you said they're dangerous. More dangerous than you?
BEN Yes. But your mother will protect you. Okay, now go.
SAYID Where is he?
CREW-MEMBER Engine room.
SAYID You sure?
CREW-MEMBER Yeah.
SAYID He's in the engine room.
MICHAEL I don't understand, It should be working.
JEFF Gaskets are all corroded.
MICHAEL Can I help you?
SAYID The captain sent us down to help with the repairs.
MICHAEL Oh, thanks. We're okay. Hey, Jeff, man, you know what? We need a pressure valve. You mind grabbing one from the, uh, supply room?
JEFF Not at all.
MICHAEL You shouldn't be here.
MICHAEL Hey! Uhh! Aah!
DESMOND Hey Sayid, what are you doing?
SAYID Why are you here?
MICHAEL Listen, if they see me talking to you—
SAYID Then talk quickly!
MICHAEL You won't understand it!
SAYID I'll understand perfectly, Michael. You just start from the beginning and explain how you came to be on this boat.
MICHAEL I'm sorry 
LIBBY I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, Mr. Dawson.
MICHAEL It's... what happened to me?
LIBBY You were in a car accident. It's a miracle you're alive.
MICHAEL How badly am I hurt?
LIBBY Shh. You just need to rest now.
LIBBY It's a cold night.
MICHAEL Uhh!
LIBBY I brought you some extra blankets.
MICHAEL Aah!
NURSE Ah. Let's get some light in here. Now, I thought I heard someone shout, and something tells me it wasn't him. You okay? You're lucky to be alive. E.M.T. say they found you in a wrecked car with a note pinned to your chest. You didn't have any I.D. on you. Want to tell me your name? Yeah, I didn't think so. You want me to call Walt?
MICHAEL What?
NURSE The note pinned to your chest. It was written to "Walt." You want me to call him?
MICHAEL No.
NURSE Okay, then.
MICHAEL Hey, ma.
MICHAEL Can I... come in?
MICHAEL'S MOTHER No. You know the answer to that.
MICHAEL I wanna see him.
MICHAEL'S MOTHER No.
MICHAEL Just let me talk—
MICHAEL'S MOTHER I don't know what you said to that boy, but whatever it was, he doesn't want to see you.
MICHAEL Please, ma. He's my son. I have a right—
MICHAEL'S MOTHER I thought you were dead! They said your plane crashed in the middle of the ocean, but you show up here fine and dandy, only I can't tell anybody about you or Walt, can't call you by your real names. He barely talks to me, but he does wake up screaming in the middle of the night, and I'm the one that's got to tell him it's gonna be okay. So until you can explain to me where you were for over two months and what happened... you gave up your rights.
MICHAEL Will you, uh... will you tell him I love him?
MICHAEL'S MOTHER Yeah.
GUS What can I do for ya?
MICHAEL How much can I get for that?
GUS Why is there Chinese writing all over it?
MICHAEL It's Korean, man — the guy who gave it to me.
GUS You don't look like you speak Korean. I'll give you $300 for it.
MICHAEL I'm not looking for money.
GUS What are you looking for?
MICHAEL I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.
MICHAEL Come on. Let's just get this done. Help me just get this done.
MAN Excuse me, sir. You got the time?
MICHAEL No, man. No.
MAN Come on, Michael.
TOM How about for an old friend?
TOM Manhattan, huh? We let you leave one island, you just go to another one.
MICHAEL Uhh!
TOM Will you just relax? I just came here to—ooh!
MICHAEL Uhh!
TOM Now are you ready to talk? Like adults?
MICHAEL Yeah.
TOM Enough!
MICHAEL Do it. Go ahead, do it!
TOM You'd like that, wouldn't you?
MICHAEL How do you find me?
TOM We're the ones who sent you home, Michael. Did you honestly think we weren't gonna keep tabs?
MICHAEL What do you want?
TOM Your help.
MICHAEL Why would I help the son of a bitch who kidnapped my son?
TOM We gave him back to you in one piece, Mike, you're the one who lost him. You told him, didn't you? You couldn't carry the guilt of what you did to those two women all by yourself, so you shared it with a 10-year-old kid. Is that why you want to kill yourself, Michael? Because that's the way he looks at you now? Because he knows you're a murderer?
MICHAEL Go away!
TOM I got some bad news for you, amigo. You can't kill yourself. The Island won't let you!
MICHAEL What'd you say?
TOM No matter how bad you want to, no matter how many different ways you try, it won't happen.
TOM Give it a shot if you don't believe me. You got more work to do, Mike. When you figure that out, I'm in the penthouse at the Hotel Earle.
MALE ANNOUNCER Let's give a warm Hollywood welcome to your host...
GAME SHOW HOST ...our jump-ball category... literature. I hope you stayed awake during high school English. All right...
MICHAEL Ahh...
GAME SHOW HOST ...Slaughterhouse-Five?
FEMALE CONTESTANT Um, is it Kurt Vonnegut?
GAME SHOW HOST Correct! And triple your puzzle points in the next round—can you give us the name of the book's protagonist?
MAN We interrupt this program for a news bulletin.
FEMALE ANCHOR The wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 has been found. This footage confirms the airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.
FEMALE ANCHOR At these tremendous depths, there is little hope of recovering any remains. Investigators are equally skeptical about the chances of retrieving Oceanic 815's black box. The real story behind what happened to this fateful airliner may have been lost along with the 324 passengers onboard. But even with this tragic discovery, the victims' families were hoping today...
TOM I didn't expect you that fast.
TOM Mm.
ARTURO Is this the guy who hit you with the champagne bottle?
TOM Yeah, but I had it comin'. 
TOM Arturo, Michael and I have some business we have to attend to. Would you get some air?
ARTURO Of course.
ARTURO Ciao.
TOM Help yourself to the chow.
TOM Don't make it to the mainland too often—
TOM —so when I do, I like to indulge myself.
MICHAEL So you people can just... come and go?
TOM Some of us. You want a drink?
MICHAEL What I want is for you to tell me what my plane is doing at the bottom of the ocean.
TOM That's not your plane. It's a phony. A man named Widmore put it down there, and he staged the whole wreck.
MICHAEL Staged? Why would he stage a—
TOM Because he doesn't want anyone else finding where the real plane ended up... except for him.
MICHAEL I'm supposed to believe this?
TOM Did the bullet bounce off your skull, or did the gun just jam on you?
MICHAEL Prove it.
TOM Sorry?
MICHAEL Prove that this guy, Widmore, did what you say he did. Prove it.
TOM That's the cemetery in Thailand where Widmore dug up the 300-odd corpses he needed. And the purchase order for the old 777 he bought through a shell company, and the shipping logs for the freighter he used to drop the whole mess down a trench deep enough to guarantee that no remains are ever gonna be identified. Do you have any idea what it would cost to bring those bodies up?
MICHAEL Whatchyou want from me, man?
TOM In a few days, a freighter is porting in Fiji. It's Widmore's boat. We have reason to believe he's finally found the coordinates of the Island, and he's heading right for it. So congratulations, Michael. Your shore leave is over. You just got a job on that boat. Meet Kevin Johnson.
TOM You're joining the crew in Fiji as a deckhand.
MICHAEL You want me to go undercover? Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?
TOM Because if Widmore finds the Island, it's good night for everybody on it. He'll kill them all without thinking twice. You wanna redeem yourself for what you did? This is your only chance. You can save all their lives.
MICHAEL No. I can't. I can't go back to that island.
TOM I didn't say you were going back to the Island. You're not going on that boat so you can swab decks, Michael.
TOM You're going so you can kill everyone onboard.
MINKOWSKI Hey. You our engineer?
MICHAEL Nah. Just a deckhand.
MINKOWSKI Well, we're all equals on this boat... as long as you play decent hold'em. I'm George... Minkowski.
MICHAEL Kevin Johnson.
MINKOWSKI Ah, nice to meet you, Kevin. All right, well, why don't you go check in with Naomi over there? And, uh, I'll be seeing you. Welcome.
NAOMI Okay. You're good to go. Thanks.
MICHAEL Uh... I'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.
NAOMI Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure. So you're from the States, yeah?
MICHAEL New York.
NAOMI Yeah, I could tell from the accent.
MICHAEL Manchester?
NAOMI How'd you guess? You can head onboard. Oh, uh, one of these crates was delivered for you.
NAOMI I'll have it delivered to your berth?
MICHAEL Yeah. Thanks.
NAOMI Welcome aboard, Kevin.
MILES Your name isn't Kevin.
MILES Don't worry. Eighty percent of the people on this boat are lying about something. Orange?
MICHAEL No, thanks.
MICHAEL Yeah?
TOM How was your trip?
TOM I figure flying can't be too much fun for you.
MICHAEL What do you want?
TOM You get your care package?
MICHAEL Yeah.
TOM Wait a day or two until you're out in the open sea, then you're good to go.
NAOMI You can stow your gear downstairs, all right? Welcome aboard, Keamy.
TOM Oh, you met some of 'em now. Got some names and faces, and you're gettin' cold feet, huh?
MICHAEL Yeah, actually, I am.
TOM Well, here are a few more names for ya—Sun, Sawyer, Jack, Claire, her baby. And the only way you're gonna save their lives is if you man up and get on that boat. Or maybe you wanna come back and explain to your kid how you let all of them die, too. It's game time. Are you in or out?
MICHAEL I'm in.
TOM Good, then ditch your phone and go do your job.
NAOMI Sorry, Frank, but I'm going first and that's all there is to it.
FRANK No offense, but I was flying these things when you were still in grade school. If anybody's gotta go first, it should be me.
NAOMI Yeah, I need you here to transport the science team, Frank.
FRANK What the hell are you gonna be doing?
NAOMI That's need-to-know. You don't.
FRANK So much for the fairer sex, huh?
FRANK Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.
MICHAEL Kevin Johnson. Deckhand.
FRANK So what's your story, Kevin?
MICHAEL Sorry?
FRANK How'd you end up on this tub?
MICHAEL Um... looking for a little adventure.
FRANK Ah, adventure. Yeah. Well, how do you like this for adventure? You ever hear about Oceanic 815?
MICHAEL Yeah.
FRANK What would you say if I told you the plane they found in that trench wasn't Oceanic 815?
MICHAEL Then what is it?
FRANK You know those nuts that think the moon landing was faked? Well, this is like that... only real. That's why I signed up for this trip, because the owner of this boat believes me. Charles Widmore. He believes that 815 is still out there somewhere. (Whispering) I mean, can you imagine what would happen... if we found some of those people alive?
KEAMY Pull!
CREWMAN Whoo!
KEAMY Pull!
KEAMY Pull!
KEAMY Another clip.
CREWMAN Good job.
KEAMY Pull!
KEAMY Kill shot!
CREWMAN Yeah!
MICHAEL Hey.
CREWMAN Whoo!
MICHAEL What are you guys doing?
KEAMY What's it look like we're doing? We're shooting things. Pull!
CREWMAN Whoo.
MICHAEL I, uh... thought we were going on a rescue mission.
KEAMY Uh... don't you have something to mop up?
CREWMAN Yeah.
CREWMAN Come on. Let's go.
KEAMY Pull!
KEAMY Pull!
MICHAEL You can do this, man. You can do this. 7... 1... 7-7-6. Okay. Okay.
CASS ELLIOT ...but it's getting better...
LIBBY Don't do it, Michael.
MICHAEL I love you, Walt.
MINKOWSKI What, are you going Nicholson on us?
MICHAEL What?
MINKOWSKI You know, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, when he's bouncing that ball against the wall? Next thing you know, you're gonna go after your wife with an ax.
MICHAEL I'm not married, man.
MINKOWSKI Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you got a call.
MICHAEL A call?
MINKOWSKI Yeah. From the mainland. They patched it through to the radio room.
MICHAEL It's gotta be a mistake, man. Nobody even knows I'm here.
MINKOWSKI Well, you're the only Kevin Johnson onboard, so somebody knows you're here. Said he really needs to talk to you. His name's Walt.
MINKOWSKI Yeah, here you go.
MICHAEL Hey, uh ... it's kind of personal. Mind if I take this alone?
MINKOWSKI Take your time, Kev. You just push this yellow button (indicates a switch from "Channel A" to "Channel B") and, uh, turn this knob on the console .
MICHAEL Got it. Okay.
MICHAEL Walt?
BEN I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in New York.
BEN So I'm afraid you're stuck with me. Michael? Are you still there?
MICHAEL You put me on this boat, talked me into blowing it up, and when I push the damn button, a flag pops up.
BEN You actually activated the bomb?
MICHAEL It's not a bomb! It's a... it's a joke.
BEN There are people on your boat who are innocent. They have no idea that the man they work for is a monster, a killer without conscience or a greater purpose. I had to show you the difference between him and me. When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win, but I will not kill innocent people.
MICHAEL Ana Lucia and Libby... they were innocent.
BEN You killed them, Michael. No one asked you to... I don't blame you, Michael. We did have your boy. And what wouldn't a man do for his son?
MICHAEL What do you want... from me?
BEN I want you to compile a list of names... every person on your boat. When I call again, you'll give me that list. Then you will disable the radio room you're sitting in. When the crew is disoriented by their lack of communication, you'll take out the engines too. That way, the boat can never get to this island, and your friends will be safe. Will you do that for me, Michael?
MICHAEL Yeah.
BEN Then consider yourself one of the good guys.
SAYID So you're telling me... that you're working for Benjamin Linus?
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
MICHAEL Hey! Aah!
DESMOND Hey, Sayid.
MICHAEL Guys!
MICHAEL Hold it! Uhh! Let me go! What are you doing?!
SAYID Shut your mouth!
GAULT What the hell is this?
SAYID This man is not who you think he is. He was a passenger on Oceanic Flight 8-1-5. I spent two months with him on the island before he betrayed us. This is the man who sabotaged your radio room. He destroyed the ship's engine, and his name isn't Kevin Johnson. It's Michael Dawson, and he's a traitor.
ROUSSEAU We stop here and drink. Two minutes, then we keep moving.
ALEX What's wrong?
KARL Nothing.
ALEX Karl.
KARL I don't know. I just have a bad feeling about this. What if your dad is... playing us?
ALEX Look, I don't like taking orders from my dad any more than you do. But I know he doesn't want me to get hurt.
KARL Well, at least we've got something in common.
ALEX I promise not to tell if you won't.
KARL Uhh!
ROUSSEAU Alex!
ALEX Karl?
ROUSSEAU Alex!
ALEX Karl! Karl, Karl! No!
ROUSSEAU Come on.
ALEX No! No!
ROUSSEAU Come on! He's gone.
ALEX Karl!
ROUSSEAU Alex!
ALEX No! No, no, we have to get Karl. Karl!
ROUSSEAU He's gone.
ALEX Karl!
ROUSSEAU He's gone! He's gone! Listen to me.
ALEX No. 
ROUSSEAU I need you to take my hand. On the count of three, we're going to run.
ROUSSEAU Can you do that with me? I love you. I love you very much, Alexandra.
ROUSSEAU Are you ready?
ROUSSEAU One...
ROUSSEAU Two...
ROUSSEAU Three!
ALEX Wait! Wait! Don't! I'm Ben's daughter! I'm his daughter!
