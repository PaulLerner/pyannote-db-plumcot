libby_smith Isn't this nice?
hugo_reyes I kind of prefer breathing.
libby_smith Come on, you're doing great. You know, exercise is addictive.
hugo_reyes Wow, I can -- I can see why.
hugo_reyes I guess I need to drop a few pounds.
libby_smith Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not going to happen overnight. Some people's metabolisms are just a little slower.
hugo_reyes It's not my metabolism. I'm sick.
libby_smith What? What's wrong?
hugo_reyes Never mind.
libby_smith Hurley, you can trust me.
hugo_reyes Okay, but it's bad.
hugo_reyes When we first crashed here, I thought, this isn't all bad -- it's, like, the all mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing but I did drop a couple belt sizes. Then we found this hatch and it was full of food -- tons of food. I tried giving it all away, but I guess I kind of kept some of it for myself. I wish I could just get rid of it.
libby_smith Then get rid of it.
libby_smith You want to change -- then change.
libby_smith How do you feel?
hugo_reyes I feel free.
jinsoo_kwon 뭘 찾았대! 뭘 찾았대!
sunhwa_kwon They found something. Come on!
charlie_pace Risotto. Nice.
hugo_reyes No.
libby_smith Where did this come from?
jinsoo_kwon 누가 여기다 떨어뜨렸나봐.
charlie_pace Locke said some kind of blast doors trapped him in the Hatch. Maybe it was because of this -- so no one would see who dropped it. Any of you guys see a plane last night?
james_ford Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo. I just decided not to tell.
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode18 #1 Hey, give those back, man. Those are mine.
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode18 #2 No, man. I saw them first.
hugo_reyes No.
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode18 #1 No, you saw me put those in my box.
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode18 #2 No way.
REDSHIRT#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode18 #1 Give me my stuff, man!
james_ford Hold on, take it easy. You guys are like locusts. How about a little order here?
charlie_pace Shouldn't we let someone a little more trustworthy take care of this?
james_ford Like you, babynapper?
charlie_pace No, like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's done it before, he can do it again.
hugo_reyes No. No way! Not me, no! Not again, no!
libby_smith Okay, hey, hey, guys, guys, how about no one's in charge, okay? I'm sure everyone can manage to just take what they need.
james_ford Great plan, Moonbeam. And after that we can sing "Kumbaya" and do trust falls.
charlie_pace You don't have to be savages about it.
james_ford We can do it anyway you want.
hugo_reyes Hey! Hey!!
hugo_reyes Uh-oh.
libby_smith Hey. What are you doing?
hugo_reyes Nothing.
libby_smith Who were you looking for out there?
hugo_reyes No one.
libby_smith When you ran off it sort of seemed like you were looking for someone. I tried to find you.
hugo_reyes I kind of -- don't want to talk about it.
libby_smith Sure, okay. Pretty weird, huh? So the Island won't let you lose weight -- you destroy your stash, then bang -- more food falls from the sky.
hugo_reyes How about that?
libby_smith I'm proud of you.
hugo_reyes Proud of me for what?
libby_smith Not freaking out.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS How's the diet coming, Hugo?
hugo_reyes It's okay. I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS That's great. It gets easier, I promise. So I heard you had a visit with your mom. How did that go?
hugo_reyes It was good.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS You're not still mad at her, then?
hugo_reyes Nah. I know she put me in here for a reason.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS What reason was that?
hugo_reyes The accident.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS You want to talk about that today?
hugo_reyes Do we have to?
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Hugo, you've been in here almost 2 months, now. Don't you think it's time to start getting our hands dirty? Okay, why don't we talk about the little homework assignment that I gave you?
hugo_reyes I was never really good at homework.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS You remember what you were supposed to do -- just make a list of things you like about yourself?
hugo_reyes Nobody else did it.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Nobody else -- meaning -- ?
hugo_reyes Well, Dave didn't do it. He said it was a stupid idea.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor, but we have talked about how he could be a very negative influence.
hugo_reyes Dave's the most normal person in this place, man.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS But he doesn't want you to change, does he?
dave Dude, dude, I'm open, dude! It's called dribbling, not drooling -- dribbling. Well, shoot it then! Shoot it! Wait -- oh, high percentage shot, excellent choice. Do you want in the game, man? Go for it. Something tells me no one will care. What's the matter with you?
hugo_reyes Nothing.
dave Dude, dude, give up the rock!
dave Fantastic, give it to the guy who's not even in the game!! Hey, it's taco night, dude, let's blow this pop stand. What?
hugo_reyes Brooks said you're, like, negative.
dave Well, duh. So what, you don't want to hang out with me anymore?
hugo_reyes Nah, I don't know, it's just...
dave Is that quack getting inside your head, man? Do not let him. You've got much more important things to think about.
hugo_reyes Like what?
dave Like hard or soft shell, baby -- chicken or shrimp -- sour cream or hot sauce.
hugo_reyes Yeah, I guess I could eat.
dave Yeah, I thought so -- noche de tacos, amigo.
dr_jack_shephard Good. Now, can you do the other one?
john_locke Is it broken?
dr_jack_shephard Without an x-ray, you're just going to have to do with my best guess.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry.
kate_austen How are you holding up?
john_locke Depends on Jack's best guess.
dr_jack_shephard There's a small fracture -- probably hairline. This will keep the swelling down until I can get a splint on it.
john_locke How long 'til I can walk on it?
dr_jack_shephard You're going to have to keep off it a couple of weeks. There's a wheelchair back at camp...
john_locke No! -- I don't need a wheelchair.
kate_austen We took a pair of crutches from the fuselage when we moved down the beach. Okay. I'll be back in a while.
john_locke He could have escaped.
dr_jack_shephard Sorry?
john_locke Henry -- during the lockdown -- I was hurt. He could have escaped. But he came back to help me, why would he do that?
dr_jack_shephard He didn't come back to help you, John. He came back because he thought his story was going to check out.
ben_linus He was dead already. 4 months ago I was part of the search party. Henry Gale was hanging out of the basket -- neck broken.
sayid_jarrah So he was already dead?
ben_linus Yes.
sayid_jarrah Then you buried him and left a grave marker?
ben_linus Yes.
sayid_jarrah You really should have checked his wallet before you did that. I assume Henry Gale did not have any paper on which to compose his thoughts, so he had to improvise. There wasn't much space for that. "Jennifer, well, you were right. Crossing the Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer. I'm hiking to one of the beaches to start a signal fire. But if you're reading this I guess I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny. Always have -- always will. Yours, Henry." So tell me, how did Henry Gale write a note to his wife with a broken neck?
ben_linus It wasn't me. I didn't kill him. You don't understand.
sayid_jarrah How did you know his wife's name? Did you interrogate him?
ben_linus Please, just listen. I'm just a --
sayid_jarrah How many of you are there?
ben_linus If I told you about them -- you have no idea what he'll do.
sayid_jarrah He?
ana_lucia_cortez You mean their leader -- the guy with the beard.
ben_linus Him?! He's no one! Nothing!
sayid_jarrah Where are your people?
ben_linus I can't...
sayid_jarrah How many of you are there?!
ben_linus You don't understand!
sayid_jarrah Understand this --
ana_lucia_cortez Hey.
sayid_jarrah You have 3 seconds to answer my question. How many of you are there? 1 --
ben_linus He'll kill me!
sayid_jarrah I'll kill you. 2...
ana_lucia_cortez Sayid!
ben_linus You can't do this! I am not a bad person!
sayid_jarrah 3.
ana_lucia_cortez What the hell is wrong with you?
john_locke What's going on?! I heard a gun shot!
dr_jack_shephard What happened?
sayid_jarrah He's a liar!
ana_lucia_cortez It's fine, just get him out of here.
john_locke Jack! Jack! Jack!
dr_jack_shephard I've got it covered, John.
ben_linus Thank you.
ana_lucia_cortez Shut up.
charlie_pace Hey, I noticed you were building something. I thought maybe you could use this -- for whatever it is.
mr_eko That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie. Why don't you help me?
charlie_pace What are you making?
mr_eko Hold that end.
charlie_pace Is it a Starbucks?
mr_eko Help me carry one of those logs, please.
charlie_pace Are you going to tell me?
mr_eko Not right now.
hugo_reyes You're not here!
hugo_reyes Hey, wait!
hugo_reyes Wait, Dave!
charlie_pace Are you okay, Hurley?
hugo_reyes Did either of you see a guy run through here -- in a bathrobe, with a coconut?
charlie_pace No. Saw a polar bear on roller blades with a mango.
mr_eko I did not see anything, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Yeah, me either.
leonard 4, 8, 15...
hugo_reyes Uh, dude.
dave Pretty sneaky, Leonard. You're using those magic numbers of yours as a psyche-out, are you man? Oh, yeah, that's right, you just play dumb. I'm on to your juju, man.
hugo_reyes They're just numbers, man.
dave Hey. What the hell is that?
hugo_reyes It's my mid-afternoon snack.
dave Dude, that's celery. Celery is not a snack. Leonard's got graham crackers, man. You should snag one. He won't notice. What's he going to do -- call you a 23? 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hike!
nurse Here, Hugo. Here's your meds.
hugo_reyes Thank you, nurse Lazenby.
dave Dude, you want to get out of here with me? Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
hugo_reyes What do mean, get out of here?
dave I mean escape, man. Me and you, A-S-A-P. They're getting to you, dude. We've got to split.
hugo_reyes Dr. Brooks says...
dave Dr. Brooks does not care about you, man. He's the one prescribing that crap. What the hell is it, anyway?
hugo_reyes Clonazepam.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Hugo, something wrong with your meds, there?
hugo_reyes No, me and Dave were just, you know, talking about stuff.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Right, well, sorry to interrupt. Hello there, Dave.
dave Hello there, Dr. Brooks.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS And how are you today?
dave Never been saner.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS I've been taking some pictures for the bulletin board. I've got everyone except you 2. Would you guys mind?
hugo_reyes Okay.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Okay. Why don't you two get a little bit closer.
dave Are you going to make us look at the ducky, too?
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Say cheese.
hugo_reyes Cheese.
dave Queso.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Great. Okay, you -- you need a little water with that?
hugo_reyes Nope, I'm good.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Okay, well fine. See you later guys, thanks for the photo op.
dave Dude.
hugo_reyes Dude.
dave The revolution has begun, man. Lay low -- when the time is right we fly.
hugo_reyes You've got to twist it to get the frosting. Pulling it will only break the cookie.
james_ford Well, that's what I get for not going to the expert in the first place. What can I do you for, Deepdish?
hugo_reyes I'm kind of looking for something.
james_ford Forget it. I'm done trading. I got enough food now to open a chain of mini-marts. Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?
hugo_reyes Well, actually, I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor. Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog -- that you killed?
james_ford Yeah, I remember.
hugo_reyes I sort of -- need some medicine.
james_ford What do you need?
hugo_reyes It's called Clonazepam.
james_ford Clonaza -- what? What the hell's that?
hugo_reyes So you can calm down. Or, for when you're seeing things that aren't supposed to be there.
james_ford What stuff you seeing?
hugo_reyes I don't know, maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe.
james_ford You mean like that guy there?
james_ford Gotcha.
james_ford What the hell are you doing? Get off of me.
hugo_reyes Who the hell do you think you are?!
james_ford Let go of me.
sunhwa_kwon 뭐야?
hugo_reyes Pork Rinds! Barbar! Jabba! Stay Puft!
sunhwa_kwon 어우 안되겠다, 가서 도와줘요.
hugo_reyes Mongo! Lardo!
james_ford Let go of me. Get him off me.
sunhwa_kwon 도와 줘요!
jinsoo_kwon 이제 그만 해!
james_ford What the hell's the matter with you? Get off me.
james_ford What the hell's the matter with you?
jinsoo_kwon 그만 해.
james_ford You're crazy!
hugo_reyes I'm not crazy. -- I'm not crazy.
kate_austen So, he just attacked you, huh?
james_ford Try to contain yourself, Freckles.
kate_austen What? I'm -- I'm worried. You look like you got your ass kicked.
james_ford Don't you got an adventure to get to? I think Timmy fell down a well over that way.
kate_austen Seriously though, why would Hurley of all people...?
james_ford I've got no idea. I didn't do nothing. He just Hulked-out on me.
kate_austen For no reason at all?
james_ford Okay, you walk off and have yourself a nice long giggle. But steer clear -- the man is crazy.
libby_smith Hurley? Hey, are you okay? What happened with Sawyer?
hugo_reyes I don't want to talk about it.
libby_smith So, you beat him up?
hugo_reyes I guess you know what happened, then.
libby_smith I'm on your side, whatever you tell me...
hugo_reyes I don't want to talk, okay!
hugo_reyes What?
libby_smith That's a lot of peanut butter.
hugo_reyes Well, I'm going to need a lot of protein where I'm going.
libby_smith Where are you going?
hugo_reyes Back to the caves. No one lives there anymore, so I won't bother anybody. I'm just going to live alone and be one of those guys -- you know, the crazy guys -- with a big beard and no clothes who's naked and throws doodie at people.
libby_smith Hurley, you don't have to do this.
hugo_reyes Just leave me alone. You can't help me. No one can.
hugo_reyes You're not here. You were in the hospital. You can't be here.
dave Sorry, dude. I am here.
hugo_reyes I like that I have a good relationship with my mom. I like making my grandpa, Tito, laugh. I like chicken.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Well, that last one wasn't about you, Hugo.
hugo_reyes I like that I like chicken?
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS So, tell me, how did it feel writing that? Was that difficult?
hugo_reyes Kind of -- I think I messed up some spelling.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS I notice that you didn't say anything about the way you look. Are you comfortable with your appearance?
hugo_reyes It's not like... I can't really do anything about it, right? If I, uh -- if I w -- wasn't so fat, they never would have died.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS There were 23 people on that deck. It was built to hold 8. And it would have collapsed whether you went out there or not.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but I did walk out there. And it did collapse. I killed them.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS It was an accident.
hugo_reyes That was my fault.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Look, after those people died, you were in a practically catatonic state. You stopped talking, you stopped going out, you stopped sleeping. But you never stopped eating because that's how you punish yourself.
hugo_reyes Dave's right about you. You know, you're nothing but a quack.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Dave doesn't want you to lose weight, does he?
hugo_reyes You know, Dave cares about me. He's my friend.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Let me show you something.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS It may upset you. This is the photo I took for the bulletin board.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Dave isn't your friend, Hugo, because Dave doesn't exist.
dave Psst. Hey, wake up, dude. Finally, you could sleep through a damn NASCAR race, man.
hugo_reyes Wait, you're not -- you're a hallucination. Ow.
dave Was that a hallucination?
hugo_reyes Maybe I just imagined you slapped me? Ow! Damn it.
dave We can do this all night.
hugo_reyes Dr. Brooks showed me a picture from the rec room. My arm was around, like, nothingness.
dave Uh, Kinko's, Photoshop? What, you think they really blew up the Death Star?
hugo_reyes No.
dave Then stop talking crazy, man. Come on, we're on a clock here.
dave Hey, you in or you out, dude?
dave Okay, come on, come on. Yo, check it out, Marcus didn't finish his lasagna. That is a waste, man. One for the road?
dave Shhh. Wait for it -- wait.
dave Tippy-toes, big guy. Vámonos.
dave Okay, man. You've got the keys, hombre. You took them off Brooks' desk earlier.
dave Come on, man. Open it, open it.
dave Oh, oh, oh -- can you taste that? That is freedom, baby. You know what tastes even better than freedom? Cheeseburgers.
dave Come on, man, chili-fries on me.
hugo_reyes I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.
dave Sorry? What, are you kidding me?
hugo_reyes You're not real. You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because I want cheeseburgers.
dave Did you take those pills, man?
hugo_reyes No, man. I'm just not coming. Look, you don't want me to get better. You don't want me to change.
dave You don't need to change, man. You are fine. You're great.
hugo_reyes No, I'm not. You just want me to stay fat. You don't want me to get better. You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death.
dave Do not do this, man. If you don't come with me right now, you will never get out of here.
hugo_reyes Bye, Dave.
dave You wouldn't happen to have my slipper, would you?
dave Thank you. Oh, man, you got peanut butter on it. Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now, and I'm, I'm sorry. But it's going to get a little worse before it gets better.
hugo_reyes Worse?
dave Yeah, kind of. You ready, dude? You remember that night you closed that window on me? You remember what you did after that night?
hugo_reyes Yeah, I realized you were imaginary.
dave Mmmmhmmm.
hugo_reyes And that was a breakthrough. And a little while later Brooks let me out, and I went home to live with my mom, and I got my job at Mr. Clucks back. And I got better.
dave Okay, good, great, yeah -- except see, here's the thing -- uh -- none of that ever happened.
hugo_reyes What?
dave You're still at Santa Rosa, man. You never left the hospital.
hugo_reyes That's -- not possible.
dave It's hard, I know, but I mean -- all this? You, me, this island, that peanut butter -- none of it's real, man. None of it's happening. It's all in your head, my friend. The second you closed that window your brain popped a gasket. You went back into your little coma thing. And that's where you are right this very second. In your own private Idaho, inside Santa Rosa.
hugo_reyes No. I had my mom, my friend Johnny -- I won the lottery.
dave Whoa, wow, awesome, dude! What numbers did you play? Leonard's numbers, right -- from the hospital? What a coincidence. You, uh, seen them around anywhere else?
hugo_reyes The Hatch?
dave Bingo! The Hatch -- with the button that you've got to push every 108 minutes or the world ends. Oh, oh, oh, and what's the code for the button? Oh yeah, the Numbers.
hugo_reyes But I got better. I changed.
dave Changed? What, are you kidding me? Take a look at yourself. You've been on a deserted island for over 2 months and you haven't dropped 10 pounds. How is that even possible, man?
hugo_reyes I just destroyed my stash, and I've been exercising. Libby says it won't happen over night.
dave Oh, right, right, right, Libby -- the mega cute blonde chick who magically appeared from the other side of the Island. Oh, oh, oh, yeah -- and who just happens to have the hots for you. Come on, man, let's take a walk.
hugo_reyes So this is all in my brain?
dave Every rock, every tree. Every tree frog. Even me. The real me -- the one they told you was imaginary? He went out the window, man. Right now he's probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick, unlike me, who's really you, who's got more important things to do.
hugo_reyes So I'm making you up?
dave Well, sort of. I'm part of your subconscious, man. All the people on this island are.
hugo_reyes What part of me are you?
dave I'm the part of you that wants to wake up, man. Follow me.
dave This is it, dude.
hugo_reyes It?
dave The big finale. The answer to all your problems. A way for you to wake up, snap out of it.
hugo_reyes I don't want to kill myself.
dave Who said anything about killing yourself, man? This is going to bring you back to life. The only way for you to bust out is to tell your mind that you don't believe any of this.
hugo_reyes So, if I -- all this will be gone? I'll just wake up?
dave That's right. And when you do wake up, come find me. I'm sure I miss you. See you in another life, Hurley.
hugo_reyes Dave!!
john_locke Jack not back yet?
ana_lucia_cortez Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach that we've got one of them. Something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest.
john_locke I want to talk to him.
ana_lucia_cortez I don't think that's on today's program.
john_locke Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia, but I don't care what you think. 5 minutes. I earned 5 minutes with him.
john_locke What's your name -- your real name?
ben_linus Why don't you just keep calling me Henry? I've gotten used to it.
john_locke Did you get caught on purpose? You and your people have been here for God knows how long, and you got caught in a net...
ben_linus God doesn't know.
john_locke Excuse me?
ben_linus God doesn't know how long we've been here, John. He can't see this island any better than the rest of the world can. May I ask you a question? What possible reason could I have for putting myself through all this?
john_locke Maybe your people were looking for this place.
ben_linus This place? This place is a joke, John.
john_locke What are you talking about?
ben_linus I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer as the alarm beeped. And you know what happened? The timer went all the way down to zero, and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place. They looked like hieroglyphics, but I'm no expert. And then things got real interesting. There was a loud clunking and a hum like a magnet -- a big magnet. It was really very frightening. And you know what happened next? Nothing happened, John. Nothing happened at all. Your timer just flipped back to 108. I never entered the numbers. I never pressed the button.
john_locke You're lying.
ben_linus No, I'm done lying.
hugo_reyes Dave!
libby_smith Who's Dave?
hugo_reyes What are you doing here?
libby_smith What are you doing here?
hugo_reyes How'd you know where I was?
libby_smith Jin saw you while he was fishing.
hugo_reyes Hah! Jin doesn't speak English!
libby_smith Sun was with him. She translated. Hurley, what is going on?
hugo_reyes No! You're just a part of me that's scared. You don't want me to wake up. Well, guess what? I'm not scared.
libby_smith Okay, okay, Hurley, you're having some sort of panic attack. I get that. But this isn't like you.
hugo_reyes Like me? You don't know me.
libby_smith I was starting to.
hugo_reyes Yeah, well did you know I'm so fat that I killed 2 people? And that I have an imaginary friend?
libby_smith Hurley, please, you're going to hurt yourself.
hugo_reyes No, I'm not, because this isn't happening! None of it! I'm just imagining it! This isn't real life!
libby_smith Why would you say that?
hugo_reyes Because in real life -- no girl like you would ever like me. Remember when I said I knew you from somewhere? Well, maybe it's because I made you up?
libby_smith What was the man's name who broke his leg? The day of the crash on the other side of the Island, Eko brought a man with a broken leg to me for help. What was his name?
hugo_reyes I don't know.
libby_smith You don't know. You know why? Because it happened to me. His name was Donald, and I buried him. I buried a lot of people, Hurley. So don't tell me that that wasn't real. And don't tell me you made me up. It's insulting.
hugo_reyes When you saw me on the beach this morning was I holding a slipper?
libby_smith Not that I can remember, no. Hurley, look at me. I am real. You're real. The way I feel about you -- that's real.
libby_smith And that was real.
hugo_reyes Maybe you should do it one more time just to be sure.
libby_smith Ready to go back?
hugo_reyes Do you really think I can, you know, change?
libby_smith Yeah, yeah I do.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Why don't you get a little closer together.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Say cheese.
hugo_reyes Cheese.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS Great. So, you need some water to go with that?
hugo_reyes Nope. I'm good.
dr_douglas_brooks BROOKS See you later, guys. Thanks for the photo op.
nurse Here's your pill, Libby.
