LOCKE These are the last two eggs.
BEN From my own bookshelf.
LOCKE Help you pass the time.
BEN I've already read it. 
LOCKE You might catch something you missed the second time around.
BEN Why did you move me from the rec room down here?
LOCKE I wanted you under my own roof.
BEN Where are you keeping your other prisoner? Miles, is it?
BEN Oh, you don't wanna share.
LOCKE Actually, I was hoping you would share, Ben. Seeing as you claim to have a spy on his ship.
BEN I feel for you, John. I really do. You keep hitting dead ends.
BEN You couldn't find the cabin, you can't make contact with Jacob — you're so desperate to figure out what to do next, you're even asking me for help. So here we are, just like old times. Except I'm locked in a different room, and you're more lost than you ever were.
LOCKE I know what you're trying to do. It's not going to work.
BEN Excellent, John! You're evolving!
LOCKE Done with your breakfast?
KATE What was that all about?
CLAIRE Who knows? It's Locke.
SAWYER Mornin', ladies.
CLAIRE Good morning.
KATE Mornin'.
SAWYER Mmm, the coffee smells good.
CLAIRE Well, why don't I go make you a cup?
SAWYER Kinda weird, ain't it? Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs? By the way, I found some clothes about your size, in the closet. So after I kick out Hugo—
KATE I'm not moving in with you, James.
SAWYER Well. Then why did you stay?
KATE That's none of your business.
SAWYER Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh? Well, if you're spying for Jack—
KATE I'm not spying for anyone.
SAWYER So why don't you tell me why—
KATE Because I don't trust you.
SAWYER This is about the pregnancy.
KATE James?
SAWYER Yeah.
KATE Go home.
SAWYER Okay, fine. See you later then.
DUNCAN You ready?
KATE Is there a back entrance?
DUNCAN Yeah, but you're going in the front door, with your head held high, okay?
KATE Yeah. Okay. Let's do this.
DUNCAN Let us through. Folks, we're not making any statements or answering any questions right now. Thank you.
BEARDED MAN IN CROWD We hate you!
BAILIFF The people vs. Katherine Anne Austen, the honorable Arthur Galzethron presiding.
JUDGE GALZETHRON Bailiff will read the counts. Will the defendant please rise?
BAILIFF Katherine Anne Austen, you are charged with fraud, arson, assault on a federal officer, assault with a deadly weapon, grand larceny, grand theft auto, and murder in the first degree. Ms. Austen, how do you plead?
KATE Not guilty.
JUDGE Thus entered. I will now hear the argument on the bail.
MELISSA Your honor, we are requesting that the defendant be remanded into custody for the duration of the trial.
DUNCAN Your honor, my client's been free pending arraignment, now suddenly she's a flight risk?
MELISSA She's the very definition of a flight risk.
DUNCAN She is one of the most recognizable faces in America. Where's she going to run?
JUDGE Ms. Austen, based on your prior history, I'm inclined to agree with the people. You are hereby remanded into federal custody for the duration of your trial.
DUNCAN Your honor—
JUDGE Bailiff, please take the defendant into custody.
DUNCAN Sorry.
JIN Al-ber-kerke.
SUN Too hot.
JIN New York.
SUN Too many people.
JIN 서울보다 더 많아? 
SUN 서울이 어때서요? 
JIN 자기야, 이제 우리는 이 섬을 곧 떠날텐데... 
JIN I learn English...for you...to live...in...America.
SUN 글쎄... 나는... 내 아기는 내가 자란 한국에서 키우고 싶어요. 
JIN 우리 애기. 
JACK This is, uh, Charlotte, and Dan. Their helicopter already took Sayid and Desmond back to their freighter. They can make arrangements to get all of us off this island.
SUN Where's Kate?
JACK She stayed with Locke.
LOCKE Hello, Kate.
KATE You got blood...
LOCKE I just killed a chicken. What can I do for you?
KATE I want to talk to Miles. Where are you keeping him?
LOCKE Why do you need to talk to him?
KATE It's personal.
LOCKE No.
KATE And what gives you the right to decide whether or not—
LOCKE You may think this is a democracy, Kate, because of the way Jack ran things, but this is not a democracy.
KATE Then I guess that makes it a dictatorship.
LOCKE If I was a dictator, I would just shoot you and go about my day. Dinner's at six if you're hungry.
KATE Hey Hurley! You bringing that to Miles?
HURLEY Yeah.
KATE Well, Locke asked me to do it.
HURLEY Cool. That dude creeps me out.
KATE He's still in the rec room, right?
HURLEY No, we moved him to the boathouse that... You just totally Scooby-Dood me, didn't you.
KATE Sorry.
HURLEY You're not going to let him go, are you?
KATE No. No, I promise.
HURLEY Just don't tell Locke it was me.
MILES So the Arab traded you too, huh?
KATE Do you know who I am?
MILES Excuse me?
KATE Do you know who I am. Do you know what I did?
MILES What did you do?
KATE Answer the question.
MILES Okay. I'll tell you what you wanna know. But you gotta do something for me first.
KATE I'm not letting you go.
MILES I don't wanna be let go. I'm exactly where I wanna be. What I want, is one minute of someone's time. You bring him to me, and I will tell you everything I know about you.
KATE Who?
MILES Who do you think?
DUNCAN You okay?
KATE Yeah, I'm fine.
DUNCAN Listen. The D.A.'s decided to try this case herself. Which means they're gonna do the full-court press. Now we need to start talking about cutting a deal.
KATE What kind of deal?
DUNCAN Honestly, my best guess, I'd say...she'll take a fifteen year sentence, and you serve seven.
KATE No way.
DUNCAN If you go to trial, Kate, you're looking at twenty years on each count, not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge.
KATE No.
DUNCAN Kate, you confessed to your mother that you killed your father. And now, she's their star witness. So you tell me, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to win this thing?
KATE Put me on the stand.
DUNCAN And take a chance with the D.A. crossing you, no. The way I see, we've got one shot at this.
KATE What's that?
DUNCAN We make it about character. Not about what you did or didn't do, but about who you are.
KATE What do you mean who I am?
DUNCAN I want him in the courtroom.
KATE Absolutely not.
DUNCAN We need him, Kate. It will generate tremendous sympathy—
KATE Duncan, listen to me. You are not bringing him in here. Alright, you want to make this about me, about my character, fine. You are not using my son.
JULIET Maybe you should try a number other than the boat, like 911.
SUN What's wrong?
JACK Nothing. I'm just having some trouble getting a hold of their boat.
SUN You haven't heard from Sayid? You said they left yesterday!
JACK And I'm sure they're fine.
SUN What if Locke was right? What if these people are here to hurt us?
JACK Locke has no idea what he's doing.
SUN Then why is Kate with him?
KATE You sure he's got Ben in the basement?
CLAIRE Uh-huh. I saw Rousseau take him in there last night.
KATE Does Locke ever go out?
CLAIRE No, he's been in there cooking all day. He invited us all over for dinner.
CLAIRE Oh, can you get Aaron for me?
CLAIRE Just pick him up and rock him a little bit.
KATE Um...yeah, I'm just not very good with babies. I wouldn't want him to get more upset.
CLAIRE Here, I got it.
CLAIRE Ohhh...it's okay. There we go, muffin. There we go.
KATE You're so good with him.
KATE What?
CLAIRE Just...the last thing I thought I'd be good at was being a mum. You know, you should try it sometime.
BAILIFF Please rise.
BAILIFF Court is now in session. Please be seated.
DUNCAN Don't fire me, okay?
KATE What?
DUNCAN We got killed in the opening. I had to do this.
JUDGE Does the defense have a witness?
DUNCAN Yes we do, your honor. The defense calls Dr. Jack Shephard to the witness stand.
MELISSA Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness on the basis of relevance.
JUDGE And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection. You have to be aware that this witness did not meet the defendant until after the alleged crimes she's been charged with. He is to be viewed as a character witness only. Proceed.
BALIFF Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
JACK Yes.
DUNCAN Dr. Shephard. Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if there are any of you who don't read the newspapers or the internet or watch television, how you met the defendant?
JACK Um... on September 22, 2004, Kate uh, Ms. Austen, and I were both passengers on Oceanic Flight 815, which crash-landed on an island in the South Pacific.
DUNCAN Were you aware that Ms. Austen was a fugitive being transported by a United States marshal on that flight to Los Angeles for trial?
JACK I did learn that eventually, yes.
DUNCAN From the U.S. Marshal?
JACK No, the marshal died in the crash. I never spoke to him. Ms. Austen told me.
DUNCAN Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?
JACK No. Never.
DUNCAN Well, that seems like a reasonable question. Why not?
JACK I just assumed that there had been some kind of mistake.
DUNCAN And why would you think that?
JACK Only eight of us survived the crash. We landed in the water. I was hurt, pretty badly. In fact, if it weren't for her, I would have never made it to the shore. She took care of me. She took care of all of us. She — she gave us first aid, water, found food, made shelter. She tried to save the other two, but they didn't—
KATE Stop.
JUDGE Ms. Austen, please sit down.
KATE This has nothing to do with... with anything. This is my trial, and I don't want him to say anything else.
DUNCAN That's fine. I have no more questions, your honor.
JUDGE Ms. Dunbrook, bear witness.
MELISSA That was very moving, Dr. Shephard. I only have one question for you. Do you love the defendant?
DUNCAN Objection!
JUDGE You opened this door, Mr. Forrester, I'm going to allow it.
MELISSA Doctor Shephard, do you love Ms. Austen?
JACK No. Not anymore.
HURLEY So... what do you wanna watch? Xanadu or Satan's Doom?
SAWYER I'm reading.
TV "They call it Xanadu..."
SAWYER Turn that thing down, dammit!
HURLEY Sorry.
SAWYER Hey.
KATE Can I come in?
SAWYER Sure. I believe you know my roommate.
KATE Hey Hurley.
HURLEY Hey Kate.
SAWYER Got something in your eye, Hugo? Why don't we talk in the kitchen?
SAWYER I know it's in a box, but, uh, it's pretty damn good wine. I tested it. So, how's life in Casa de Claire? Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?
KATE No, no, he's a good sleeper.
SAWYER Good for you.
SAWYER You are terrible at this, Freckles.
KATE Terrible at what?
SAWYER You already said you didn't stay behind for me. So at least be woman enough to tell me you want to use me for something.
KATE I want to use you for something.
SAWYER See? Wasn't that hard. For what?
KATE For Ben. I want you to help me bust him out.
SAWYER Wanna play some backgammon?
LOCKE You're on.
LOCKE Do you think I know what I'm doing?
SAWYER Huh?
LOCKE Do you regret following me out here? Are you worried about what we should do next?
SAWYER All I know is that I'd be a lot more worried if I was sitting on that beach.
LOCKE And the rest of the group, what are they saying?
SAWYER I think they're saying "Baa."
SAWYER That's the nice thing about sheep. They're predictable. But I ain't so sure about Kate.
LOCKE What do you mean?
SAWYER I need your word you ain't going to do nothing to her.
LOCKE Why would I do anything to her?
SAWYER Just give me your word, John. You know what? Forget it.
LOCKE No, no, no, alright. You have my word.
SAWYER She came to me about an hour ago. Said she wanted my help busting Ben out of your basement.
LOCKE Why?
SAWYER She talked to that guy... Bruce Lee from the freighter, the guy you've got locked up. He told her to bring Ben down to him for a chat.
LOCKE No, that's impossible. She doesn't even know where Miles is.
SAWYER What, the boathouse down by the dock? If Hugo knows, everybody knows.
LOCKE Are you sure about this?
SAWYER Yeah, I'm sure.
SAWYER Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going with that?
LOCKE Whatever Miles has to say to Ben, he can say to me.
SAWYER Son of a bitch.
KATE Come on.
KATE You got one minute. Go.
MILES How about some privacy?
KATE Fifty-five seconds!
MILES Do you know who I am?
BEN Yes.
MILES Do you know who I work for?
BEN Yes.
MILES Then you know he's put a lot of time and energy into finding you. So now I've found you. And I can tell him exactly where you are. Or I can lie, and tell him you were already dead. I'd be willing to do that, for 3.2 million dollars.
BEN You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?
MILES It's extortion if you want to get technical.
BEN 3.2? But why not 3.3 or 3.4?
BEN What makes you think I have access to that kind of money?
MILES Do not treat me like I'm one of them! Like I don't know who you are, or what you can do!
BEN Your friend Charlotte has seen me, she knows I'm alive.
MILES I'll take care of Charlotte. You just worry about getting me the money. You have two days.
BEN My present situation is a little bit restricted. Can that be amended?
MILES Okay. One week, in cash.
KATE Time's up.
MILES Don't even think about it!
KATE I said time's up!
MILES Ooh, this is hot.
KATE You got your meeting, now I want my answer.
MILES We got your name when you called the freighter. Of course we know about you and everybody else on the 815 manifest.
KATE Then prove it.
MILES Your name is Katherine Anne Austen, and you're wanted for murder, fraud, arson and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember. You're a fugitive. You got caught in Australia and the feds were bringing you back. So yeah, we know. If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island. Who knows, maybe you didn't survive the crash.
KATE Come on.
LOCKE Go back to your house, Kate.
KATE John, this has nothing to do with you—
LOCKE Go back to your house, Kate!
CLAIRE Hey. You okay?
KATE I couldn't sleep.
CLAIRE Yeah. The beds take a little getting used to.
KATE I didn't wake Aaron up, did I?
CLAIRE No. Aaron was born on this island, he can sleep through anything.
CLAIRE John. What are you doing?
LOCKE I'd like a moment alone with Kate. Would you excuse us, please, Claire?
KATE It's okay.
KATE John, I—
LOCKE I don't need to know why you did what you did, Kate. I just need to know what they said to each other.
KATE Miles told Ben that he would lie to the people he worked for on the boat, tell them that Ben was dead for 3.2 million dollars.
LOCKE Hmm.
KATE Listen, John. I'm sorry. I asked you where he was—
LOCKE You're not welcome here anymore. I want you gone by morning.
DUNCAN I worked it out so you two could have a few minutes of privacy.
KATE I don't need any privacy.
DUNCAN You need to talk to her, Kate. I'll be outside.
DIANE Hello, Katherine. Was it true, what he said? Dr. Shephard. That you're a hero.
DIANE Why won't you talk to me?
KATE Because, mom, the last time I tried to talk to you, when you got sick? When I risked my life to see you, you screamed for help and called the police!
DIANE Please. I don't want to fight with you, Katherine.
KATE Why are you here?
DIANE Because I... It all changed, when I thought you were dead. My doctors have given me six months to live for the last four years. I don't know how long I'm going to last. So I came here to tell you that I don't want to testify against you.
KATE Then don't.
DIANE I want to see my grandson.
KATE You came here to make a deal?
DIANE I just want to meet him.
KATE I don't want you anywhere near him. We're finished! We're finished!
SAWYER Oh hey, Freckles. You okay? Listen, look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothing. I wanted him to think that you'd fooled me too. No sense in him not trusting both of us.
KATE He wants me gone by tomorrow.
SAWYER What, he banished you? Well, I unbanish you. You can stay right here. This is my house.
SAWYER Okay, me and Montezuma's house. You're gonna be alright. I'll keep you safe.
CHARLOTTE Time. Okay, tell me. What do you remember?
DANIEL Uh...queen of diamonds? Then uh...six! Of clubs. Sorry. And then we have the red ten of...hearts, maybe?
CHARLOTTE It's two out of three. It's not bad. It's progress.
DANIEL Three cards, Charlotte. Is that progress?
JACK Hey. I've been calling your boat all day. Why isn't anyone answering?
CHARLOTTE We're here, how should we know? If they're not answering, they're probably--
JACK Are you telling me there is only one line on that boat?
CHARLOTTE There is another number that we're only supposed to use in emergencies.
JULIET It's an emergency.
JACK Put it on speaker.
REGINA Yeah?
CHARLOTTE Regina, it's Charlotte.
REGINA Why are you calling me on this number?
CHARLOTTE Minkowski wasn't answering. The people on the island want to talk to their friends, make sure they're alright.
REGINA What friends?
CHARLOTTE They left last night! Frank took them up in the helicopter.
REGINA What do you mean they took off? I thought the helicopter was with you.
LOCKE Morning.
MILES Listen. I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're wasting your time—
LOCKE Open your mouth. Open your mouth.
LOCKE Wide. Don't talk, bite down, bite down.
LOCKE I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day, I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself. My name is John Locke, and I'm responsible for the well-being of this island. Eventually, Miles, you're going to tell me who you are, you're going to tell me about the people on the boat, and you're going to tell me why you're so interested in Ben. In the meantime, however, you're going to keep your mouth shut. I learned something yesterday. No use in having rules if there's no punishment for breaking them. You'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger. Enjoy your breakfast.
KATE Wait, wait, wait a minute. Just slow down.
SAWYER Oh, come on! It's not like we ain't never done it before. Now, I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night. I get it. You were sad. But I mean, how can you resist after that whole "I'll keep you safe" thing?
KATE No, Sawyer.
SAWYER What? What, what'd I say?
KATE Forget it.
SAWYER Alright. You still think you might be pregnant.
KATE I'm not worried. And I'm not pregnant.
SAWYER Are you sure?
KATE Yeah, I'm sure.
SAWYER I mean, whoo!
KATE Would it have been the worst thing in the world?
SAWYER Yes, yes it would have been the worst thing in the world. What would we have done with a baby?
KATE I'm going back to the beach.
SAWYER Beach? What, you're leaving? Because of this? That's that? You crawl up in my bed one second, and the next you just—
KATE Goodbye, James.
SAWYER Don't make this about me, Kate. You didn't want a baby any more than I did. You're just looking for some excuse to split, and now you got one. But it's alright, Freckles, I ain't gonna hold it against you. I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed. Because in about a week, you'll find some reason to get pissed at Jack and bounce right back to me.
JUDGE Ms. Dunbrook? Are the people ready to proceed?
MELISSA May we approach the bench, your honor?
JUDGE Oh, please.
MELISSA Unfortunately, your honor, our chief witness, Diane Janssen, the mother of the defendant, is unable to testify because of medical reasons.
JUDGE How long will you need?
MELISSA I can't say right now.
JUDGE What I'm going to do is grant a recess for lunch, but be ready to proceed with the case after we return. (to all) This court is now in recess.
BALIFF All rise.
MELISSA We have to talk.
MELISSA My key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday, and now she's got cold feet.
DUNCAN Quit posturing, and let's get to it. What are you offering?
MELISSA Four years in.
DUNCAN No jail time. Kate Austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other people's lives after a plane crash, and nearly starved to death on a deserted island. And after all that, you put this woman on trial for rescuing her mother from an abusive husband. If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time, then you must have a hell of a closing, Melissa.
MELISSA Alright. Time served plus ten year's probation in agreement that she does not leave the state.
DUNCAN What does that matter? She can go anywhere she—
KATE No, I'll take it.
DUNCAN No, wait, Kate--
KATE Give me something to sign and I'll sign it. And then I walk out the back door. I just...I just want this to be over.
MELISSA I can do that. Ten years probation, and you stay put.
KATE I have a child. I'm not going anywhere.
JACK Hey.
KATE How did you know I'd be here?
JACK Uh, your lawyer gave me the heads up. He owed me one.
KATE Thank you for saying what you did.
JACK You're welcome.
KATE You know, Jack, I've heard you say that story so many times, I'm starting to think you believe it.
JACK I just...I just wanted to tell you that what I said in there...I didn't mean it.
KATE Do you want to follow me? Come by for a visit?
JACK Uh, I actually have to get over to the hospital. But um...maybe you and I could grab some coffee together or something.
KATE I know why you don't want to see the baby, Jack. But until you do...until you want to, there's no you and me going for coffee. But um...if at anytime you change your mind, come and see us.
JACK Yeah. Okay.
KATE Bye.
JACK Bye.
KATE Hello?
NANNY Kate! I'm so glad you're back. He missed you so much.
KATE Did you keep him away from the TV?
NANNY Absolutely. I just put him down for a nap.
KATE Hey buddy. Hey.
KATE Hey.
AARON Hi mommy.
KATE Hi, Aaron.
