claire_littleton What are you writing?
mr_eko Things I need to remember.
claire_littleton Do you mind if I sit?
mr_eko Please.
claire_littleton Thanks. So you're Eko, huh?
mr_eko Yes.
claire_littleton Claire; and this is Aaron.
mr_eko Aaron? The brother of Moses?
claire_littleton Yeah, that must have been tough to live up to, right? The pressure of everyone saying, "Why can't you be more like your brother, Moses."
mr_eko Yes, I'm sure it was. Why did you choose it -- Aaron?
claire_littleton I just liked it.
mr_eko Aaron was a great man. Moses had great difficulty speaking so it was Aaron who spoke for him.
claire_littleton So you're religious, huh? You should speak to Charlie. He doesn't want to admit he's religious, but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary.
mr_eko Statue?
claire_littleton Yeah, he says he found it on the island. Weird, right?
mr_eko May I see it?
mr_eko Where did he find this?
claire_littleton He said he found it in the jungle.
mr_eko Where in the jungle?
claire_littleton I don't know.
mr_eko Where?!
claire_littleton Look, what are you -- it's just a statue.
mr_eko Just a statue?
mr_eko Where is Charlie?
michael_dawson You breaking in or breaking out?
john_locke I used to love those old silent movies where the robbers would crack a combination lock with their ear pressed up against the safe. And the money they stole was always in a white bag with a big dollar sign on it.
michael_dawson Silent movies, huh? You're not that old, man.
john_locke I'm old enough.
michael_dawson You set the combination?
john_locke With the new folks joining us I figure we better limit people's access to the guns. Can't have just anyone who wants one walk in and help themselves -- which I'm guessing is why you're here, Michael.
charlie_pace He's got wit he's got charm/But when he gets rough he'll break your arm/He's got taste, manners and grace/But when he gets rough he'll slit your face/He'll buy you jewels, expensive shoes, uh, oooo -- Hey Jin, do you like the Kinks? Kinks?
jinsoo_kwon Keens?
charlie_pace No, man, Kinks. Kinks with a "k" at the end. A kicking ka. Kinks. You know, Once you're in love, you're not getting out ha-a-a-a so look out. It's a good tune, Jin. Look out.
jinsoo_kwon 너때문에 물고기가 다 도망가잖아!
charlie_pace Oh, thank you very much, Jin. I do have a beautiful voice, don't I?
mr_eko Where did you find this?
charlie_pace What happened?
mr_eko Where did you find it?
charlie_pace In the jungle. I found it in the jungle.
mr_eko Take me there.
jinsoo_kwon 왜 그래?
mr_eko This is not your business. I want you to take me to where you found it.
charlie_pace Okay, fine. Yeah, we'll go for a stroll -- there's nothing there. We'll go first thing in the morning, alright?
mr_eko We're going now.
charlie_pace Okay, let me go tell Claire so she doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait here --
mr_eko Tell her on your way.
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN Get us some beers. Go.
mr_eko Where did you find this?
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN What does it matter?
mr_eko Same in the other bag?
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN Yes.
mr_eko Fifty.
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN Fifty what?
mr_eko Fifty is what I will pay you in exchange for the favor you are asking me to do.
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN A favor?
mr_eko You have a large quantity of heroin in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale. Your drugs are of no value here, so you must get them out. The borders are all guarded by the military so you must fly. But as I'm sure you are aware the only private planes currently allowed into the air are either U.N. aid or the Catholic missionaries. And so you have come to me for a favor. I will buy your heroin -- for 50.
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN It is true what they say about you.
mr_eko And what is that?
tough_moroccan MOROCCAN You have no soul.
mr_eko No. Go. Go. And tell your friends that I let you live -- that Mr. Eko let you live.
charlie_pace Just give me a second, okay? Hi, Claire. What happened to the statue?
claire_littleton Don't play stupid, Charlie.
charlie_pace What?
claire_littleton What's this? Because this was in your little statue. And, unless I'm mistaken I seem to remember you saying you're a drug addict.
charlie_pace I didn't know. Look, it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know? Claire, I'm not using. Look, you believe me now? I don't -- care.
claire_littleton Someone's waiting for you.
john_locke Got it?
michael_dawson Got it.
john_locke Alright. Breath half-way out -- gently squeeze the trigger. Squeeze. Good.
michael_dawson How'd you learn all this stuff?
john_locke My dad used to take me hunting.
michael_dawson Hunting for what?
john_locke Birds mostly. Of course, birds don't shoot back.
michael_dawson Yeah. I know people are talking -- thinking I'm going to go running off after Walt again.
john_locke If people are talking I'm not hearing it. But if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan.
michael_dawson Yeah, it's not.
john_locke Let's try one for real.
john_locke Bravo.
charlie_pace Well done with Claire, mate. You got me in a lot of trouble there, so thanks for that. Hope you're happy. Oh, that's right, you don't do happy. Alright, well, we're here. I found it right here, right by that tree.
mr_eko You found it here?
charlie_pace Yeah, found it here.
mr_eko You're lying.
charlie_pace You know what? I don't even know you. You asked to see where I found it. This is where I found it. We're done. Have a nice hike.
mr_eko You did not find the statue here. Take me to the plane.
charlie_pace How'd you know about the plane, man? It's old, you know. It's been out in the jungle for years. Of course, you would know that - you know everything.
mr_eko Why did you lie to the girl?
charlie_pace What?
mr_eko You told her you did not know what was inside the statue.
charlie_pace I wasn't lying.
mr_eko Then what is the wrong idea?
charlie_pace What?
mr_eko When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster, you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea. What is the wrong idea?
charlie_pace I don't have to tell you anything, man. You come traipsing across the island, and what, suddenly now you're in charge? You want me to take you to your plane? You best start treating me with some respect. I'm not just some guy you can just...
charlie_pace What? What?
mr_eko Let's go.
charlie_pace Yes, sir.
nigerian_woman WOMAN Sir! Sir, if you buy a statue, the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 200 Naira, sir.
yemi What are you doing here?
mr_eko I have come to give my confession.
yemi Hello, Eko.
mr_eko Hello, brother.
mr_eko So I come to visit you for the first time in 3 years and you won't hear my confession? You know, Monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper Catholic boy.
yemi Well, why waste your time confessing. It won't help you.
mr_eko It won't?
yemi No, for confession to mean something you must have a penitent heart.
mr_eko You and your guilt, Yemi. I've only done what I needed to do to survive. How is that a sin?
yemi You may live far from here, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard of who you are and what you have done.
mr_eko Have you forgotten how you got that cross, brother -- the day they took me? Is what I did that day a sin? Or is it forgiven because it was you that was saved?
yemi Why are you here, Eko?
mr_eko I have come to help you. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. I would like to use one of your church relief flights to transport it.
yemi Merchandise? You mean drugs.
mr_eko It is not my normal business, Yemi. We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria so that they cannot be used by our people. And the money -- you'll have all the money to buy your vaccine. God has given us this opportunity; we should not turn our back on it.
yemi God did not bring you here, Eko. Your own greed did. I will always love you, but I will not help you. It's good to see you again, brother.
james_ford A little close to the ear, Freckles. You sure you know what you're doing?
kate_austen Would you please turn your head.
james_ford Why, you ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck? I can cut my own damn hair.
kate_austen You know, you don't have to be belligerent just for belligerence's sake. Everyone loves you now.
james_ford Bull puckey.
hugo_reyes Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man.
james_ford Yo yourself, Pillsbury.
kate_austen See?
michael_dawson Hey, Kate? Hey, Locke said you were on hatch duty later. I was wondering if, uh, you mind if I go instead?
kate_austen You want my shift?
michael_dawson Help me take my mind off things.
kate_austen Sure, it's all yours.
michael_dawson Thanks, appreciate it. Glad you're okay, man.
james_ford Yeah. Don't even say anything.
charlie_pace Alright, time to take a break.
mr_eko You just had a break.
charlie_pace I'm not what you think I am.
mr_eko And what do I think you are?
charlie_pace It was my brother's fault.
mr_eko Sorry?
charlie_pace It was his fault I became an addict. He started with the heroin. I tried to make him stop. You don't know me, man. I was a good person. I was an altar boy. Alright, I knew what was in that statue, it doesn't mean I needed what was inside it. So don't judge me, man.
charlie_pace What? What's that? It's a parachute.
charlie_pace Is that a priest?
charlie_pace What are you doing?
charlie_pace You know that guy?
mr_eko Yes, this man saved my life.
charlie_pace He saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense. He takes off in a plane in Nigeria -- we're out in the middle of the South Pacific -- that makes all the sense in the world.
charlie_pace This is scripture written here. You're a priest. You're a priest, right? He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right?
mr_eko I need to talk to you.
yemi I'm in the middle of a confession.
mr_eko It cannot wait.
yemi Bless you. God be with you all and please come back in the morning. It's okay. How dare you come here and disrupt my work?
mr_eko Have you reconsidered?
yemi What?
mr_eko My request?
yemi Flying drugs under the cover of the church? How is that something I could ever reconsider? Look, hey, don't touch those!
mr_eko I'm going to make this easy for you. You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
yemi Make you priests?
mr_eko Just sign these ordination documents and I will give you the money for the vaccines.
yemi Leave this church now, Eko. Go. Now.
mr_eko Yemi, I understand that you live in a world where righteousness and evil seem very far apart, but that is not the real world. I am your brother and I would never do anything to hurt you, but my friends -- if you do not do what I ask -- they will burn this church to the ground. Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper? Think of the lives you will save.
yemi My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
mr_eko How many of the statues do you have left? The Virgin Mary statues, how many?
yemi I don't know -- three hundred.
mr_eko I will take all of them.
mr_eko I guess we are both sinners now.
yemi Perhaps we are but God will forgive me, Eko.
charlie_pace Uh, I'm lost. It was dark. I was following Sayid. Right afterwards a big bag of rocks fell on my head so I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography.
mr_eko Climb that tree.
charlie_pace What?
mr_eko Climb that tree and perhaps you will be able to get your bearings or spot the plane.
charlie_pace You climb it. What if I don't? You going to beat me with your Jesus stick? I find it a little odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it.
mr_eko Are you going to climb that tree, or not?
charlie_pace What kind of priest are you, anyway?
mr_eko You need to get higher.
charlie_pace Wonderful. Thank you.
charlie_pace Eko, run! Run!
mr_eko Did you see it?
charlie_pace Yeah, I saw it. What the bloody hell did you do?
mr_eko I did nothing.
charlie_pace Most people, when they see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run.
mr_eko I was not afraid of it.
charlie_pace I can see that. That thing kills people.
mr_eko Did you see the plane?
charlie_pace Yes, I saw your plane. It's about a kilometer that way.
mr_eko Thank you.
charlie_pace Wait!
michael_dawson Come on. Come on. Where are you?
MONITOR#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode10 Dad?
michael_dawson Are you OK?
MONITOR#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode10 Yes. Are you alone?
michael_dawson Yes.
MONITOR#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode10 Can't talk long. They're coming back soon.
michael_dawson Where are you?
MONITOR#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode10 You need to com...
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Michael.
michael_dawson Hey.
dr_jack_shephard How're you doing?
michael_dawson I'm good, thanks.
dr_jack_shephard You down here alone?
michael_dawson Yeah, Hurley's supposed to be here, but, uh, I guess he's running late.
dr_jack_shephard Well, listen, uh, no one's forgotten about Walt.
michael_dawson What?
dr_jack_shephard I can't -- I don't have any idea what you must be going through, but I just want you to know that as soon as we can we're going to figure a way to go out and bring him back.
michael_dawson Yeah, thanks, man. Thanks.
dr_jack_shephard You okay?
michael_dawson Yeah, fine.
dr_jack_shephard Well, I'll leave you to it then.
michael_dawson Thanks.
ulu Eko.
mr_eko What are you doing here, Yemi?
yemi I came to stop you.
mr_eko Go back to your church.
yemi Do not get on that plane, Eko. You saved my life once and now I'm here to save yours.
mr_eko Save my life?
yemi Look, if you get on that plane -- if you do this...
mr_eko Do what, Yemi?! Are you a prophet now?!
yemi Please, Eko! Let me take your confession! Anything I can do, I will do! But please, don't go.
goldie He called the military!
mr_eko You did this?
yemi I did not tell them who was involved. Just leave the drugs and come back with me.
yemi No! Stop! No more! No more!
mr_eko Yemi! No! No! Help me get to the plane.
mr_eko Forgive me, forgive me.
lead_soldier Father? Are you okay, Father?
charlie_pace Eko? Who's that?
mr_eko He's my brother.
charlie_pace I'm sorry.
mr_eko For the one I broke.
charlie_pace So, are you a priest or aren't you?
mr_eko Yes, I am. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I fear no evil for thou art with me; thy rod, thy staff they comfort me.
mr_eko Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.
charlie_pace Claire?
claire_littleton You lied to me, Charlie.
charlie_pace I know I did. I'm sorry. I just -- it made me feel safer to have it around.
claire_littleton Look, I can't have you around my baby, okay?
charlie_pace Claire, I...
claire_littleton Charlie, I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us, okay?! Just go.
