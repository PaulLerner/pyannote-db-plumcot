HURLEY He wasn't on the plane.
KATE Who wasn't on the plane?
HURLEY Ethan, the Canadian guy, he is not on the passenger manifest.
JACK Well, where the hell is he?
HURLEY I don't know. I saw him yesterday, but now...
JACK Has anyone seen Ethan?
KATE Sayid's leg.
JACK Has anyone seen Ethan?
MICHAEL Yeah, yeah. He went to go get some wood. He took off on the path to the beach. Is he okay? What happened?
JACK Where's Charlie?
KATE What?
JACK Where's Charlie?
LOCKE He went after Claire.
LOCKE Jack!
JACK She was moving back to the beach. Claire. That's hers. What happened? What...
LOCKE I don't know. Footprints. At least three distinct sets all over the place. It looks like there might have been a struggle.
JACK What? What is it?
LOCKE Drag marks. Here. And here.
JACK Claire and Charlie, they were together.
LOCKE I think they've been taken.
JACK Claire!! Charlie! Claire!
LOCKE Jack. Jack. Shhhh.
LOCKE Tracks are still fresh.
JACK This doesn't make any sense. How can one man drag off two people, one of them pregnant?
LOCKE You're asking the wrong question. Not how, why?
JACK You think it was Ethan.
LOCKE It certainly feels like it was Ethan, doesn't it?
JACK By himself. How?
LOCKE We can't account for all of our people. And, more importantly, who's to say they're even our people?
JACK What?
LOCKE Sayid said there were others.
JACK Sayid said we're not alone.
LOCKE Semantics.
JACK Sayid's injured. We're not even sure where he went. He's delirious.
LOCKE I'm just telling you what the ground is telling me.
JACK So which way is the ground telling you that they went?
LOCKE Jack, we don't know what's going on here.
JACK We know enough.
LOCKE We need to prepare. We could be back at the caves in 10 minutes, organize a search party, get wea-
JACK Which way did they go, Locke?
NURSE ...stats are dropping.
JACK C'mon, c'mon.
NURSE #2 BP's falling. She's bleeding out.
JACK No, I've got the artery almost there.
NURSE #2 She's in arrest.
JACK 1 milligram epi. Let's get the crash cart over here. Alright, artery's sealed. Close her up.
NURSE Defib.
JACK Charge
NURSE Charged.
JACK Clear. Charge.
NURSE We're charged.
JACK Clear.
JACK Come on, come on back now, come on. Come on now. Come on back. Come on.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Call it.
JACK Come on, baby, come back. Come back. Come on, baby, come on. Come on now. You can do this. Come on. Come on.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Call it, Jack. It's over, call it.
JACK You call it.
KATE You let him go alone?
LOCKE Don't worry. I'll catch up. What's the word from the beach?
KATE Nothing. Nobody has seen him.
KATE I'm coming with you.
LOCKE I figured you might.
SHANNON What are you doing? We need to get our water and get back to the beach...
BOONE I heard you're forming a search party. Can I help?
SHANNON This is a deserted Island. There's no choppers, no Amber Alerts. How exactly are you going to find them?
LOCKE By following Ethan's trail. No one can walk through the wilderness without leaving signs, bending blades of grass, breaking twigs, especially with captives in tow. And yes, I could use another hand if you're up for it.
BOONE I'm up for it.
LOCKE Then let's get moving.
WALT I could take Vincent, and he could sniff something that belonged to Charlie. And I can help.
MICHAEL I said no, man. Hey, Locke. Hey, look, you know, a lot of us don't just want to sit here waiting for news.
LOCKE Thanks, but we're set. Anyone else will just slow us down.
MICHAEL Okay. Maybe I'll just put together another party.
LOCKE Good idea. We're going north. I suggest you go south.
MICHAEL Come on.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I never thought I'd see the day, Jack. You barge into my O.R. You work on my patient.
JACK You didn't have to do this procedure.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I don't have to do anything.
JACK Yeah, of course, you don't.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I chose to do this procedure, this emergency procedure, because when this girl crashed in the ER, they called me.
JACK I was right upstairs.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD And you should have stayed upstairs. And how did you find out?
JACK One of the nurses came to get me.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Who? Oh, thank god I have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me.
JACK She told me that your hands were shaking.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD My hands were not...
JACK You cut her hepatic artery.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD She was in a car crash, Jack. Her insides were a mess.
JACK You made a mistake.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD They called me. I...
JACK I don't care whether they called you. You made a mistake.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Are you lecturing me?! You tell me, if you were upstairs, and I was in a restaurant having lunch, then why did they call me?
JACK How many drinks did you have at lunch, dad?
LOCKE Jack. Jack. It's a good thing you were going in a circle. Not much of a search grid, but we never would have found you otherwise.
KATE Did you find anything?
JACK No.
LOCKE You should go back to the caves -- Sayid's leg.
JACK I dressed Sayid's leg. You found me, we can find Charlie and Claire. Now, do we have a trail to follow or not?
LOCKE Jack, this was my fault.
JACK What?
LOCKE I hunted with Ethan. I spent time with him. I never sensed anything -- off. But for everything that I know about hunting, tracking -- whoever he is, he knows more. If we catch up with him, I don't want anything to happen to the only trained physician on the Island. So go back, be the doctor. Let me be the hunter.
JACK Can we go now?
LOCKE Follow me.
MICHAEL I'm trying to help and all the guy can tell me is go south? Like what? I'm going to get in his way or something?
HURLEY We're all tweaked, man. Locke's just feeling it like the rest of us.
MICHAEL So, what? There's five other guys who would've gone out there with me, putting our necks on the line to find Charlie and Claire. All I'm saying is I'm getting sick of getting treated like a second class citizen around here because Mount Baldy can bag a boar.
WALT He knows a lot more than how to catch a boar. Mr. Locke is a warrior. He can hunt, he can track stuff, and he's the only who brought knives. So, if it were me, I would listen to him.
MICHAEL Well, I don't want you to. You understand? You stay with Hurley. I may not be a warrior, but I am going south.
HURLEY Back home, I'm known as something of a warrior myself.
LOCKE We mark our progress by line of sight. We tie these off so we don't get lost.
BOONE You can lead us back to camp, right?
LOCKE If nothing happens to me.
BOONE Maybe I better take marker detail.
JACK Anything?
LOCKE Not yet.
JACK If you can't find the trail...
LOCKE I'll pick it up again, alright? We need to rest for a minute to get our clarity back.
JACK You're going to take a break? It's got to be almost 4 o'clock. When the sun sets there's no way...
LOCKE It's 425. And, yes, I'm taking a break.
KATE Can I talk to you for a sec? Would it kill you to give the guy a little space?
JACK It might.
KATE Stop that.
JACK What?
KATE That. What's going on?
JACK I didn't believe her -- Claire. I gave her a sedative.
KATE Jack, you can't...
JACK She told me someone was after her, that she was being attacked, and I -- she just seemed so out of it. I thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress and I... I didn't believe her.
LOCKE Jack!
KATE What is it?
LOCKE Look familiar?
JACK It's Charlie's.
BOONE You think it just came off?
JACK No. He's leaving us a trail.
JACK They went this way.
LOCKE I'm not so sure. There's another trail here.
JACK What do mean, another?
LOCKE These are footprints. People moved off this way.
JACK Charlie's leaving these for us to follow . They went that way.
KATE Unless Charlie isn't the one leaving them. If Ethan knows that we're behind him, he could be setting up a dummy trail. Take off in one direction, double-back his own footprints.
BOONE Wait? Now you're a tracker?
LOCKE You're just full of surprises.
JACK So, we've got two trails. Let's split up, I'll take that one.
LOCKE No. We should stay together, Jack.
JACK Why? We've got two trails, and, apparently, two trackers.
LOCKE Be careful.
SAWYER Who got taken by what?
WALT Charlie and Claire, they think Ethan took them.
SAWYER Ethan took them, huh?
WALT Yeah.
SAWYER Took them why? And who the hell is Ethan?
WALT I don't know. He wasn't on the list thing, the manifest.
SAWYER Ever think he might have lied about his name?
WALT It's stupid to lie about your name.
SAWYER Alrighty, Tattoo, where do you think Ethan came from?
WALT Maybe he was already on the Island, before we were.
SAWYER You got yourself one hell of an imagination, kid.
WALT There could be lots of other people on the Island.
SAWYER So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH-1 has-beens? Yeah, fiendishly clever. And why am I getting the evening news from a 6 year old?
WALT I'm 10.
SAWYER Okay, then it must be true.
WALT If you don't believe me, ask Sayid. He said we're not alone.
SAWYER Sayid's back?
BOONE Red shirt.
LOCKE Huh?
BOONE Red shirt. Ever watch "Star Trek"?
LOCKE Nah, not really.
BOONE The crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys, the captain and the guy with the pointy ears, they always wore red shirts. And they always got killed.
LOCKE Yeah?
BOONE Yeah.
LOCKE Sounds like a piss-poor captain.
BOONE What do you do in the real world, Mr. Locke?
LOCKE It's John.
BOONE John.
LOCKE Why don't you guess?
BOONE Well, you're either a taxidermist or a hit man?
LOCKE I was a regional collection supervisor for a box company.
BOONE A box company?
LOCKE They made boxes.
BOONE Yeah, right.
KATE Please, slow down.
JACK You said they went this way.
KATE I think they went this way. I'm not as good at this as Locke is.
JACK So where did you pick up the tracking skills, Kate? Was that before or after you were on the run?
KATE I'm trying to help, Jack.
JACK You know what might help? A little honesty. Just give me something real, anything.
KATE My dad was in the army. Ranger Battalion. We were stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington State. We'd go hiking together. One day we spend 8 hours tracking deer. Being in the woods, it was like -- it was like his religion. That was real. Anything you want to share, Jack?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Oh, thanks for coming in, Jack. Have a seat. 
JACK What does it say?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD The truth, that a patient was brought to the ER following a car accident, rushed into surgery with massive internal bleeding -- you joined me, and in spite of our most heroic efforts, the patient succumbed to her injuries.
JACK Looks like you fixed everything but the patient. You had no business being in O.R.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Do you really think I would have walked in there if I couldn't handle it?
JACK You've done it before.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD That's right, I have, because I am perfectly capable of making those...
JACK How can you say that after what happened yesterday?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD The problem is not that...
JACK You were impaired.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I know my limits.
JACK I won't sign this.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD You're a part of the team, Jack. I'm not the only one on the hook for this. You called me off. You were the surgeon of record when she died. Look, accidents happen in surgeries all the time, Jack. That's the truth and you know it. But if you contradict this report, if you mention alcohol, well, that's the only fact that's going to matter. They'll strip me of my license.
JACK Yes, they will.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD I know I have been hard on you, but that is how you make a soft metal into steel. That is why you are the most gifted young surgeon in this city. And this, this is a career that is all about the greater good. I've had to sacrifice certain aspects of my relationship with you so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live because of your extraordinary skills. I know it's a long, a long time coming. What happened yesterday, I promise you, will never happen again. And after all what I've given -- this is not just about my career, Jack. It's my life.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Thank you, son. Thank you.
SAWYER Well, well, well. I don't know if you Islams got a concept of karma, but I get the sense this Island just served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback.
SAYID What do you want?
SAWYER Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics so I have to hump it up here everyday just to get my meds. You know, a less magnanimous man than I might just be thinking he could beat the ever-living-snot out of you right now without fear of reprisal.
SAYID You want to take a shot? Take it. But know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you. It was never my intention to return.
SAWYER Sorry, fresh out of sweet forgiveness. If it wasn't your intention to return, then why did you?
SAYID I was taken prisoner by the French woman.
SAWYER The one who's been sending out a distress signal for 16 years? She's alive?
SAYID She was on a science expedition. She said their ship wrecked.
SAWYER She alone?
SAYID She said that there are others on this Island.
SAWYER Her people?
SAYID No. She believed they had all gotten sick. She murdered her entire team.
SAWYER Right. And these others, who the hell are they?
SAYID I don't know. She's never seen them.
SAWYER Oh, she's never seen them, but she knows they're there.
SAYID If you believe her.
SAWYER Do you?
SAYID Maybe. Maybe not. But on my way back I heard something in the jungle surrounding me.
SAWYER Something like what?
SAYID Have you got something to say to me, Sawyer, or are you going to continue asking me questions you know I don't have the answers to?
SAWYER Tide's coming up the beach. Plane hull's almost in the water. Kept your signal fire burning.
HURLEY Crap.
WALT Your blacks can't get in.
HURLEY Yeah, I know my blacks can't get in.
WALT My roll.
HURLEY Yahoo.
WALT Need a 4-3. 
HURLEY Dude, would you please roll?
WALT Yes.
HURLEY No!
WALT Your turn.
WALT It's okay, I wasn't very good when I first started playing, either.
HURLEY I didn't just start playing. I took 17th in a tournament once.
WALT 17th is not very good.
HURLEY No, 17th is very good.
WALT C'mon double 6's, double 6's. Yes.
HURLEY Aw, you've got to be kidding me,
WALT I'm lucky.
HURLEY No one is that lucky.
WALT My dad said I was the luckiest person he ever knew.
HURLEY Really?
WALT Not Michael, Brian. My other dad. Yeah, um. . . Yes! Yes! C'mon, one more game, double or nothing.
HURLEY Can't. I have a meeting.
WALT A meeting?
HURLEY Yeah. A meeting.
WALT You owe me 20 thousand dollars!
HURLEY You'll get it.
BOONE It's been all 15 minutes since we've seen any sign. What are we following?
LOCKE My gut.
BOONE Great.
LOCKE So, Boone, what did you do in the real world?
BOONE I run a business.
LOCKE What kind of business?
BOONE Uh, it's a wedding thing.
LOCKE Huh?
BOONE My mother has this empire. The Martha Stewart of matrimony. I run one of the subsidiaries.
LOCKE So who's running it now?
BOONE I guess it doesn't matter, does it?
LOCKE I'm sure there are people who can handle it, temporarily. It's going to start raining, in one minute.
BOONE 1 minute?
LOCKE Give or take a few seconds. You should turn around, Boone, and head back.
BOONE What?
LOCKE The trail's been cold for a quarter mile, dangerous terrain ahead. If you start now, you'll make it back to camp before dark.
BOONE What about you?
LOCKE I can take care of myself.
BOONE No, I'm not heading back.
LOCKE I admire your courage, but...
BOONE I'm not heading back.
LOCKE Alright.
BOONE They teach you how to predict the weather in a box company?!
JACK I guess we were right. Where to now?
KATE Jack? Jack, where are you going? Jack?
JACK Didn't you hear her?
KATE What? Hear, hear who?
KATE Jack!
ETHAN If you do not stop following me, I will kill one of them. Do you understand?
ETHAN No more warnings.
ANDREA Dr. Shephard.
JACK Andrea. Andrea, that man that my father is talking to, who is that?
ANDREA That's her husband. He's threatening to sue.
KATE Jack, Jack. Jack, are you okay?
JACK How long was I out?
KATE I don't know, I'm sorry, you slid on the rocks and...
JACK Ethan?
KATE What?
JACK Ethan was here.
KATE You banged your head, Jack.
JACK No, no. He was here.
KATE You have to stop. The rain has washed away the trail. Even if he was here -- you've got -- Jack!
JACK I'm not letting him do this.
KATE Not letting him?!
JACK Not again.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD We realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously, at which point the patient went into cardiac arrest. Of course, every effort was made to resuscitate her, but the severity of her injuries, the amount of internal bleeding, made that impossible. Now, in my professional opinion, ladies and gentlemen, and that's all I have, by the time I was called in the damage was irreversible.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR Okay, thanks, Christian. Sorry about this formality.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Of course.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR Just one final detail -- you were aware of the patient's pregnancy when you went into the procedure?
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Absolutely. The patient's husband had informed the attending in the ER. It was, however, extremely early in the pregnancy, so our primary focus had to be on the mother.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR Okay, then. I think we're done here. The final report will be filed.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Okay.
JACK I need to -- revise my statement. I didn't come into the O.R. until well into the procedure.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Jack?
JACK I was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating... under the influence.
CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD Jack. This is not...
JACK By the time I got there it was clear that my father was not only incapacitated, but that he had also severed the patient's hepatic artery, which, in my professional opinion, caused the crisis which led to her death.
JACK No. You've got to cut him down.
JACK Hold on, Charlie. Hold on there.
KATE I can't reach! Pull him over to me!
JACK He's not breathing. C'mon, breathe, Charlie. C'mon, breathe. C'mon. C'mon.
JACK C'mon, Charlie, c'mon! C'mon, c'mon, Charlie, c'mon!
KATE Jack, Jack stop, he's not...! Jack, stop, he's not coming...
KATE It's okay, it's okay.
JACK No, no.
KATE Jack, Jack! 
KATE Stop! Stop!
JACK C'mon! C'mon.
JACK Just breathe, breathe. Breathe deep, breathe deep. You're okay.
WALT Dad! They brought Charlie back. But he hasn't said anything since he came back.
MICHAEL They find Claire?
JACK Does that hurt? How's your breathing? Charlie, you've got to talk to me. We're going to back out and look for Claire the moment the sun comes up, and I could really use your help. Anything that you can tell me about what you remember, where you were going. Did you see or hear...?
CHARLIE I didn't see anything, hear anything. I don't remember anything. Claire...
JACK What?
CHARLIE That's all they wanted.
JACK They?
CHARLIE All they wanted was Claire.
SHANNON They aren't back yet.
KATE I'm sure they just made camp for the night. If there's anyone on this Island that your brother's safe with, it's Locke.
BOONE Are we lost?
LOCKE No, Boone, we're not lost.
BOONE Sorry, it's just... I don't see how you can still be following this trail. I think we should go back.
LOCKE Don't you feel it?
BOONE Feel what?
LOCKE It.
BOONE Alright, John. I'm going to follow the strips back.
LOCKE Suit yourself. Boone, you need this more than I do.
BOONE What is that?
LOCKE Steel.
BOONE Could that be part of the plane? Part of the wreckage?
BOONE What is that?
LOCKE That's what we're going to find out.
