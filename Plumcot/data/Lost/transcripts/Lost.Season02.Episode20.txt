kate_austen Michael, Michael. What's wrong with him? Michael. Michael? Jack, where are you going?
dr_jack_shephard Maybe they just let him go?
kate_austen Let him go? He's alone. They didn't just push him out into the jungle, Jack! He's alone!
dr_jack_shephard Okay, let's go.
PARTNER#unknown#Lost.Season02.Episode20 See ya, Ana Lucia.
captain_teresa_cortez You look tired.
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, thanks. What?
captain_teresa_cortez Where were you last night?
ana_lucia_cortez Home.
captain_teresa_cortez All night?
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, cooked myself some dinner, watched some TV.
captain_teresa_cortez What'd you watch? Let's go for a drive.
captain_teresa_cortez Remember Jason McCormack? Found him in a parking lot just after three in the morning. He was dead an hour before anyone saw him. Crime scene pulled a gun from the dumpster -- registration was filed off, no prints, no witnesses. He was executed.
ana_lucia_cortez Any idea who did it?
captain_teresa_cortez Yeah, Ana, you did. This man confesses to shooting you in cold blood, and you refuse to ID him, so we had to cut him loose. A week later he shows up with five bullets in his chest because you shot him in cold blood.
ana_lucia_cortez Guess I should get a lawyer.
captain_teresa_cortez Look, we both know that this is going to be a dead-end investigation. But, Ana, if you did this -- if you did this -- you have to let me help you.
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, thanks, mom; but I don't need your help.
captain_teresa_cortez You don't want my help; you're going to have to get it from somewhere else. You're a police officer, Ana. If you don't respect me, at least respect that.
ana_lucia_cortez Then I quit.
ana_lucia_cortez Hey, Henry, what do you say? How long are you going to keep up this hunger strike, Henry? I ever tell you I was a cop? I've been around a lot of killers in my life. You know what surprises me most about them? How much they love to talk. But you're different, Henry. Hmm? Quiet.
ben_linus
ana_lucia_cortez What was that?
ben_linus
ana_lucia_cortez If you're going to say something; you're going to have to speak up.
ben_linus You killed two of us -- good people who were leaving you alone. You're the killer, Ana Lucia.
john_locke I guess he decided to start talking, huh?
ana_lucia_cortez Hey, Mike, tequila-tonic.
dr_christian_shephard Long day, huh? Good to see you again. You, uh, wanded me at security. Another one, please. So, how does one get into wanding?
ana_lucia_cortez One stops being a cop.
dr_christian_shephard What a coincidence, I just stopped being a doctor.
ana_lucia_cortez Why'd you quit?
dr_christian_shephard I didn't. My son ratted me out for drinking on the job. Thank you. Lost my license. Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.
ana_lucia_cortez No, no, it's just that I don't think parents and their kids should work together -- too many issues.
dr_christian_shephard I'll drink to that.
ana_lucia_cortez So, where you headed?
dr_christian_shephard Sydney. Sydney, Australia. You want to come? I'm serious.
ana_lucia_cortez Why would I go to Sydney with you?
dr_christian_shephard Maybe fate has just thrown the two of us together, you know. Two drinks in an airport bar --
ana_lucia_cortez Why would fate do that?
dr_christian_shephard Same reason fate does anything -- so that we can help each other out. You do need help, right? Unless you don't. What I'm doing down there could be a little dangerous and I need someone to protect me -- a bodyguard. It's perfect for someone who stopped being a cop.
ana_lucia_cortez I don't even know your name.
dr_christian_shephard Oh, let's not use real names. I'll tell you what -- why don't you pick a name for me and then I'll pick one for you.
ana_lucia_cortez You look like a Tom.
dr_christian_shephard Tom, what an excellent name. And you should be a -- Sarah. Australia.
libby_smith What happened?
ana_lucia_cortez I cut myself shaving. The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.
libby_smith You okay?
ana_lucia_cortez I'm fine; but he won't be.
libby_smith Hey, Ana?
ana_lucia_cortez What?
libby_smith Don't do anything stupid.
ben_linus If you've come to apologize, I forgive for hitting me with your crutch. I'm so glad my head didn't break it.
john_locke Why?
ben_linus Now that's a broad question.
john_locke Why'd you try to hurt Ana Lucia, but not me?
ben_linus I'm not sure I know what you're getting at, John.
john_locke I was trapped under that blast door, helpless. You could've crushed my skull, but you didn't do a thing. Why didn't you?
ben_linus Because you're one of the good ones, John.
john_locke What? Good what?
ben_linus None of this matters. I'm dead anyway. The doctor's gone to make a trade and we both know he'll come back empty-handed and then I've lost my value. So either Jack comes back here and kills me or my people find out where I'm being held and they do it.
john_locke Why would your own people want to kill you?
ben_linus Because the man in charge -- he's a great man, John, a brilliant man -- but he's not a forgiving man. He'll kill me because I failed, John. I failed my mission.
john_locke What mission?
ben_linus When that woman caught me in her trap I was on my way here, John. I was coming for you.
kate_austen Locke!
dr_jack_shephard Locke, get out here! Locke! Locke!
kate_austen John!
james_ford Hey, I've been knocking those things down for 20 minutes. Get your hands off of my damn mangoes.
ana_lucia_cortez I didn't figure you for the fruit picking type.
james_ford What do you want?
ana_lucia_cortez I need a gun.
james_ford Well, here's an idea -- why not go to your buddy, Jack? He's got himself a gun. Oh, that's right, he's still traipsing around the jungle with Kate.
ana_lucia_cortez If you've got a problem because he's making time with your girlfriend, don't take it out on me, man. How about you just give me a gun?
james_ford Here's another idea -- scram. You heard me, now git.
dr_christian_shephard Sarah. Sarah, open the damn door. Good, you're up. It's time -- protection duty. Come on, let's go.
ana_lucia_cortez After four days of drinking and doing nothing -- now, in the middle of the night, you're ready to go?
dr_christian_shephard That's exactly right. It's time, come on. Fate's calling, Sarah.
dr_christian_shephard This is it, pull over right here.
ana_lucia_cortez This is what you needed protection for -- the suburbs?
dr_christian_shephard Stay in the car.
ana_lucia_cortez Should I keep the meter running?
dr_christian_shephard I just want to see my daughter. She's my daughter and I have every right to see her!
lindsey_littleton No, you don't have a right! Now get out!
dr_christian_shephard I pay the mortgage on this house... I want to see my daughter!
ana_lucia_cortez What the hell is wrong with you?
lindsey_littleton Don't you ever come back here!
dr_christian_shephard I was just having a conversation with the lady.
lindsey_littleton You need help!
hugo_reyes Dude, nice hole.
sayid_jarrah What is it, Hurley?
hugo_reyes Hey, man, remember that radio we made? I'm thinking maybe I could get it to play some music. You know, for Libby.
sayid_jarrah Well, it worked only once and then just for a minute. I've tried several times since and only gotten static.
hugo_reyes Here's the thing -- even that would be good -- because then Libby would be like, "it's the thought that counts" -- and I'll score major points. Especially when she sees me holding it over my head.
sayid_jarrah And why would you hold a static generating radio over your head?
hugo_reyes They didn't have "Say Anything" in Baghdad? It's awesome. This dude, like, gets his boom box and he holds it over his head outside this chick's window and he plays some Peter Gabriel song for her and bam, the girl's, like, his. I mean, after her dad goes to jail. But then he gets her.
sayid_jarrah I think I get the idea.
hugo_reyes You should really check it out sometime. I mean, if we ever, you know, get off this island.
sayid_jarrah If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometers from here. You could take her there.
hugo_reyes You think she'd like that?
sayid_jarrah I took Shannon there once.
dr_jack_shephard Michael. Michael.
john_locke So, it worked?
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about, John?
john_locke Your deal -- the trade. If they gave us Michael...
dr_jack_shephard They didn't give us anything.
john_locke So, it was just a coincidence that he came wandering out?
dr_jack_shephard I was shouting; he heard my voice. What, they just let Michael go hoping we would keep up our end of the bargain? You think they're on the honor system?
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
james_ford Come out, come out whoever you are. I know you're there. Don't make me come in after you. Well, well, well, what have we got here? Was little red riding hood going to follow the big bad wolf back to his big old stash-o-guns?
ana_lucia_cortez Why don't you give me that one, right there?
james_ford I ain't going to gimme you nothing. We've been through this, Lucy.
james_ford What you gonna do now, Muchacha?
dr_christian_shephard We need some damn music in here.
ana_lucia_cortez Who is she?
dr_christian_shephard Who is who?
ana_lucia_cortez That woman.
dr_christian_shephard She is a very long story, Sarah.
ana_lucia_cortez It's Ana Lucia.
dr_christian_shephard Well, I'm still Tom.
ana_lucia_cortez You're pathetic, that's what you are.
dr_christian_shephard You bet your sweet ass I am.
ana_lucia_cortez Why are you here?
dr_christian_shephard I'm here because I can't apologize to my son. He tried to help me, so I thanked him by cutting him off. I thanked him by hating him. You came here for the same reason I did, kiddo. You ran away. My, my, look what fate has delivered up this time. Come on, let's go have a drink or ten and be pathetic together. What do you say?
ana_lucia_cortez No. No.
dr_christian_shephard It's your call.
james_ford Hey, I'm walking here!
ana_lucia_cortez Wait, don't. Let's just get the hell out of Sydney. Let's just go. Let's go back.
dr_christian_shephard I can't ever go back. See ya, kiddo.
ana_lucia_cortez What?
james_ford Don't you want my phone number?
ana_lucia_cortez You tell anyone about this and I'll kill you.
james_ford I guess that takes cuddling off the table.
libby_smith Hey there. How's it going?
hugo_reyes This isn't what it looks like.
libby_smith And, what does it look like?
hugo_reyes It looks like something that... it's not. Aw, man. I'm so busted.
libby_smith Hurley, I'm not here to tell you how to act around food.
hugo_reyes Naw, I'm not busted for that. I'm busted for something else. I was packing a picnic because I was kind of hoping that you'd want to go with me. You know, as an 'us' thing. But, it was a surprise.
libby_smith Really? That's very sweet.
hugo_reyes So, you want to go?
libby_smith Where to?
hugo_reyes Can that part still be a surprise?
ana_lucia_cortez Hey, you're back.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
ana_lucia_cortez So, the Others -- they didn't show up?
dr_jack_shephard No. Michael's back, though. What happened here?
john_locke My fault. I left the tap on in the bathroom sink and Ana wiped out and hit her head on the bathroom counter. And I'm sorry, again.
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah, don't worry about it.
kate_austen Jack? Jack. I think he's waking up.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, Michael.
michael_dawson Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, man.
michael_dawson Wait a minute... how did I get...?
dr_jack_shephard Wait, try to take it easy, okay. You're back in the hatch. We found you out in the jungle last night.
michael_dawson Oh, my head.
john_locke Welcome back.
michael_dawson Hey, John. I found them. After I left I hiked North back to where we were . I hiked to the beach -- followed the shore line. A day later I saw one.
john_locke What did he look like?
michael_dawson He was dirty, worn clothing, no shoes, simple. Just like the rest of them.
dr_jack_shephard Like the rest of them?
michael_dawson Yeah, his people -- the Others. I followed him back to his camp. They live in tents -- canvas tents and teepees. They eat dried fish. They're worse off than we are.
kate_austen How many of them were there?
michael_dawson I counted 22.
dr_jack_shephard And, the boat?
michael_dawson I didn't see it.
dr_jack_shephard Did you see Walt?
michael_dawson No. But I know he's there.
ana_lucia_cortez What about everyone else they took? Cindy -- did you see any other kids?
michael_dawson No, no, no kids, no. But I think they were in the same place as my boy. They have a hatch.
dr_jack_shephard How do you know that they...
michael_dawson There's a set of metal doors leading underground. What else could it be?
dr_jack_shephard And you think that's where they're keeping the kids?
michael_dawson They keep it guarded 24/7. Two guards, two guns. And two guns is all I saw. They're barely armed. Most of them are old and half of them are women. I wanted -- I couldn't save him. So I came back to tell you -- tell you that we can take them. As soon as I get my strength back, I will take us back there. And we are going to get my boy back.
dr_jack_shephard You were right.
john_locke Right about what?
dr_jack_shephard About Henry -- what you and Sayid did to him when you first found him. You were right. I don't like how you did it, but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.
john_locke Well, you did what you thought was right at the time you thought it, Jack. I just hope that next time you decide to do something you include me. And something tells me that's going to be soon.
dr_jack_shephard You heard Michael. We can take them.
john_locke Our friend with the beard told us not to cross the line.
dr_jack_shephard These people are liars, John. Why should we take their word on anything?
john_locke I couldn't agree more. So, now what?
kate_austen Where are you going?
john_locke To get our guns back from Sawyer.
dr_jack_shephard We're going to need you to help convince him.
kate_austen Who's going to take care of Michael?
ana_lucia_cortez I'll stay. You guys go ahead.
dr_jack_shephard You sure?
ana_lucia_cortez Give Sawyer my best.
dr_jack_shephard Alright, we'll be back soon.
hugo_reyes Watch your head. Almost there.
libby_smith You ever watch the Flintstones?
hugo_reyes Sure, I used to watch it all the time when I was in the hospital -- when I broke my hip.
libby_smith Well, did you ever notice how Fred would run by the same thing over and over again? Third time past this tree.
hugo_reyes Uh, that's a different tree.
libby_smith Hurley, it's okay if you're lost.
hugo_reyes Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me? We're right about to walk on the most excellent secret beach on the Island, and -- surprise!
libby_smith Uh, Hurley, this is our beach. There's Jin. Hey, I'll tell you what -- why not have the picnic here? Come on, give me the blankets.
hugo_reyes Blankets?
libby_smith You don't have any blankets? How about drinks? Okay, I'll tell you what, I will handle the blankets. You just track down Rose and Bernard. I saw them pull wine from the pallet, okay?
hugo_reyes Oh, wine. Groovy. Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough I'll remember where I know you from.
libby_smith Yeah, okay.
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer, put the book down.
james_ford It's not a book, it's a manuscript. I'm about to be the first and only guy to find out who done it. I think I've got it figured out. Cool your damn jets and walk around the coconut trees; I've got, like, ten pages left.
james_ford Hey!
dr_jack_shephard You want to figure it out?
james_ford What is your problem, Doc?!
dr_jack_shephard It's time to give us the guns back.
james_ford You burn the ending of my book and now you want...
john_locke Where are they, James?
james_ford You too, Brutus?
kate_austen Just take us there, Sawyer, alright? Quit playing around.
james_ford What, did you bring her along for a sympathy vote? She ain't in my head, Doc. Why don't you two just go play in the jungle, huh?
dr_jack_shephard Take us to the guns, now.
james_ford Ah, that bitch. She stole my damn gun -- Ana Lucia.
dr_jack_shephard Why would she need a gun?
james_ford Son of a bitch.
john_locke Jack, I need to tell you something.
ana_lucia_cortez Pick it up. Cut yourself loose.
ben_linus What?
ana_lucia_cortez Just do it.
ben_linus Why?
ana_lucia_cortez You know why.
ben_linus He kept saying you were misunderstood.
ana_lucia_cortez What are you talking about?
ben_linus Goodwin. Yes, he told us all about you, Ana -- how he thought you were worthy, and that he could change you. But he was wrong. And it cost him his life.
ana_lucia_cortez He was going to kill me.
ben_linus Was he?
ana_lucia_cortez Are you done?
ben_linus Yes, Ana, I'm done.
ben_linus So, this is it, huh?
ana_lucia_cortez Yes, Henry. This is it.
dr_jack_shephard I want you to listen to me, okay, because I'm asking you a favor, Crissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral. And I'm asking you a favor. In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there , and I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Crissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because -- because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just -- I need to bury my father.
ana_lucia_cortez That was an airplane. No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney. That's right, Australia. I -- I don't know, I -- I made a mistake, mom. You knew, so I got as far away from you as I could. But now -- I want to come home, mom.
captain_teresa_cortez So come home.
ana_lucia_cortez I'm on Oceanic flight 815.
captain_teresa_cortez I'll be there when you land, mija.
michael_dawson Where is everybody?
ana_lucia_cortez What you said got them worked up. They went to get all the guns back from Sawyer.
michael_dawson Sawyer? Sawyer has all the guns?
ana_lucia_cortez Long story.
michael_dawson At least he didn't get that one.
ana_lucia_cortez Yeah. Too bad I can't use it.
michael_dawson Use it on what?
ana_lucia_cortez We caught one of them -- the Others. He's locked up in there.
michael_dawson How long has he...?
ana_lucia_cortez Over a week.
michael_dawson And you're what -- taking care of him?
ana_lucia_cortez He tried to kill me today, so I wanted him dead. I couldn't do it. I couldn't even kill him. I looked at him and he -- I can't do this anymore.
michael_dawson Then let me do it. They're animals. I've seen these people and they are animals. They took my son -- right out of my hands -- they took my son and -- I'll do it. Give me the gun. I'll kill him. Because that's what they do. What's the combination?
ana_lucia_cortez 18 right, 1 left, 31 right.
michael_dawson I'm sorry.
ana_lucia_cortez For what?
libby_smith Michael?!
