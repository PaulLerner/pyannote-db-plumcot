KATE Hi. I'm expecting a letter -- hold for guest arrival.
SANJAY Sure, what's your name?
KATE Joan Hart.
SANJAY Oh, Joan Hart.
CHARLIE Platinum.
KATE Platinum?
CHARLIE As in platinum record -- as in a million units sold. Now, Drive Shaft's albums must have spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster. When I come back, alive, it's going to be insane.
KATE So you think the raft's going to work?
CHARLIE Yeah, of course it will work, look at that thing. It's not a raft. They built a sodding boat. And when they get picked up, the helicopters will come, making us ridiculously and eternally famous. What's the matter, don't you want to be famous?
KATE What do you think is going on over there?
ARZT Sure, you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch. I was just assuming you didn't want to die.
MICHAEL So, when is the next time we can launch?
ARZT 3, maybe 4, months.
SAWYER C'mon, even a weather man on TV don't know what's going to happen. Why are we listening to Arzt?
ARZT Because I'm a doctor, and you're a hillbilly.
SAWYER You're a damn high school science teacher.
JACK Hey, Sawyer, just let the man talk.
ARZT It's been raining every afternoon. That means that we are on the cusp on monsoon season. Monsoon season is bad. Now, the trade winds are blowing north right now -- shipping lanes are north -- so north is exactly where you want to be.
MICHAEL What does that mean?
ARZT It means that when monsoon season hits the trade winds are going to shift to the south. The raft goes with the wind. Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that is south of us?
JACK Antarctica.
ARZT That's right, Jack, Antarctica.
MICHAEL So, when do we have to leave?
ARZT Yesterday.
KATE So obviously you believe him?
MICHAEL Arzt? I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances.
KATE You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?
MICHAEL The man said not a day to waste.
KATE Supplies all set? You've got food, fresh water?
MICHAEL Kate, no offense, but I've got work to do. Why the sudden interest?
KATE Because I'm going with you.
MICHAEL Look, the raft's full -- we need 4, we got 4.
KATE Including Sawyer?
MICHAEL Including him. We needed the stuff he had so he bought his way on.
KATE To the first raft, which burned.
MICHAEL You know, I'm not going to get into semantics with you. I told the guy...
KATE He doesn't even know how to sail.
MICHAEL And you do?
KATE I spent 2 summers crewing J boats. I know my way around a sailboat.
MICHAEL Yeah, maybe so, but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.
KATE You're bringing Walt, too? I'm just saying it's dangerous.
MICHAEL I decide what's best for my boy. And right now, what's best for him is to get the hell off this Island. The raft's full.
HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT Hospital chaplain to the neural ICU. Hospital chaplain please report to the neural ICU.
KATE I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.
NURSE Right, she just came up from ICU. She's in room 208. It's around the corner to your right.
KATE Thanks.
NURSE You're welcome.
KATE Hey, Tom.
TOM Oh, Katie. What are you doing here?
KATE Diane's dying of cancer. I thought I owed it to her to come see her.
TOM I heard. I'm sorry.
KATE Yeah, me too.
TOM So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
KATE I need your help.
SUN 당신도 갈 거에요? 여보, 제발 나랑 얘기 좀 해요. 
JIN 나도 갈 거야. 
JACK How much further?
SAYID We're almost there.
JACK You want to tell me where we're going, Sayid?
SAYID It's better that you see it for yourself.
JACK No, I'm not so sure that it is. Tell me why you brought me out here or I'm going to turn around.
LOCKE He brought you out here because I asked him to. I asked him not to tell you. I wanted you to have an open mind.
JACK Open mind about what?
JACK My god, what is this thing?
LOCKE Exactly. I guess it's time we talked about this.
SAWYER Yo, chief, dumb question here -- we're sailing out in the ocean, right?
MICHAEL Do you mind?
SAWYER Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.
MICHAEL Yeah?
SAWYER We can't catch fish?
MICHAEL Do you know anything about surviving at sea -- sailing, navigating, steering a raft?
SAWYER Do you?
MICHAEL It doesn't matter what I know, I built it. Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft.
SAWYER You're going to vote me off, Mickey? And who the hell's going to take my place?
SAWYER What the hell do you think you're doing?
KATE I'm sorry?
SAWYER Don't give me the awe-golly eyes. Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.
KATE I was just asking some questions. He must have misunderstood me.
SAWYER I know what you're doing.
KATE Yeah?
SAWYER Yeah, just like I know why you wanted that Halliburton case so bad -- the one that belonged to that U.S. Marshal who was flying with us. You were his prisoner.
KATE Let go of me.
SAWYER The only chance of running is getting on that raft, ain't it? We get picked up by a ship and they come back to rescue the rest of you all -- there's going to be a nice big asterisk next to your name. Don't worry puddin', your secret's safe with me. But just so you know -- no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft.
KATE Hey Sawyer. I want your spot, I'll get your spot.
MICHAEL Hey, give me that water, man.
WALT Yo, dad.
MICHAEL Thanks.
WALT So what were you and Sawyer arguing about?
MICHAEL I told him something he didn't want to hear.
WALT Why does he want to get on the raft so much?
MICHAEL Because he knows it's going to work.
WALT When we get rescued we're going to come back for everybody else, right?
MICHAEL Yeah, sure, of course. The thing is -- this Island, uh, is, uh -- finding it again might be hard.
WALT Can't we fly around and look for it?
MICHAEL Absolutely, but there's no guarantees. That's why you and me-
WALT Dad?
MICHAEL Oh . That's why you and... 
WALT Dad! Dad!
MICHAEL Get Jack.
WALT Help! I need help. It's my dad.
KATE What's the matter?
WALT His stomach is really bad.
KATE Take him back to Michael. I'll go get Jack.
SUN Okay. Let's go.
WALT This way.
KATE Jack! Jack!
JACK How long have you known about this?
LOCKE 3 weeks, give or take.
JACK 3 weeks. You've been out here for 3 weeks digging this thing up and you never told me about it?
LOCKE All due respect, Jack, but since when do I report to you?
JACK All due respect, John, but you lied.
LOCKE How long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know? You used your best discretion. I used mine.
JACK So how do we open it?
SAYID What? You want to open it?
JACK Yeah.
SAYID We should bury it! I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity. Anything could be inside!
JACK Best case scenario there's supplies -- worst case, we use it as a shelter.
SAYID Actually, Jack, I can think of much worse cases than that. You notice anything about this hatch? There's no handle. Could the reason for that be more obvious?! Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.
KATE Jack! Jack!
JACK Yeah, over here!
KATE It's Michael, something's wrong.
JACK What'd you eat today?
MICHAEL Uh, fruit, fish.
JACK You drinking enough water?
MICHAEL 2 or 3 bottles.
JACK Where are you getting that water from?
MICHAEL You know, the caves, like everybody else.
JACK Alright, listen, Michael, just take it easy, okay? You stay in the shade and try not to move too much, okay.
MICHAEL No. We have to launch that raft tomorrow. We have to.
JACK I know, I know. I need you to lay back.
KATE Lay down. Just lay down, okay.
TOM Hello? Hey, Adam, hey, listen can you carve out some time for me on the MRI? Yeah, it's a favor for a friend of a friend. Um, no, that would work out great, okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam. His name's Conner.
KATE How old is he?
TOM 22 months next week.
KATE He's beautiful.
TOM Yeah, well, it's Rachel, it's not me.
KATE Where is she?
TOM She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks. They get back on Sunday. I got Diane in for an MRI. Now, they'll bring her downstairs to radiology. The appointment's not til 5am, so, we've got about 3 hours to kill.
KATE Tom...
TOM You're welcome.
KATE You think it's still there?
TOM What?
KATE You know what.
TOM It's the middle of the night, Katie.
KATE We might not get another chance.
LOCKE What do you think it is? Heatstroke?
JACK No, he would have felt that coming on.
LOCKE Bad fruit maybe? Raw fish?
JACK Michael and Jin are on the same diet.
LOCKE Well, Jin's fine.
JACK Jin's fine. What was making him sick was metabolized fast. It hit him quick and it hit him hard.
LOCKE So you think it was the water.
JACK No, I don't think it was the water. I think it was something in the water.
JACK Feeling any better?
MICHAEL The cramps are quieting down -- as long as I don't move, or, -- or breathe.
MICHAEL You and Locke kiss and make up? Good.
JACK No, Michael.
MICHAEL What?
JACK Drink from that one.
MICHAEL Somebody did this to me?
JACK I don't know. I'm not sure of anything yet.
MICHAEL Sawyer.
HURLEY I'm on bamboo duty, but yeah, sometimes I help refill the water.
LOCKE Michael and Jin getting along?
HURLEY Well, they fight like a married couple building a raft together...
LOCKE You told him?
JACK Think Sawyer might have done it.
HURLEY Oh, because of Kate?
JACK Kate?
HURLEY Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft. So Sawyer went off on Michael because, you know, he gets to decide who goes. Hey, you don't think Kate did it, do you?
LOCKE Why would Kate poison Michael?
HURLEY Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.
HURLEY He doesn't know? Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn't even know about the polar bear.
LOCKE What did she do?
JACK I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
LOCKE And you didn't think the others should know about this, Jack?
JACK Discretion, John.
CLAIRE Okay, can you stop moving or I'm going to cut your ear off.
CHARLIE Ah, this is good. I'm writing again. I'm really feeling it, as well. So, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get rescued?
CLAIRE You know, I don't really know.
CHARLIE You can hang out with me in L.A. -- you and turnip-head. You know, until you figure things out.
CLAIRE Thanks.
CHARLIE Smashing. Okay, check this out. This is track 2. It's called... Sorry. It's called "Monster Eats the Pilot".
KATE How's Michael?
JACK He's going to be fine.
KATE Somebody going to be taking his place on the raft?
JACK I don't know.
KATE Because, you know, Dr. Arzt said if they leave tomorrow...
JACK Did you poison Michael, Kate?
KATE What?
JACK He's not sick, someone did this.
KATE Do you really think I'm capable of that?
JACK I don't know what you're capable of.
KATE You brought beer?
TOM No self-respecting man in Iowa goes anywhere without beer.
TOM It's not fair, you know -- you coming back. Here. Home.
KATE Yeah, I know.
TOM Wow.
KATE Wow. Oh.
TOM Oh my god. My plane. I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there.
KATE That was your idea. Kate and Tom, 1989.
YOUNG TOM Is it on? I don't think it's on.
YOUNG KATE It's on.
YOUNG TOM Okay, this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan and this is our dedication for our time capsule, here on August 15th, 1989. Hey, give me that back.
YOUNG KATE Why are you putting this stupid plane in there?
YOUNG TOM Because it's cool, Katie. I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself.
YOUNG KATE Ooh, that is cool, just like this time capsule.
YOUNG TOM It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in like 20 years.
YOUNG KATE How do you know we'll be together?
YOUNG TOM Because we'll be married and you'll be a mom and we'll have 9 kids.
YOUNG KATE I don't think so. As soon as I get my license we should just get in a car and drive. You know, run away.
YOUNG TOM You always want to run away, Katie.
YOUNG KATE Yeah, and you know why.
TOM Funny how things turn out, huh?
KATE Yeah.
KATE Sorry.
TOM We'd better get to the hospital.
KATE Yeah.
WALT What happened?
LOCKE I had a little accident.
WALT Does it hurt?
LOCKE Yep. Something you want to tell me, Walt?
WALT I didn't do it.
LOCKE Didn't do what?
WALT I heard Jack. He thinks somebody got my dad sick. And I didn't do it.
LOCKE You think because I know you burned the first raft that I'd think you made your dad sick? We're friends, Walt. I didn't tell on you before and I'm not going to tell on you now. And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad.
LOCKE What's the matter?
WALT Don't open it.
LOCKE What'd you say?
WALT Don't open it, Mr. Locke. Don't open that thing.
LOCKE What? What thing?
WALT Just don't open it.
SAWYER Thought you might need that, boss. Wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before take-off.
MICHAEL What? You feeling guilty?
SAWYER What?
MICHAEL You're off the raft.
SAWYER Come again?
MICHAEL You're off the raft!
SAWYER We had a deal.
MICHAEL Yeah, well, the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me.
SAWYER I did what now?
MICHAEL I'm done with you.
SAWYER You ain't done with me by a damn sight. You said you needed 4!
MICHAEL I've got 4! You've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies, keeping it for yourself, using it to buy favors. You're a liar and a criminal, and I'm not letting you near my boy!
SAWYER Oh, I'm a criminal, huh?! I poisoned you because I'm a criminal!
SAWYER Get your hands off me, boy. Hey, sweet-cheeks! I had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock. Time to set things straight.
KATE Let go of me.
SAWYER Tell him who the criminal is!
CHARLIE Hey, leave her alone, man!
SAWYER Tell him!
KATE Give that back.
MICHAEL Leave her alone!
SAWYER Leave her alone?
KATE Give that back.
SAWYER Mmm-hmmm. Look. Look at this.
KATE Sawyer, please.
SAWYER You all remember Joanna, don't you? Huh? The woman who drowned? Now what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID? Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft? So she could get herself rescued, run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn Island? She might even poison the captain himself.
KATE Shut up!
SAWYER She don't care about nothin' or nobody but herself.
TOM This is good here. Thank you.
TOM My office is right back there. I'll wait for you.
KATE Hi, mom. Can you hear me? Mom?
KATE Mom? It's me, Katie.
DIANE Katherine?
KATE It's me, Katherine. I'm so sorry for everything that I have put you through.
DIANE Help. Help.
KATE It's okay, mom. It's just me.
DIANE Help. Help.
KATE It's okay.
DIANE Help. Help me. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me, somebody.
SECURITY GUARD What's going on?
KATE I'm her daughter. She's just confused. I was going to get a doctor.
SECURITY GUARD Hang on. We've got a situation-
TOM What happened?
KATE I need your car keys. 
TOM Kate, Katie?
KATE Get out.
TOM I am not letting you do this. Katie, if you cooperate they go easy...
KATE He's calling for backup! I've got to go! Get out!
TOM You can have a real life.
KATE Tom, please.
TOM No.
KATE Now. Get out.
TOM No!
KATE Tom? Tom! Oh god, Tom. No, no, no, Tom. Please wake up.
SAWYER You want to tell us why you need to run so bad? You want to tell us the truth?
KATE Yes. I was on the plane -- with the Marshal. Yes, I was wanted and caught and being transported back. No matter what I say about what happened -- about what I supposedly did -- I'm going to jail. But I didn't poison you.
MICHAEL Here.
JACK He looks determined.
SUN Yes, he is.
JACK You don't want him to go, do you?
SUN No.
JACK Is that why you tried to make him sick? Michael and Jin working together all the time -- pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up...
SUN I didn't want him to die out there. I just didn't know what to do. I only used enough to make him -- I wasn't trying to hurt him. Are you going to tell the others?
JACK I don't see any reason why they need to know. But Sun, he's going. If I were you, I'd -- I'd say goodbye.
SAWYER I'm back on the raft.
KATE I'm glad to hear it.
SAWYER Michael's going to cowboy up. We set sail tomorrow.
KATE Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?
SAWYER Nah, sorry don't suit me. You cornered me, Freckles. I did what I had to.
KATE I cornered you?
SAWYER You said if you wanted my spot you were going to take it. I guess I believed you. Well, that's that. I've got some packing to do.
KATE Why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
SAWYER 'Cuz there ain't anything on this Island worth staying for.
KATE Be safe, Sawyer.
SAWYER Yeah.
WALT Dad.
MICHAEL Hey, buddy.
WALT Feeling better?
MICHAEL Yeah, yep. I'm going to be alright. Hey, don't worry. I'm going to be on my feet soon. We'll be sailing home before you can even-
WALT I'm the one that burned the raft. I didn't want to leave and I thought I could stop you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, dad.
MICHAEL Hey, it's okay, man. We can stay here. You and me. We don't have to go.
WALT Yes we do.
SUN Hello.
KATE Hey.
SUN Jack knows. I didn't tell him it was your idea.
KATE Thanks.
SUN Why should you be punished? You were only trying to help me. He said he wouldn't tell the others.
KATE Yeah, Jack's good at keeping secrets.
SUN When I was a little girl I believed that once I found the man I loved I would be happy, forever.
KATE Yeah, me too.
