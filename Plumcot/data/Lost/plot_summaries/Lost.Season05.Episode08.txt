The survivors left on the island, now led by Sawyer after Locke's departure, find themselves back in the 1970s, where they are now forced to become members of the Dharma Initiative.
Thanks to Locke correctly moving the island, the time jumps finally stop to the survivors left on the island, in which Sawyer, Juliet, Miles, Jin, and Faraday find themselves now stranded on the island in the 1970s when they are forced to kill a small group of Others who try to abduct a young woman and are now forced to establish themselves as allies of the Dharma Initiative by trying to defuse a conflict between the Otheres (called 'Hostles' by the Dharma members) and the research group. Three years later in 1977, Sawyer (under his new alias Jim LaFleur) is now the foreman of the Dharma Initiative living with Juliet whom try to adjust to life and deal with their fellow members whom include the drunkard Horace Goodspeed and his pregnant wife Amy.
Sawyer, Jin, Juliet, Miles and Daniel see a hooded woman ready to be executed by two men and Sawyer and Juliet kill the men and save the woman. She asks them to bury the men and bring the victim, Paul, who was her husband, with her. Soon they learn that the year is 1974 and Amy and Paul belong to the Dharma Initiative. They head to the facility and Sawyer tells to their leader Horace that they are castaways and their ship sank while sailing to Haiti. When Richard Alpert arrives in the Dharma Initiative facility, Horace explains to Sawyer that they have a truce with The Others and now it was broken. However Sawyer offers to explain to Richard what happened. Three years later, Sawyer is the security chief of Dharma Initiative and Juliet, Jin and Miles also work there. Out of the blue, Sawyer receives a phone call from Jin and has a huge surprise.
