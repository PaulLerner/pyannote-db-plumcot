The French woman arrives at the camp with a dire warning about a group of survivors known as the Others.
Danielle Rousseau arrives in the camp of survivors at the beach and advises that "The Others" are coming. There is black smoke in the sky, and they have three choices: run, hide, or die. Jack recalls his meeting with Ana-Lucia Cortez in the airport. Meanwhile, the group is about to launch the raft. Sawyer tells Jack the conversation he had with his father in a bar in Australia. Jack, Kate, Locke, Hurley and Leslie Arzt go on an expedition to bring explosives from the Black Rock to blow the hatch. There they can shelter the survivors against "The Others". Meanwhile, Jin and Sun make peace and there are farewells to Michael, Walt, Sawyer and Jin as they finally set sail on their makeshift raft to find help and safety.
Danielle shows up unexpectedly to warn the survivors that "The Others" are coming. Jack leads a team into the "Dark Territory" to retrieve dynamite to open the hatch so the survivors can hide safely from this new unknown threat. The raft is launched carrying Michael, Walt, Jin, and Sawyer.
The survivors try to finish the raft. Jack, Locke, Kate, Hurley, and Danielle go to the Black Rock so they can get dynamite to open up the hatch. The survivors finally finish the raft, and Michael, Walt, Sawyer, and Jin leave. Danielle tells the survivors that the Others are coming and Sayid takes everyone to the caves so the Others don't find them.
