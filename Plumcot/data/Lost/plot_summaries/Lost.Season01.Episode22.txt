Jack suspects foul play when Michael becomes violently ill while building the raft. Meanwhile a secret from Kate's past is revealed, the mysterious hatch is shown to a few of the survivors, and Walt gives Locke a warning.
Jack suspects foul play when Michael becomes violently ill while building the raft and the suspects include both Kate and Sawyer. Meanwhile, more of Kate's background story is revealed involving her continuing fugitive status and her old school friend and the events leading up to his death. The mysterious hatch is shown by Locke to Jack and Sayid, and Walt gives Locke a warning not to open it.
Michael Dawson is advised by another survivor, named Mr. Leslie Artz, that the monsoon season will begin and he needs to sail on the next morning. Kate Austen requests the spot of Sawyer in the craft, since its full capacity of four persons is fulfilled. When Michael is poisoned, the group suspects of Kate. More of Kate's background story reveals years earlier when she was a fugitive (again the reason is not explained why, or what crime she committed), traveling to her home town to visit her terminally sick mother in the hospital and meeting her old school friend Tom Brennan (Mackenzie Astin), to get him to sneak her into the hospital, leading up to when he was accidentally killed. Also, Locke shows the hatch to Jack and Sayid. But Walt tells Locke not to open the hatch after touching Locke's hand and having a psychic vision, which disturbs Locke because he never told Walt about the hatch.
