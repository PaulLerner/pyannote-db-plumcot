After Mr. Eko has a vision of his dead brother, he sets out to return to the site of his plane crash.
A delirious Eko wrestles with demons from his past, while Locke, Sayid, Desmond, and two other castaways, Nikki and Paolo, head back to The Pearl -- one of the Dharma Initiative's island stations -- hoping to find a computer that they can use to locate Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Meanwhile, Jack doesn't know whom to trust when two of "The Others" (Ben and Juliet) seem at odds with one another when Ben wants Jack to perform surgery on him to remove a potentially dangerous tumor whereas Juliet does not want Jack to do it.
