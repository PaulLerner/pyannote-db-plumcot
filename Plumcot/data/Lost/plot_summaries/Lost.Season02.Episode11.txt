Jack, Locke and Sawyer follow Michael who left to look for his son. They meet "the others". More is shown about Jack's back-story.
The deranged Michael locks Jack and Locke in the ammunition storage room and leaves the shelter to go looking for Walt. Sawyer joins to Jack and Locke in an expedition to find Michael, but Jack asks Kate to stay with the computer at the hatch. While hiking in the jungle, Jack remembers the death of a patient, his comforting of the patient's daughter Gabriela, and how Sarah left him because work was always taking him away from the house, and her. The group is surrounded by "The Others" where their emissary, known as "Mr. Friendly" tells them that they must return to their beach camp without their guns, otherwise Kate, whom the others now have captive, will be executed before them. Meanwhile at the hatch, Hurley and Charlie pass the time playing old records, while Sun argues with Jin about wanting to help out Jack and the rest of the search party.
