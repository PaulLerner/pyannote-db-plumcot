The surviving members of the supposed "rescue team" are scattered around the island after a helicopter problem. However, once they are located, they reluctantly reveal that they are indeed not there to rescue them.
Four members of a supposed "rescue team" arrive on the island and are forced to bail out. They include scientist Daniel Faraday whom is found by Jack and Kate's group as well Miles Straume, a "spirit talker" and they try to find their grounded helicopter and their pilot, Frank Lapidus. Research specialist Charlotte Lewis is found by Locke, Claire, and their group where Ben knows Charlotte and that they are not here on the island to rescue them. At the beach camp, Sayid is also wary about the rescue people whom he suspects are there to mean them harm. Also, backgrounds are shown of the four "rescue party" members, Faraday, Charlotte, Miles, Frank, and Naomi and how they were recruited by a shady "third party" to find the mysterious island.
