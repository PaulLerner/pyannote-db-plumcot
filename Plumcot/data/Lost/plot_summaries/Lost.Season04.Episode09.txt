The team from the ship attacks Locke's camp looking for Ben, with Alex as a hostage. Meanwhile, the doctor from the ship washes up on shore at Jack's camp, and Daniel Faraday provides some distressing news to Jack.
Bernard finds the body of a man on the beach and Daniel identifies that he is the doctor of their ship. Meanwhile, Alex is captured and forced to shutdown the defense system of the housing compound, releasing a warning code. Ben organizes the defense of house and when Alex is executed by her captors, he releases the smoke monster to destroy the enemies. Meanwhile, in the future, Ben escapes from Tunisia to Iraq where he helps Sayid in the funeral of his wife Nadia; later Ben has an unexpected meeting with Charles Widmore in his suite late night in London.
Jack, Kate and the other castaways at the beach discover a body washed up ashore where Daniel Faraday identifies it as the ship's doctor... murdered. Meanwhile, a 'kill-squad' from the ship arrives at the settlement forcing Ben, Locke, Sawyer, Hurley, along with an injured Claire and an unwitting Miles to barricade themselves in Ben's house. The leader of the kill squad, Martin Keamy, arrives with the captive Alex and threatens to kill her unless Ben is handed over to them. In a flash forward, Ben is shown to have escaped from the island and how he came to hire Sayid after his own escape from the island, and how he became Ben's personal assassin to kill all those who work for the evil and powerful Charles Widmore who's obsessed with finding the island and using its magical power for his own nefarious reasons.
