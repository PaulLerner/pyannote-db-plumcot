Ben, Locke, and Hurley go to The Orchid, but Keamy and his men beat them there. Jack and Kate go after the helicopter, and are later joined by Sawyer. Sayid comes back to the island with a rescue boat, and then goes after them too.
Jack and Kate head off into the jungle to search for the helicopter landing site, just as Sawyer, Miles, and baby Aaron run into them to update them on the facts, including Claire's mysterious disappearance. Meanwhile, Sayid also returns to the island on the motor raft hoping to take a few people to the freighter offshore while Desmond, still aboard, learns what Michael intends to do. In a flash-forward, Jack, Kate, Sayid, Sun, Hurley, and Claire's baby son Aaron arrive safely back in Hawaii from their ordeal where they set about trying to keep the true facts of what happened on the island to protect the ones left behind... and themselves.
In the survivors' camp, Jack and Kate decide to seek the location in the woods where the helicopter landed expecting to find Sayid and Desmond. They meet Miles and Sawyer with Aaron, and Sawyer reveals what has happened with Claire disappearing. Kate returns with baby Aaron to the camp where she meets Sayid, who tells the true objectives of Keamy and his men. Daniel offers to take groups of six to the supply vessel, while Sayid and Kate track Jake and Sawyer. Meanwhile, Ben, Locke and Hurley reach the Orchid but Keamy has taken the site. In a flash-forward, the survivors of the Oceanic 815 are called Oceanic 6 by the press and meet their relatives. Jack is informed that Claire is his sister.
Jack and Sawyer try to find Locke, Ben and Hurley so they can rescue Hurley and then get off the island. Sayid returns to the island, and he and Kate try to get Jack and Sawyer so they won't run into the mercenaries. Ben, Locke, and Hurley continue their journey to the Orchid Station so Ben can "move the island". Desmond and Michael discover a bomb on the Freighter.
