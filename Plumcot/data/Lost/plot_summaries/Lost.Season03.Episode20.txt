As Ben takes Locke to see Jacob and reveal the island's secrets, Ben's background on the island is exposed--as well as what happened to the Dharma Initiative.
On the day of his birthday, Ben recalls important parts of his life: when he was born, his mother Emily, pregnant of seven months, was hiking with his father, Roger, dying after the delivery in the woods nearby Portland, Oregon. Years later when he was a boy, Ben's unemployed father moved to the island with him accepting a job offer, but becoming a frustrated man with a simple position of janitor in the ultra-secret project 'Dharma'. His drunkard father blamed him for the death of his mother. But because of the island's mysterious power, the young Ben had visions of his Dharma teacher, Olivia, and decided to leave the compound, meeting the so-called 'Hostiles'. Years later, the grown-up Ben kills his dysfunctional father with poison gas while he leads the 'Hostiles' in an all-out attack against the village, killing the entire staff of Dharma Initiative, and Ben becomes their leader. In the present, Locke brings the dead body of his father, and meets Ben and The Others at their new base camp. The Russian man, Mikhail Bakunin, informs Ben about the arrival of Naomi on the island. Ben brings Locke into the jungle to meet the shadowy 'Jacob', his superior and leader who claims to know the secrets of the island, and after the weird reunion, Ben shows Locke the ditch where the remains of Dharma people were dumped. Meanwhile, Sawyer shows the tape to Sayid and the other survivors exposing the betrayal of Juliet. When Jack and Juliet arrives, the situation becomes tense.
