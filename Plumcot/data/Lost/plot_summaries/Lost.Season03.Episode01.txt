Jack, Kate and Sawyer are kidnapped by the Others, who reveal themselves as more sophisticated and savvy than anyone guessed.
Jack, Kate and Sawyer are kidnapped by "The Others" and put in different environments. Kate has a shower, gets a dress and is invited to have breakfast on the beach with the leader Henry Gale (who identifies himself under his real name of Ben Linus); Sawyer is locked in a cage for wild animals and without food or water, being "awarded" when he hits a lever as if he were an animal; and Jack is locked in a sort of aquarium, being interrogated and controlled by his handler and the Others doctor, Juliet, who has a complete report about his life. Meanwhile, Jack recalls his divorce process with Sarah and how his desperation and rapid meltdown affected everyone around him, including his father.
