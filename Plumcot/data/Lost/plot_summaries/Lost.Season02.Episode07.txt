48 days ago, the tail section of Flight 815 crashes. The survivors struggle to live when some other people on the island continue to kidnap some of them.
The harrowing first 48 days in the lives of the 23 tail section survivors are revealed, formally introducing Ana Lucia, Mr. Eko, Libby, Cindy, Bernard, and Goodwin, and detailing the first terrifying days and battling the dreaded "others", leading to their numbers dwindling, their hikes though the jungle, and meeting with Jun, Michael and Sawyer.
The tail section of the airplane crashes in the ocean, and the 23 survivors reach the beach. They are led by the tough-minded Ana Lucia, the heroic Goodwin, the hulking West African Mr. Eko, as well as Bernard, Libby, and flight attendant Cindy. On the first night, they are attacked by "The Others" while sleeping at the beach and some of them are abducted, including two children. But Ana Lucia and Mr. Eko manage to fight them off, killing three of them. Further inspection show the others (two men and a woman) are barefoot, scruffy, people with near-super human strength and speed with the intelligence of genius's. Ana Lucia suspects that Nathan is one of the "others" who as infiltrated in the group and a few days later, she finds the truth but not before Nathan is killed. After 42 days, the five remaining tail crash survivors meet Jin, Michael, and Sawyer for the first time, leading to the events on Day 48 where they meet Shannon and Sayid in a tragic way.
