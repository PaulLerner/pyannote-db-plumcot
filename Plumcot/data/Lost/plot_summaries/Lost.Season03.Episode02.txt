Sayid's attempt to rescue Jack, Kate and Sawyer from the others jeopardizes Sun and Jin's lives.
On the sailboat, Sayid lies to Jin, and convinces Sun to sail to a dock to make a fire camp on the beach and signal to Jack, Kate, and Sawyer but actually he wants to attract and ambush a group of "The Others". Sun recalls her childhood in South Korea, when she broke a glass ballerina and lied to her domineering and brutal gangster father, blaming the maid. Later as an adult, she cheated Jin with Jae Lee. Her father found out and he ordered Jin to murder Jae Lee, while lying about the reasons. Jin also reveals that he lied when he said that he cannot understand any English. Meanwhile, Kate and Sawyer are sent to a field for labor work where they try to escape, but are thwarted by Juliet. Also, the Others leader, Ben Linus, offers a deal with Jack that he will send him back home if he cooperates with him and his people.
