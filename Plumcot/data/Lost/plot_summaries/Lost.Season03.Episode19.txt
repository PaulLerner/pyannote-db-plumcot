Locke comes back to the survivor's camp and lures Sawyer, telling him that he had kidnapped Ben and wants Sawyer to kill him. He brings Sawyer to the old vessel, the Black Rock, and locks him in the brig with his father. After an ironic conversation, Sawyer realizes that Anthony Cooper is the man that deceived his mother and responsible for the destruction of his family. More of Locke's three days with the Others at their new camp is shown. There Ben urged Lock to prove his worth to them by killing his father, whom they brought to the island. But Locke does not have the heart to do it and plots to have Sawyer kill Anthony Cooper for him. Meanwhile, Desmond, Hurley, Charlie and Jin secretly bring the mysterious and wounded woman, Naomi, back to the survivors camp and hide in Hurley's tent. Hurley tells the secret to Sayid so he tries to fix her radio to contact her vessel which lies about 80 miles away. But Kate sees the device and reveals the secret to Jack and Juliet. Locke releases Sawyer and gives a tape-recorder to him proving that Juliet is a traitor and The Others will raid her camp to get the pregnant Sun.
Locke returns from the Others. He tells Sawyer that he kidnapped Ben and needs Sawyer to kill him. When they get to the Black Rock where Locke kept Ben, Sawyer sees that it is really Locke's father...and in time Sawyer discovers why he has to kill him.
