After Claire returns with no memory since the flight, Jack and Locke form a plan against her kidnapper, who threatens to kill the other survivors.
After the missing Claire returns with no recollection of what has happened since before the doomed flight of Oceanic 815, Jack and Locke formulate a plan of defense against her kidnapper, the mysterious Ethan Rom, who threatens to kill off the other survivors unless Claire is returned to him. Meanwhile, the disappointment Charlie feels when Claire does not remember him triggers recollections of Lucy, a woman he had let down in the past back in England where Charlie ruined their engagement so he could steal money from her to fuel his escalating heroin addition.
Claire Littleton has amnesia, and Charlie Pace tries to help her to recover her memory. Meanwhile, he recalls his girlfriend Lucy and how he destroyed their engagement due to heroine. Ethan Rom stalks Charlie in the forest, and tells Charlie to bring Claire back to him; otherwise he would kill one survivor per day. Dr. Jack Shephard, John Locke, Sayid Jarrah, James "Sawyer" Ford and Kate Austen organize a group to capture Ethan using Claire as bait and so they can try to disclose the mystery of the island.
