Locke experiences visions of Boone, leading him to a new mystery on the island.
The fates of Locke, Eko and Desmond are revealed after the implosion of the hatch, while Hurley returns to the beach camp to tell the tale of what happened when he, Jack, Kate and Sawyer encountered "The Others". A mute Locke makes a sweat-lodge and talks to the spirit of Boone who persuades him to rescue Mr. Eko from a polar bear cave with Charlie's help. Desmond also survived the implosion, but not quite the same. More of Locke's background is revealed how his life took a turn when he, living with a group of "farmers" picked up a lonely youth who was not who he appeared to be. Meanwhile, Claire is shocked to find fellow survivors, Nikki and Paulo, in Jack's tent.
Locke wakes up mute after the implosion of the hatch, recovers his faith on the island and builds a sweat tent for self meditation. He has a vision of Boone guiding him through the airport before the check in of the passengers of Flight 815. He goes with Charlie to rescue Mr. Eko from a polar bear in its cave, and meets with Hurley returning to the survivors' camp, who tells what happened with Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Meanwhile, Locke recalls his relationship with his new acquaintance, Eddie, in a community where he lived over 10 years ago.
