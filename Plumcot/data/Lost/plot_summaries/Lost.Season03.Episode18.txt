An unlikely person helps Desmond save the life of the mysterious woman who crashed onto the island, and Juliet helps Sun find out whether she conceived on the island or before the plane crash.
Juliet invites Sun along the night to submit to a medical ultrasound examination in a facility of The Others hidden in an old Dharma station to determine the date of conception of the fetus. Juliet discloses that all women that became pregnant in the island had died, driving Sun to a dilemma about who could be the father of the baby. Sun recalls when she was blackmailed by a mysterious woman about the origins of Jin and his impoverished background. Meanwhile in the jungle, Desmond, Charlie, Jin, and Hurley capture Mikhail, the mysterious Russian man (first presumed dead), and he makes an offer: he could heal the wounded woman, named Naomi who parachuted onto the island via helicopter, if they release him after the conclusion of the medical procedures.
