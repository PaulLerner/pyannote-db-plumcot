Sleepwalking Claire Littleton is held by Charlie Pace during a nightmare. The next night, she claims that she was attacked, but Jack believes she is stressed due to the pregnancy and imagining things. Claire becomes upset with the situation, and while recalling her past, she decides to move to the beach with Charlie. Meanwhile, Hurley Reyes decides to prepare a query to find out who each survivor is. He compares the results with the flight manifest and realizes that the weird Ethan Rom was not on the flight while Sayid Jarrah returns telling that they are not alone in the island. Jack looks for Claire and Charlie.
After Claire has nightmares about someone attacking her, she gets attacked the next night by a unseen person. But Jack thinks she's hallucinating (as a result of stress-pregnancy). As a result, Hurley decides it's a good idea to find out who are the people on the island... and he discovers something weird looking at the flight manifest. Meanwhile, Claire's background story is revealed showing her at her home in Australian where she became pregnant from her boyfriend, who later abandoned her, as well as her difficult decision to give her baby up for adoption, and meeting a mysterious psychic who convinced her to take the ill-fated flight that landed her on the island. Also, a delirious Sayid returns from his trip into the jungle. These stories at the end become into ONE BIG SURPRISE: they are not alone on the island!
