Michael's journey from escaping the island to working as Ben's spy on Widmore's ship is revealed, as well as his mission. Ben tells Danielle and Alex to leave Locke's camp and go to the island temple, but they are ambushed on the way.
In the freighter, Sayid presses Michael to tell him what happened to him since he left the island. In a long flashback, Michael is in despair in Manhattan, since Walt refuses to talk to him after discovering the truth about the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby. When Michael decides to commit suicide in an alley, he is saved by Tom Friendly who convinces him to work for his people by infiltrating the Kahana freighter to save the lives of the survivors in the island. Michael commits sabotage in the radio room and in the engine of the vessel following direct orders of Ben. After the explanations, Sayid delivers the traitor to Captain Gault. Meanwhile on the island, Ben is released by Locke and convinces Alex, Karl, and Rousseau to leave the camp and move to a hidden sanctuary. But they are ambushed by unseen killers.
