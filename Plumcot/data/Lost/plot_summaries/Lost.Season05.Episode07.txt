John Locke, now alive again and back on the island after the second plane crash, flashes back to his return to civilization, where he is brought in by Charles Widmore and asked to convince the Oceanic 6 to return to the island.
In the aftermath of Alija Flight 316 crashing on the island, John Locke inexplicably appears, back from the dead, and tries to bring the survivors together, two of whom include the shady Ilana (who was with Sayid on the flight) as well as a fellow man, named Caesar, who try to make sense of what is going on. Locke flashes back to the time months earlier when he moved the island and was transported to the deserts of North Africa, and was found by Charles Widmore who asked Locke to convince the Oceanic 6 to return to the island.
