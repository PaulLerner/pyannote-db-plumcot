Jack takes Juliet back to their camp after being abandoned by The Others. However, nobody else at the camp trusts her or wants her there, until she saves Claire's life.
Sayid, Kate, Jack, and Juliet arrives back at the camp of survivors, and the group does not accept the presence of Juliet. Jack protects Juliet, while she recalls her arrival to the island and her relationship with Ben. When Claire gets sick, Juliet advises that Claire was the subject of an experiment with pregnant women carried by her, and she brings the necessary vaccine to inoculate and heal Claire. Later, Juliet recalls how she first arrived on the island three years earlier, her first meeting with Ben and the Others, and about the last assignment Ben gave to her a couple of days ago.
Jack forces the remaining survivors to take him at his word when he defends Juliet when she is left behind as the Others move on. And she proves her worth when she reveals that she actually knows why Claire is so sick and in danger of dying. Meanwhile, Juliet recalls the day she came to the island three years earlier, and about meeting Ben who educated her about the island's powers and mysteries.
