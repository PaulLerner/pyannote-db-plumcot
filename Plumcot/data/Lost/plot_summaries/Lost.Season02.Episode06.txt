Sawyer's wound becomes life threatening as he, Michael and Jin make their way across the island with the tail section survivors.
Sawyer's wound becomes life-threatening as he, Michael and Jin make their way through the interior of the island with the tail section survivors, Ana-Lucia, Mr. Eko, Bernard, Libby, and flight attendant Cindy. Meanwhile, Shannon is once again haunted by visions of Walt, but she cannot convince a skeptic Sayid that her visions are real. More of Shannon's background story shows her difficult relationship with her late step-brother Boone and further detailing how her step-mother financially cut her off after the death of their father. Also, Charlie becomes jealous of Locke's interest in Claire, while Locke learns that Charlie took a heroin stuffed porcelain statue from the Beechwood plane wreck.
Sayid builds a tent for Shannon, and she sees Walt again speaking some unintelligible words (see IDMb Trivia). Sayid does not believe her. Shannon recalls the death of her father years earlier leading to a reunion with her estranged half-brother Boone, and how her stepmother deserted her. She uses Walt's dog, Vincent, trying to find Walt in the woods and proves that she is worthy. Meanwhile, the tail crash survivors, Ana-Lucia, Mr. Eko, Bernard, Libby, and Cindy force Michael, Sawyer and Jin to take them to their camp on the other side of the island. During the long hike through the jungle, Sawyer passes out due to his gunshot wound, delaying the expedition. Cindy vanishes, the rest of the group feel that "The Others" are close. The tense situation leads to a tragedy.
