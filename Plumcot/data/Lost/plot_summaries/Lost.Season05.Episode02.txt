Jack teams up with Ben to try to find the other Oceanic 6 to get them to return to the island with Locke's body. Hurley has an encounter with Ana-Luicia's ghost, and later seeks refuge at the home of his estranged father to help the unconscious Sayid.

Back on the island, Sawyer, Juliet, Miles, Charlotte and the plane crash survivors are continuing to skip through time as they come under attack from unseen attackers wielding flaming arrows.
