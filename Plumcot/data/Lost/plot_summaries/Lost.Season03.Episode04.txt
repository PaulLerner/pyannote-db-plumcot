The Others perform a sadistic medical procedure on Sawyer in order to prevent him from causing any more mischief.
Sawyer discovers just how far his captors will go to thwart any plans of escape he and Kate might have when they forcibly and surgically implant a pacemaker in his heart which will detonate if he tries to escape again. Jack is called upon to scrub up in order to save the life of one of "The Others,", a team leader, named Colleen, who was shot by Sun during the theft of the sailboat. Meanwhile, Desmond's behavior begins to perplex Charlie, Hurley, and the rest of the survivors when he starts construction on an unknown device outside Claire's tent.
"The Others" bring Sawyer to a room, inject a needle in his sternum and when he wakes up, Ben Limus tells him that a pacemaker has been implanted in his heart and any physical effort for him will be lethal, since his heart will blow-up. Sawyer recalls his period in prison, when he betrayed another prisoner to commute six years of sentence and be released earlier. Colleen, the women shot by Sun, is submitted to a surgery, has complications and Juliet calls Jack on to help her, but it is too late. Paulo is playing golf on the beach, and Desmond asks for a club to build a weird apparatus. Ben brings the controlled Sawyer with him to the top of a hill to show where they are.
