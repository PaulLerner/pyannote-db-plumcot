Having retrieved the plane tranceiver, a group of survivors try to transmit a signal, only to receive a strange transmission from another inhabitant.
Jack, Kate and Charlie return to the group, but the transceiver is broken. Sayid Jarrah fixes the apparatus and organizes an expedition with Kate, Charlie, Shannon Rutherford and her brother Boone Carlyle and the dangerous James "Sawyer" Ford to hike and climb a mountain to transmit a SOS. The group receives a sixteen years old distress call from a French woman in the island instead and kills a polar bear. They return to the survivor's base and decide to hide the information to preserve the hope of the group.
Jack, Kate and Charlie return from the cockpit. Sauid Jarrah tries to get the transceiver working. Him, Kate, Charlie, Sawyer, Boone, and Shannon hike to the top of a mountain to get it to work. Meanwhile, Jack and Hurley struggle to save the Marshall's life.
