Eloise explains that the Oceanic 6 have a very limited window to return to the island, and leaves Jack instructions to bring one of his father's items to John Locke.
Ben takes Jack, Sun, and Desmond to meet with Faraday's mother, scientist Eloise Hawking, (whom Desmond remembers years earlier leading him on the path to the island). Eloise tells them when and where the island will appear in time and the "window" to reach it, as well as the circumstances that brought them there in the first place. Jack decides to return with the corpse of Locke despite his doubts as to what may lie head for them, while Kate, Sayid, and Hurley need more convincing. Jack also visits his grandfather, residing in a nursing home, which leads him to do a little soul searching to seek his path.
Jack awakes on the island and rescues Hurley and Kate from a lake. Two days ago, Ben, Jack, Sun and Desmond meet Ms. Hawking, who is Daniel's mother, and she shows a device to them to locate the island that moves through time. She also tells that, if they want to return to the island, there would be a window that could bring them back. But they need to be together to reproduce the original situation. Jack decides to come back to the island bringing Locke's coffin. In the plane, the pilot is Frank Lapidus and Kate, Sun, Hurley, Sayid and Ben also embark in flight 316. When Jack asks Ben what will happen to the passengers, he replies who cares.
