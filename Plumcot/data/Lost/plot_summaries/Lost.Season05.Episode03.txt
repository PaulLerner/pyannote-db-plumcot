Desmond returns to Oxford to fulfill Faraday's request to find his mother. Back on the island, the survivors discover that they've run into The Others 50 years in the past, but Richard Alpert is the same age.
Following a past memory about Faraday, Desmond travels to Oxford University in England where he tries to find Faraday's mother, to find a way to return to the island in which the search leads him back to Charles Whidmore. Back on the island, Miles, Faraday, Locke, Juliet, Sawyer and Charlotte continue to skip through time and they have an encounter with a group of "Others" in the 1950s where they meet the then-leader Richard Alpert, whom is still the same age, and whom have in their possession a stolen nuclear bomb.
Desmond has a recollection and convinces Penny to sail to Oxford to meet Daniel's mother and he is forced to meet Charles Widmore, who is the sponsor of Daniel's research. On the island, Locke and the group of survivors meets The Others in 1954 and Daniel tries to disarm a hydrogen bomb. Locke meets Charles Widmore and tries to convince Richard to tell him how to leave the island.
