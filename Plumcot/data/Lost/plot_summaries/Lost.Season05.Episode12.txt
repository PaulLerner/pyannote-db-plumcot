Ben and Locke return to the island, where Ben says he is going to summon the Smoke "monster" and atone for his daughter's death. In addition, the falling-out on the island between Ben and Charles Widmore is revealed.
Locke travels with Ben to the ruins of the Dharma barracks where they reunite with Sun and Frank Lapidus in which Ben hopes to face the consequences of his past actions in a fateful meeting with the "black smoke monster" that resides beneath an old temple. Frequent flashbacks show Ben's indoctrination with the "Others", his ouster of Charles Witmore as well as how he came to have gotten beaten up on his way back to the island after having a run-in with Desmond and Penny at the Marina del Ray when they thought he was coming to kill them. Elsewhere, the Flight 316 survivors, Ilana and Caesar, are revealed to have a sinister agenda for the survivors of the crash.
Ben manipulates Caesar and kills him to protect Locke. Then they row to the island and arrive at Dharma village, where Ben will summon the smoke monster to judge him for the death of Alex. He recalls his relationship with Charles Widmore and the hostiles, and how he manipulated the group to banish the former leader from the island. Further, he also recalls what he did to Desmond.
