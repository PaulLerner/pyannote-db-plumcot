Mr. Eko enlists Locke to help find a secret location he believes houses answers to the island's mysteries. Meanwhile, Jack, Sawyer, and Kate struggle to cope with the horrific situation in the hatch following the escape of "Other" Henry Gale, and of the shooting deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby, unaware that it was Michael who is responsible.

While sleeping, Mr. Eko is assigned by his brother Yemi (Adetokumboh McCormack) in a dream to go with John Locke to disclose the meaning of the "?" symbol, which Locke previously saw painted on a blast door in the bunker. With the pretext of chasing the escaped Henry, Mr. Eko brings Locke with him and they find a second hatch near the Beechwood crash site, called Station 5, co-named "Pearl" part of the Dharma Initiative in a vast underground bunker with the question mark symbol marked on the field, where a video explains that the other hatch is a psychological experiment and people behavior pressing the buttons of the computer every 108 minutes are actually subjects. More of Mr. Eko's background story shows him as a priest at a mission in Australia where he is sent to investigate a possible resurrection miracle, where the little girl gives him a message from his late brother during her near-death state. Meanwhile, Jack unsuccessfully tries to save Libby after she is fatally shot during the escape of Henry, all of them unaware that the murderous, but guilt-ridden Michael was the one responsible.
