Survivors fear that "The Others" may have returned when Sun is injured during a failed kidnapping attempt. Meanwhile, Sawyer is an amused, but highly interested, bystander when tension escalates between Jack, Locke, Kate and Ana Lucia over control of the hatch computer, and the storage of the weapons.
Locke shares with Jack the combination of the locker of the weapons. While Jack and Ana Lucia are trying to gather people to form a defense army, the survivors believe that they are safe and have no interest to join them. When Sun is attacked apparently by The Others, Jack decides to get the guns for protection of the group. However, Locke is informed by Sawyer of Jack's intention, and moves the armament to a hidden place with serious and surprising consequences when Sawyer finds out and plots something of his own. Meanwhile, Sawyer recalls his former "long con" against a former girlfriend Cassidy.
When Sun is nearly kidnapped and seriously injured, the rest of the castaways assume the Others have broken their agreement to keep away. However, Kate begins to suspect that one of their own may have had to something to do with it in a bid to scare them in to taking up arms against The Others. Meanwhile, in the Sawyer-centric flashback set some years earlier, the charming and sociopath Sawyer's latest con is foiled by his victim, a troubled divorc√©e named Cassidy. But she's more interested in learning his ways than turning him in to the authorities.
Jack and Ana Lucia are trying to use the guns to build an army, although Locke disapproves this. So he turns to Sawyer for help, and Locke decides to hide the guns. Meanwhile, Sun gets dragged through the jungle, and everyone believes it was the Others, although Sawyer has another theory.
