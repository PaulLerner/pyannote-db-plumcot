Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) receives an unwelcome visit from someone from her past and is given orders to track down Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) and Faraday (Jeremy Davies) in order to stop them from completing their mission -- by any means necessary. Meanwhile, Ben (Michael Emerson) offers Locke (Terry O'Quinn) an enticing deal. In flashbacks, we see Juliet's history on the Island after the plane crash and before she met the survivors.
