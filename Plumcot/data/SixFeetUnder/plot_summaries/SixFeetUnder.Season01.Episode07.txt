As for Nate's plans, just as they're accepted grudgingly by Rico and David, a turn of events might throw them.
Much to Dave's annoyance, Nate plans to take the weekend off and go away with Brenda. Things don't go quite as planned when Brenda's brother Billy, apparently off his meds, has a crisis. Rico also is not happy with his situation and with a new baby on the way decides to listen to a offer from Gillardy at Kroehner Services. Ruth meanwhile decides to invite her boyfriend Hiram over for dinner and introduce him to the family. She also decides to do something about her life and gets a job at Nikolai's flower shop.
