
not_available Claire, you're drooping.
not_available Higher.
not_available Really? I wanna make them feel like the crow's gonna peck their eyes out.
not_available Good.
not_available $75? That's so low.
not_available I've never sold a piece in my life.
not_available I want someone to buy it.
not_available But it's not just a print.
not_available You got a good spot.
not_available Do you think? Have you seen mine? 
not_available Where? Exactly.
not_available Follow me into the annex.
not_available Cool pyramid.
not_available This is weird.
not_available Does Olivier know they put you here? He said there are only four first years in the show and some people would be grateful.
not_available Nice.
not_available 500? 
not_available Is that disgusting? The copper spray was so expensive, I had to take a loan out to pay for the fucking thing.
not_available It sucks.
not_available I'll buy dinner.
not_available Hey, you people.
not_available I'm needing workers here.
not_available Can you untangle this mobile? It's by some big alumni idiot and I got it all fucked up.
not_available Olivier, do you think I should have priced my photograph higher? The price tag and the placement.
not_available It's disgusting.
not_available give your work away.
not_available Nobody in this country is born with a soul.
not_available It has to be beaten into you.
not_available There's another part that I ruined.
not_available Lord knows where it goes.
not_available Have you seen this? I don't like that guy.
not_available He's too veiny.
not_available Sarge was veiny.
not_available Let's get the new Matt Summers.
not_available I don't know why we wouldn't tell Frank.
not_available There's nothing to say.
not_available It was just a fun thing we did.
not_available A fun thing we never did before.
not_available So was the gospel brunch.
not_available We didn't talk about that.
not_available Do you wanna talk about that? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you wanna talk about Sarge? Not really.
not_available I just thought it seemed like a therapy topic.
not_available I'd rather talk about the dishes thing.
not_available You're still angry about that.
not_available David.
not_available Father Jack.
not_available Please call me Jack.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Great.
not_available You? 
not_available Just fine.
not_available This is due on Wednesday.
not_available What'd you rent? 
not_available Something Keith picked.
not_available Sister Act.
not_available OK.
not_available Jack, have you met my boyfriend Keith? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available This is Father Jack from St Bartholomew.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available You still have Back To The 
Crack Butt Munch 2.
not_available It was due last Friday.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sorry, I can't.
not_available I cannot have this conversation one more time.
not_available I can't give you what you want.
not_available Love? I give you love, Lisa.
not_available I fucking give you love every day.
not_available There's just always some fucking thing.
not_available Introducing Maya to some friend before I introduced you.
not_available Who cares? It happens all the time.
not_available It's like I'm an afterthought.
not_available People notice.
not_available I can't do any better than this.
not_available Some women might be happy with a faithful, committed, devoted father and husband.
not_available Father and husband.
not_available I just don't have anything else for you.
not_available What am I supposed to do with that? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I don't know.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available What isn't right? This.
not_available Us.
not_available But I thought you loved me.
not_available I do.
not_available But not enough.
not_available It's enough for me.
not_available It's not, though.
not_available It's not enough for you.
not_available I'm totally fucking fine with what we have.
not_available You're not happy but you have to make it about me.
not_available That's what I can't live with any more.
not_available So what are you saying? You wanna leave? 
not_available Leave? I would have to leave because I moved my whole life to this shithole city! Not for me, you didn't! So you wanna split up? Maybe, yeah.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Just a moment.
not_available Why, hello.
not_available I hope I'm not interrupting.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Please come in.
not_available That last song was so beautiful.
not_available Did you write it yourself? 
not_available I did.
not_available It was just wonderful.
not_available I'm so pleased that you liked it.
not_available I thought I would call it Semiprecious.
not_available For your Aunt Pearl? 
not_available In part, yes.
not_available I don't know how you can get such a beautiful sound from a computer.
not_available It's unexpected.
not_available As a child, I played the violin, but when I went to college, I I had a very cruel roommate who threw the violin from our dormitory window.
not_available It was hand
not_available carved by my Uncle Gunther before he died of polio.
not_available I gave up playing the violin altogether and left college to go to mortuary school.
not_available It was there in the computer room that I discovered another way to make music.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available I wonder if you're available tomorrow night to come with me to this art opening.
not_available It's a benefit show for Claire's school.
not_available Apparently, some of these alumni are quite well
not_available known artists.
not_available I'm afraid I don't know any of their names.
not_available Claire's very excited.
not_available She's one of the few students whose work has been selected.
not_available I think it's important for her that we all be there.
not_available I would be honoured to go.
not_available If you feel it would be appropriate.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available You're a member of our little family here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That means so much to me.
not_available The secret is the new threein
not_available one invention called the fanny lifter.
not_available Part one is a six
not_available inch segment used in the cardio sculpting.
not_available Part two, an eightinch section What are you doing? What's going on with dinner? 
not_available Couldn't decide.
not_available Why not? Who cares? Meatloaf is fine.
not_available Then I have to go out for meat.
not_available So we'll make some rice and beans.
not_available Kids had rice already for lunch.
not_available That's OK.
not_available It's one day.
not_available I couldn't remember what we had last night.
not_available We had burgers last night.
not_available That's where the meat went.
not_available Are you taking the medication? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's only been two weeks.
not_available He said it takes up to a month sometimes.
not_available For anything to happen at all? I gained five pounds already, so something's happening.
not_available Her mom's pretty much crazy.
not_available She couldn't deal with arranging the funeral.
not_available I don't think Melinda even told her we broke up.
not_available Did Melinda leave any instructions for what she wanted in terms of a service? No.
not_available She did leave me a note.
not_available But it wasn't about her funeral.
not_available I tried to end the relationship before, but she always said she was going I never thought she was really going to do it.
not_available But maybe, in some way, I did, because I stayed for years after I wanted to leave.
not_available I finally moved out about two weeks ago.
not_available And I thought she was OK.
not_available She seemed really calm about it.
not_available And then it's like I keep waiting to find out it's all this mistake.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available This note.
not_available It's so horrible.
not_available You had to live your own life.
not_available Was she depressed? 
not_available For years, yeah.
not_available What was she like? 
not_available Rico.
not_available It was like those tribes or whatever, they think if you take their picture, they'll lose their spirit.
not_available It was like her spirit got stolen, and all that was left was this body that she didn't even want any more.
not_available Was she on medication at all? 
not_available Everything, all of them.
not_available Mostly it just made things worse.
not_available Then she was on something that was really working.
not_available I thought.
not_available What was it? Paxil? 
not_available Paxil made her really jittery.
not_available This was a combination of Zoloft and something else.
not_available She did seem better.
not_available I'd have never left if I didn't think she'd be all right.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Mommy's OK.
not_available I hear that when I rewash the dishes after you've washed them, it makes you feel like I don't think you're good enough.
not_available Did David hear you correctly? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So I'm sorry and I'll try not to do it any more.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Has anything else come up since our last session? 
not_available Not really.
not_available David? We did have three
not_available way sex with a stranger.
not_available I just wanna make sure Frank thinks that's a healthy couple activity.
not_available How did it feel to you? Fine.
not_available It was a lot more enjoyable than the paintball.
not_available What do you think, though? 
not_available Were you safe? Of course.
not_available There are certainly a variety of ways that couples can enjoy their sexuality.
not_available Then it's totally OK to just have sex with whoever? Generally, it's best when there's an open negotiation between partners as to what the rules are in these situations, so that both people are comfortable.
not_available Were you both comfortable with what happened? 
not_available Yes.
not_available We didn't exactly negotiate the rules.
not_available It just sort of happened.
not_available Is it something you might wanna do again? It was very liberating to be spontaneous and kind of wild together instead of always being so careful about everything.
not_available It was fun to be wild.
not_available If this is something that you think you might like to do again, then I suggest you take some time to lay down some ground rules.
not_available OK.
not_available Do you need to borrow some blush? Those peach tones you're wearing just don't pop.
not_available That's OK.
not_available I don't need to pop tonight.
not_available Want some of these for your bag? I quit, remember? 
not_available I didn't know you were still in that mode.
not_available That's the goal, to stay in the mode.
not_available I'm just curious.
not_available What makes you think that was such a problem for you? Being stoned all day and night? 
not_available It was never like that.
not_available How would you know? 
not_available I work with addicts.
not_available You're not an addict.
not_available You went through a difficult break
not_available up and needed to act out, but that was just stress.
not_available I'm not interested in discussing this with you.
not_available You seemed very defensive when I offered you a joint.
not_available I would appreciate it if you respected my choices.
not_available If I thought that they were your choices and not some 12
not_available step Christian dogma, I'd feel much better about it.
not_available Whenever in my whole life have I ever wanted to take on someone else's dogma? 
not_available That is not a big problem of mine.
not_available But you do tend to overdramatise yourself.
not_available I'm sorry, but I've known you for a long time.
not_available Thanks for your support, Mom.
not_available But I am sorry if you feel I've been insensitive.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You guys ready? The car's double
not_available parked.
not_available I just have to do one final coat.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available OK.
not_available I'm sick of being so fucking conscious all the time.
not_available It's like I'm this incredibly boring, watered
not_available down version of myself.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available What piece have you got in this thing tonight? 
not_available It's a new one.
not_available Might suck.
not_available That's all right, sweetie.
not_available It's for charity.
not_available I'm sure it doesn't suck.
not_available That blouse might actually work if you got rid of the bra.
not_available That skirt might actually work if you got rid of that ass.
not_available It's 7:15.
not_available Where's the babysitter? 
not_available I'm sure she just hit traffic.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available You don't have to come if you don't want to.
not_available I'm not going for you.
not_available I'm going for Claire.
not_available I have a relationship with her.
not_available I know.
not_available I thought maybe we should talk some more.
not_available Obviously.
not_available That's Kayla.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available I'll just be cold.
not_available Come here, baby.
not_available I'm pretty sure that's Jan Vanhoosen.
not_available Look, he's going straight to his own piece.
not_available Narcissist.
not_available Who'd ever buy that? 
not_available MoMA.
not_available Let's go see if anyone's looking at my piece.
not_available Narcissist.
not_available I just feel bad for it back here all by itself, no one coming to see it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Someone bought it already? Do you think it's a mistake? Russell, it's a really beautiful piece.
not_available Maybe that's why I got such a good spot.
not_available Do you think somebody actually thought I was somebody? You are somebody.
not_available It's pretty good, don't you think, for a 19year
not_available old? Yeah, I guess.
not_available Looks like art.
not_available It's dark.
not_available Really? I think it's kind of funny.
not_available Funny? It's so, "What's the point?" Come on.
not_available It's like, "Life goes on.
not_available " I so totally don't get that, and I know Claire a lot better than you do.
not_available She has no sense of humour? 
not_available She has a very dark vision.
not_available I think you just have this one really old idea about who she is.
not_available Maybe, but it happens to be accurate.
not_available It's magnificent.
not_available It's great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's so incredible.
not_available Awesome.
not_available God, you guys didn't all have to come.
not_available Why not? It's a big deal.
not_available It's so not.
not_available Is that Vigo Mortensen? How did you get the plasteredout look? Who? 
not_available It's infrared film.
not_available No, it says duratrans.
not_available It's like this process they use for ads in airports.
not_available It's really boring.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I love that movie.
not_available I wept.
not_available I remember.
not_available Fiona Kleinschmidt.
not_available She's got some pots in the next room.
not_available Nate was deflowered by a mildly famous ceramicist.
not_available I don't think she's coming, though.
not_available I heard she was in Japan.
not_available Where'd you guys get the drinks? I pumped so I could drink tonight, because I wanna drink tonight.
not_available The bar's over there.
not_available Need anything? So what happened to you? You were showing everywhere and then nothing.
not_available Did you get married or something? 
not_available I went crazy.
not_available What a drag.
not_available Where'd they put you? 
not_available Clarendon.
not_available That place isn't too bad.
not_available I had another student who used to go there.
not_available Micky Herschel.
not_available I think they had some of his feeling art hanging in the cafeteria.
not_available How was it? 
not_available Not bad.
not_available He had a breakthrough with me.
not_available Who doesn't? 
not_available The repressed people.
not_available Right.
not_available Them.
not_available Billy.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Great.
not_available How are you? I'm good.
not_available You guys know each other? 
not_available Olivier visited for a term while I was here.
not_available He was my best student.
not_available After I cracked him open.
not_available Before it was all too pretentious, right? 
not_available The first class I ever taught.
not_available You said you taught in Argentina.
not_available I lied.
not_available There's Jani.
not_available I have to go pretend I like his piece of shit.
not_available Jani, it's so good to see you.
not_available His best student? I don't know about that.
not_available I'm pretty sure I was the only one sleeping with him.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was a pretty amazing experience for me.
not_available I had a lot of static around my sexuality.
not_available It was totally suffocating my work.
not_available It was a sex thing, not a gay thing.
not_available Wasn't that sort of a fuckedup power dynamic, though? There's always a fucked
not_available up power dynamic in sex, isn't there? Not always.
not_available How you doing? Fine.
not_available This dip tastes like vomit.
not_available Cheese is OK.
not_available Here.
not_available It's all right, thanks.
not_available I don't want that, thanks.
not_available You eat it.
not_available I just had some.
not_available So throw it out.
not_available You don't want that.
not_available I don't? 
not_available I'm told it tastes like vomit.
not_available Brenda, this is my wife Lisa.
not_available Lisa, Brenda.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You too.
not_available So what can I eat here? Disturbing work always takes longer to sell.
not_available Most people want something that's pretty.
not_available Like the cleaning supply installation? 
not_available He was on the cover of Art Forum.
not_available Olivier's right.
not_available You can't give a fuck about what sells.
not_available It's easy for you to say.
not_available Yeah, but that was just a fluke.
not_available My mom probably called from Florida to put a hold on it.
not_available That's sweet.
not_available If my mother buys mine, I'll kill myself.
not_available Any asshole can take a camera to a cemetery.
not_available It's better than my lame self
not_available portraits from my first year.
not_available That's true.
not_available Baby, it's so nice in here.
not_available Angie and her boyfriend took the boys to Shaky's and then to play Goofy Golf.
not_available Baby, I can't drink on these pills.
not_available I forgot.
not_available Even if they're not working yet? 
not_available You're not supposed to.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You know, if this medication isn't working, you can try a different one.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available I'm just saying, sometimes it takes a while for you to find the right one.
not_available Baby, I know.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available Billy's? It's really different for him, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I like it.
not_available I think.
not_available It's very cool.
not_available And sort of painless.
not_available You haven't seen it before? No.
not_available He doesn't use me that way any more.
not_available That sounds like an improvement.
not_available It's my new thing.
not_available I won't take care of anyone else so I'll be forced to take care of myself.
not_available Theoretically.
not_available How's that going for you? 
not_available I'm still living with my mother.
not_available Who isn't? 
not_available God, that's right.
not_available You too.
not_available Temporarily.
not_available We've really evolved.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Come on in.
not_available We're smoking some of my husband's cancer pot.
not_available It's incredible, and I got a ton of it.
not_available Went a lot faster than anybody expected.
not_available Jani was just talking about that pyramid.
not_available You been in it yet? 
not_available Too much of a line.
not_available It's fantastic.
not_available Sensual.
not_available It's plastic.
not_available I thought I heard your voice.
not_available I looked for you.
not_available Are you ready to go out and get that drink? In a minute.
not_available You're smoking pot.
not_available You want some? 
not_available It's California pharmaceutical grade.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Oh, God, Bern.
not_available It's lovely, Claire.
not_available Lovely? The way it looks.
not_available Did you make the frame as well? 
not_available No, I bought the frame.
not_available It was the perfect choice.
not_available Well done.
not_available This must be your mother.
not_available Mom, this is Olivier CastroStaal, my formand
not_available space teacher.
not_available It's so nice to meet you.
not_available And you.
not_available This is my friend Arthur Martin.
not_available It is a pleasure and an honour.
not_available I know you've had quite an effect on Claire.
not_available Not as much as you have.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What do you think of her piece? I think it's very sweet, really.
not_available It's supposed to be disturbing.
not_available It is.
not_available Great art often provokes controversy.
not_available And, if I may, I also feel the image is quite tender.
not_available It suggests the quiet dignity of eternal love.
not_available Would anyone care for a refreshment or an hors d'oeuvre? No, thanks.
not_available I'll come with you.
not_available You think they're fucking? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry if that was weird before.
not_available It was a little confusing.
not_available I didn't tell Nate we'd met.
not_available But you did know who I was at the spa.
not_available No.
not_available I just figured it out.
not_available Just now? Then why were you pretending we'd never met? I don't know, I just didn't wanna get into it with him.
not_available I think you did know who I was when you came in.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just wanted to know what you were like.
not_available That's weird and dishonest and kind of stalkerish.
not_available Getting a massage isn't the best way of finding out what happened between Nate and me.
not_available He hasn't been very clear about it.
not_available Why does it matter? I don't know.
not_available I'm such a wreck right now.
not_available He's pretty good at making people feel crazy.
not_available Not that I wasn't.
not_available I am too, I think.
not_available I feel like I've totally lost my mind.
not_available What was I doing sneaking around like that? It's so desperate.
not_available It's not desperate.
not_available It's just trying to get something you don't have.
not_available You mean Nate? 
not_available You have Nate.
not_available I think you'll have him for ever if you want him.
not_available He doesn't love me the way he loved you.
not_available He didn't love me.
not_available Not really.
not_available He was just trying to get something he didn't have.
not_available He's such a fucking idiot.
not_available He's living life.
not_available It doesn't feel like plastic.
not_available It feels like those shells, abalone.
not_available I know.
not_available Kind of makes you wanna build a pyramid to live in.
not_available I understand why you wanna leave.
not_available I don't wanna leave.
not_available I'm not happy either.
not_available I wanna blame you, but it's not your fault.
not_available I've known you for so long, I don't know why I thought getting married would transform you.
not_available It has transformed me.
not_available I know.
not_available I didn't mean it to sound like that.
not_available I know how committed you are.
not_available I just mean it didn't change the way you feel about me.
not_available God, it did, though.
not_available Not the way I wanted it to.
not_available It's not fair to you and I guess it's not fair to me either, really.
not_available It's good we tried.
not_available I think we had to try.
not_available Don't you think we could maybe now just start from a different place? Neither one of us is ever gonna be what the other person wants.
not_available This is bullshit, this idea of what we want.
not_available Maybe it's enough now to just stop pretending.
not_available And be like friends, you mean? 
not_available Yeah, but not just that.
not_available And you wanna be lovers still? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Without all the pressure to be something we're not.
not_available But what if it's never any good? Then we'll know we really tried.
not_available Really tried.
not_available I feel really relieved.
not_available You do? I do too.
not_available You see? These fucking pyramids really do work.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Come in.
not_available It's really nice in here.
not_available It's supposed to have the same proportions as the pyramids in Egypt.
not_available I thought it was supposed to be this horrible plastic version of a sacred space.
not_available That's kind of a reverse message.
not_available Like modern life isn't always so bad? I don't know, like even though we feel like we've lost touch with this more authentic history, there's a continuity that we don't even realise.
not_available That's really comforting.
not_available I wish we never had to leave.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you know who bought it? Fifi Rochedale.
not_available Is that you? 
not_available No.
not_available It isn't.
not_available Your old cat's name was Fifi and I don't know where you got Rochedale.
not_available It's the street.
not_available It's your porn name.
not_available Nice.
not_available God, you're fast.
not_available It doesn't make it OK that no one wanted it.
not_available I wanted it.
not_available I love it.
not_available You're in debt.
not_available It's a good investment.
not_available The thing's gonna be worth so much more in five years.
not_available Weird.
not_available Checked all the stalls? Yeah, and upstairs.
not_available What shall we do? Fuck it.
not_available She's got a cellphone.
not_available She can call a cab.
not_available Might I remove my glasses? 
not_available Please do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How weird was it that Brenda was there tonight? I don't know.
not_available How weird was it? She dropped off the face of the planet as far as I knew.
not_available What do you think about him? 
not_available He's pretty sexy.
not_available So? So what? Do you wanna go for it? Really? 
not_available Unless you like someone better.
not_available I just thought we were supposed to be negotiating if we did it again.
not_available We are negotiating.
not_available You can pick somebody else.
not_available Frank made it sound like there are rules or something.
not_available Like what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe certain things we only do with each other.
not_available Like what? I don't know, like kissing, maybe? 
not_available That sounds OK.
not_available Would that be rude to the other person? I'm sure he won't care.
not_available OK, let's start with that.
not_available That's Patrick.
not_available What about him? For us? No way.
not_available Why not? He's so nice.
not_available We're not doing it with somebody we know.
not_available It's just creepy.
not_available I'm gonna talk to the tall guy.
not_available I thought you were at your sister's art thing.
not_available We just came from there.
not_available How is this place? I don't know.
not_available It seems pretty much like a freefor
not_available all.
not_available I think I'm not so much a gay
not_available bar person.
not_available Is that really sad for me? I think that's really happy for you.
not_available Mom? Darling, you're home.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It was too late to stop.
not_available Honey, I bought a painting.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Thank you for a lovely evening.
not_available I should be getting back now.
not_available You can stay if you'd like.
not_available No, I couldn't.
not_available I really should be getting back.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you so very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Let us know if there's anything else we can do.
not_available That's hard to live with.
not_available Someone kills herself over you.
not_available She was depressed.
not_available But he said she was doing fine.
not_available She was on the right medication.
not_available She did it because he left her.
not_available It's depressing how deluded people are about what love is.
not_available Wait.
not_available What do you mean? Like it's gonna make their lives better.
not_available It does a little, right? It's just not like someone else can change who you are.
not_available Like this woman Melinda.
not_available That guy was the only good thing in her life? He didn't seem that great to me.
not_available I wouldn't wanna be him right now.
not_available Me neither.
not_available It takes all my heart to keep from giving that asshole in five a triple dose of this stool softener.
not_available It would hurt us more than it would hurt him.
not_available How are you doing on the Paxil? 
not_available Not great.
not_available All I can feel are the side effects.
not_available So when are you gonna go see Rogers? I should try and stop in this week, but I always feel like he has no idea who I am.
not_available I go in there for five minutes and he goes down some list.
not_available They don't give a fuck.
not_available They just give you whatever samples came with the best gifts.
not_available When I was depressed, the only thing that worked was Celexa with Ativan.
not_available I should probably ask Rogers.
not_available Just try it and see if it works for you.
not_available You can tell Rogers that you saw another doctor while you were on vacation.
not_available Here.
not_available Gave you generic.
not_available Still the machine.
not_available I already left a message saying I was coming over, so if she wants me to walk in on more fucking, that's her choice.
not_available I can do it for you if you feel like you've seen enough of Mom's pussy for a few days.
not_available Who could ever see too much of Mom's pussy? It's like a trip down memory lane.
not_available Really, though.
not_available I know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I don't even know where everything is.
not_available I can come with you.
not_available That would help.
not_available Good.
not_available I appreciate you letting me stay here.
not_available I have the space.
not_available It's just until I get my client list back together.
not_available Stay as long as you can stand my friends.
not_available Is Kenny still over here all the time? You know what? He's not that bad.
not_available He used to come into my room and fart on my pillow.
not_available He was ten.
not_available Get up.
not_available I can't believe how much money I've spent fucking up my life.
not_available Did you ever find out who bought your piece? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Was it your mom? 
not_available I wish.
not_available You wish? Who could be worse than your mom? It wasn't my mom, was it? 
not_available No.
not_available It was Olivier.
not_available That's flattering.
not_available I'm sure it's just some kind of head trip.
not_available Why? To teach me some kind of weird lesson or something.
not_available What kind of lesson? 
not_available Like he owns me.
not_available His whole power thing.
not_available Maybe he just really liked your piece.
not_available Kind of doubt it.
not_available Tickles.
not_available I fell asleep.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Is it late? 
not_available It's not even five.
not_available Is Maya 
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's sleeping.
not_available How long have you been here? 
not_available I just got here.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available I'm just happy to see you.
not_available You are? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm happy to see you too.
