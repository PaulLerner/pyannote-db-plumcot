not_available Episode 1.
not_available Pilot Sleek, sophisticated, seductive The new Millennium Edition Crown Royal Funeral Coach.
not_available Because your loved one deserves the very best in style and comfort I'll be home for Christmas.
not_available You can plan on me.
not_available Nathaniel Fisher.
not_available / Nathaniel? It's Ruth.
not_available Did you take your blood pressure medication today? / Yes.
not_available Don't lie to me.
not_available I took it.
not_available What do you want me to do? O.D.
not_available on it? Oh, I just realized.
not_available We don't have any of that soy stuff natraxe, you know, since you gave up milk.
not_available I don't know what it's called.
not_available Why not just cut some milk with tap water? I'll never know the difference.
not_available Look, if you don't want to go, I'll go.
not_available It's not as if I don't have enough to do already.
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available I'll get some, but it has to be after I pick up Nate at the airport.
not_available I'm already running late.
not_available Nathaniel, are you smoking? / Nope.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available I heard you.
not_available I'm not.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available / Look.
not_available Forget you'll give yourself cancer and die a slow and horrible death.
not_available You should not be stinking up that new hearse.
not_available I told you not to let him take it.
not_available Like I could have stopped him.
not_available He's every bit as proud of that thing as your fool brother was of that damn motorcycle he had in high school.
not_available And who still has a pin in his foot? Nathaniel, people want things to be nice when there's a funeral.
not_available They don't want their loved ones riding around in something that smells like an ashtray.
not_available Alright, alright.
not_available Look, I'm quitting right now, I promise.
not_available Okay? I'll see you tonight.
not_available That new hearse was a total waste of money.
not_available There was nothing wrong with the old one.
not_available I think your father is having some sort of midlife crisis.
not_available It would have made so much more sense to invest in re
not_available paneling for the chapel or adding coffee bars to the slumber rooms.
not_available Well, I'd much rather he buy himself a fancy new hearse than leave me for a younger woman, or a woman my age for that matter, or, heaven forbid, a man, like my cousin Hannah's husband did.
not_available God sure has dealt that woman some blows in this life.
not_available Mom, can I do anything to help? No, no, honey.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Besides, don't you have a viewing tonight? You should probably be getting ready.
not_available Right.
not_available So I enjoyed talking to you about that whole shiatsu thing.
not_available I hope that pans out for you.
not_available You should let me work on you sometime.
not_available Well, here's my cell number.
not_available I'll be here until the 29th.
not_available Here ya go.
not_available Huh, my dad is supposed to meet me here.
not_available I could give you a ride.
not_available That's alright.
not_available I'm sure he'll be here soon enough.
not_available I wasn't talking about that kind of ride.
not_available You've done a nice job.
not_available She looks so peaceful.
not_available Well, she is at peace now.
not_available If there's any justice in the universe, she's shoveling shit in hell.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available / David Claire.
not_available Is Nate there yet? / Nope.
not_available I thought he was coming in tonight so we could do that whole forced Christmas eve family thing.
not_available Well
not_available / Because there are some really excellent parties I could be going to.
not_available Claire, this is one of the few times a year we're all together.
not_available Alright, alright.
not_available Don't get all Pat Robertson on me.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available I just I have to drop some stuff off at a friend's house before I head over.
not_available Okay? Bye.
not_available Fuckin' boy scout.
not_available This is kind of disgusting.
not_available Disgusting good or disgusting bad? Disgusting very good.
not_available You're so fucking hot.
not_available You're so sweet Shut up and fuck me.
not_available Hello? This is Ruth Fisher.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm his wife.
not_available What is this about? What?!? Excuse me.
not_available Mom, what the hell are you There's been an accident.
not_available The new hearse is totaled.
not_available Your father is dead.
not_available Your father is dead, and my pot roast is ruined.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available You carry a lot of tension around in your lower back.
not_available Not as much as twenty minutes ago.
not_available Just so you know, I never do this.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Me neither.
not_available So are you ever gonna tell me your name? Probably not.
not_available Why not? Because I'm a realist.
not_available That's my father looking for me.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available Oh, Dave.
not_available Hey.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Of course I'm OK Couldn't be better, in fact What? I'm so sorry, Nate.
not_available I hate to have to be the one to tell you.
not_available This is just speed, right? Promise me this isn't crack.
not_available Because I gotta spend tonight having Christmas Eve dinner with my demented family and it's gonna be weird enough without me being high on crack.
not_available No.
not_available It's just crystal meth.
not_available It just makes everything burn a little bit brighter.
not_available And it makes sex like totally primal.
not_available Here.
not_available It's alright.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available It's too late now.
not_available It's mine.
not_available Hello? David, hi.
not_available Hang on a second.
not_available So is Nate there yet? No, he's still at the airport.
not_available Claire, I've got bad news.
not_available What? Um Yeah, sure.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available I have to go.
not_available No fuckin' way.
not_available / Excuse me.
not_available Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
not_available You're coming back, right? Uh, I don't think so.
not_available My dad just got hit by a bus, and it broke his neck, and he's dead.
not_available I gotta go pick up my mom and take her to the morgue so she can identify his body.
not_available No, I'm not kidding.
not_available This is actually happening.
not_available And now I'm high on crack! Crystal.
not_available / Whatever! So I guess this whole hellish experience I'm about to go through is just gonna burn a little brighter now, right? Great! Thank you! Fuck! You really didn't have to do this.
not_available I could have just rented a car.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You're in no shape to drive, and frankly, I'm in no hurry to get home to my family's annual Christmas Eve massacre.
not_available Parents who stayed together for the children, but really because they got off on tormenting each other so much.
not_available Manic depressive brother who always chooses the holidays to go off his medication.
not_available Oh, and an ancient Springer Spaniel who's completely blind, deaf, and incontinent.
not_available What about you? Uh, actually, we're pretty normal.
not_available My mom's a control freak.
not_available My brother, well, he's a control freak, too.
not_available And my sister, well, I left home right before she was born, so I never really knew her that well, but she's kind of wild like I was.
not_available Was? My dad really rode my ass when I was a kid.
not_available He'd just buried this girl who drowned, and buried this dipshit loser who O.D.ed at a Flock of Seagulls concert, and suddenly I'm not allowed to go to concerts for a year.
not_available Your dad worked in a cemetery? 
not_available How could a man who's so fucking scared of everything, who never had an accident, or even a speeding ticket in his entire fucking life how could he have a car wreck? Are you mad at him or the fact that we're all gonna die? Are you a shrink? No, God! No! No! Both my parents are.
not_available So what else do you wanna talk about? The weather? Or the fact that we both just fucked a perfect stranger and that we both lied when we said we never did that? Wonderful service.
not_available Yes, it was very nice.
not_available Should we? / Yes, dear.
not_available She looked so peaceful.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available / Wonderful job.
not_available Did you know that before you were born, funeral homes ran the ambulance business? No.
not_available Hearses were the only vehicles that could transport people lying down.
not_available Wow.
not_available Your father used to joke about that.
not_available Just drive him around the block a few more times.
not_available We won?t need to stop at the hospital.
not_available You're kind of freaking me out right now.
not_available Claire, are you having sex? What? Doing drugs? Why are you asking me this right now? Your father is dead.
not_available I can't even remember the last time you and I talked about anything important.
not_available I need to know you're OK.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Believe me, I'm OK, considering.
not_available Do you work here? Yes.
not_available I wanted to compliment you on the music.
not_available I've been to three other funerals this year cancer, stroke, pediatric leukemia and the music is always that same, sad organ music.
not_available It reminds me of those soap operas my mom used to watch before I started kindergarten.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available You're probably too young to remember that.
not_available Anyway, I so prefer this light, classical, you know, chamber orchestra stuff.
not_available It's so spiritual, but doesn't seem so dated, 
not_available or depressing.
not_available I studied musical appreciation..
not_available You think I'm really boring, don't you? Well, get used to it! Because now that your father is dead, you can forget about ever going to law school.
not_available It's just you and dead people and freaks like me for the rest of your life! Mom, I'm so sorry.
not_available Who's she? Brenda Chenowith.
not_available / Brenda Chenowith.
not_available Oh.
not_available Brenda, this is my mom, Ruth Fisher, and my sister, Claire.
not_available Nate, can I talk to you for a second? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, just give me a minute.
not_available Mom you already do the
not_available I can't.
not_available I've seen too many dead people in my life.
not_available They're work.
not_available I won't see your father that way.
not_available I need you to do it.
not_available Oh.
not_available / Nate, I need to talk to you now, please, it's urgent.
not_available So how did you and my son meet? In cooking class.
not_available I have to tell somebody.
not_available I am tweaking.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We're all upset.
not_available / No, I'm high on crystal.
not_available I smoked some with some friends before David called me.
not_available You did what? / Don't worry.
not_available It's the first time, but I think I'm having a meltdown and I can't tell if it's Dad being dead or the crystal, but I'm really scared.
not_available You cannot do this to me right now.
not_available Don't be such a narc.
not_available We smoked pot at Thanksgiving.
not_available Look, I have to go identify our dead father's body.
not_available I'm sorry you're having a bad drug experience, but deal with it! Well? Well, well, the prodigal returns.
not_available This is what you've been running away from your whole life, buddy boy.
not_available Scared the crap out of you when you were growing up, didn't it? And you thought you'd escape.
not_available Well, guess what? Nobody escapes! Well? Yeah, it's him.
not_available OK, let's get out of here.
not_available How'd he look? Dead.
not_available Will there need to be a lot of reconstruction? David's not that skilled at the really hard stuff.
not_available Federico usually does that.
not_available He's quite gifted.
not_available You don't think we'll have to have a closed casket, do you? I would hate to send that message.
not_available What message? / That we're not equipped to handle a major restoration or that we're not proud of our work.
not_available / Mom.
not_available Can we talk about this later? We should really get Nate home.
not_available He's probably exhausted.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Um.
not_available Thanks for driving me here.
not_available Please.
not_available Just avoiding my own hell.
not_available I'm a big coward.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I don't know if I can handle this.
not_available Well, you're about to find out.
not_available I wish you the best, Nate.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Claire, you're driving too fast.
not_available This isn't fast.
not_available You wanna see fast? PULL OVER! Listen, do you do a lot of drugs? What? No.
not_available And it's none of your business.
not_available Yes, it is my business.
not_available Look, you were driving like a maniac back there.
not_available You could have gotten us all killed.
not_available What the hell is this? You're not my father! Look, you split as soon as you could.
not_available You don't even know me, so don't start thinking you can tell me what to do, OK? So, where's Dad? Downstairs already? He's still in the morgue.
not_available You didn't bring him back with you? Oh, dear.
not_available It didn't even cross my mind.
not_available We should have taken the van so we could bring him home.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That was very stupid of me.
not_available Nice going, Dave.
not_available Like she doesn't have enough to feel bad about right now.
not_available Things have to be done.
not_available Federico's downstairs ready to start.
not_available Every second that we wait will only make Dad?s restoration more difficult.
not_available But you wouldn't know about that, would you, bag boy? Bag boy? I am assistant manager of organic produce at the highest buying food co
not_available op in Seattle.
not_available Jesus, pull your dicks out and measure them, and let?s get this over with! What were we supposed to do? Throw Dad in the back of Claire's car? It is a hearse! Yeah, hi.
not_available It's David Fisher.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll come pick up the body.
not_available I made you some dinner.
not_available I'm so not hungry.
not_available We have to eat, Claire.
not_available We didn't die! Ready? One.
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
not_available I'm really sorry, man.
not_available Thanks.
not_available For a body that's firm, yet flexible.
not_available For skin that begs to be touched.
not_available For the velvety appearance of actual living tissue, top morticians rely on Living Splendor Enbalming Fluid.
not_available Living Splendor Only real life is better? Hey, buddy boy.
not_available Come on in.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Say hello to Mr.
not_available Bloomberg.
not_available There isn't anything to be afraid of, Nate.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bloomberg is dead.
not_available I'm getting him ready so his family can see him for the last time and say goodbye to him.
not_available It'll make them feel better.
not_available That's what Daddy does.
not_available Bang! You got me! You can touch him, if you wear one of these.
not_available Believe me, he won't mind.
not_available He won't care.
not_available Nate! What's up? Hey, Rico.
not_available / It's good to see you.
not_available Oh, really sorry about your dad, man, but, you know, when your time is up, it's up, right? How's he doing? So far, so good.
not_available I really appreciate you coming in on Christmas Eve, Federico.
not_available It's the least I can do for Mr.
not_available F.
not_available Everything he did for me.
not_available I'd be up all night, anyway, putting together all this useless shit Santa Claus is bringing my kid, you know? We don't use that kind of language in here.
not_available Show some respect.
not_available You need something? No, I just, um
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Hey, listen, I just want to remind you.
not_available Don't eat too much with your family tonight, alright? Because I am making you something totally decadent and fatty for dessert.
not_available Hold just a second, please.
not_available Hi, Keith.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can't make it.
not_available Why not? Because my father was just killed in a car accident.
not_available Oh, shit, David, I'm so sorry.
not_available What can I do? Nothing.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I have to stay here.
not_available Listen.
not_available If you need anything, don't hesitate to call me.
not_available Sure.
not_available I mean it, David.
not_available You don't have to go through this alone.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available OK, here it goes.
not_available This is the one I'm most proud of.
not_available The husband, OK, got fired, flipped out, shot his wife point blank in the head, right? And then turned it around and shot himself in the mouth.
not_available Some seriously closed casket shit, right? Now look at this.
not_available Huh? Hah! Hah! Like the bride and groom on top of cake! And then we cremated them.
not_available What a fricking waste.
not_available Actually, this right here is my best work.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available This kid was just born like last month.
not_available Be four fucking years old in April.
not_available Can you believe it? Shit! Oh Vanessa's pregnant again! Hey, you stud! Hey, it wasn't planned.
not_available But, you know what, neither was this one, and he's the best thing that ever happened to me.
not_available Keep an eye on those chemicals, Federico.
not_available We don't want him to burn.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where's Mom? / She went to bed.
not_available Was she feeling any better? Yeah, Nate.
not_available She was on top of the goddamned world.
not_available Where's David? He's downstairs working.
not_available On Dad? Yeah, well, him and Rico.
not_available Said not to wait up for him.
not_available We should just try and get some sleep.
not_available Yeah.
not_available As if that were a viable option.
not_available Do you wanna go to the grocery store? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Anything to get out of here.
not_available Hello? Well, it's about to start raining frogs here.
not_available How are things on your end? God, I'm glad you called.
not_available Really? Why? I don't know.
not_available Because you have a calming effect on me.
not_available Uh huh.
not_available Are you familiar with the psychological term, "projection"? Are you familiar with the psychological term, "blow me"? Come on.
not_available You're up with all that psychobabble.
not_available Rebelled against it every chance you got, still do, and that includes having sex with strangers in closets at airports.
not_available And you think you're not easy to read? Coasting by on your looks and charm isn't working like it used to, but you have no idea what else to do, because you've never had to learn.
not_available Any woman with half a brain looks at a guy like you and thinks, "Good for a hot fuck, but, believe me, that's it.
not_available " / I Nate, can we go home? I've really got to take a shower.
not_available Oh, God, Jesus Christ, am I not allowed to have even a single moment to myself? OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available What can I do? Nothing.
not_available No one can do anything.
not_available You'll have to pay for that canteloupe.
not_available WILL YOU FUCK OFF?!? She looked her best every day of her life.
not_available Don't let one horribly disfiguring accident change that.
not_available Use new Wound Filler Cosmetic Molding Putty.
not_available Now fastersetting and self
not_available sealing.
not_available To help make masking unsightly wounds a breeze? Ma, you remember that stuffed dog I used to have and dragged it around till its ears fells off, and then you made new ears out of a dishtowel? I hated that dog after that, and I threw it up on the roof.
not_available No.
not_available Then I wanted it back, and I begged Dad to go get it, but he said "No.
not_available " If I'd really wanted it, I never would have thrown it up there in the first place.
not_available Your father did so many wonderful things for you, and that's all you can think of right now? I just remembered.
not_available / He was a good man! I'm going running.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You're doing me? You're the worst one we've got.
not_available Thanks, Dad.
not_available Where's Federico? It's Christmas morning.
not_available He's with his wife and kid.
not_available He'll be in later.
not_available Oh, couldn't this wait? I don't want you ruining my face.
not_available It's a little late for that.
not_available / Not funny.
not_available I need to stay busy right now.
not_available So go reorganize some files, or develop a new bookkeeping system.
not_available That's what you're good at.
not_available You never really had an aptitude for this stuff.
not_available I know.
not_available What did I do with my life? I went to school to learn exactly how to do this stuff.
not_available Other kids my age were going to frat parties.
not_available I was draining corpses and refashioning severed ears out of wax.
not_available Thank God I didn't lose an ear.
not_available I can only imagine what you'd do with that.
not_available I did it all for you.
not_available I did it to make you happy, you ungrateful son of a bitch.
not_available Um, Dave, yeah, I just wanted to let you know I was here.
not_available We'll deal you in next hand.
not_available Well, I'm about to jump out of my skin.
not_available Don't.
not_available I'm just barely holding it together.
not_available Are you still high? I don't know.
not_available Am I sweating? I don't know.
not_available I am.
not_available This is too fucking weird.
not_available It's been like three days.
not_available I'm still stuck in Zombie World.
not_available This is all happening to you.
not_available Fuck off.
not_available Sorry, but you're not the only one who wasn't prepared for this.
not_available I came home expecting to sleep late and chow down on Mom's cooking for six days, and now I find myself feeling like 
not_available I'm not even a part of this family.
not_available Well, I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat.
not_available What? At least you got out of here.
not_available I live in a shitty apartment, which was supposed to be temporary.
not_available I work at a job, which was also supposed to be temporary until I figured out what I really wanted to do with my life, which apparently is nothing.
not_available I have lots of sex, but I haven't had a relationship last more than a couple of months.
not_available I don't even have the self
not_available discipline to floss daily.
not_available I've had four root canals.
not_available Four.
not_available I am 35.
not_available I've had four root canals.
not_available I'm gonna be one of those losers who ends up on his deathbed, saying "Where'd my life go?" No, you won't.
not_available You'll be saying, "Where the hell's the morphine?" I'm just trying to cheer you up.
not_available I've spent my whole fucking life being cheerful.
not_available I am sorry about your father, but he's in a much better place now.
not_available You are so right about that.
not_available Who the hell is that?!? I know, Ruth.
not_available I know everything.
not_available I've known the Fishers for years from church.
not_available Mm hmm.
not_available You know them too? Yes, yes, I work here.
not_available / Oh, you work here.
not_available Mm hmm.
not_available What are you doing here? Just got off duty.
not_available I came to pay my respects to your father.
not_available You never even met my father.
not_available Exactly.
not_available And you've met my parents how many times now? 
not_available Christ, we just spent the weekend at their house.
not_available Don't do this to me, Keith.
not_available This is not your high school reunion.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available / This is not the time for you to be political.
not_available You think that's why I'm here? To be political? Would you keep your voice down? / What is this? We can fuck each other, but I can't be a shoulder for you to cry on? I'm not crying.
not_available / So what am I? Am I just sex to you? / Jesus! Do we really have to have this conversation now? Oh, shit! Here comes my mother.
not_available I'm so tired.
not_available I know, Mom.
not_available It's exhausting.
not_available Is something wrong? No, nothing's wrong.
not_available This is Keith Charles.
not_available He's a friend of mine.
not_available He came to pay his respects to Dad.
not_available It's nice to meet you, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available I'm really sorry about your husband.
not_available You're friends with a cop? We play racquetball together.
not_available Oh.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available I'd like to see your father now.
not_available Who's that cop? My aunt Shirley was laid out here.
not_available Aunt Shirley, huh? / Mm hmm.
not_available Shirley Hamilton.
not_available Terrible accident.
not_available Lost her ear.
not_available Oh, yeah! Yeah! I know Shirley! I remember Shirley! / Really?!? Yes, yes.
not_available I was the person who sewed her ear back on.
not_available That was me.
not_available / Really? / That's my work.
not_available What, she's sad, so he has to get her out of sight? They always do that the second someone starts to lose it.
not_available They take them off into that room.
not_available It makes all the other people uncomfortable, I guess.
not_available This is not about the other people.
not_available Volume? When I went backpacking through Europe after I quit school, I went to this island off the coast of Sicily.
not_available This volcanic island.
not_available And on the boat over, there was this pine box.
not_available Somebody from the island who was being returned to be buried there, and there were all these old Sicilians dressed up all in black, waiting, just lined up on the beach.
not_available And when they got that coffin to the beach, these old Sicilian women just went apeshit, screaming, throwing themselves on it, beating their chests, tearing at their hair, making animal noises.
not_available It was just so
not_available so real.
not_available I mean, I'd been around funerals my entire life, but I had never seen such
not_available grief.
not_available And at the time, it gave me the creeps, but..
not_available now I think it's probably so much more healthy than this.
not_available That cop is hot.
not_available Oh, David.
not_available David.
not_available I know, Mom.
not_available It's gonna be OK.
not_available It just takes time.
not_available I've done a terrible, terrible thing.
not_available What? I've done a terrible thing.
not_available / What's she doing? She's fine.
not_available I'm not fine.
not_available I'm a whore! I was unfaithful to your father for years, and now he knows, he knows! Uh
not_available I met a man at church once when your father didn't come with me.
not_available Mom
not_available / And he invited me for coffee.
not_available He said he liked my hair.
not_available He's a hairdresser, a widower.
not_available Well, they divorced before she died, so, technically, I guess, he's divorced.
not_available He invited me to accompany him on a hike.
not_available This is really not the time.
not_available I didn't even have the right shoes.
not_available I wore sandals.
not_available Maybe she needs to just get this out.
not_available Well, I don't want to hear it.
not_available I used to love hiking when I was younger, and being outdoors.
not_available I always wanted to take you kids camping, but your father would never leave the business.
not_available Well, I can tell you, I went camping with this man from church several times! Told your father I was visiting my sister, whom he never thought to call! Can you even begin to fathom the impropriety of this? Your husband is lying in a casket out there.
not_available David, she's grief
not_available stricken, OK? Fuck propriety! / We don't say that word! Did you know him? No.
not_available Did you? He was my father.
not_available You're Claire? Yeah.
not_available Keith Charles.
not_available I'm a friend of your brother's.
not_available Of Nate's? / No, David's.
not_available David's friends with a cop?!? We play racquetball together.
not_available David plays racquetball?!? / Excuse us.
not_available Do you want me to cry on your shoulder? / Fine.
not_available My mother just confessed she was having an affair.
not_available Wow.
not_available / Yeah.
not_available With some hairdresser.
not_available Who likes to hike.
not_available Now fucking Nate is in there, playing Mr.
not_available Sensitive with her, while her dead husband lies in the next room.
not_available It's disgusting.
not_available Hey, breathe.
not_available Alright? You're gonna get through this.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available I'll be the strong one.
not_available The strong one.
not_available The dependable one.
not_available Because that's what I do.
not_available Everyone around me will fall apart, because that's what they do.
not_available Don't you get exhausted being so hard on everyone and yourself? Oh, shut up.
not_available She met him at church.
not_available You met me at church.
not_available Hands.
not_available I didn't even realize how lonely I was, or how long it had been since a man touched me like that.
not_available Well, loneliness is a terrible thing.
not_available I'm still a woman, you know.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available And now your father sees me, and God sees me.
not_available He knows everything.
not_available I'm so ashamed.
not_available You didn't do it to hurt anybody.
not_available You were lonely.
not_available I'm sure Dad forgives you.
not_available And God doesn't?!? Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sure He does, too.
not_available Look, it's OK.
not_available Everybody forgives everybody for everything.
not_available Looking for the olives, honey? They're right here.
not_available Ashes to ashes and dust to dust is easy as pie with Franklin's New Leak
not_available Proof Earth Dispenser.
not_available Say goodbye to soiled fingers forever! Only from Franklin Funeral Supplies.
not_available We put the "fun" back in funeral? In the midst of life, we are in death.
not_available Of whom may we seek for succor, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins are justly displeased? Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.
not_available Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer, but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O Holy and Merciful Savior, thou most worthy Judge Eternal.
not_available Suffer us not at our last hour through any pains of death to fall from thee.
not_available To the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, to Almighty God we commend our brother, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, and we commit his body to the ground.
not_available It's like he's selling popcorn.
not_available Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
not_available The Lord bless him and keep him, the Lord make his face to shine upon Him and be gracious unto Him.
not_available The Lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace.
not_available Nate.
not_available / No! I refuse to sanitize this anymore.
not_available This is how it's done.
not_available Yeah? Well, it's whacked.
not_available What is this stupid saltshaker? Huh? What is this hermetically sealed box? This phony Astroturf around the grave? Jesus, David, it's like surgery.
not_available Clean, antiseptic, business.
not_available He was our father! / Please don't do this.
not_available You can pump him full of chemicals.
not_available You can put makeup on him, and you can prop him up for a nap in the slumber room, but the fact remains, David, that the only father we're ever going to have is gone.
not_available Forever.
not_available And that sucks, but it's a goddamned part of life, and you can't really accept it without getting your hands dirty.
not_available Well, I do accept it, and I intend to honor the old bastard by letting the whole world see just how fucked up and shitty I feel that he's dead! God damn it! Um? Amen.
not_available Wait.
not_available Let her.
not_available Let us pray.
not_available Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
not_available Amen! / Amen! Amen! The Lord be with you.
not_available Mom, Federico is gonna drive you back, OK? I just need to go over a few details with Nate.
not_available We'll be right behind you.
not_available There, there, Mrs.
not_available F.
not_available You have such delicate hands, Federico.
not_available Like a statue or an illustration in an antique book or one of those little ceramic hands they use to display gloves.
not_available You wanna be the Alpha dog, is that it? You're coasting towards midlife with nothing to show for it, and now you wanna come back and be the rock for this family to lean on? Fuck you.
not_available / That is not what I'm
not_available You want to get your hands dirty? You sanctimonious prick.
not_available Talk to me when you've had to stuff formaldehyde soaked cotton up your father's ass so he doesn't leak.
not_available Jesus! / Yeah, well I'm sure you just would have tossed him out with the garbage.
not_available It may seem weird to you, but there is a reason behind everything that we do here.
not_available We provide people with a very important and sacred service at the darkest time in their lives, because maybe they don't want to make a spectacle of themselves.
not_available Because maybe they'd prefer to grieve in private.
not_available Why? Why does it have to be such a secret? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available Dave, please.
not_available / You know nothing! Nothing! You had a responsibility towards this family, and you ran away from it, and you left it all for me.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Don't blame me if you're not living the life you want.
not_available That is nobody's fault but your own.
not_available OK.
not_available Fine.
not_available Just do me a favor, OK? You got out.
not_available Stay out.
not_available Excuse me, excuse me, Mr.
not_available Fisher, sir, if I could just get a moment of your time.
not_available / What? I'm from Kroehner Service International.
not_available I need to talk to you about the advantages of joining 
not_available our family of death care facilities.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Sir, if you could just hear me out
not_available We're not selling.
not_available Now get the fuck out of here! We wouldn't change the name of the business, and, of course, we would retain you as a salaried manager.
not_available Look, I really want to hit somebody right now, and it might as well be you.
not_available I'll call you, when you've had some time to recover from your loss.
not_available You're really lucky, you know that? You kidding? It was over in a second.
not_available I didn't have to be afraid of it.
not_available I didn't even have to think about it.
not_available No more bullshit.
not_available No more responsibility No more having to care.
not_available / No more boredom.
not_available No more waiting to die.
not_available Hi.
not_available Well, after four days with my family, I'm ready for shock therapy.
not_available I'm just waiting to see if my HMO covers it.
not_available / Aah.
not_available How's it going with you? Oh, it's great.
not_available Great.
not_available You know? My father's dead, my mom's a whore, my brother wants to kill me, and my sister's smoking crack.
not_available Who could win? Four days ago, I was a relatively happy guy.
not_available Now, it's like I don't even know who that guy was.
not_available I'm a fucking mess, if you wanna know the truth, but I think you're already aware of that.
not_available Well, here's my number, if you ever want to, I don't know, go out on a real date.
not_available You know, where you buy me dinner before I put out.
not_available Ah hah.
not_available Maybe I'm one of those women that meets a man who seems emotionally conflicted, no relationship skills, and I figure, hey, it's for me.
not_available You know, I don't even live here, right? I live in Seattle.
not_available See, that just makes you more attractive.
not_available / Really? Oh yeah.
not_available Hah.
not_available Well, I also happen to be a serial rapist.
not_available Got ten nurse buried under my house.
not_available Now you're making me wet.
not_available Hey.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available I need I need Hey.
not_available It's OK.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Thank God you're here.
not_available Yeah, well, of course I'm here.
not_available What do you want for breakfast? I'm going to go for a run.
not_available I'll eat when I get back.
not_available Nate.
not_available / Yeap! you don't have to go back to Seattle right away, do you? I guess not.
not_available I could make a few calls.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Just for a few days.
not_available OK.
