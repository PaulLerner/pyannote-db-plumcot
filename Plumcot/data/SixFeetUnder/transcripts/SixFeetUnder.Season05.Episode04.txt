not_available People do things for other people.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Well, I don't want him to do it just for me.
not_available Why the hell not? 
not_available Because I want him To want to have our baby, Not to do me the favor of letting me have mine.
not_available Don't be weirder about this than you absolutely have to be.
not_available But he should want to have this as much as I do.
not_available He has maya already.
not_available No, it's not the same thing.
not_available Then maybe he's afraid of losing another one.
not_available You know? And anyway, Let's say he is doing it just for you.
not_available Is that so terrible? We had sylvia for all the perfect bothof
not_available us reasons, And I had Josh for Mark, Because he couldn't imagine life without a boy.

not_available Oh, shut up.
not_available Next new 
message Today at 3:01 Please, get a life for one minute, please! Do you guys have wives besides being gay? No.
not_available We're a married couple, essentially.
not_available Well, when our dad married our mom, He was completely homosexual in his orientation.
not_available Only he was in such denial about it Because of the social pressure, it was like he didn't even know he was gay.
not_available That happens.
not_available Well, it wasn't until he became a success in his chosen field That his ego felt, you know, strong enough to face the truth.
not_available Do you ever have sex with chicks? 
not_available I don't.
not_available So, you do? I've had sex with a few women.
not_available Have you had sex with our dad? 
not_available You are kind of his type.
not_available Do you guys have orgies? 
not_available Okay, that's enough.
not_available No more talking until we get to the salon.
not_available They have orgies.
not_available He was waiting with that girl 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available For more than an hour! 
not_available They were gonna be there until 4:00.
not_available They left early, and she called you.
not_available My phone didn't ring.
not_available Oh, bullshit.
not_available Don't pretend you don't know that shit happens.
not_available I don't have to pretend anything.
not_available The way it is is bad enough.
not_available If we were still together Oh, this wouldn't happen? Bullshit! It would happen less! 
not_available Really? What a good point.
not_available I know it's all my fault, vanessa.
not_available Whenever anything goes wrong with the boys From now until the end of time it will be because I went out And fucked some whore, oka iaknow, I know, I know! 
not_available Look.
not_available What? You wanna hang out for a while? You wanna stay for dinner? I was supposed to go to this, hum But you know, I can call and change it.
not_available No, you're not doing me any favors.
not_available Oh, god, I didn't say I was doing you any favors.
not_available Shit.
not_available I'm feeling pretty secure now, But I went through a phase last year Where, you know, I was so shy around chicks Tthat I thought maybe I was gay, too.
not_available I think it's pretty normal to go through a phase like that.
not_available Yeah it is, but then we had some group sessions With our therapists and dad, and it turned out What I was really afraid of was not being gay.
not_available I mean, if I wasn't gay, Would dad still love me? So, that cleared it up.
not_available I'm not gay, and I have a girlfriend in Aspen.
not_available Oh, what's her name? 
not_available Alison.
not_available She's bi.
not_available Keith, does this look completely deviant? No! Looks good.
not_available We're almost done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available My mom has a friend back home named vernon, But she doesn't feel like he'd be a good sexual partner for her.
not_available I have to say I kind of agree.
not_available You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and get a haircut while you take these two back home.
not_available If that's okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'll come back and pick you up after I drop the kids off.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So how is he doing? 
not_available Not great.
not_available He's been asking to go down to the bomb shelter again.
not_available I don't think it's a good idea.
not_available I told him I would ask you.
not_available No, I don't want to risk going through all that again.
not_available We should board that place up and forget it's there.
not_available Maybe it would be good for him To have somewhere 
not_available No.

not_available Uh.
not_available Time flies when you're pretending to have fun.

not_available Time flies when you're pretending to know what people mean when they say "Love." Let's face it, buddy boy, there's two kinds of people in the world There's you and there's everybody else, And never the twain shall meat.

not_available All right.
not_available Bye.

not_available It's not the size of the animal that makes it deadly, It's the size of its mouth.
not_available The bigger the mouth And then we go to the vet, And then back to the house, and then all over beverly hills, And then finally we come here.
not_available It's like his job came and found my day and ate it.

not_available Yeah, in exchange for a childhood.
not_available Whatever we do, we're not gonna put our kids through that.
not_available Parents can have a few secrets.
not_available It's not a bad thing.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll have secrets.
not_available You got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available "Paris, the city of dreams, the city of lights, The city of love." You're gonna wake the boys.
not_available No, they sleep through it now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is this the line to pee? So the bird's in there now? How'd it get in there? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What did you say to billy? He was really upset.
not_available I didn't say anything to Billy.
not_available He had some thing with Claire, 
not_available He got mad and he walked out.
not_available Well, what happened? You know, I don't know what happened, Brenda.
not_available I guess what usually happens.
not_available Your brother went fucking mental.
not_available What did you Hey, you might want to wait a few seconds before you go in there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Why did you fucking invite that guy? 
not_available I thought he was your friend.
not_available He's not.
not_available You know, it really Excuse me.
not_available I hate that you're always jumping to conclusions about Billy.
not_available You will never believe that he's getting better.
not_available No, I won't.
not_available I hate that he's with Claire and in our fucking house.
not_available Yeah, well, at least he knows how to keep a secret.
not_available Look, I know that you told jackie, so what's the big fucking deal? There is a very big difference between me telling my supervisor, And you telling our entire family, who are now looking at me 
not_available Wondering when I'm gonna lose this baby.
not_available Jesus christ! This morning I wasn't excited enough, now I'm too excited.
not_available What the fuck do you want ? 
not_available No, that wasn't excitement.
not_available That was macho, aggressive male bullshit.
not_available What the fuck is this? When you do stuff like that, it makes me wonder if we should be together.
not_available We just got married.
not_available Yeah, well, if it's not right, it's not right.
not_available You might want to light a match in there.
not_available It wasn't me.
not_available You're freaked out right now because you're pregnant.
not_available You see that, don't you? Yeah, with a baby that you don't even want.
not_available Bullshit! You don't respect me enough To wait until we know that everything's all right 
not_available Before you tell the whole world.
not_available Shut the fuck up! I need to pee.
not_available Nate! Tequila shots in the kitchen.
not_available Get in here! So you stopped taking it? Just like that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you feel? I feel a little tingly.
not_available That's about it.
not_available What do they got you on these days? Well, they just switched me from lithium to tofranil, In between the shock treatments.
not_available What are those like? Honestly I don't know.
not_available I go in.
not_available They put me on a bed.
not_available Ey give me some oxygen.
not_available They say, "you're gonna feel a little prick in your hand." That always makes me laugh.
not_available And then the next thing I know I wake up with the worst headache I've ever had in my life.
not_available Do you think it's helping? I think that As émile coué used to say, "Every day in every way, i am getting better and better." But not everyone agrees.
not_available Yeah, it's hard to get your shit together With someone watching all the time.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available But when no one's watching, then where are you? Where the fuck are you then? Daddy sang bass Mama sang tenor Me and little brother would join right in there Singin' seemed to help a troubled soul I'm gonna take off.

not_available You have this wonderful family 
not_available And a baby on the way.
not_available I know.
not_available And it's really fucking lonely.
not_available I just feel like all I do all day long Is manage myself, Try to fucking connect with people.

not_available You know what I mean? Well, I know that if you think life's a vending machine, Where you put in virtue And you get out happiness, Then you're probably gonna be disappointed.
not_available I know that.
not_available Is that how I sound? 
not_available A little.
not_available Nate! Nate! Get in here! Fuck! 
not_available I don't think believe it.

not_available No, you don't.
not_available You say that you do, but I can tell by the way you look at me, You think that all of this is my fault.
not_available You don't wanna make love to me.
not_available You don't wanna kiss me.
not_available You don't wanna be in the same room with me! 
not_available That's not true.
not_available Oh, yes, it is! Ruth Don't you understand? Nobody grows up thinking this is the way they're gonna turn out to be.
not_available If I could change just by snapping my fingers, 
not_available I'd do it.
