not_available Thanks.
not_available I feel like I've been eating this cake for 12 months.
not_available I wasn't gonna say anything.
not_available Well, I guess I better get going.
not_available You could stay over tonight if you want.
not_available Here? Yeah, if you're too drunk to drive or whatever.
not_available I guess I could do that.
not_available And what's wrong with here anyway? Nothing 
not_available Here is where I grew up.
not_available Nothing's wrong with it.
not_available I've just never stayed over your house.
not_available That's all I meant.
not_available Well you can.
not_available That's all I meant.
not_available Look, I'm tired, okay? My mother just married some guy.
not_available Let me be a little edgy.
not_available Be whatever you want, I don't give a shit.
not_available So stay over.
not_available Okay! Jesus.
not_available I have to drive to Santa Barbara to pick up her body.
not_available To pick up my wife's body.
not_available Go to sleep.
not_available I can't.
not_available It's all so impossible.
not_available It's all so fuckin' impossible.
not_available Just sleep, Nate, it helps.
not_available It's weird.
not_available What? It's quieter here than over at Your place? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it's quieter.
not_available And stranger.
not_available What's so strange? Oh, I don't know, the thought that I just got blown in the same bed where my mom used to read me "The Runaway Bunny"? And "The Five Chinese Brothers." Oh God.
not_available What is that? Is that Claire? No! George! George! Oh, that was nice.
not_available It certainly was.
not_available I'm married again.
not_available And? Nothing.
not_available I just never thought I'd be married again.
not_available Are you happy? Very.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'm sorry your children couldn't come to the wedding.
not_available Well, they were very busy.
not_available I get it.
not_available I'd like to meet them, though, sometime.
not_available Brian and Maggie? Sure.
not_available You know so much about my family, and I know so little about yours.
not_available I'm sure you'll meet them someday.
not_available At my funeral, if not before.
not_available George! 
not_available If they even bother to come to that.
not_available George, I'm serious.
not_available Look you've lived your life one way, I've lived mine another.
not_available The costs are different.
not_available But I can tell you this, every day when I wake up, I'm glad that I'm alive, and if people don't like the way I've done things, that's their business.
not_available But right now, I'm so very happy I've found you.
not_available And I'm looking forward, not back.
not_available Okay? Do you think we were too loud? It's possible that we were too loud, yes.
not_available Nate? 
not_available You don't have to say it, I know.
not_available Bye.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Call me if you need anything.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available I waited up until, like, 4:00.
not_available He never showed up.
not_available God, I'm sorry.
not_available No, I couldn't sleep anyway.
not_available Could you believe that? I was like completely scandalized.
not_available I never knew the word "George" could sound so obscene.
not_available Good for them.
not_available You want some more coffee? 
not_available Yes, please.
not_available We have all got to get out of this house if they're gonna keep doing that.
not_available Out of the state.
not_available Out of the universe.
not_available What happened to you? Lisa's dead.
not_available Oh shit.
not_available Her body washed up near Carpinteria a few days ago.
not_available Some kids found it.
not_available Fuck.
not_available It took the lab till yesterday to figure out it was her.
not_available Do they know what happened? She drowned.
not_available She just drowned? That's what they said.
not_available No evidence of anything else bad.
not_available But she could swim, right? Yeah, it just just looks like she drowned.
not_available God.
not_available So I have to go to the coroner up there and get her.
not_available I'll come with you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Nate, what happened to your face? I got in a fight.
not_available Good morning, morning glories.
not_available I hope we didn't keep any of you folks up last night.
not_available They found Lisa's body.
not_available She's dead.
not_available Oh, Lord.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So am I.
not_available So am I.
not_available Angelica?! Sweetie, I gotta be at work in like 10 minutes, David's going up there with Nate, so Wait a minute, honey, okay? Angelica, come on! Gimme a second.
not_available Why were you so late last night? I was at work.
not_available We had this body come in, this young girl.
not_available You don't even want to know.
not_available Thank you for taking such good care of us.
not_available Angelica, I'm serious! So, Keith.
not_available So what about him? You guys are back together? No.
not_available He was there this morning.
not_available He was a little drunk last night, I let him stay over.
not_available I was being polite.
not_available Polite and horny.
not_available And horny.
not_available Thank you for bringing that up.
not_available I never really thought Lisa and I'd be together forever.
not_available I always knew something would come along and end it.
not_available I just didn't want it to be me.
not_available You wouldn't believe how much time I wasted thinking, "Please don't let it be me that fucks it up." 
not_available And it wasn't.
not_available No? Good for me.
not_available You smell terrible.
not_available Cavity fluid, sorry.
not_available The smell of it just permeates everything.
not_available It always smells so cold and lonely.
not_available But then also weirdly sweet, like an old lady's hair.
not_available That's Velvetone.
not_available Moisturizer.
not_available It's to mask the other smell.
not_available I'll take a shower before I come to bed.
not_available When I die, I don't want any of that stuff in me.
not_available Yeah, I don't blame you.
not_available No, I'm serious.
not_available I don't want to be chemicalized and boxed up.
not_available I just want to be taken out to some open space in the forest somewhere, buried right in the ground.
not_available Nothing between me and the earth that made me.
not_available You don't want to end up in a graveyard.
not_available Nate, the whole world's a graveyard.
not_available Anybody home? Hello? 
not_available It's Joe.
not_available From across the way? The guy that you didn't go on a date with last night? Oh, hi, yeah.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, what's in the bag? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.
not_available Well, what's the matter? Oh, a friend of mine died.
not_available Oh God, I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can go if you No, stay.
not_available Stay.
not_available I've just been sitting here staring into space all morning.
not_available I've got to get my shit together at some point.
not_available Chinese food? 
not_available Uh, yeah yeah.
not_available Do you want some? I got a little extra just in case that you were around.
not_available It's not a date thing.
not_available It's just a neighbor thing.
not_available All right.
not_available You eat shrimp? 
not_available Mmm.
not_available There is some saltand
not_available pepper shrimp in here somewhere.
not_available I eat everything but mushrooms.
not_available I don't like mushrooms either.
not_available They're too much like parts of people, aren't they? They just taste dirty to me.
not_available Here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's funny? 
not_available I don't think I've ever had a neighbor who just stops by before.
not_available So, how is it? It's interesting.
not_available I don't want to go in there.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is the worst one I've had in a long time.
not_available It's like those whales, when they die.
not_available You know what happens? 
not_available No.
not_available Their guts turn to cream and they explode.
not_available All that's left when they wash up on shore is a big bag of blubber This is my sisterin
not_available law.
not_available Oh, shit shit shit.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought you were here on business.
not_available I am, and this is my sisterin
not_available law.

not_available But you found us okay? Once you got here? Nope, good directions, no problem.
not_available And the hotel? 
not_available Everything.
not_available Those were good, good directions.
not_available Love that MapQuest.
not_available Oh, that's a good site.
not_available Helluva site.
not_available Extremely helpful.
not_available I'm still a little shaken up.
not_available Of course you are.
not_available My little girl is dead.
not_available You want to take a peek at Maya, maybe? Yeah, that'd be great.
not_available You're Michaela.
not_available I am.

not_available I remember.
not_available I met you at the wedding.
not_available I'm sorry about your aunt Lisa.
not_available We're not gonna have to see her, are we? No.
not_available That's a relief.
not_available Are you, um do you want something to eat? 
not_available Not me.
not_available But I bet the rest of 'em do.
not_available They all love to eat.
not_available I have had this goofy feeling in my ear for, like, a week now.
not_available I think it started the other day, you know, when I took the boys to the beach.
not_available Angelica? 
not_available What? I was I was wondering maybe, if it wasn't time for you to start looking for a new place.
not_available Is he making you do this? He is, isn't he? 
not_available No.
not_available You know what? That's bullshit.
not_available Don't you think it's time you get on your own two feet? I have always been there for you, Vanessa, 
not_available whenever you needed anything.
not_available And I've been there for you! When it's easy for you.
not_available When it fits for you, you're there for me.
not_available Shit.
not_available Watch your mouth in front of my kids.
not_available I'm sorry, but this ear thing is driving me crazy! Angelica 
not_available No, you know what, don't even talk to me, Vanessa.
not_available Don't even talk.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I'm gonna go pack my things.
not_available Come in.
not_available Can I escape in here for a second? 
not_available Sure.
not_available This house is crawling with people.
not_available There's nowhere to hide.
not_available What are you doing? I'm trying to break my eye open.
not_available Ouch.
not_available That's what Olivier called it.
not_available It's learning to see things differently, without all the same tired associations we've made all our sad lives, blah blah blah.
not_available That one's pretty cool.
not_available Yeah, that one is cool.
not_available They're all really cool.
not_available It's fucking Nan Goldin, hello.
not_available So you're back together with Keith, huh? I don't know, maybe.
not_available Do you wanna be? Hmm.
not_available What I want is I think I could be happy going back if I could Break your eye open a little? Yeah.
not_available If we both could.
not_available Why, is it that hard? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Yeah, it's the hardest fuckin' thing in the world.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available What about you? Are you seeing anybody? Got a thing for anybody? 
not_available Are you kidding? Ugh! Everyone is an asshole who ultimately fucks you over.
not_available I am totally done with that.
not_available I'm thinking about becoming like a crazy hermit recluse.
not_available You won't always feel that way.
not_available Yes, I will.
not_available What? 
not_available David.
not_available Everybody's waiting for you in the dining room.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Thanks for the hideout.
not_available Thanks for listening to me complain about my cushy, alienated life.
not_available Any time.
not_available Okay, here we go, gentlemen.
not_available That's not what Lisa wanted.
not_available With all due respect, Nate, you only knew my daughter for a few years.
not_available I think I have a little better idea than you of what she would have really wanted, if she hadn't been so busy throwing everything 
not_available in my face with her strange ideas.
not_available Mom No, Barb! She is getting cremated and she is going in the family mausoleum in Coeur d'Alene.
not_available That is final.
not_available Peg, at times like these David, the Kimmels have always done it this way.
not_available Tell him, Ed.
not_available We've got a real nice space set aside for her.
not_available It's almost like a little chapel unto itself up on the hill there.
not_available That's not what she wanted, does that matter to you people at all? Did she have a plan, or a will or something that we could consult? 
not_available Of course she didn't.
not_available Honey.
not_available She wanted she didn't want 
not_available What? She didn't want to be embalmed.
not_available She didn't want to be cremated.
not_available She just wanted to be put back into the earth somewhere.
not_available No casket, nothing.
not_available That is just the sickest thing I've ever heard.
not_available Mom.
not_available To be eaten by bugs and worms? Yeah, well, you should know that a lot of her already has been eaten by sharks and fish and shrimp! Nate! 
not_available Stop yelling at me! Tell him to stop yelling! She just wanted to return to the earth is how she put it.
not_available Well, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, right? Seems pretty clear to me.
not_available I can't believe that you wouldn't want to honor your daughter's wishes about this! 
not_available It seems to me What? I think we all need to be a little more aware of each other's grief right now, and a little less aggressive.
not_available It would be nice to do something that bears some relation to what Lisa would have wanted.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But if that's not possible I'm sorry, I can't deal with this.
not_available David, you're gonna have to deal with this.
not_available Um why not Why not what, David? Let's all start to try thinking in terms of a middle ground.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? Not much.
not_available Or a fuckin' lot, I guess.
not_available Where are you, can you talk a second? Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was just on my way to grab coffee with these two absolute idiots who think they're revolutionaries because they just went to their first flash mob.
not_available So the later I am, the better.
not_available Say something, speak.
not_available Well, um you know my sisterin
not_available law Lisa, she was missing for, like, a really long time.
not_available They just found her body.
not_available She's dead.
not_available Holy fuckin' shit, Claire.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's really fucked up, isn't it? Claire, I'm so sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nate, she's their little girl.
not_available If something happened to Maya, you'd be a nightmare to deal with.
not_available That's not the point and you know it.
not_available It's their last chance to be her parents.
not_available I'm her husband, so the fuck what?! 
not_available Should I, perhaps, leave? No! Look, you know I'm with you on this.
not_available I'm sorry, that's not painfully fuckin' obvious! That's because, you asshole, I'm trying to keep everybody happy! 
not_available Well, it's working.
not_available I know it's not working! I think I could go re
not_available alphabetize those unclaimed cremains while you guys Arthur! Or I can do that later, also is good for me too.
not_available You just honest you just tell me, do you think it's okay for that fuckin' hydra which, incidentally, was what Lisa called her, okay? Do you think it's okay for her to burn my wife up in an oven and stick her in a drawer? When all that Lisa wanted was to be outside somewhere under the stars? No, but what you're suggesting is against the law.
not_available We could lose our license.
not_available Look, I know you want to do a good thing for Lisa.
not_available They do too, so do I.
not_available We all want to do a good thing.
not_available I'm over here.
not_available What can I do for you? I'm looking for someone to, uh I wanted to make a confession.
not_available Do I know you? Uh no, no.
not_available I didn't want to go to my own church.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Well, have a seat.
not_available We're not going in there? Well, we can if you like.
not_available But nowadays, a lot of people prefer to do it face to face.
not_available Well okay.
not_available I say everything else the same, right? Like, the official way? You can say it however you like.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh well, I'm I'm married, and I have two kids, but the other night, I went to a strip club called The Seventh Veil? Uh I'm not really familiar with it.
not_available Oh, nn
not_available neither was I, but this guy made me go, and I met this girl, and I let her give me a you know.
not_available She, uh she orally Do you know what the scriptures say about the sanctity of marriage? Uh yeah, yeah yeah, kinda.
not_available You know? III know the basic position of
not_available of the scriptures, and, and whatever, yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Do you know the act of contrition? Yes, sir.
not_available Yes.
not_available Uh, "O, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee.
not_available I detest all my sins, but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love.
not_available I firmly intend to confess my sins, do penance, and amend my life.
not_available Amen." That was fast.
not_available Hello? Hi, it's me.
not_available What's up? I just wanted to know when Lisa's funeral is gonna be.
not_available Nate? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available It's tomorrow, 10:00.
not_available Do you want me to come? Uh 
not_available honestly, no.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's just there's a shitload of people here, Brenda, all kinds of Lisa's family from Idaho.
not_available It's a mess.
not_available You don't have to explain.
not_available Is that all right? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You do what you got to do to get through this.
not_available Yeah, I'm trying.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available My sister Lisa didn't believe in borders.
not_available She didn't see the edges and the lines in between things that most of us think keep life manageable.
not_available And this meant if you were her sister growing up, she would always come into your room without knocking.
not_available Or she would come into the bathroom and open the shower curtain just to tell you about some article she'd read, or some boy she'd met.
not_available And it meant later on that she would call me on the phone, sometimes very very late at night, just to tell me about a new recipe I needed to try, or more recently, some new, completely amazing thing that Maya had done.
not_available Or about how well things were going with Nate.
not_available It also meant that she looked for ways every day to reach out to the people around her, to extend kindness to strangers when it wasn't expected.
not_available And to push everyone around her to see the things that unify us with nature, with each other with life itself.
not_available Lisa didn't believe in borders and that's why I know that wherever Lisa is right now she's everywhere.
not_available She's everywhere, and that means she's home.
not_available So you ready, guys? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess.
not_available This was one of Aunt Lisa's favorite songs.
not_available One, two, three, four.
not_available # You, who are on the road # # Must have a code # # That you can live by # # And so become yourselves # # Because the past # # Is just a goodbye.
not_available # That was an amazing service, Nate.
not_available Lisa would have loved it.
not_available So where is she gonna be buried or scattered or We're gonna put her ashes in the family mausoleum in Coeur d'Alene.
not_available Oh good.
not_available Idaho, good.
not_available See, I didn't even know she was from Idaho.
not_available We've lost three friends in the last month or so, it's kinda taking a toll.
not_available Oh, you poor thing.
not_available And we're not even What's it gonna be like when we're 50, or 60? There's so much death.
not_available And Maya, what is she gonna do? She's never gonna know her mother.
not_available I don't know how you deal with it.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm just sorry it's under such totally crappy circumstances.
not_available But, it's so good to see you.
not_available What have you been up to? Not much.
not_available Making bad art.
not_available Saying stupid things.
not_available Continuing implementation of my master plan to be completely forgotten when I'm gone, and totally forgettable while I'm here.
not_available You? Not much.
not_available I got an abortion.
not_available When? Like, right after we broke up.
not_available So, okay, give me a minute, did you just tell me that we got pregnant, that you had an abortion and it was mine? Ours, yeah.
not_available And you didn't call me? You didn't think you should at least tell me? I'm telling you now.
not_available Why are you telling me now when there's nothing I can do about it? Because I'm lonely.
not_available Because I need somebody to talk to about this.
not_available Claire, I could've been there.
not_available I could've done something.
not_available Russell, believe me, there's nothing to do.
not_available There would have been if I'd been there.
not_available Like what? I wasn't gonna have it.
not_available I know that.
not_available I could have comforted you With what, flowers? Balloons? 
not_available Believe me you'd already done enough.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Look, I'm sorry that 
not_available Just give me a second.
not_available Okay, just just give me a second to get used to the idea of living with this for the rest of my life.
not_available Are you fuckin' kidding me? 
not_available No, I'm not! I'm not kidding you, Claire! It's fucking sad! It's fucking sad and it's fucked up! I mean, did you cry?! Did you?! I cried more than you have ever cried in your whole life! Then give me one fuckin' second to feel bad about this, okay? Just a motherfuckin' second? Is everything all right in here? Yes, George, we're fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Do you need me to come with you to the crematorium? No, thanks.
not_available It'll be good to have some time alone.
not_available I could run by in the morning and get the ashes.
not_available It's on my way, Nate.
not_available It's cool.
not_available No, thanks, Rico, I told them Lisa's folks have to leave first thing tomorrow.
not_available They'll do it when I get there and I'll bring her right back.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm really really sorry, Nate.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well, I'm gonna go straight home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Say hi to Vanessa and the kids for me.
not_available I will.
not_available So I'll see you in about an hour? Yeah.
not_available A lot you could do with this.
not_available Take a beautiful handkerchief and drape it over the top and you'd be in business.

not_available I really don't.
not_available And neither do I.
not_available Then why do we Keep fuckin' it up? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available Things would really have to be different though, Keith.
not_available I think so too.
not_available I mean it, I can't I mean, I don't want to sit through anymore therapy.
not_available I don't either.
not_available But we have to look for ways to bring the good things we feel about each other more into the way that we get through each day.
