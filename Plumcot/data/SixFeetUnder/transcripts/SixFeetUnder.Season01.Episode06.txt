not_available the.
not_available room.
not_available Damn, this house is cold.
not_available Shit, Hattie, it's like a goddamn ice box.
not_available Well, no wonder! Girl, are you crazy? We live in the desert.
not_available gets cold at night.
not_available You plan on sleeping all day? Plan on gettin' me some breakfast before nightfall! Come on, bitch.
not_available Get your lazy ass up.
not_available Come on, this ain't the old folks' home.
not_available Hattie? Hattie? Hattie! "MILDRED 'HATTIE' EFFINGER JONES ARY 7, 1922
not_available MARCH 10, 2001" I hate this client.
not_available Every time she gets dumped by a guy, she gets a puppy.
not_available So now she's got like 15 dogs, they're all male, they're all huge, and they sit there and watch with their tongues hanging out while I work on her.
not_available It's like being in some live sex show for Asian businessmen, frat boys
not_available which I actually did for a while, back in the 80s, make some money.
not_available I got this great thing going with ping pong balls you'd really like.
not_available I must show it to you sometime.
not_available Hey, wouldn't it be funny if I got some hedge clippers and cut off your dick? What? Do me a favor, OK? Don't read that shit in front of me.
not_available You gave it to me.
not_available Yeah, come on, I'm late.
not_available I'm at the part with the doll.
not_available Why is your doll angry? Because she got raped.
not_available Really? By who? By you.
not_available Brenda, do you know what "raped" means? It means she was forced into sexual intercourse against her will.
not_available It's so cool.
not_available You were obviously doing it to scare him into leaving you alone, right? What do you want from me? I was 8.
not_available Did it work? No, it didn't work.
not_available I just got a whole new level of scrutiny by a whole different set of vultures, only this time they were women.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available You still want a ride? You alright? Yes, I'm fine.
not_available What are you doing today? Um, well, the cabinets.
not_available I'm gonna try to organize the cabinets.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be downstairs.
not_available Alright.
not_available Hey, Bobby! Yeah? Bring the Lincoln Town Car round front.
not_available OK.
not_available You're the other Fisher boy, huh? The one from where? Oregon? Seattle.
not_available Right.
not_available The health food thing.
not_available Yup.
not_available I remember your dad talked about you.
not_available Sorry to hear about him, man.
not_available He was a funny guy.
not_available Yeah? No, you don't pay.
not_available Don't pay? Yeah, your dad buried my brother a few years back.
not_available It was in trade.
not_available My father traded a funeral for oil changes? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Bye, Mom, have a good day.
not_available So would you like us to take care of finding you a cemetery plot, Mr.
not_available Jones? Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
not_available Would you like a double plot? What for? Well, one for your wife and one for you.
not_available Next to each other.
not_available Is this what you do all the time? Sell people their own graves? Well, yes, sir.
not_available This is my job.
not_available Don't try to pull that shit with me, boy.
not_available I want a simple box.
not_available No frills.
not_available You can't take advantage of me because I'm old.
not_available I'll kick your ass! Just a single plot, then.
not_available No.
not_available Double plot.
not_available Shit.
not_available Will you want Mrs.
not_available Jones prepared for viewing? Yes, I want to see her, but I don't want you messin' with her none.
not_available I don't want you to cut her or stick her or pickle her like an egg.
not_available If you want a viewing, I strongly would recommend
not_available That's my wife, boy, I don't want you to touch her! Mr.
not_available Jones, I can guarantee that you will not want to see her, nor will anybody else, unless she's been embalmed.
not_available I would beg you to consider what your wife would want.
not_available She's dead, fool! Don't matter what she wants! Well, yes, sir, but
not_available after death, the body immediately begins to decompose much quicker than you might think.
not_available The skin begins to separate, there's quite an unpleasant odor.
not_available Should you choose to forego embalming, my recommendation would be cremation, as soon as possible.
not_available That's just the way it is, Mr.
not_available Jones.
not_available I don't want to burn her up.
not_available I want to see her.
not_available Fine.
not_available You do understand, however, that that means she'll have to be embalmed.
not_available I ain't payin' for that.
not_available Sir, the cost is minimal
not_available I will waive the embalming fee, Mr.
not_available Jones, alright? That was a good sermon, I thought.
not_available Did you? You didn't? I didn't really listen to it.
not_available Hello! Hello! Hello.
not_available Hello, Mrs.
not_available Fisher, I'm Tracy Blair, David's friend.
not_available Tracy.
not_available I keep asking him when we're gonna meet his fiancee.
not_available Does she go to another church? Yes.
not_available What fiancee? Tracy, I told you, Jennifer and I had broken it off years ago.
not_available You did? So there's no fiancee now? Excuse us.
not_available That's really a sore subject for us all.
not_available Ow! You're hurting my arm.
not_available Hiram! How are you? I'm fine, thank you.
not_available Have you come to church? I haven't seen you.
not_available I wanted to give you some space.
not_available Please don't sacrifice anything on my account.
not_available A little late for that.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Can I see you? No.
not_available Ruth, haven't you punished yourself enough? Shall we go? Hi, I'm David Fisher.
not_available Hiram Gunderson.
not_available Nice to meet you
not_available You're the hairdresser.
not_available It's nice to meet you, son.
not_available Don't call me that.
not_available David! What? I'll go get the car.
not_available No, I'm coming with you.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available You look well.
not_available OK! I hear you! Jesus! Who are you? I live here.
not_available Who are you? I want to see my wife.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available We're not open yet.
not_available Everyone who knows anything is gone.
not_available I want to see my wife.
not_available Look, sir, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't deal with the dead people, so you're just gonna have to come back when my brothers are home.
not_available Bitch, I don't need your permission.
not_available Sir, I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to come back later.
not_available Ow, my foot! What? Help! Help! There's a white girl trying to cripple an old black man! Honestly Look, sir, you can't go in there! Hello! Hello, is anyone home? Yes, in here! Who's your friend? Hell if I know! His wife died, and he wanted to see her.
not_available I guess she isn't ready yet.
not_available He looked like he was about to keel over, so I helped him sit down.
not_available Then I had to listen to him bitch and moan about public transportation for fucking ever, and then he just, like, passed out.
not_available Now I can't get his fucking hand to let go! Maybe he died.
not_available Very funny.
not_available No, he's still breathing.
not_available And farting.
not_available Can you help me pry his hand loose? Sure.
not_available Is Nate around? I just bought this fabulous antique chest, weighs a ton.
not_available I'm gonna need a hand getting it home.
not_available No, I haven't seen him.
not_available I can help you move it, though.
not_available no, thanks.
not_available So what? I'm no good because the whole cabinet thing is just foreplay for you to fuck my brother? No.
not_available I'm just not into babysitting high school girls.
not_available No offense.
not_available Let go of me! Goddamn! What are you all trying to do? Trying to steal my watch? I oughtta call the goddamn cops! Why? You're the one who's breaking and entering! Look, we've gotta go move a chest.
not_available Someone should be back soon to let you see your wife.
not_available Hey, little girl.
not_available What? You ain't foolin' nobody.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll work on that.
not_available Look, I'll be like one minute to change, OK? Are you gonna be OK here alone? Everybody's alone.
not_available You're born alone, you die alone, goddamn it.
not_available I'm sorry about your wife.
not_available You didn't know her.
not_available jessica Wilcox? I'm Nate Fisher, Nathaniel's son.
not_available I wondered why I hadn't heard from Nathaniel in quite a while.
not_available I hate this.
not_available I hate that I'll never see him again.
not_available He was such a kook! Kook? Dad? I don't think anybody made me laugh like that.
not_available He had such a sense of humor.
not_available So I hear.
not_available He was really proud of you.
not_available I'm Nate, not David.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available You're the one who took off.
not_available Your father really respected you for that.
not_available Said he wished he'd had the guts to do that when he was a kid.
not_available Ms Wilcox, did you have some kind of arrangement with my father? Arrangement? In our ledgers, some of the funerals were marked differently, and your mother's was one.
not_available Seems my father sometimes traded his services for payments other than cash.
not_available Please don't take this the wrong way, but can I see some kind of identification? Driver?s license would do.
not_available Uh
not_available sure.
not_available Libra, huh? I would've taken you for a Capricorn.
not_available You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle? Yeah.
not_available Better be careful.
not_available Give you kidney stones.
not_available Oh, come on! Surely you wouldn't begrudge your father such a minor indulgence! My father never smoked pot.
not_available Not in front of you, he didn't.
not_available It's the finest organic.
not_available Grown in San Francisco by my son.
not_available Take it.
not_available It's your father's monthly supply.
not_available How is your mother doing with the grieving, David? She is fine.
not_available As far as I can tell.
not_available You know her.
not_available She likes to suffer in silence.
not_available That seems to be a family trait.
not_available You know it's God's will for us to live our lives fully.
not_available Breathing in the joy around us, not just shouldering the pain.
not_available God wants us to be happy.
not_available I call them energy buns.
not_available They're my own recipe.
not_available Well, not really.
not_available Adding the peppers was something I picked up on my honeymoon.
not_available Have you ever been to Brazil? no.
not_available Oh my God, Brazilians are the most beautiful people alive.
not_available They're like these fabulous mongrels who've incorporated all the very best attributes from ever race.
not_available I mean, all that crossbreeding, hello! I had a half
not_available breed mutt who lived to be almost 20, and then I got this purebred, Corky, and its hips disintegrated before it was even 2 Here you go.
not_available Fuck you, church freaks! Well, enjoy.
not_available Do you cook? I hate cooking just for myself.
not_available That's the worst part about being divorced.
not_available That and the no regular sex thing.
not_available Daivd, could I talk to you for a moment? Alone.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available What do you want? Ruth won't talk to me.
not_available I'm worried about her.
not_available I was hoping that you couldYou were fucking my mother while my father was still alive, and now you want me to
not_available I understand if you're upset with me.
not_available Understand this.
not_available Whatever you have with my mother is between you and her, but I have no interest in helping you.
not_available Table for one? Are you the owner? Yes.
not_available Did you know my father, Nathaniel Fisher? This used to be our storeroom.
not_available But when I finally got a loan from the bank, I put an extension onto the kitchen.
not_available Your father buried my wife seven years ago.
not_available I have very little money for the funeral.
not_available He asked if he could have this room as his own, and that would be my settlement.
not_available What did he do here? I don't know.
not_available Stay as long as you would like.
not_available How often did he come here? Well, sometimes we wouldn't see him for months.
not_available Sometimes he was here everyday.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fisher! Good afternoon, Nikolai! I don't believe I've had the chance to thank you yet.
not_available When Kroehner started pressuring everyone to cut us off, most of our suppliers just abandoned Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available You stuck with us.
not_available Of course I stick with you! Thank you.
not_available These flowers are not gonna plant themselves.
not_available Such delicate skin.
not_available You have Russian color.
not_available I do? You don't like the beauty you have? The front door is open.
not_available You can leave the flowers inside.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, that is where the chest is gonna have to stay.
not_available God, that shit is heavy.
not_available You wanted to help.
not_available Oh my God, is this yours? No, that's Nate's, but he keeps leaving it in my car.
not_available I love this book! You read it? Oh, yeah, my friends and re all over this like 2 summers ago, before they turned into pretentious drama nerds and totally abandoned me.
not_available Thank God.
not_available What's your favorite part? Oh, they're too numerous to mention.
not_available Where is that part where she like stops speaking for a month and just barks at them? Brenda Brenda, I know you're angry.
not_available Can you talk to me? You know, they put me in therapy 'cause I stole that foot.
not_available Yeah, Nate told me.
not_available God, I would love to go into one of those sessions and just bark.
not_available Just to see the look on his face.
not_available Do you totally identify with this book? Of course she does.
not_available It's about her.
not_available What?!? She's Charlotte.
not_available You're shitting me! Is he for real? Completely.
not_available Oh my God! Oh my God! is like meeting Ghandi or Jesus! Don't tell me.
not_available The book spoke to you, like it was written specifically for you.
not_available Well, yeah, in a way.
not_available Have you been to the website? There's a website? Oh, yes, there's a fan club.
not_available Yeah, those lonely little girls desperate for something to emulate, because, apparently, they're not original enough to come up with anything on their own.
not_available Well, that's what I like to see.
not_available ing before sundown.
not_available Hi, I'm Billy.
not_available I'm Claire.
not_available How do you know my sister? Through my brother, Nate.
not_available They're dating.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Dating.
not_available what? Going steady? He give her his ID bracelet? She carve his initials in her arm so they'd be there forever? Yo, Bren, you should've seen me out on the ocean.
not_available All those Venice dicks, taking themselves so seriously! You surf? Me? do I look like I surf? Do I? Uh oh.
not_available You'll freeze your ass off this time of year, wearing that kind of thing.
not_available So? It's my ass.
not_available Oh, fine, you wanna get pneumonia again? Go right ahead! Claire, I should take you home.
not_available I got stuff to do.
not_available No, that's alright.
not_available I'll take her.
not_available Great.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I've got time.
not_available We just need to go right now.
not_available Well, if you have got stuff to do, don't worry about it.
not_available Yeah, do your stuff.
not_available I just have to take a shower.
not_available So, I'm walking along one day, and this asshole stops me and asks if I'm alright.
not_available He says I got a look.
not_available He'd seen a man with that same look once and had ignored it.
not_available And that man had jumped out of a 9 story window.
not_available You know the reconstruction involved in a death like that? This business gets under your skin.
not_available It's like a fucking virus.
not_available They can even see it on your face.
not_available Smell it on you.
not_available What the hell is this place? This music? Since when do you listen to The Classics Four? What the hell did you do here? Who the hell are you? So many questions.
not_available Why couldn't you ask them when I was still ALIVE?!? It's OK.
not_available I couldn't answer most of them, anyway.
not_available Unlike now.
not_available Now, I'm a fucking prophet.
not_available Right.
not_available You think I'm kidding, buddy boy? That's one of the perks of being dead.
not_available You know what happens after you're dead, and you know the meaning of life.
not_available That seems fairly useless.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Life is wasted on the living.
not_available Could have told me you were proud of me.
not_available You were never around for me to tell, which is exactly what I was proud of you for.
not_available Therein lies your catch
not_available 22.
not_available So, what's the meaning of life? Really wanna know? I don't know.
not_available Will it fuck me up if I do? Oh, David, you make such a handsome deacon.
not_available All those old stiffs.
not_available Finally, a dose of viagra to the place! Oh, I don't mean that literally.
not_available Not like you'd need it.
not_available Thank you, Tracy.
not_available So, no fiancee, huh? No, no, that's over.
not_available But she broke my heart, and I'm just not ready or interested in any sort of relationship right now.
not_available Oh, come on, any relationship? I'm just not ready, and I doubt I will be for quite some time.
not_available Well, what if Cindy Crawford were to walk up to you and say, "Just use me for sex"? I would say no.
not_available Liar.
not_available Is it so wrong to want a little human contact? You're lonely, too.
not_available I can tell.
not_available For Chrissake, Tracy, what does it take? No.
not_available Well, you don't have to be so mean about it.
not_available Apparently I do.
not_available Look, I come here to feed these people because I don't want to talk to anybody.
not_available Do us both a favor.
not_available Go to a bar.
not_available Pick somebody up.
not_available No, no, we just met.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just so turned on by you.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I have to go home.
not_available Hey, I wanna see you again.
not_available Good.
not_available But I'm not some skank for you to fuck.
not_available If that's what you're into, just go and find that somewhere else.
not_available That's not what I'm into, Claire.
not_available I swear.
not_available If you're lying, I swear to God, I will kill you.
not_available I will kick your ass.
not_available You do not want to mess with me.
not_available That ain't her.
not_available Excuse me? That ain't my wife.
not_available That ain't my Hattie What'd you do with my Hattie? Mr.
not_available Jones, with all due respect
not_available I don't want your respect.
not_available I want my wife.
not_available Sir, that is your wife.
not_available You married? Yes, sir.
not_available Is she all young and pretty and knows how to treat you right? Yes, sir.
not_available You can't believe how lucky you are, how life can be so good to you, right? She gonna turn into that.
not_available We all do.
not_available Well, don't that piss you off, boy? Not yet.
not_available He used this how long? Seven years.
not_available It's weird how you keep showing me rooms people used to live in.
not_available I just think it's so fucking weird.
not_available He'd sit in this sad, little room doing God knows what.
not_available Why does it have to be sad? Look around.
not_available I think it's fascinating.
not_available Really, why? Such a mystery, ya know? You'll neverk now what went on here.
not_available That's exactly what's driving me crazy.
not_available So what if you did know, had it all explained to you? I bet it wouldn't be nearly as interesting or fun.
not_available Your father would be a lot more boring.
not_available Enjoy this! Come on, don't you pick up on something? I thought things left marks in people, in places, in time.
not_available So, what, you think I'm a witch? You really don't get any kind of vibe from this place at all? You wanna know what I think? I think your father wanted some place that was just his and nobody else's.
not_available Nate, if you didn't know him when he was alive, you never will.
not_available I don't wanna be somebody who when I die nobody knows who I was.
not_available So don't be.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Jones? I'm sitting here, holding my dead wife's hand.
not_available How do you think I'm doing? you'll let me know if you need anything.
not_available hello.
not_available For Jones.
not_available Oh, Mr.
not_available Jones, see the beautiful flowers for your wife's viewing tomorrow? I don't know why you so excited.
not_available They're just gonna grow up and die.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available I'll see you out.
not_available I don't know what you think you're doing, but I'm going to have to ask my sons to order flowers from another florist if this behavior continues.
not_available Which behavior? This is our place of business.
not_available There are grieving people here.
not_available I can't have you skulking round with that look in your eye.
not_available What look? That sex look.
not_available Maybe you like it.
not_available Lady wear red, she means business.
not_available This is just what was clean.
not_available Lady, I can see you from here, and I'm blind and deaf.
not_available You need to get yourself laid.
not_available Time warp! I told you.
not_available Pretty cozy for a morgue.
not_available Must be weird living here.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available You ever done it with anyone in here? Yeah, right.
not_available And have my mom walk in? No.
not_available you look great.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Come on, seduce me.
not_available There ya go.
not_available Oh, yeah, there ya go.
not_available Don't pretend like you haven't done this before.
not_available You are a natural! Look at you! Look at you! No, no, don't hide, don't hide! This what you do? You shoot models and stuff? Hardly.
not_available Alright, it's on timer.
not_available Something to remember me by.
not_available Hey, what do you think about Brenda and your brother? Think they have a chance in hell? I hope so.
not_available She's pretty amazing.
not_available He'd be a real idiot to let her go.
not_available But again he's capable of being an idiot sometimes.
not_available So what is she to him? Just hot sex? I think he's really in love with her.
not_available How could he not be? Shit, I'm thirsty.
not_available You got any beer? No, sorry.
not_available It's alright.
not_available I should be heading out anyway.
not_available Oh, OK.
not_available I had fun today.
not_available Me too.
not_available Let's do this again.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, Mr.
not_available Bosun is all juiced up.
not_available I'll be in around 7 tomorrow to airbrush him.
not_available Get him ready for the viewing tomorrow.
not_available Unless, you know, you want me to do him now.
not_available I was kind of hoping to get home before Vanessa put Julio down.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Good night.
not_available Need any help? No, Federico, go home to your family.
not_available Don't work too hard.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jones? Time to go home.
not_available Who the hell are you? I'm Nate.
not_available Work here.
not_available That's my wife in that box.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available day in, day out.
not_available It's late.
not_available Maybe I should drive you home.
not_available Shut the fuck up, boy, and let an old man speak.
not_available OK.
not_available She chased me across the front yard with a steak knife once, tried to cut my ass.
not_available Then we spent close to a year apart.
not_available That time's like a hole in me now.
not_available She was the only one who ever really knew me.
not_available You know, your wife will always be with you in your memories.
not_available When you love somebody that much, they never really
not_available You sell that shit to somebody who's buyin' it cause I ain't.
not_available You don't know nothin' about love.
not_available Some pretty little thing catches your eye, and the next thing you know it's been 56 years and you've shit all over yourself in the movie theatre, and she the only one to help you clean it up.
not_available That's love.
not_available You don't know nothin'.
not_available I won't argue that.
not_available Can I get you anything to drink? I have beer, red wine, a little vodka.
not_available No, just water, thanks.
not_available I don't usually go out on a school night, but you know how it is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here ya go.
not_available My ex.
not_available We were together for nearly 2 years and then he dumped me for a 22 yearold stand
not_available in he met on location.
not_available I think that's the only picture I had of him that I didn't tear up.
not_available Funny, you know, you think you know somebody, and
not_available I hear he's in AA now.
not_available So, are you in the business? No, no, I'm a lawyer.
not_available I'm from Boston.
not_available God, how refreshing! You tend to forget sometimes living in LA that there's this world outside the entertainment industry.
not_available And that's the real world.
not_available So what do you do? Production accounting.
not_available I told you that.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's OK.
not_available So, Jim, what do you like to do? Can we sit down? Sure.
not_available Had a little too much to drink there, Jim? Are you OK? Yeah.
not_available I want to apologize for what happened yesterday.
not_available It's OK.
not_available I should never have lashed out at you like that.
not_available It's just, I don't know what's wrong with me.
not_available I was holding a saucepan the other day, and, all of a sudden, I remembered making creamed corn in that pan.
not_available Some night when it was raining outside, and both the boys had colds, and my husband was on a call, picking up a body, and then, yesterday, I was cleaning out the cabinets, and I found a jar of baby food in the very backstrained carrots
not_available from when Claire was a baby.
not_available That jar had been sitting there for over 15 years.
not_available I am surrounded by these relics of a life that no longer exists.
not_available We're here for the Jones viewing.
not_available Right this way, please.
not_available Yeah? Oh, shit, Billy, did I wake you? I'm sorry.
not_available Fuck! Who is this? It's Claire.
not_available Who? It's Claire, Nate;s sister.
not_available I just wanted to see if maybe you wanted to hang out again after school today.
not_available Not really.
not_available Come on, Claire, you're what? What do you think I am, a pedophile? Well? I don't know what you want me to say.
not_available Well, I don't want you to say anything.
not_available I just thought you should see it.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available So, great! Dad traded a room for a funeral.
not_available No wonder we never had any money.
not_available Didn't Dad ever say anything to you about this place at all? Dad and I never talked about anything but work.
not_available That's exactly the relationship you and I have.
not_available Nate, people are allowed to have private lives.
not_available So what if Dad had a secret room? I don't care.
not_available I don't care if he brought women back here to fuck.
not_available I don't care if he brought men back here to fuck.
not_available You think we should tell Mom about it? Sure, why not? You won't be happy until this whole family's in therapy.
not_available That's kind of a leap.
not_available Dave, look, I know you're pissed off about a lot of shit, but I didn't make any of that shit happen.
not_available Oh, right, I
not_available I abandoned you.
not_available Well, you know what? I'm not your father.
not_available I'm not the one whose responsibility it was not to abandon you.
not_available So just get over it, please.
not_available Life is just too fucking short.
not_available Thank you, Nate.
not_available I appreciate your honesty, wrapped as it was in such a bouquet of condescension.
not_available If I were you, I'd pack this place up before they start charging us for rent.
not_available Quite a hottie, huh? This is Mom? You have no idea how beautiful she was, buddy boy.
not_available I have no idea who you were.
not_available I wasn't really that interesting.
not_available No, I think you probably were.
not_available I think you were this great guy who was funny and weird and high.
not_available I was just always so afraid of everything you did.
not_available Death.
not_available You know, I made the decision to come back home, to become a fucking undertaker, because I thought it was something you believed in, and now I find out you think running away was the best thing I ever did? Maybe.
not_available Jesus Christ, I kept us from selling to Kroehner, and I'm taking the Funeral Director's License Test next month.
not_available Well, maybe I was just covering up for how embarrassed I was when you left.
not_available Is that why you left half the business to me? To get back at me? Maybe.
not_available Maybe I just wanted to see if you had the balls to go against me.
not_available Or maybe I really wanted you to have it.
not_available You'll never know.
not_available Goddamn it, when are you gonna stop fucking with me? When are you gonna stop caring what I thought.
not_available "I never knew my father!" Get over it! Please! Life is just too fucking short.
not_available My brother is a very complicated man and very high maintenance.
not_available And, don't get me wrong, I love him dearly, but I pity the woman he ends up with.
not_available See, that's the same thing I'd say about my brother.
not_available Nate is not even in the same league.
not_available Was I crazy? I mean, Billy was really acting like
not_available Did you fuck him? No.
not_available Well, you dodged a bullet there.
not_available Is every man alive a total asshole? At some point or another.
not_available Then, again, so are we.
not_available Come on, we've gotta go.
not_available I still cannot get over the fact that you are 
Charlotte Light &amp; Dark! Well, you have to, because it's very irritating.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jones is still downstairs.
not_available I know this silver has been in your father's family for three generations.
not_available I don't believe I've ever used it.
not_available I'm going to put an ad in the paper and see if I can sell them.
not_available Mom, I found something you should probably have.
not_available Where'd you find these? In the office, among Dad's things.
not_available Look at what a child I was! Your father was leaving for Vietnam.
not_available He'd volunteered as a medic.
not_available Your grandfather was furious! You don't remember your grandfather, do you? No.
not_available He was a very unhappy man, and he wanted everyone else to be unhappy, too.
not_available We were all living in this house.
not_available Well, you were a baby, and there was no privacy, so Nathaniel and I got a room in a motel.
not_available Some seedy place in the Valley.
not_available And we made love like maniacs.
not_available Like it was the last time.
not_available Your father took these pictures, in that damp little room.
not_available Told me he kept them in his pocket in Vietnam to protect him.
not_available It's frightening how much we change.
not_available Are you staying for dinner, dear? Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jones? Probably should think about heading home.
not_available You've got a long day ahead of you tomorrow.
not_available Funeral.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jones? Mr.
not_available Jones? Mr.
not_available Jones? Oh, shit.
