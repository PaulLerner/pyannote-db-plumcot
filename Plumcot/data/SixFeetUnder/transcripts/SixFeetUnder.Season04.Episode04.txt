
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, it's my fault.
not_available Nothing is anybody's fault.
not_available Well, good night.
not_available You're beautiful.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Oh my God, David, is that you? I'm sorry, can you hold on just a second? Hello? David? Yeah? 
not_available It's Jennifer.
not_available Hi.
not_available My father's been killed! Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
not_available How did it happen? He was struck by lightning.
not_available Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, of course we'll take care of it.
not_available David, are you okay? No, that's just You sound 
not_available Hold on, it's just it's my mouth guard, so I don't grind my teeth when I sleep.
not_available What the fuck? 
not_available Jennifer's father died.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available I hope she's married.
not_available That way I won't have to feel so guilty for wasting almost two years of her life.
not_available Every woman needs to go through falling in love with a gay man.
not_available It's a total female rite of passage.
not_available What about Claire and what'shis
not_available face? Keith, don't you ever tell her I told you about that.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Just like every gay man goes through a period where he tries to be straight.
not_available I don't think that's a requirement anymore.
not_available We were the last generation that did that.
not_available What about Claire and what'shis
not_available face? So I'm back on Celeste duty today.
not_available Another talk show? Some rehearsal for some charity tomorrow.
not_available What should I wear? Mm, uh, Helmut Lang jeans, a black tshirt, the faded Banana Republic one with the stretch, and black lace
not_available up boots.
not_available David, this is a profession, okay? There is an image to project.
not_available And that image isn't fucking Keith of Finland.
not_available Are you not out on the job? No one's ever asked.
not_available You big whore.
not_available What, it's not like I'm only defined by being gay.
not_available I'm defined by being a lot of things.
not_available Being black, being American, being Busted? You broke up with me because I was not out! Yeah, to your family.
not_available I don't expect you to come out to every person who walks through the funeral home.
not_available Nor do I expect you to come out to every client you have, whether it's Celeste or Cameron Diaz or lan fucking McKellen.
not_available But the people you work with 
not_available Calm down.
not_available I'm not the enemy.
not_available I'm your lover.
not_available Thanks, Barb, she's never been before.
not_available Seriously, you've never taken Maya to LEGOLAND? No.
not_available She was too young for it until, basically, now? I used to love to play with those blocks when I was a kid.
not_available Didn't you? Does Maya love them? Too young, small parts, choking? Oh, dear, she's still that orally fixated.
not_available Well, no wonder, she was still breast
not_available feeding when Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey! She just keeps getting bigger every day.
not_available Yeah, kids kinda do that.
not_available You got me.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available Uncle Nate? 
not_available Yeah? Could you be sure and give this to David? Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell him that it's from Michaela.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay, so we'll drop her off on Sunday around 6:00 or so.
not_available Hey, listen, you guys, thanks so much for doing this.
not_available If there's anything you ever need that l Well, yeah, we do need I guess, what, Hoyt? maybe 120.
not_available For you know, Maya's share of the hotel, and the parking, and the restaurants Stroller rental.
not_available Of course, yeah.
not_available Uh, look, could you just take her? Does Maya like to swim? Yeah, yeah, she loves it.
not_available She loves it.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Say goodbye to Daddy, honey.
not_available Hey, bye, baby girl.
not_available I love you.
not_available Have a good time.
not_available Nate, are you doing okay? Yeah, you know it comes and goes.
not_available I can appreciate the attempt, but I think it looks like something you'd see on a calendar, like in some bargain bin somewhere, like three months after the new year.
not_available Can you be a little more harsh? No, it's obviously a stylish calendar, in an upscale store Okay, so this piece is no good.
not_available Let's move on.
not_available I think the question is not so much is this piece good? I would rather we ask is this piece successful? Yeah, well, this is America, successful equals good.
not_available Successful in achieving its intention.
not_available Anita what was your intent with this piece? I don't know.
not_available I liked the way the light was hitting her head.
not_available Do we have to go into every piece knowing exactly what it means? No, but surely it ended up meaning something to you, or you wouldn't have brought it into class.
not_available Oh.
not_available I can't believe this! I thought Arthur was merely eccentric.
not_available I had no idea he was seriously disturbed.
not_available Kinda brings new meaning to the term "dump truck," huh? # You're just a legend in your own mind, aren't ya? # Stop marking it, Sammy! # You're never ever gonna be mine, are ya? # Ugh! Sloppy.
not_available You guys blow! Hey, Javier.
not_available How many of those guys you think she fucked? Man, them faggots are too busy fucking each other 
not_available to ever work her in.
not_available Right? Yo, K, what's up? You coming on the road with us next month? I'm still waiting to hear.
not_available Johnny, you suck! Jennifer, I'm so terribly sorry.
not_available David, this is my fianc√© Greg Sutton.
not_available Hi, Greg.
not_available I'm glad to meet you.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Shall we? He'd been depressed for years, ever since my mom divorced him.
not_available Well, you remember.
not_available Yes.
not_available Will your mother be coming to the funeral? No, she's in a nursing home.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available She's so young.
not_available Honey, I don't mean to rush you, but I've gotta be back on the site by noon at the latest.
not_available So what's going on tour like? All right, the thing about Celeste every concert's packed with teenage girls fucking horny out of their minds.
not_available You know what I'm saying? You better make sure you're checking I.D.
not_available s or you'll find your ass in jail.
not_available Naw, you just got to make sure you don't videotape nothing.
not_available What, you married? No, not married, but we live together.
not_available Don't do it.
not_available I'm on number three, and I can't seem to fucking learn.
not_available I don't want to play myself.
not_available I wanna play someone ugly or fat.
not_available Something that'll show I can be a serious actress.
not_available Hey, you mind if I ask you a personal question? If I do, I won't answer it.
not_available How many times a week do you get your pole wet? What? I'm curious.
not_available It averages out, I guess, to about five or six times a week.
not_available Damn.
not_available You don't need to go on tour.
not_available What about you? Once.
not_available Twice if I'm lucky or if I buy her something.
not_available That's not good.
not_available That is so motherfuckin' not good.
not_available See if you can at least get some free clothes out of it.
not_available These two great black balls of male erotic fury go to explode on one another.
not_available That's when everything started.
not_available From those cave paintings, that was the creation of the idea of "image," of the representation of ourselves.
not_available Exactly, and that's when we stopped living inside nature, and started living inside our heads.
not_available Yeah, which is why we can just sit back and watch while greedy corporate Bush
not_available suckers destroy nature, since we're no longer a part of it.
not_available If you take humans out of nature, then all that you're left with is human nature.
not_available Okay, that sounds really good, but what the fuck does that mean? Oh, Olivier! That's no doubt his new assistant.
not_available I heard you fucked him.
not_available No! I did not fuck him.
not_available So why did you have to be so mean during my crit, you bitch? Or was that just the new Claire Fisher? There's a new Claire Fisher? What was wrong with the old one? She just waited around for the world to happen to her.
not_available Hey, Jimmy.
not_available What the fuck?! Oh, God, I sorry.
not_available I thought that was going to be like a charming moment, 
not_available but now you want to kill me.
not_available No way.
not_available What good would my life be without you? Oh shut up.
not_available So, Claire Fisher.
not_available Yes, Jimmy.
not_available I'm not exactly sure I know what your last name is.
not_available I would love to hang out with you.
not_available Say when.
not_available Okay, you are verging dangerously close on being smarmy.
not_available You still haven't answered my question.
not_available I could come over tomorrow afternoon, but I have to be home by 7:00 at the latest.
not_available No! That's hardly any time with you at all! And Nicole misses you.
not_available Well, I miss Nicole too, but I have kids of my own, Sophia.
not_available Federico, did Arthur leave some sort of forwarding address? Uh, no, I don't think so.
not_available Vanessa, I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, sweetie? Vanessa? Oh no, he didn't.
not_available He's engaged in a campaign of harassment against this family! Ruth, I wish you'd let this go.
not_available I have no intention of letting it go.
not_available I have a good mind to get the authorities involved.
not_available That's never a good idea.
not_available What have you got here? Male, 60s, struck by lightning.
not_available Oh.
not_available What exactly happens to a person when they get struck by lightning? Well, cardiac arrest is what kills 'em, but their insides get fried wherever the current goes.
not_available Which in this case, was his right arm and left leg, hence the separate embalming.
not_available So he becomes sort of a human fulgurite, as it were.
not_available Federico, I need to get in touch with Arthur! Surely there's some way of tracing him.
not_available Ruth, calm down! Fine.
not_available I'll just resign myself to receiving excrement in the mail for the rest of my days on this earth.
not_available You little shit! I'm starting to lose patience with all your "sensitive man" bullshit.
not_available You're not sensitive.
not_available You're a fucking eunuch.
not_available A castrato.
not_available Castrato, I like that.
not_available You little shit, you don't make jokes! You take this seriously.
not_available I'd flip you over and spank your candy ass till it bled if I didn't think you'd like it so much.
not_available I won't, I promise I won't like it.
not_available Nice try.
not_available Huh.
not_available I wonder who that is.
not_available Hey, shut the door.
not_available What, you don't want somebody to see you all tied up like this? Too bad, because I want the whole world to see what a twisted sister you are.
not_available Freak.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I thought you might be up for grabbing a movie or a bite or something? Oh.
not_available Maya's with her Aunt Barb.
not_available They went to LEGOLAND.
not_available I'm going kinda stir
not_available crazy.
not_available I just need to be with somebody, I think.
not_available I just ordered out for pizza.
not_available That's who I thought you were, the pizza guy.
not_available I like pizza.
not_available Um 
not_available Bad timing.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Well, I guess I should have called.
not_available No, Nate stay.
not_available You can meet him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just give me a few minutes.
not_available I just don't know if he's the right guy for her.
not_available At least he has sex with her.
not_available I had sex with her.
not_available Right, you're the stud because you've had sex with more women than I have.
not_available Wow, you're like, almost heterosexual.
not_available What's up with you? I don't know.
not_available It's weird at work.
not_available I feel like Sarah Jane from "lmitation of Life." That makes me Troy Donahue.
not_available Okay, this fits.
not_available But there's this side of me that feels all puffed up because everybody thinks I'm straight.
not_available It's like I feel like I'm How fucked up is that? In a culture that consistently puffs up men for being straight? Not very.
not_available But, Keith, you have to come out.
not_available David, that's my decision.
not_available You are the last person I ever expected to turn into a self
not_available loathing homo.
not_available Wait, I'll get that.
not_available Keith Charles.
not_available Duane, what up? I know Two venti soy lattes.
not_available Yeah, later.
not_available Bitch.
not_available Just because I'm the new guy, I'm their fucking waitress? Now I can't answer the phone in my own house? No, don't be silly.
not_available I'll just make sure they always call me on my cell.
not_available David, look if they take me on tour, I can make 100 fucking bucks an hour, okay? And that's for us! Hi, you've reached David and Keith, but we can't come to the phone right now because we're too gay.
not_available So after watching this thing, like, 100 times I decide I'm gonna do the scarecrow for her.
not_available So I'm dancing around, doing the thing and throwing myself around like a ragdoll and she's laughing her head off.
not_available The next thing I know she starts doing the same thing.
not_available She's throwing herself around and I can just see her cracking her head open on the edge of a coffee table or something, and that's how you go from feeling like you're Super Dad to the village fucking idiot.
not_available Parenthood is just such a huge fucking responsibility.
not_available Aren't you ever, you know, terrified? Yeah, but I just remind myself that some things in my life I just don't have any power over, and I never will.
not_available You know, because fear is no good.
not_available Fear can take over your life.
not_available I still feel like Lisa's around pushing me to move on, wants me to But you can't.
not_available You can't rush it.
not_available Uh, I should go.
not_available Oh.
not_available Nice to meet you, Joe.
not_available Yeah, you too.
not_available Take care.
not_available Are you all right to drive? 
not_available Yeah yeah.
not_available I can't believe I was the only one drinking.
not_available You guys make me feel like such a lowlife.
not_available Well, be good to yourself.
not_available Yeah, okay, I will.
not_available That guy is seriously wounded.
not_available I want to put one of those lampshades around his head, you know, like they put on dogs so they don't chew their stitches.
not_available I know.
not_available I felt like I couldn't turn him away.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No no no no, I love having your ex
not_available boyfriend invited in when I'm trussed up in the other room like a Christmas ham.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's hot.
not_available Really? That's very hot.
not_available Hey, buddy.
not_available Well, hello.
not_available Whatcha doin'? So long.
not_available What is it? Hey, buddy boy.
not_available What's up, huh? How ya doin', huh? What are you doing, huh? Lisa? Uh
not_available oh, incoming.
not_available Is Celeste in there? 
not_available Who wants to know? Nancy Freymire.
not_available I'm chairwoman of this event.
not_available Please, stand back from the door.
not_available Hi, Celeste, I'm 
not_available We have a problem.
not_available I know.
not_available That's why I'm here 
not_available I bring my own hair and makeup people.
not_available It's in my contract.
not_available Yes, but we were unaware that there would be a $3,000 fee Hey, these people work hard.
not_available We're actually trying to raise money for people with anticoagulative blood disorders.
not_available Right, and that's why I'm here for free.
not_available I'm totally committed to this.
not_available Lucien and Phyllis, however, are not as rich as I am and therefore, cannot afford to work for free.
not_available Perhaps a more reasonable This problem needs to be resolved before I go on stage, all right? Otherwise, I don't.
not_available Fine, but might I just say I think you're a gigantic bitch, and I will no longer allow my daughters to listen to your music? I'm sorry.
not_available You're either trying to weasel out of what you agreed to, or were too stupid to even read it, and I'm the bitch? Trollop.
not_available Jesus, some people are tense.
not_available Keith? 
not_available That's right.
not_available You peed in my john.
not_available I did, and I apologize.
not_available I used to be a cop.
not_available I'm kinda new to this.
not_available I'm a little weird about my bathroom.
not_available What the hell is so funny? Sorry, I can't hear you you got your head so far up Celeste's ass.
not_available It is not! Tsk.
not_available Good boy.
not_available I've been expecting you.
not_available I have many messages for you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah? What's my name? They don't tell me your name, just that you've lost a lot, and that your heart has been broken.
not_available Yeah, who's "they"? An older man who watches over you, your father? Your grandfather? He was very unhappy in life.
not_available The other one is a woman, I think.
not_available I can't be sure.
not_available Sit! Ahhhh.
not_available You have a lot to work out in this life.
not_available Too much for one life.
not_available You will have many lives.
not_available Right.
not_available Listen, I think I oughta go, no offense.
not_available I just think this is a huge ball of crap, so She's not gone.
not_available She's trying to get to you.
not_available She just doesn't know how.
not_available She's Who is? I see a woman.
not_available I see water.
not_available She thinks you stopped loving her.
not_available But I only started loving her I wanted to love her the way she deserved to be loved.
not_available You still can.
not_available She's dead.
not_available She isn't dead.
not_available She's trying to get back to you.
not_available She loves you.
not_available I don't know what to say to you.
not_available Well, just What can I do? 
not_available You're completely embarrassing me.
not_available If you could even try to understand what I'm going through I am trying, but it's never enough! My older brother dies when I'm 10, my mother develops Alzheimer's really early, the love of my life turns out to be gay, and my dad gets struck by lightning.
not_available Why did all this happen to me? I don't know.
not_available But I do know that you Don't you fucking take my hand.
not_available Are you serious? You fucking broke my heart and stomped on it.
not_available And I was such a fucking idiot, I went out of my way to make it easier for you?! Because you wanted to suck cock! I was so fucking in love with you, you fucking sadist! You make me sick! I hate that you're gay.
not_available I fucking hate it.
not_available You don't hate that I'm gay.
not_available You hate that I lied to you.
not_available You should hate that.
not_available I lied to myself too.
not_available Are you sure you like it? How could I not like the first piece of furniture we purchased together as a couple? lt'll be nice to have a place to display my rock collection.
not_available I spoke to a lawyer today about pressing charges against Arthur.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Look, Ruth, Arthur never sent us any excrement.
not_available Then who did? 
not_available My son.
not_available That toy truck was something I bought him.
not_available It's the only thing I ever bought him actually, before he was even born.
not_available Brian? 
not_available Kyle.
not_available I thought your son's name was Brian.
not_available I have another son.
not_available Why have you never told me this? Because he's never really been part of my life.
not_available If he's sending us shit in the mail, 
not_available he's a part of your life.
not_available No, he isn't.
not_available I was very young.
not_available His mother and I never even married.
not_available Her family didn't think I was suitable.
not_available So you just left? 
not_available He wasn't born yet.
not_available I was very young.
not_available Nobody wanted me to be a part of his life.
not_available Are there other wives you've neglected to tell me about? No! Of course not.
not_available Art is just a sentimental construct to alleviate our fear of death.
not_available No, there's no way to even determine what it is that makes art art, much less to teach it.
not_available It's a goddamn illusion that anyone can be taught anything.
not_available I mean, yes, we can all be conditioned up the wazoo, but to really learn something, something important? That always comes from within.
not_available The cunt has spoken.
not_available Now the world sits in silence.
not_available So, why do you teach art then? Why? Because I need the goddamn paycheck.
not_available No, you don't, baby.
not_available Bern left me very well taken care of.
not_available All you have to do is just keep making paintings and I'll keep buying them.
not_available Did you know Olivier taught my son? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm hot for teacher.
not_available Drink more, Mom.
not_available Oh, darling, don't you want to try the Shiraz? It's delicious.
not_available No, I'm good.
not_available I read in the paper about a student who allowed some corporation to tattoo its logo on his forehead, and in exchange they paid for his education.
not_available What the hell is that? I imagine it's an education for someone who wouldn't normally be able to pay for it himself.
not_available It's way more than that.
not_available My students are all in such a mad rush to become commodities.
not_available But that's always been true of artists.
not_available Where is your bathroom? Straight through there, to the left.
not_available It's him! He's the one.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available He's the one! You're drunk.
not_available Now, isn't it nice to have someone who's not only great in bed, but who's also your intellectual equal? Just don't fuck it up this time, like you always do.
not_available Hmm.
not_available What if she's really not dead?! 
not_available Nate, they identified her teeth.
not_available Yeah, I know they did.
not_available But what if, by some amazing coincidence, there's somebody out there who had the exact same work done to their lower jaw as Lisa? I suppose that could be possible, but I really think the chances are pretty remote.
not_available But it could be possible, right? Are you high? 
not_available No, I'm not, not anymore.
not_available Maybe you should just, like, stay in tonight and try to chill out.
not_available Okay? I've to go.
not_available I've got a date with the Matthew Barney of LAC Arts.
not_available Even though I'm so not the Bjork of LAC Arts.
not_available All the chicks are hatched and fluffy now.
not_available Listen to them cheep cheep cheep.
not_available Cheep cheep cheep cheep.
not_available Make the chick sound, cheep cheep cheep.
not_available Hi, baby, I made some Asopao.
not_available Are you hungry? Oh, damn.
not_available I had a sandwich at work.
not_available Where are the kids? Gusto's in bed, Julio's spending the night over at Charlie's house.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I love you, Vanessa.
not_available I know that.
not_available Tell me what you'd like.
not_available I like you.
not_available No, tell me what you like me to do.
not_available Uh, just do whatever you want, and I'll let you know how it works out for me.
not_available Why won't you tell me? Look, I don't have, like, a checklist I need to go through.
not_available Do you like to have your nipples played with? Not if we have to talk about it! How else am I supposed to know what to do here, Claire? Are you telling me you don't? Okay, maybe we should just go to the movie.
not_available Maybe I should just go home.
not_available All right.
not_available You're never gonna learn anything, sweetie.
not_available Not in that program.
not_available How could you possibly learn about counseling in 18 months? Well, after a lifetime of learning how not to do things, maybe I'm a little ahead of the game.
not_available I just still can't believe you're planning on becoming a shrink.
not_available The irony.
not_available It's superb.
not_available The real irony is that shrinks are who we hire to straighten out our lives, but invariably, they're the ones who are the most fucked up.
not_available I mean, twisted.
not_available Demonic.
not_available Ooh.
not_available Well, then it makes absolute sense that Brenda would become one.
not_available Oh, honey, come on now.
not_available You're never gonna be a good shrink without a sense of humor.
not_available Do you think you're a good shrink? I think I'm a very good shrink.
not_available Does that mean you're very fucked up? Absofucking
not_available lutely.
not_available Mm, you have no idea.
not_available Darling, do you ever hear from Nate? Yeah, actually, we saw him last night.
not_available He's still grieving.
not_available Oh, he showed us pictures of his daughter.
not_available Oh my God, she's so beautiful.
not_available Those eyes, so open and trusting.
not_available It's mind
not_available boggling to think that we were all like that once.
not_available I get it! Now this makes sense.
not_available You want a baby! Where did that come from? You are getting a little long in the tooth, you know.
not_available This would be the time.
not_available Aw, Brenda's feeling eggy.
not_available Okay, well, it's time for us to go.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Nice meeting you, Jim.
not_available I hope you're up for the challenge of my daughter.
not_available I am.
not_available I am.
not_available It's Joe, not Jim.
not_available Bye, see you in a few years.
not_available Terrible evening.
not_available What? What time is it? Time for you to stop keeping things from me! Oh, Ruth.
not_available It sounds absurd when you talk like that.
not_available Okay.
not_available I was just a grad student, and I accidentally knocked up a young woman from a very wealthy family.
not_available I offered to marry her.
not_available Her family was dead set against it, so I signed something, and we both went on with our lives.
not_available What was I supposed to do? You've never even seen this child? Oh yeah, I've seen him.
not_available He tracked me down a couple of years ago.
not_available He was living in some motel over in Burbank.
not_available And? I didn't particularly care for him.
not_available As a matter of fact, I found him very unpleasant.
not_available And I assumed he never wanted to see me again.
not_available Why?! Because he said, "I don't ever want to see you again." Where are you going? I'm going to the bathroom.
not_available George, how can you I just don't see how I feel like I don't know you at all.
not_available Ruth, please.
not_available Don't blow this all out of proportion.
not_available It's not good for either one of us.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Hello? Nate? Barb? 
not_available It's Lisa.
not_available Where are you? I don't know.
not_available They won't tell me.
not_available Well, who won't tell you? Nate, the number three is not important.
not_available Wait, what? You buried me.
not_available How could you bury me? I thought that's what you wanted.
not_available But I'm not dead.
not_available I don't think it's healthy, being so disconnected from your own son.
not_available That's why I called him this morning, and told him to be expecting us shortly past noon.
not_available I'm lucky his number was in you address book You looked in address book without asking me? Ruth! 
not_available This is important to me, George.
not_available I do not ask you for many things.
not_available All right.
not_available You look terrible.
not_available I feel terrible.
not_available I'm worried about you.
not_available You're not taking very good care of yourself.
not_available I'm doing the best I can, Mom.
not_available You pointing out the ways I'm failing doesn't necessarily help.
not_available I'll be waiting for you in the car.
not_available Nate, can I ask you something? Now may not be the best time, George.
not_available Has your mother always been so anxious about everything? Pretty much.
not_available She's gotten a lot better since you two got married.
not_available How'd you deal with her? I moved away when I was 17.
not_available For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
not_available For if we live, we live unto the Lord.
not_available And if we die, we die unto the Lord.
not_available Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.
not_available Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord.
not_available Even so sayeth the spirit, for they rest from their labors.
not_available What?! That's not a very nice way to answer the phone.
not_available This is starting to get weird, okay? You are not my wife.
not_available I know that.
not_available And I do not want you calling me all the time.
not_available You got that? Of course, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't think that I I don't ever wanna be a problem for you.
not_available George, I have a question for you, and I want you to answer me honestly.
not_available Ruth, I get the feeling you think I haven't been honest with you, but I always have.
not_available I just don't want to burden you with things that don't matter, that's all.
not_available That's what I would want from you.
not_available What did you want to ask me? I have no idea.
not_available We just wanted to thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available Seriously, man, thanks.
not_available Jen told me how she unleashed on you.
not_available I think she really needed to do that.
not_available She's been doing it to me, mostly.
not_available Which was just making it harder for him to be there for me.
not_available Yes, that's a scenario I'm familiar with.
not_available The funeral was awesome.
not_available I think the old guy would have really liked it.
not_available Okay, I'll go get the car.
not_available Okay, thanks, hon.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I said some pretty terrible things about you.
not_available Most of which were true.
not_available No, David.
not_available I know it was hard for you too, probably even harder than it was for me.
not_available You're doing it again.
not_available Making it easy for me.
not_available Some things never change.
not_available Yeah, well, some things need to.
not_available So why didn't you just tell him what you wanted? Um, because there was absolutely no way.
not_available I mean, it would just be too ew.
not_available Seriously, you would do that? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Otherwise they'll never figure it out for themselves, no matter how much porn star screaming I do.
not_available I just wish they knew how to do it on their own.
not_available It's so embarrassing.
not_available Well, that's why girls are better.
not_available They know.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I love you, but I'm not into eating pussy, okay? I tried it once.
not_available It was, eh, not for me.
not_available So I'll just have to keep telling stupid guys point blank, 
not_available lick my clit while you finger me.
not_available Oh my God! But, okay, last year, I went out with this guy Phil.
not_available He was so hot, and he was like so totally into sex, I mean, we were always fucking, I mean, like always.
not_available But every time he would, you know, go down on me, it was like there was this unspoken time limit.
not_available Like I knew that just when it was starting to get good for me, he was gonna look up at me with these lobster eyes, like, "Can I come up now?" So what makes you come? I don't know.
not_available The usual stuff.
not_available Why are we talking about this? Maybe you've never had an orgasm.
not_available Of course I've had an orgasm.
not_available Because if you had, you wouldn't be embarrassed about asking for more tongue time.
not_available Could I have really never had an orgasm? I've definitely felt a surge of desire.
not_available And then you know a sort of relief of that desire.
not_available Oh my God, Claire.
not_available Have you never even rubbed one out? You don't masturbate? 
not_available I don't find it that interesting! You know, Claire, we could show you how to give yourself an orgasm right now if you want.
not_available Um, hello, not lesbians.
not_available I really don't think it's possible that I've never had an orgasm.
not_available Well, if you haven't, you're seriously missing out.
not_available I'd like to say George has told me a lot about you, but he really hasn't told me anything at all.
not_available That's because he doesn't know anything about me.
not_available I know you hate me, and you seem to blame me for everything you don't like about your life.
not_available Why is he here? Oh, this was your idea.
not_available Well 
not_available Of course it was her idea.
not_available You made it perfectly clear you never wanted to see me again.
not_available I didn't! Thanks.
not_available Kyle, look, we can't change the past.
not_available But maybe we can start fresh, if you're willing You know what you can't do.
not_available You can't walk in here and start saying this is this, and that is that, like you're God! Because you know what? You're not God.
not_available You're not even close.
not_available I want all deliveries of excrement to our house to cease! Yeah, well, I want there to be world peace, but I don't see that happening either.
not_available Why the hell are you so angry at me? It's your mother you should be angry at and your grandparents.
not_available What is it, you find my shit offensive? No.
not_available I find it childish and hostile.
not_available And I'm completely baffled at the timing.
not_available I mean, why now? Because my therapist says I need to express my true feelings to you.
not_available This is a goddamn waste of time.
not_available George, please.
not_available Are you all right, Kyle? Do you need anything? 
not_available Like what? I don't know.
not_available Clothing, underwear, socks? No.
not_available Would you like a cappuccino from my $7500 espresso machine, which I bought so I would never have to leave this motel room, because I'm so fucking twisted thanks to youknow
not_available who? Thank you, yes, I'd love a cappuccino.
not_available I was kidding.
not_available I don't even know how to work it yet.
not_available Well, we could all go to Starbucks.
not_available I feel so "Sharon Stone." Do people still do these things when they've had kids? Yeah, some people do, and some people don't.
not_available I once walked in on my parents.
not_available My father was rubbing a rolling pin over my mother's breasts.
not_available Is that something you'd like for me to do for you? Uh, no, thank you.
not_available But I mean, that fucked me up more than if they'd just been fucking in front of us.
not_available Which they also did, by the way.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That was fun.
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available Kyle deliberately spilled his frappuccino all over me.
not_available No, it was just that he was so nervous being out in the world.
not_available Oh, my heart goes out to him.
not_available He lives in a motel! Only because he's too damn lazy to change his own sheets.
not_available Ruth, his mother's family comes from major money, old, old money.
not_available He doesn't need us.
not_available Children need more from their parents than money! It's unfortunate that I was cut out of his life, but the fact remains I was cut out of his life.
not_available And that's not gonna change.
not_available He seemed so lonely.
not_available Maybe we should invite him to dinner.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Why not? Hey, how was the funeral? It was "Awesome.
not_available The old guy would have liked it." Mmm, what's this? That? That's The Rock.
not_available I would definitely tap that ass.
not_available I'm still not out at work.
not_available Yeah, so? I thought you were kinda pushing me to come out.
not_available I don't care about that anymore.
not_available It's boring.
not_available And I'd rather not fight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you have fun? Huh, did you have fun? She had a blast.
not_available I can really see Lisa in her, Nate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Listen, Barb, I need to tell you something.
not_available I, uh I went to a psychic.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Was that helpful? She said Lisa's still alive.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available What's wrong with you, Nate? Do you need help? Because if you do, you should get it and not from a fucking psychic.
not_available I want to have kids too.
not_available Or just one or, uh, or several.
not_available And I want to have them it with you.
not_available I mean, I never really saw myself as, or I never really thought it was possible, but somehow ever since we've met everything seems
