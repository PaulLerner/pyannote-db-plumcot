not_available Do you like this place ? Yeah.
not_available It's lovely.
not_available But ? You can tell me.
not_available You're not going to hurt my feelings.
not_available I just kind of feel like Nancy Reagan might walk in And sit at the next table.
not_available Yeah, I think we've stumbled upon a republican nest.
not_available I believe it's called an enclave.
not_available No no, Like vampires, a nest.
not_available Here they are, safe in their fancy restaurant bubble while that stupid,evil war goes on and on.
not_available Stupid, Evil, I don't think so.
not_available Right.
not_available We eliminated a murdering asshole dictator.
not_available And now we're establishing democracy which, of course, takes time.
not_available But we have to stabilize the middle east.
not_available The war was inevitable.
not_available You're not serious.
not_available Of course I'm serious.
not_available Ma'am.
not_available Ma'am ? Will you complete this, please ? Physicaltherapy to five west.
not_available Physical therapy to five west.
not_available I don't know if he had a colonoscopy Or what his paternal grandmother died of.
not_available I don't.
not_available I don't know the answers to anything.
not_available How about his insurance provider ? I don't know.
not_available Do you have his wallet ? I don't know.
not_available Maybe it's in his jacket.
not_available Is that his jacket ? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available You don't think they wanted a free eltion ? Did you see those pictures ? They were dancing in the streets, 
not_available Literally.
not_available That doesn't mean they wanted to be invaded and slaughtered.
not_available I saw the pictures from Abu Ghraib, too, and nobody was fucking dancing there.
not_available That was an isolated group of disturbed individuals.
not_available Don't give me that.
not_available Those orders came down from the top.
not_available The top ! There's memos to prove it.
not_available Wow ! The world is corrupt.
not_available How can that be ? Freedom isn't free.
not_available Oh, god ! What are you ? Some redneck blogger pig ? Come on.
not_available Name one right, one civil liberty, That doesn't have blood all over it, that people haven't fought and died for.
not_available We didn't go to war to protect iraqi civil liberties.
not_available That's just a lame justification.
not_available I didn't say it was just.
not_available But that's the way human beings make progress.
not_available We're violent.
not_available It's our nature.
not_available It's a little naive to expect anything different.
not_available So you just rationalized away all moral responsibility.
not_available I guess you learned that in law school.
not_available What ? oh, no.
not_available He's stable for the moment.
not_available Is he conscious ? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available I called his specialist, Dr.
not_available Dipaolo, 
not_available But he's out of town.
not_available That's all right.
not_available His records are coming over and we're going to get him in for a cat scan right away.
not_available Okay, that's good.
not_available that's good He's been completely asymptomatic for two yeaars For two years, since the embolization ? 
not_available As far as I know.
not_available And immediately prior, any nausea or pain ? He said something about his arm.
not_available Has there been any recent physical or mental stress ? Yeah, actually, I think he's been under a lot of stress.
not_available But nothing physical ? Except Before he fell, there was Physical activity.
not_available All right.
not_available Well, would you characterize it As extreme exertion ? No.
not_available No, but There was a climax.
not_available Okay.

not_available Let's talk a little.
not_available We're talking.
not_available You know what I'd like ? What ? I'd like to see life clearly, But that's the first thing to fly out the window when I get romantic.
not_available I wonder if there's a way to do it where that doesn't happen.

not_available We already argued about this.
not_available I don't want to go through it again.
not_available You're not supposed to love someone who cheats on you.
not_available It's stupid.

not_available I fuckin' refuse.
not_available It will never happen again.

not_available We just didn't get it.

not_available I didn't know I'd feel like this, like a lioness with my cubs.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hoffman 308.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hoffman, call 308.
not_available Then there are days I want to kill them.
not_available Well, that's part of the fun.
not_available Is he okay ? 
not_available Was it the avm ? Let me tell you everything I know up front, And then I'll try to answer your questions.
not_available He developed a new avm.
not_available That's what ruptured and caused some herniation and swelling in the brain.
not_available We did manage to stop the bleeding and to relieve the cranial pressure But there were some problems With his heart rate and his breathing.
not_available What does that mean ? 
not_available He's in a coma.
not_available There may be some long
not_available term effects from everything that's happened.
not_available We won't know for certain until he wakes up, and we don't know when he will.
not_available Jesus.
not_available So he could be in a coma for ? 
not_available Days, weeks.
not_available What kind of long
not_available term effects ? Loss of vision, memory, Impairment of speech, movement.
not_available But you can learn how to speak and walk again.
not_available My grandfather had a stroke, and he did.
not_available That's right.
not_available That can happen.
not_available But, like I said, we are not going to know anything until he's conscious.
not_available We really need to see him as soon as possible.
not_available Once he's out of recovery.
not_available If all goes well, We'll transfer him to the neuro stepdown unit in the morning, but let's just get him through the night first, okay ? 
not_available Hold good thoughts.
not_available Thank you, dr.
not_available Fraker.
not_available Thank you for the worst fucking news I ever heard.
not_available He's alive.
not_available That's something.
not_available Did you sleep with her ? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're so fucking predictable.
not_available It wasn't about the sex.
not_available Oh, right, you fucked her because 
not_available of silence and meaning and god.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not because we're having a hard time and you need an illusion to stick your dick in.
not_available We're always having a hard time.
not_available There's all this pain and anger and struggle here.
not_available I used to think it was passion, but it's just drama.
not_available You came to me.
not_available I had my own fucking life Before you turned up on the doorstep, bleeding and crazy.
not_available Remember ? 
not_available I remember.
not_available We have to face the truth.
not_available We don't fit.
not_available We never have.
not_available We weren't meant to be.
not_available "Meant to be" ? What quaker bullshit.
not_available You think you and Maggie are meant to be After you slept with her, what, once ? What are you, 15 ? 
not_available No, I'm 40 years old.
not_available And I see that there can be peace between a man and a woman, 
not_available And that's what I want.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go for it.
not_available I'm certainly not going to beg you to stay.
not_available But you might want to ask yourself, "What kind of person am I ?" What kind of man betrays his pregnant wife and leaves her ? It's better this way.
not_available You know it is.
not_available Nate.
not_available Nurse, he's awake.
not_available Nate.
not_available I'll go get the doctor.
not_available Nate.
not_available Nate.
not_available Do you know who I am ? Brenda.
not_available You had a cerebral hemorrhage.
not_available We thought you might be in a coma for months, but here you are.
not_available What's wrong with my arm and my leg ? Well, they said you might have problems just for awhile.
not_available Maya ? 
not_available She's with my mother.
not_available It was an emergency.
not_available You were with Maggie.
not_available Do you remember that ? Yeah.
not_available You're going to have to step out, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available We're going to run some tests.
not_available How long will that take ? 
not_available A little while.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available I'm going to go tell everybody you're awake.
not_available Chuck, get back in that bed.
not_available Brenda ? I think it's very childish that you're not speaking to me, Hiram.
not_available But suit yourself.
not_available I don't want to say something I'll regret.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What's one more regret ? I'm full of them.
not_available All right.
not_available I think it was rude and selfish of you To leave the tent last night.
not_available You're not mad at me for leaving the tent.
not_available You're mad at me for not having sex.
not_available Well, yes.
not_available You were the one that came into the salon.
not_available Then you seduced me with the promise of aperitifs.
not_available Then it was your idea to go camping.
not_available You led me on, then pushed me away.
not_available I feel rejected and humiliated.
not_available I didn't mean to lead you on.
not_available I wanted to want to have sex in the tent, But when it came down to it, I couldn't.
not_available Couldn't or wouldn't ? What do you want me to do ? Just lie there while you do whatever ? I am not a receptacle.
not_available There are other things you could have done, but you didn't even offer.
not_available Do you mean oral ? 
not_available Yes, or a hand job.
not_available Hiram, a woman has to be in the mood To do that stuff, or it's just no good.
not_available I'm a sensitive man, but, you know, I have needs.
not_available Your needs are not my responsibility ! Where are you going ? You can't survive out here on your own.
not_available You have no wilderness skills.
not_available Oh, go give yourself a hand job ! 
not_available Where's dr.
not_available Fraker ? 
not_available She went home.
not_available I'm her associate.
not_available I'm following Nate at the moment.
not_available We can talk, or you could wait to talk 
not_available No, no more waiting.
not_available Okay, what nate had was called an arterial venous malformation.
not_available We know.
not_available He had one before.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Here it is.
not_available What happened this time is this avm ruptured, Causing herniation and bleeding.
not_available We know.
not_available We've been here all night.
not_available So you know the operation went well and he was in a coma briefly ? 
not_available Yes, we know.
not_available How is he now ? His vitals are stable, and everything looks good, Except for a weakness on your right side, Nate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What about physical therapy ? We'll start as soon as he's up to it.
not_available When do you think he might be able to leave the hospital ? A week or two, if he continues to improve.
not_available That's not long.
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you okay ? I am now.
not_available Really ? You put up a great fight.
