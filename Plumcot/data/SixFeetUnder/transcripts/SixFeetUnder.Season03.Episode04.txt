
not_available Let me see what Now you know, Mother.
not_available I'm a gypsy.
not_available I'm in the road company of 42nd Street.
not_available And my feet are gigantic.
not_available You hit him with the shoes, didn't you? 
not_available Well, duh, bitch.
not_available That's how he got those half
not_available moon marks on his forehead and hands.
not_available What about those cigarette burns on his ass? 
not_available Answer me.
not_available Mommy, you need to go on Prozac.
not_available And fast.
not_available What else could I do? Flog him with those braids? 
not_available But it was his fault.
not_available If he gave me the medal like I told him to, I wouldn't have hit him.
not_available That still doesn't explain why you fucked him.
not_available All right, now.
not_available We'll start at the beginning.
not_available You're going to tell me the truth.
not_available I know you killed him, so there's no sense lying.
not_available Rhoda, tell me the truth.
not_available The truth? You're too old to be my mommy.
not_available Socialism is a better system.
not_available You're a man.
not_available How can I be a man when my girdle hurts this much? Ask Charles Pierce.
not_available I found him there and I told him I'd hit him with my shoe if he didn't give me the medal.
not_available Mommy, please say you won't let them hurt me.
not_available Honey, you just killed 'em all anyway.
not_available I don't know what must be done now, but I promise you nobody will hurt you.
not_available I want to play the way we used to, Mommy.
not_available Will you play with me? Not unless you pay me first, you little freak.
not_available If I give you a basket of kisses.
not_available No discounts for family.
not_available Please.
not_available Lise, you awake? Can you run by Whole Foods and pick up six MahiMahi filets for tomorrow? Six? 
not_available I'm making dinner for your mom's birthday.
not_available I told you not to do that.
not_available Doesn't mean you don't want me to do it.
not_available Maybe your mother likes people to go out of their way for her birthday, but, trust me, my mother never wants us to do anything for hers and we never do.
not_available So far that has worked out great for everyone.
not_available Do you think she'd like Sarah McLachlan? It's a party.
not_available We have to have music.
not_available Play whatever you want.
not_available Just don't run to me when it blows up in your face.
not_available Nothing's gonna blow up in my face.
not_available This is important.
not_available I wanna do something for your mom.
not_available Now with us living here and all.
not_available OK.
not_available Just keep your expectations low, that's all I'm saying.
not_available Companies were forced to restrict how they market cigarettes Lisa called.
not_available She wants us to come over for dinner tomorrow.
not_available I thought it was our turn to invite them.
not_available She's throwing a birthday party for your mom.
not_available Who does she think she is? My mother does not like anything for her birthday.
not_available Your mom deserves a party.
not_available You want to go? What else are we gonna do? Stay home and watch porn? Which reminds me, you gotta return The Gaytrix to Video West.
not_available Somebody wanna tell me why I should give a rat's ass what's in Salma Hayek's purse? 
not_available You're something else, Fisher.
not_available I'm sorry? It's your fucking birthday and you spend it at the dentist's? I can't just ignore my oral hygiene.
not_available And there's going to be a party tomorrow night.
not_available You bet there's gonna be a party, even if I have to spike the punch with LSD.
not_available Bettina, don't, please.
not_available Speaking of LSD, your sister called me last night.
not_available How is she? She won't return my calls.
not_available She's become best friends with someone very famous, but she won't tell me who.
not_available All she'll say is it's somebody who fucked Michael Douglas.
not_available OK.
not_available This is not what I had in mind when I said I'd spend the day with you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available My friend had an appointment to get her teeth cleaned at 11 o'clock.
not_available It's almost noon.
not_available Our technician is running a little late today.
not_available How much longer do you think? 
not_available I can't really say.
not_available You can't, huh? 
not_available No.
not_available You're just gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Patty.
not_available Hi, Patty.
not_available I'm Bettina.
not_available I have another question for you, Patty.
not_available Yes? 
not_available I can understand our having to wait.
not_available What I can't understand is your need to be such a condescending asshole Excuse me.
not_available I don't have to sit here and listen to this.
not_available Do you really think you're so special or are you just pissed off because your life sucks? I hate to break it to you, honey, but it's not our fault! I'll call to reschedule.
not_available Dennis recommended you.
not_available From chorus? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm a member, too.
not_available I haven't been very active the past year, since Bob got sick.
not_available It wasn't Aids.
not_available Even though we both fucked like bunnies during the '70s.
not_available We buried half our friends.
not_available We thought we'd been spared and we'd grow old together.
not_available Such hubris.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available It was cardiomyopathy.
not_available Enlarged heart.
not_available His heart was too big.
not_available We used to joke about it.
not_available It was caused by a severely leaking heart valve.
not_available We used to joke about that, too.
not_available Bleeding heart.
not_available Have any of his family been contacted? I called his sister in Phoenix, but she's not coming.
not_available His family was never very accepting of things.
not_available Bob and I were together for 22 years, so I'm his family.
not_available We have durable power of attorney.
not_available I'll have our lawyer fax it to you.
not_available I'm sorry we have to ask you for that.
not_available I'm a scenic designer for the Los Angeles Lyric Opera.
not_available Bob was the lighting designer.
not_available I was told that you would be more open to accommodating certain requests.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available A fucking opera? He just wants to design a set and rig some special lighting.
not_available How long is this gonna take? 
not_available Two days.
not_available No way.
not_available We could have three funerals.
not_available Apparently he's willing to pay for it.
not_available For a fucking opera? Yes, Federico.
not_available Vanessa's cousin won opera tickets once and she gave them to us.
not_available It was so completely whacked.
not_available There was, like, this magic mirror and this dead swan and this bleeding spear.
not_available Parsifal.
not_available Yeah! And they had these flower chicks who were supposed to be hot.
not_available And they were all just major wide
not_available loads.
not_available And these lame
not_available assed knights who were prancing around and singing at the top of their lungs.
not_available It was just so fucking Gay? 
not_available I was gonna say stupid.
not_available You don't wanna do this funeral.
not_available You think it's too gay.
not_available That's not what I was gonna say.
not_available We're doing it.
not_available These guys were together for 22 years.
not_available We're going to show them the respect they deserve.
not_available Hey.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available You never had a massage before? No.
not_available Where have you been living? Under a rock? Lighten up, sister.
not_available This is her first time on the table.
not_available What you're doing is just fine, dear.
not_available Nikolai tried to get me to come here.
not_available Why didn't you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I was afraid.
not_available If you're afraid of something, it probably means you should do it.
not_available I don't usually like being touched by strangers, but this is invigorating.
not_available It's mandatory.
not_available I started getting a massage every week after I caught my second husband cheating on me.
not_available I'm not a porcelain butterfly.
not_available You want a tip or not? 
not_available I cheated on my husband.
not_available No way.
not_available It's true.
not_available With my hairdresser.
not_available He was the one who first took me hiking.
not_available Way to go, Fisher.
not_available I cheated on number two, but only after I knew he was cheating on me.
not_available That's fair.
not_available I even slept with his gastroenterologist.
not_available For some reason I thought that would really hurt him.
not_available He just laughed at me.
not_available I will always hate him for that.
not_available Asshole.
not_available I still feel guilty for cheating on Nathaniel.
not_available You gotta let go of that.
not_available It's done.
not_available Move on.
not_available Careful with that.
not_available Put it in there.
not_available Just make sure it doesn't lean against the wall.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I thought Puccini was Italian.
not_available He is, but Turandot takes place in China.
not_available It's big.
not_available Kevin needs something to pour himself into to take his mind off such an incomprehensible loss.
not_available It was Puccini's last opera.
not_available He died before he got a chance to finish it.
not_available Bob was much more of a formalist than I am.
not_available But I think he would have liked it.
not_available I know he would have liked that.
not_available Jesus.
not_available You could sit breakfast on that ass.
not_available If Bob were here, he'd be all over that boy.
not_available I guarantee you, he'd have him in bed before nightfall.
not_available I swear, he could charm the pants off any man alive, and he usually did.
not_available I was never as lucky as he was in that department, but at least he liked to share.
not_available Eric, you'll have to make sure those risers are flush.
not_available Let me do it.
not_available That's one way to grieve.
not_available How did they ever last 22 years? It's easy when you get to fuck whoever you want to the whole time.
not_available Hand me that Makita.
not_available Here.
not_available So were you guys a couple or just hanging out? I thought we were a couple, but he thought we were just hanging out.
not_available He was squirrelly, wasn't he? 
not_available Totally.
not_available Nate used to be like that.
not_available Sometimes you just have to hang in there and wait.
not_available Wait for what? For them to grow up.
not_available If I'd known he was gonna be such a jerk, I would never have slept with him.
not_available OK, put me to work.
not_available Ruth, no.
not_available It's your night off.
not_available I much prefer to be busy.
not_available You should have told me this was a big deal.
not_available I could have changed my plans.
not_available I won't hear of it.
not_available You're not going to be here? I've got to go to this guest
not_available artist lecture series.
not_available It's Scott Philip Smith.
not_available He's this really radical artist with death threats against him.
not_available He's very political.
not_available Claire, it's your mother's birthday.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available You go ahead.
not_available This isn't going to be my last birthday.
not_available I'll totally make it up to you.
not_available Ruth, would you prefer curried chickpeas or chickpea croquettes? Chickpeas give me gas.
not_available This an unusually gassy family.
not_available But I love chickpeas anyway and this is my birthday.
not_available So you decide.
not_available You're the chef.
not_available That's such a lovely dress.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here.
not_available I'd hate it if you got something on it.
not_available Too late.
not_available Maya spit up on it last time I wore it.
not_available Isn't that funny? I think all my dresses had spit
not_available up on them.
not_available There you go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Has the party started yet? 
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available Hello, dear.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Hello.
not_available Kevin never mentioned this.
not_available I mean A tongue stud I can sort of understand.
not_available But this, that's gotta hurt.
not_available Not to mention getting it, you know, installed.
not_available So is that supposed to enhance pleasure? And for who? Apparently it worked for Queen Victoria.
not_available Come again? 
not_available It's called a Prince Albert.
not_available She liked him to wear tight pants.
not_available The ring was attached by a strap to his thigh, thus enabling a smooth trouser line.
not_available How do you know all this stuff? I read a lot.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available You know what I've been noticing a lot lately? A lot of guys coming in with their balls shaved.
not_available What's that all about? Actually, it makes them more sensitive.
not_available For oral stimulation.
not_available Besides, no one likes getting pubic hair stuck in their teeth.
not_available Do you want to ask me if I shave my balls? No, not really.
not_available I'm happy to tell you.
not_available And I do shave.
not_available Have to.
not_available Lot of hair down there.
not_available Keith doesn't have to.
not_available Anything else you wanna know, now is the time.
not_available No.
not_available I'm good.
not_available In 1982, Ronald Reagan's deregulation of the nation's mental hospitals left thousands of former inpatients homeless.
not_available I believed these incapacitated victims of greed deserve to voice their dissent.
not_available So I spent two nights roaming the streets of New York City in the dead of winter asking them to wipe their asses with this flag.
not_available When this piece was unveiled, a group of, quote, "patriots", unquote, ripped it from the walls of the Whitney Museum, took it to the streets and burned it.
not_available That I was able to motivate these right
not_available wing assholes into actually burning an American flag, this is what I consider to be the highlight of my career.
not_available So what'd you think? 
not_available I think he's amazing.
not_available Amazing? He's so unafraid and so committed to what he believes in.
not_available You should meet him.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stop hitting on my students, you overrated shit.
not_available Bite my ass, you Nazi prick.
not_available Scott, I'd like you to meet Claire Fisher and Russell Corwin, two very promising first years.
not_available It's a real honour to meet you, sir.
not_available Totally.
not_available Do yourselves a favour and give up now, unless you're willing to live as outlaws.
not_available This is a culture where art is not only a dirty word, it's a fucking crime.
not_available I'm starving, I'm thirsty and, more importantly, I am your guest.
not_available Why don't you two join us? 
not_available Seriously? An artist never questions her right to experience everything the world has to offer.
not_available Never.
not_available OK.
not_available Maybe we can do as much damage as we did in Antwerp.
not_available Hope you got better health insurance this time.
not_available OK, I'm officially scared.
not_available Don't let them see.
not_available No, that's the good
not_available good china.
not_available Yes.
not_available We never use the good
not_available good china.
not_available Then what's it for? But we hardly ever use the good china.
not_available Do you want me to put this back and use the good china? If that isn't the good china, then what is it? The good
not_available good china.
not_available What the hell.
not_available Let's use the good
not_available good china.
not_available Yippee.
not_available Bettina, this is my daughterin
not_available law Lisa.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available Don't worry, it's all good.
not_available She likes you a hell of a lot better than the one before you.
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available You didn't have to do this.
not_available Don't even think about returning it.
not_available There's no receipt, if you catch my drift.
not_available We have to move this table.
not_available Why? 
not_available We're gonna dance.
not_available Heavens, no.
not_available We don't dance in this family.
not_available Ruth Fisher, we're gonna celebrate you tonight, like it or not.
not_available Now go put on your new clothes.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Help me move it up against the window.
not_available Shouldn't we wait until after dinner? 
not_available I'll be too wasted by then.
not_available And I brought some music.
not_available I hope you weren't planning on listening to this Lilith Fair crap all night long.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Being an artist is not about being right all the time.
not_available It's resigning oneself to a life of masochism.
not_available OK.
not_available Just answer me this.
not_available Why are you an artist? Because I'm angry.
not_available Disgusting.
not_available What do you have to be angry about, you and your fucking grants? I don't use that to make art.
not_available I give it away.
not_available It was your shit on the flag.
not_available You're too fucking scared to actually go there You're pissed because you have nothing original to say.
not_available You latch onto politics because you have nothing original.
not_available There is nothing original to say.
not_available It's all been said before.
not_available Go to Hollywood, then.
not_available That is so pathetic.
not_available That is so fucking American.
not_available Is there anything more infuriating than the moral vanity of Eurotrash? Fuck you.
not_available Welcome to Epcot, kids.
not_available I would rip your dick off and force
not_available feed it to you if I didn't think you would like it.
not_available Fantastic rage.
not_available I fucking love you, you stupid bald peasant.
not_available Prove it.
not_available Buy us another round.
not_available And why are you an artist? Because Because I have a lot of pain.
not_available Good.
not_available Pain is good for an artist.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available Adolescent romanticism.
not_available "All artists must suffer.
not_available " God, you are fucking beautiful.
not_available Your skin is like Carrara marble.
not_available Is this young man your lover? No.
not_available Why the hell not? Maybe Russell doesn't think she's beautiful.
not_available I think she's very beautiful.
not_available And why are you an artist? Because I don't have a fucking choice.
not_available If I can't create art, I don't want to live.
not_available Attaboy.
not_available Why do you validate these infantile notions? Because you want them to love you.
not_available I want them to trust their own vision.
not_available Something which you have none of, arriviste.
not_available And you want them to love you.
not_available Can I get you anything else? My friend will have a shot of ouzo with a big dollop of shit in it.
not_available Our room opened directly out onto the pool.
not_available And the dregs of humanity, from the looks of it.
not_available And that's the Sunday smorgasbord brunch.
not_available They come for the breakfast burrito and the free shuttle to the outlet mall.
not_available I never really understood the concept of a breakfast burrito.
not_available So where are all the X
not_available rated ones? You leave those at home? You gotta go on the internet and pay 9.99 a month for those.
not_available Poor David always looked so funny in a bathing suit.
not_available I do not look funny in a bathing suit.
not_available Actually, you do.
not_available Is she asleep? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You, on the other hand, do not look funny.
not_available Bettina! 
not_available What? I'm just flirting.
not_available You're barking up the wrong tree, lady.
not_available Who wants coffee? 
not_available For God's sake, stop waiting on us.
not_available Sit down.
not_available You deserve a break after that scrumptious meal.
not_available This is David at the Geoffrey Beene outlet mall.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Now I get the attraction.
not_available He's a hottie.
not_available I almost forgot.
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available Oh, dear, you really shouldn't have.
not_available Shut up.
not_available It's just a little something I thought of at the last minute.
not_available "For my motherin
not_available law on her special day.
not_available "This coupon is redeemable for one free foot massage.
not_available Love, Lisa.
not_available " Nice.
not_available What happened to the bath salts? 
not_available It felt so impersonal.
not_available Can I have it now? 
not_available You want it now? Yes, please.
not_available I love massages.
not_available Since when? 
not_available Since yesterday.
not_available Please? You wanna go under the sun porch? Maybe it'll be more comfortable.
not_available Come on.
not_available Maybe we'll all end up naked.
not_available I wouldn't bet on that.
not_available I would.
not_available Does this party seem a little weird to you? On a scale of one to ten, ninety.
not_available Which foot first? So what do you really think of his work? 
not_available I like parts of it.
not_available Not really, though.
not_available It's kind of on the nose.
not_available It's way too on the nose.
not_available Good.
not_available Because every nasty thing I said to him earlier was the absolute truth.
not_available And every flattering thing was a lie.
not_available You didn't say too much that was flattering.
not_available You are a brilliant artist, Claire.
not_available That piece you did last week in the studio was better than anything Smith has done in the last ten years.
not_available Really? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available But you, Russell, you're going to be successful beyond your wildest dreams.
not_available You honestly think so? Would I lie to you? I might.
not_available But who gives a fuck? The world is gonna love you.
not_available No matter what, you cannot care what other people think.
not_available I don't care what other people think.
not_available Phoney baloney, ka
not_available ka shit.
not_available Everybody your age cares about what other people think.
not_available You don't even know what you think yourself.
not_available I have to pee.
not_available I'm serious about you.
not_available Russell is good.
not_available He's gonna make a lot of money.
not_available But you, your talent is epic.
not_available It's like the tail of a comet.
not_available You can change the world.
not_available Shut up.
not_available God.
not_available I'm so envious of you.
not_available You see the world with your own eyes.
not_available Do you know what a rare and precious gift that is? No.
not_available And God created beauty.
not_available And then he retired.
not_available Promise me you'll do great things in your life, nothing less.
not_available Promise me.
not_available I promise.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get out of here and leave that imbecile with the tab.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available That feels unbelievably good.
not_available I have strong hands.
not_available Right there.
not_available That's the spot.
not_available You never give me a foot massage.
not_available Your feet stink.
not_available They do not.
not_available They do.
not_available You get that from your father.
not_available How come you never give me a foot massage? Because you never ask.
not_available This is really weird.
not_available I just remembered this dream I had.
not_available It was about a month ago, I guess.
not_available I was getting a foot massage.
not_available You all know I have extremely ticklish feet.
not_available You were all there.
not_available Not you, Bettina.
not_available Not you, Keith.
not_available No offence.
not_available Everyone else.
not_available You were there, Lisa, David and Claire.
not_available I'm getting this foot massage.
not_available I can't remember who was giving it to me.
not_available I think it may have been Dad.
not_available I'm holding Maya and she's slippery.
not_available She's squirming like a pig.
not_available She's squirming like a pig and then what? I don't remember the rest of it, except that I could never find my shoes.
not_available I read somewhere that every person in your dream is actually you.
not_available I'm gonna check on the baby.
not_available Did you know that there are more bones in the feet than in the rest of the entire body? I didn't know that.
not_available But now that you say it, I totally believe it.
not_available Thank you, dear.
not_available That's the nicest thing anyone's done for me in a very long time.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available It's just my little way of saying thank you for letting us live here.
not_available Of course.
not_available You're family.
not_available Nobody touches anything.
not_available I love it.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available It's very large.
not_available I've always wanted to see the Great Wall of China.
not_available So have I.
not_available We should go.
not_available What the hell is this? The scenic designer for LA Lyric Opera created this for the funeral of his lover.
not_available It figures.
not_available What figures? Only a gay man would build a fucking opera set for his lover's funeral.
not_available I think it cheapens their whole relationship.
not_available Don't be such a snob.
not_available It's sweet.
not_available You'd better be prepared to build me something when I go.
not_available Something involving Steve McQueen on a motorcycle? An entire POW barracks.
not_available Get over here.
not_available What? Come on.
not_available Why don't you loosen up? 
not_available It's unbelievable.
not_available It's made out of wood.
not_available I know.
not_available What did I miss? You and me and Lisa are going on vacation to China together.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Can I come? Are you drunk? 
not_available It's OK.
not_available I have four days' worth of milk in the freezer.
not_available Why'd you change your shirt? 
not_available I just spilled something on the other one.
not_available You're such a klutz.
not_available But you're my klutz.
not_available Look at the pagoda.
not_available You smell like Listerine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm dying.
not_available His name was Simon Rodia and he spent 33 years working on them.
not_available When he felt they were finished, he gave the deeds to his house to a neighbour, packed up and moved away.
not_available They're amazing.
not_available He put everything into them.
not_available Whatever he'd find on his way walking to and from work.
not_available Steel rods, seashells, pottery, glass, old boots, corncobs.
not_available He must have been out of his mind.
not_available He was a construction worker, but he was a real artist.
not_available And all real artists are out of their mind.
not_available Yeah? You think so? 
not_available Look at Olivier and Scott Smith.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Van Gogh cut off an ear.
not_available It's so weird.
not_available What? Every single person at our school thinks they're gonna be successful otherwise they wouldn't even be doing this.
not_available But what is success? Is it just money or fame? Or is it the critics loving you? Or is it you knowing that you've done good work? Or what? This is a fucking masterpiece.
not_available But maybe the guy who made it just thought it was shit and now no one even knows his name.
not_available Simon Rodia.
not_available God, I feel like such a phoney.
not_available Why? You're fucking brilliant.
not_available Because I can't imagine ever being this dedicated or this consumed by anything.
not_available Maybe you just haven't found whatever it is that's worth cutting off an ear for.
not_available I would never cut off my fucking ear.
not_available Van Gogh did it for love.
not_available He did it because he was totally insane.
not_available It's only an ear.
not_available It's not like he couldn't hear out of it.
not_available There was still a hole there.
not_available It's almost two.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm not even tired, are you? No.
