not_available I can see that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I felt like I took the collage stuff as far as I could.
not_available And with these I was thinking less about the process I think simple emotional connection.
not_available Well? They're quite beautiful.
not_available But I can't sell them.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Well, Claire, they're wedding photographs.
not_available Yeah, technically, but 
not_available And they're beautifully shot, but I'm an art dealer, I know what people want.
not_available And it's not pictures from someone else's wedding.
not_available Maybe if I took out some of the ones That specifically identify it as a wedding.
not_available You know, make it a little more ambiguous.
not_available Do you think I should? I would never ask you to compromise your artistic vision.
not_available Well, I can probably interpret my vision In different ways, you know? And I was kind of hoping to get another show soon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I still have a couple ideas for the collage series.
not_available You know? All right, I'm having a group show next month.

not_available Pack I thought you were secretly gay.
not_available Dude, I got fat.
not_available It's not the end of the world.
not_available You swore you'd never become a fucking funeral director and look at you now.
not_available At least I don't need a golf cart to get around.
not_available Oh, dude, harsh.
not_available By the way, I always knew you slept with sheila maddox While she was supposedly my girlfriend.
not_available The operative word there is supposedly.
not_available You were too busy trying to bajennifer kaufman to notice.
not_available I did bag jennifer kaufman.
not_available I knew you did.
not_available And sheila knew it too.
not_available I was merely comforting her.
not_available Do you remember that? Remember feeling like there was Nothing in the world you couldn't get away with And it would always be that way? Did you make a vegetable? No, this is spinach lasagna.
not_available I figured that would be our vegetable.
not_available Well, I only asked because sometimes you make a dish And it's not until we're almost finished eating That you remember it's still in the oven.
not_available I guess I must have alzheimer's.
not_available I wasn't being critical, Ruth.
not_available Actually, I find all your little quirks very endearing.
not_available This is delicious.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's in it? Do you want me to list all the ingredients? Not if you don't want to.
not_available I was just wondering what this spice is? "Italian seasoning.
not_available " I didn't know you could buy it all mixed up like this.
not_available "Basil, rosemary, marjoram, sage, thyme, oregano.
not_available " have to keep this in stock.
not_available I'll make a note of it.
not_available Do you know what they call an italian hooker? A pasta
not_available Tute Th kind of humor doesn't really appeal to me, George.
not_available Guess it's not that funny.
not_available You're goddamned right it's not funny! None of this funny! You tricked me into marrying you! You knew you were crazy and didn't tell me! And now I have to take care of you for the rest of my life! What did I do to fucking deserve this?! You can really taste the rosemary.
not_available I think you're making a terrible mistake.
not_available You don't belong in a place like that.
not_available I have to do my internship.
not_available I've got to clock 300 hours.
not_available But a free clinic? You're going to have to hire an armed escort to walk to your car.
not_available You're catastrophysing.
not_available Those places attract the absolute dregs of society.
not_available The most desperate and the most dangerous.
not_available The reason I charge $200 an hour Is to keep those kinds of people out of my office.
not_available Well, thankfully I'm not you.
not_available You know, I would like to work with people who actually need help.
not_available Really, Brenda, let me find you a better internship.
not_available One that's more suited to your talents.
not_available I hate to let the fact that I've slept with Half of southern california's psychiatric academia go to waste.
not_available No thank you.
not_available I am fine.
not_available What makes you think you're going to help them anyway? You're always talking about doing cognitive work.
not_available You live in your head.
not_available How are you going to relate to crack addicts? Because I've had my own struggles with addiction.
not_available Because we're all human.
not_available No, honey, we're not.

not_available I mean it.

not_available Well, I think we're out of luck there.
not_available Not if we ask Claire to donate some of her eggs.
not_available Claire? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then the baby could be like a combination of the two of us.
not_available Or as close as we could get anyway.

not_available Man, we are getting up there, aren't we? Man, it is really good to see you.

not_available I thought I heard your voice.
not_available Hi, daddy.
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available Hi.
not_available You look so good.
not_available Well, I feel pretty good.

not_available Must've done the trick.
not_available That's so good to hear.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available I made some iced tea.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm, still having problems with my memory.
not_available Yesterday he forgot our home phone number.
not_available They needed it at the pharmacy And he was hunting all over the store for me like a lost little boy.
not_available Gets pretty frustrating.
not_available But, dad, that's normal.
not_available That's not something to worry about.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available I know.
not_available The doctor said it could be a very long haul.
not_available So, how have you been filling your time? Oh, resting mostly.
not_available And a lot of reading.
not_available I just finished clinton's book.
not_available Oh, I've been wanting to read that? 
not_available Really? Let me get it for you.
not_available Before I forget.

not_available Every day's a new adventure.
not_available Hey, sharon.
not_available It's Rico again.
not_available Obviously, we're not going to have lunch today.
not_available But, uh, why don't you give me a call back so we can reschedule? Okay? Bye
not_available Bye.
not_available Thanks for helping me with this.
not_available It's not a problem.
not_available Be nice to have something feels remotely familiar 
not_available At Billy's apartment.
not_available I can relate.
not_available Of course, if you'd like to do a favor For me in return 
not_available What? It's a big favor.
not_available Okay.
not_available Donate some of your eggs to Keith and me? Like when? 
not_available As soon as possible, I guess.
not_available I mean, we have to find a surrogate first.
not_available And then you would both have to go on birth control pills At the same time so your cycles Would coincide.
not_available Then there would be all sorts of hormone injections.
not_available And you wouldn't be able to exercise or anything.
not_available No drugs or drinking, of course.
not_available Eventually, the eggs would be harvested Through a needle inserted into the vagina.
not_available Your vagina.
not_available It's like surgery.
not_available Okay, I get it.
not_available It's asking too much.
not_available I mean, I haven't given that much thought To my eggs.
not_available But I'm not exactly sure I want to give any of them away.
not_available It really wasn't fair of me to ask.
not_available You're not mad? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available No.
not_available Ev if it all worked out, there would be the weirdness Of having a niece that you're also the mother of.
not_available Yeah, that's really kind of creepy.
not_available It could make thanksgiving dinners a little awkward.
not_available Everyone say hello to Brenda Chenowith our new intern.

not_available My father.
not_available Thank you for saying that.
not_available Sometimes that's all I need to hear.
not_available That someone understands.

not_available Yes, indeed this will happen to me.
not_available It is happening to me a little bit each everyday.
not_available And that doesn't freak me out.
not_available If anything, it's liberating.
not_available Okay, so I guess it comes with the territory? I mean, your job.
not_available No, I don't think it's the job, really.
not_available It's just
not_available The job allows me to practice being okay with it.

not_available Is he doing okay? Hmm? Yeah.
not_available He's great.
not_available Why, you don't think he is? I don't know.

not_available Then we jumped out the second story window.
not_available Nate when first and sprained his ankle.
not_available I landed without injury.
not_available Until, of course, sam jumped on me And gave me a mild concussion.
not_available At that moment Or fates were sealed as best friends.
not_available Best days of my life were spent with these guys.
not_available But as always happens as time goes by once we had people using an apartment For purposes of prostitution.

not_available We have over 17,000 students here From every possible ethnic and socio
not_available Economic background.
not_available Quite a few of them end up here needing our help.

not_available You know? It's so sudden.
not_available Well, take the boys out for pizza.
not_available You need them with you.
not_available It'll make you feel better.
not_available Do you think that you can come too? Of course.
not_available Of course.
not_available Just give me a few minutes.
not_available Finish your lesson plans already? No.
not_available I don't really have the energy for it.
not_available I'm working on a new idea.
not_available Yeah, I want to go back to the collage stuff.
not_available But on a much bigger scale.
not_available Not just people as fragments glued together, But, like, the whole world.
not_available Well, that sounds good.
not_available Yeah, sort of capture the idea that everything we know is just barely being held together.
not_available That's big.
not_available I know.
not_available It's big.
not_available It's really big.
not_available I'm just trying to I'm still trying to figure it all out.
not_available Well, I'll let you keep working then.
not_available So have you had an opportunity to talk to Claire yet? Well, yes.
not_available Yesterday.
not_available And you didn't tell me? I wanted to give her another day to think about it.
not_available And? 
not_available She won't do it.
not_available Serious? 
not_available She's strongly against it.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Is it, though? Sometimes I think what's weird is us trying to create our own child.
not_available We're two men, Keith.
not_available It's not possible.
not_available There's no way that we're going to have a child That's both part me and part you.
not_available I know that, David.
not_available Then let's stop pretending.
not_available Whether we have a child through a surrogate or we adopt a child, All that's important is the child itself.
not_available Okay.
not_available Really? 
not_available Of course.
not_available look I wasn't trying to be selfish about any of this.
not_available And I really can't imagine anything greater Than being able to look at our child And see you in him.
not_available Or see you in her.
not_available Hopefully you still will.
not_available It was such a short visit, maggie.
not_available I wish you could stay longer.
not_available That's the good and the bad part of my job
not_available I'm never anywhere very long.
not_available Vanilla or chocolate? I'd like the neapolitan.
not_available We don't have that.
not_available Of course we do.
not_available I had some yesterday.
not_available Yes and now we're out of it.
not_available How can we be out of it? That's what I like! Neapolitan! Daddy, why don't you take a little vanilla and a little chocolate? 
not_available It's almost the same thing.
not_available No, it is not the same! Neapolitan is chocolate, vanilla and strawberry! If there's no strawberry it most definitely is not neapolitan! You see what I go through? I'm sorry.
not_available It's just My life is so goddamned pathetic.
not_available All I have to look forward to is a fucking bowl of ice cream.
not_available and I can't even get that! I'm sorry.
not_available I'm trying not to be demanding.
not_available It's just Oh, my life is shit! I simply don't know how to deal with this.
not_available It's like having another child.
not_available It's okay, daddy.
not_available You're gonna have moments like this.
not_available It's gonna get better.
not_available Will it really? Maggie, please don't leave.
not_available I'm not sure I can do this by myself.
not_available If you leave tomorrow, maggie, I just
not_available I don't know what I'll do.
not_available Maybe I can stay a little longer.
