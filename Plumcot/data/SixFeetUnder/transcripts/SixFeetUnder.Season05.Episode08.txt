not_available Another half hour and I gotta go feed a cat off mulholland.
not_available What kind of party ? All right, I'll call you when I get home.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available You should see this hill.
not_available No, I'm on my rollerblades.
not_available I should really take them off and walk down.
not_available It's really steep.
not_available Really, really steep.
not_available Call you right back.
not_available Come on, pup, come on ! All right ! Oh my god ! Now we're safe.
not_available I need some help out here ! I need some help ! Did I tell you Nate's dragging me to a quaker church service tonight ? 
not_available No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He thinks couples therapy is a waste of time, So this is his solution.
not_available I thought you were already going to therapy.
not_available Oh yeah, we went once, But he thought That the therapist and I were ganging up on him, So that was that.
not_available Well, who knows, maybe a little spirituality will help, you know.
not_available Quakerism ? Yeah, right.
not_available I just wish he'd take half as much interest in his own baby.
not_available Hey, if it was important to you to have him here, You should have made that clear to him.
not_available I didn't tell him.
not_available Nate and I, we're 100 miles apart on this baby.
not_available On everything, really.
not_available I didn't want him here.
not_available I mean, it's not good for me.
not_available It's certainly not good for the baby.
not_available Ha.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hello, Brenda.
not_available Hey, dr.
not_available Melnick.
not_available How are you feeling today ? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Would you lie back for me please ? No husband today ? 
not_available No, no.
not_available He couldn't get away from work.
not_available This is my friend Jackie.
not_available There's your fetus.
not_available Oh.
not_available Nice heartbeat.
not_available Size looks good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Everything seems to be developing normally at this point.
not_available So the baby's healthy ? I'd still like to do an amnio.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Do you want to know the baby's sex ? Here's my work number, my cell number.
not_available I know those numbers, David.
not_available Yes, but sometimes in the panic of an emergency It's helpful to have them written down.
not_available I'll be driving Roger's limo all day, so here's that number.
not_available This is too many numbers, honestly.
not_available We really appreciate you watching the boys.
not_available Durrell didn't tell us until last night that 
not_available It was teacher development day.
not_available You didn't ask me.
not_available I'm glad to finally have some time with my new grandchildren.
not_available You've been hiding them from me.
not_available We've been trying to keep them to a regular schedule.
not_available Well, we'll have fun today.
not_available I brought the makings for chocolate chip cookies.
not_available I thought I'd bake.
not_available I like chocolate chip cookies.
not_available All boys do.
not_available I don't.
not_available You'll like mine.
not_available Oh, we'll see about that.
not_available Durrell, you do whatever Mrs.
not_available Fisher tells you to do.
not_available What if she tells me to jump out the window ? They're allowed one hour of television, one our of playstation And they can take their soccer ball down to the courtyard.
not_available But they'd better not be kicking the ball against the building.
not_available Or you'll whup us.
not_available I did not say that.
not_available We'll be fine, really.
not_available You two go now.
not_available Have a good day.
not_available I'll be home by 5 :00.
not_available You look like a witch.
not_available I assure you I'm not.
not_available I didn't say you were.
not_available I said you look like one.
not_available This is what they made very efficient.
not_available This is why the republicans rely so much on this base.
not_available This is a corporatized christian cult situation Where it's about personal empowerment Which is part of the republican agenda The neo
not_available Contact cult agenda.
not_available What Ray was talking about Ray is obviously a different type of christian Who I offended Oh god.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Usted decidiro sobra la señora de Guadalupe.
not_available Sí.
not_available Perro con manguillos de cobre.
not_available Amarillo pulido.
not_available ¿Qué ? 
not_available El cobre pulido.
not_available Pulido, pulido what ? Qué pulido ? Con en el interior en seda rosada, 
not_available En vez de marrón.
not_available Polished.
not_available Pulido, polished.
not_available Polished what ? I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Qué dio.
not_available Por favor, un momento.
not_available If you knew they didn't speak english, Then why did you even try to handle the intake ? I'm trying to learn spanish.
not_available By using our clients as a classroom ? I didn't plan this.
not_available It was a walk
not_available In.
not_available I was the only one available.
not_available What am I supposed do with this body now ? You wanna take over for me ? Oh, that's right.
not_available You can't.
not_available I already did most of the work.
not_available Great.
not_available I'm really in the mood for dealing with a grieving widower.
not_available It's her parents.
not_available She's married, then her parents don't have the right to make these decisions.
not_available To make these decisions Nate.
not_available I think she was divorced.
not_available You think ? 
not_available Yes, Rico, I think.
not_available Gracias.
not_available Gracias.
not_available Are you really sure about all this ? 
not_available What ? Didn't you overdo it on the merchandise ? What are you talking about ? You sold them a casket for $4,000, You added another $600 just to switch handles, Three grand for the monument, another $400 for doves.
not_available It just goes on.
not_available This is their youngest daughter they're burying Nate.
not_available The guy works in a machine shop.
not_available He can't afford this.
not_available Besides learning to mangle a few words in spanish, Maybe you should learn something about latin culture as well.
not_available We honor our dead, Nate.
not_available And end up broke because of it.
not_available That is so fucking racist.
not_available How am I being racist ? ! You're the one who said it's cultural thing.
not_available Every single member of the family pitches in at moments like this.
not_available Everyone.
not_available We take care of each other.
not_available No one's left broke.
not_available I've got work to do.
not_available As you can see we've got a top of the line retort To the primary and secondary chambers Just we're lined last year.
not_available Feel free to look over everything.
not_available You're asking 340,000 ? Oh, it's worth every penny, David.
not_available I get over 300 cases a year.
not_available I could handle more if I added another retort Which is exactly what I would do If I were 20 years younger.
not_available Cremation is a growing business, you know that.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available You don't want fisher &amp; sons to get left behind.
not_available Fisher &amp; Diaz.
not_available I've got another prospective buyer stopping by in the morning.
not_available I see.
not_available I'm not trying to push you, But I've had this place since 1972.
not_available It's been good to me.
not_available I'd be pleased to pass it on to the sons of Nathaniel Fisher.
not_available I'll talk to my partners.
not_available Regular non
not_available fat latte.
not_available Oh ! Steal us a bunch of splendas.
not_available Like a whole bunch.
not_available Splenda.
not_available Yeah.
not_available A large mocha ice
not_available Blended please.
not_available I want a regular soy pomegranate blueberry tea latte.
not_available But in a large cup.
not_available and then could you just fill up the rest with soy ? Isn't that just a large soy pomegranate blueberry tea latte ? No, it's a regular in a large cup.
not_available Oh, and also A reduced
not_available Fat Wholesome morning muffin.
not_available Claire ? Hey, Anita.
not_available Oh, someone's very thirsty.
not_available And on her way to bible class, I'm guessing.
not_available Oh yeah.
not_available It's pretty awful, isn't it ? I'm kind of temping at this place.
not_available Is that where you've been ? Shit, I've left you like 100 messages 
not_available I thought you were dead.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You were like my best friend and then suddenly you were gone.
not_available Well, how've you been ? Fabulous.
not_available You know.
not_available School, sex, drugs, creating art.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm kind of on the clock, so I should probably go.
not_available Ah, here, let me give you this.
not_available Lac
not_available Arts junior show.
not_available I got a piece in it.
not_available Oh, wow ! Please promise you'll come.
not_available Everybody'll be there.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Great.
not_available Good.
not_available Boys, the first batch is ready ! Anthony, Durrell, The cookies are ready ! I really appreciate you doing this for me.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on, a quaker church service.
not_available At the very least it'll be interesting.
not_available I'm trying to keep an open mind.
not_available There's no sermon or anything.
not_available People just sit silently And wait to be filled with the presence of god.
not_available Maggie says we can say something if we feel like it, but You don't have to.
not_available It's not like a requirement.
not_available Is there anything else Maggie thinks we should know ? Melnick says the baby's looking really good.
not_available When was this ? 
not_available This morning.
not_available I had a sonogram.
not_available What ? Why didn't you tell me about it ? Because I wanted to spare you the grief.
not_available I'm sorry, but this is one of the things that we talked about really.
not_available It pisses me off when you do stuff like this without telling me.
not_available Ok, why don't you sit there and allow yourself To be filled with the presence of god ? So what did she say ? 
not_available She said that the baby was developing normally.
not_available There's no sign of any irregularities, All of which is very very encouraging.
not_available So it's perfectly healthy.
not_available Well, you know, there are some things That the sonogram can't tell.
not_available What, so it could have down's or Spina Bifida ? Oh, no probably not downs because we did this neck measurement test.
not_available And at looked really good.
not_available Wow.
not_available So, great ! We get to maybe check this one thing off the list And it could still have a million other things wrong with it.
not_available The baby's not an it, Nate, it's a girl.
not_available We're having another daughter.
not_available Mom, how could you let them take off like that ? I had no idea they'd left.
not_available Why weren't you watching them ? 
not_available I was making cookies.
not_available You said they could play in the courtyard.
not_available You never thought once to check on them ? Don't talk to me like I'm an imbecile.
not_available I've raised three children.
not_available That's why I expected A little more from you.
not_available This just can't happen, mum.
not_available Then you can take me off your list of babysitters.
not_available I'm taking my cookies.
not_available You can wipe that smirk right off your face.
not_available You are grounded, mister.
not_available And you cannot tell Keith about this.
not_available You can't just shuffle through the process 
not_available and pretend I don't exist.
not_available It's nerveWracking enough For me without you being
not_available What, the voice of reason ? Wow, you look great.
not_available Are we going out tonight ? 
not_available I am I'm going to dinner with Angelica And some of her friends.
not_available We might go to a party afterwards so don't wait up.
not_available Oh.
not_available Boys eaten ? This is wednesday.
not_available It's your night to take care of dinner.
not_available Oh, right right.
not_available Don't give me that look.
not_available You have one night a week, I have six.
not_available Order some pizza if that's the best you can do.
not_available I can cook something.
not_available Don't forget to clean up.
not_available That's not my job.
not_available Okay, I get it.
not_available And do not make me the bad guy here, please ? Vanessa I'm fine.
not_available Just Just go.
not_available I am.
not_available So, friends With the doctor saying everything's in remission, Kathy and I are feeling very Very blessed right now.
not_available Friends I have been dizzy all week.
not_available And I had to take the bus here.
not_available I need someone to give me a ride home.
not_available Oh Thank you.
not_available I just wanted to say how good it feels to be here.
not_available All day long I deal with death And stress And it's nice to be in a place of peace.
not_available That's all.
not_available Is it okay if I take some of those cookies to work ? You made so many.
not_available Take as many as you'd like.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Do you want some help ? 
not_available No.
not_available I think I've already made a mess of it.
not_available I don't know why I try and cut my own hair.
not_available Pamper yourself.
not_available Go to a salon.
not_available It's not like we're living on the prairie.
not_available You want to give quaker church another chance tomorrow night ? 
not_available Not really.
not_available One, two, four, three, five.
not_available Okay.
not_available Why ? Well, Maggie's car is in the shop And I offered to give her a ride, so It's 8 :30 in the morning and you've already talked to Maggie ? She needed a ride.
not_available That place looked like it was full of friends Who just love to be her ride.
not_available Do you want to come or not ? Are you really buying into this ? I'm not buying into anything.
not_available So, when you went into that church last night, You really believed you were in the presence of god ? What I said was that it felt like a place of peace.
not_available Which it isn't here.
not_available Not a lot lately, no.
not_available One, two, three, four, five.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available Can you get your shoes for me, Then I'll get you ready for daycare, okay ? Thank you.
not_available It was just nice, Brenda.
not_available It was really nice to be around some people who didn't think they know everything And who thought there might be something more to life Than what they can see and feel and be right about.
not_available Well, I feel sorry for you That you have such emptiness inside you That you need to fill it with something so ridiculous.
not_available You really don't believe in anything ? 
not_available You know I don't.
not_available Well, I feel sorry for you then.
not_available And I don't understand where you draw the line.
not_available The service is basically silent meditation.
not_available You meditate.
not_available Yes, but I'm not waiting for some mythical, historical ghost With his shaming, blood
not_available sacrifice bullshit To come and save my soul.
not_available I meditate to see the world as it is To accept the world, To feel alive.
not_available And you can't do that with other people ? Not with those people, no.
not_available So if I get involved with Quakerism Or whatever because it makes sense to me, Because it means something to me, 
not_available Nate, you can't you're just using this As a way to distance yourself from me and your baby, Because you're scared and you don't know what to do.
not_available How could I be distancing myself ? ! I'm here every night ! Not tomorrow night ! Apparently you'd rather be with that sappy, 
not_available Little ferret, Maggie.
not_available Hey ! 
not_available She is a deeply kind person.
not_available Oh.
not_available Is that what you're looking for now ? A deeply kind person ? Well, I know I don't want someone Who makes me feel like shit every second of the day.
not_available If I'm so awful, why don't you leave ? Will you stop threatening me ? It's like you think you can win every argument By giving me some fucking ultimatum ! 
not_available No, it was a question ! Yeah ? Well, I'm not leaving ! Maybe you want to leave, but I'm here Brenda ! I am here, Brenda, I m'not going anywhere I gotta go to work.
not_available Hey, Benny.
not_available What's up ? Can you tell me what this is ? 
not_available A side mirror.
not_available Can you tell me what it's doing in my hand ? 
not_available You got me.
not_available It's in my hand because it's no longer attached to my car.
not_available And it's no longer attached to my car Because your kid knocked it off with your ginormous truck 
not_available Trying to park last week.
not_available What, Durrell ? He's 12 years old, man.
not_available Oh, fucking kid.
not_available All right, I'll pay you for it.
not_available $280.00 I'll, I'll write you a check.
not_available So, was that you I saw crawling out of a lime
not_available Green hearse yesterday ? It's actually more of an avocado.
not_available Ah.
not_available You don't seem particularly goth and I don't think you have your own band, so 
not_available My dad was a funeral director.
not_available Ah.
not_available Really ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I grew up in a funeral home.
not_available I still live in a funeral home.
not_available Wow.
not_available With dead bodies and everything.
not_available Yep.
not_available Isn't that kind of scary ? 
not_available Not compared to this.
not_available "LacArts junior show." 
not_available Tonight.
not_available You going ? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I said I would.
not_available But I think I might become conveniently sick.
not_available Not into it ? No, it's just these friends from school 
not_available Who I don't see anymore.
not_available No way ? I got the same thing This get together with all my old fraternity brothers.
not_available I'm the only one who's not married or in a serious relationship, So I end up looking like a loser.
not_available Which you are.
not_available Beside the point.
not_available How about I go with you to your thing, And you come with me to mine ? 
not_available Are you serious ? Yeah.
not_available We'll take my car.
not_available Cool.
not_available Just going to 
not_available Please.
not_available I think it's an opportunity we can't afford to pass up.
not_available Did you start without me ? No, I'm just reading David's proposal 
not_available While we waited for you.
not_available Proposal ? What proposal ? This.
not_available I think now At the end of our corporate year.
not_available Instead of taking our traditional bonuses, we should think reinvesting in the company.
not_available I'm all for that.
not_available So I suggest we buy a crematory.
not_available What ? No.
not_available No.
not_available No way.
not_available You haven't even read it yet.
not_available People who want their loved ones cremated Are people who don't wanna spend anything.
not_available There's no money to be made in cremation.
not_available Of course, there is.
not_available There's no overhead if we own our own.
not_available Yeah, just a $340,000 mortgage.
not_available No, here's another number to think about.
not_available That is the percentage of our clientele that was latino last year.
not_available Do you know why it was so high ? I'm not saying anything.
not_available I've already been called a racist once this week.
not_available Because the name Diaz went up on our sign.
not_available That's why we have all this extra money, because I'm bringing in the latino community.
not_available And there's no way that I'm voting that we get a crematory.
not_available So what is it you want ? Well, another spanish speaking employee To work exclusively in community outreach.
not_available Fisher and Diaz needs to be a visible member in our community.
not_available We should be sponsoring soccer teams Rico, I'm gonna stop you right there.
not_available We can't think of all the fun things we'd like to do.
not_available We have to plan for our future.
not_available This is our future ! I don't think it's the future of Fisher and Diaz.
not_available Oh, I get it.
not_available The fisher boys are ganging up because you're afraid of losing a little control, huh ? 
not_available Wait, don't include me in this.
not_available Ruth Fisher.
not_available Hello, Hiram.
not_available Have a seat, I'll be with you in a moment.
not_available Or if you'd prefer one of our other stylists No, I'm here to see you.
not_available I think the last thing we need to do is buy a crematory.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But I don't agree with you either.
not_available God, this whole business is so screwed up.
not_available Death used to be something that happened at home, It was taken care of by family And all the undertaker, did was build the caskets.
not_available We were cabinet makers.
not_available Okay, I'm not sure I know how to build a cabinet.
not_available It wasn't until the civil war.
not_available That they needed to transport bodies back home without them decomposing That they started embalming them.
not_available Of course, some asshole figured out a way to make money off of it.
not_available There is no real reason for most of what we do.
not_available We don't need to embalm bodies.
not_available Well, there is a little problem of smell.
not_available So what ? That's a part of death.
not_available And I think that's where This business went wrong.
not_available We tried to disguise it, make it look pretty, neat, 
not_available And someone else's problem.
not_available Nate, do you actually have a proposal Or is this just more of a general lecture ? 
not_available Green funerals.
not_available Oh, brother.
not_available No caskets, no toxic chemicals to leach into the soil.
not_available And we make money on this how ? 
not_available This isn't about making money.
not_available This is about making a better world.
not_available I'm sorry, but a world that I'm broke in 
not_available Doesn't seem better to me.
not_available All right, look, We find a natural setting that's worth preserving.
not_available We get a conservation easement so that it's protected From being developed in the future.
not_available Look who's doing his homework all of a sudden.
not_available I just know that when I die, please, wrap me in a shroud, Plant me next to a beautiful tree so that, Nobody could build a mini
not_available Mall there.
not_available According to your pre
not_available Need you wanna be cremated.
not_available So I'll change it.
not_available Nate.
not_available Really, I understand and it all sounds very wonderful, 
not_available But we don't have that kind of money.
not_available So we'll get some investors ! Jesus, David, can you just try to be optimistic Instead of always coming up with reasons to never change ? If you want to pursue this, you have my blessing, But I'm not putting any of our money into it.
not_available Yeah, great meeting, guys.
not_available Hey, man ! 
not_available Jesus.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available How are you doing ? 
not_available Did you meet Claire ? No.
not_available Hey, I'm lauderback.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Claire here is just visiting.
not_available Oh ! She's actually the biggest soap opera star in all of Holland.
not_available Cool.
not_available Welcome to America.
not_available Danke.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Good to meet you.
not_available Lauderback invented this game Where we'd all put diapers on under our pants, go to a strip club And the first one who could take a shit while getting a lap dance won.
not_available What was the point of that ? 
not_available We were in college.
not_available And idiots and drunk.
not_available I never won.
not_available Good.
not_available Strange to think that these were My best friends for four years.
not_available I have nothing in common with them anymore.
not_available They're all bmws and baby strollers.
not_available And golf on the weekends.
not_available I'm not ready to be my dad just yet.
not_available So what made you decide to become a lawyer ? That's what my dad is.
not_available I know, I'm a complete hypocrite.
not_available It's actually pretty good, though.
not_available Maybe not my dream come true, but I like it.
not_available I knew he did it once.
not_available I didn't know it was a regular thing.
not_available Why the hell didn't you tell me ? 
not_available Because I took care of it.
not_available You've got to stop babying him, David.
not_available Grab the vegetables, please.
not_available You are grounded, my man.
not_available I'm already grounded.
not_available But I wasn't supposed to tell you.
not_available So are you gonna pay for that mirror ? It was $280.
not_available I'm not paying for nothing.
not_available You pay for it.
not_available You don't talk to me that way, you hear ? 
not_available I'll talk to you anyway I want to, bitch.
not_available That's it.
not_available Come on, big man Try me ! 
not_available What's wrong with you ? Let go ! Come on ! This is Jimmy's.
not_available He's sort of the star of our class.
not_available Why ? Well Well His use of gigantism.
not_available Sculpting his little cultural tokens But on such heroic scale.
not_available It sort of forces us to look differently at the things that Surround us.
not_available Sounds pretty stupid, doesn't it ? 
not_available I like this one.
not_available Really ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, this is Anita's.
not_available It's funny.
not_available We always thought her work was kind of surfacy.
not_available I like it.

not_available Russell, this is Ted.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.

not_available I've been, I've been good.
not_available Really really good.
not_available My work has gone to some amazing places Since I got hit by a car.

not_available And I think I saw some evil ninjas down that hallway.
not_available I'll check it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, you dated him ? He was sort of my boyfriend for a while, yeah.
not_available And then he went gay.
not_available And then he ended up with Anita And I switched to Jimmy, I think.
not_available It gets kind of confusing.
not_available You probably think I'm a freak.
not_available I once dated a girl who had a pet donkey, So far be it for me Let's get some wine or something.
not_available Well well well.
not_available If it isn't the queen of disappearance.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey ! These are my friends Jimmy and Anita.

not_available Really.
not_available Please, buy them.
not_available I need clothes and drugs and shampoo.
not_available So did you see the big review of our show in "LA weekly." Oh, no, I guess I missed it.
not_available They said the way Jimmy's sculptures clashed with reality Caused a frisson.

not_available I can't believe what idiots you have to work with.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available They don't listen to me.
not_available They don't respect me.
not_available You sure you're not talking about someone else, baby ? Vanessa treats you like a dog.
not_available She's never going to forgive you.

not_available They can't help it.
not_available I'd forgive you.
not_available I'd even forgive you a second time.
not_available You need a nice mexican girl.
not_available Not one of those puerto rican bitches.
not_available They all got razor blades in their pussies.
not_available Whoa.
not_available You know it's true.
not_available A girl like me, I'd let you be the man of the house.
not_available I'd let you do anything you wanted, Rico.
not_available Anything.
not_available Did you find Jimmy yet ? I'm such a mess, I guess.
not_available I'm always falling in love with people who hate me.
not_available Not always.
not_available Thing is, I'm not even in love with Jimmy.
not_available I want to be Jimmy.
not_available And the paradoxical thing is Underneath all of that I hate Jimmy.
not_available He's He's so self
not_available Absorbed.
not_available He builds a seven
not_available Foot sculpture Of his penis.
not_available It's a lollipop.
not_available It's subliminal, Claire.
not_available Hey, I'm sorry, you know ? About the collage stuff And taking all the credit.
not_available It was part yours.

not_available And the smartest.
not_available Which, of course you know, is not the same thing.
not_available God, shut up.
not_available She smiles.
not_available Do you know how long it's been since I saw that smile ? Where's your self
not_available righteousness ? I guess I lost it.
not_available So, who's this young man you're with tonight ? I'd introduce you to him, but I don't want you to fuck him.
not_available There's yourself righteousness, Claire.
not_available Speaking of ex
not_available boyfriends of mine whom you've had sex with, I heard Billy quit.
not_available Yeah, well, apparently you crushed him.
not_available So you got anything hanging on the wall ? Nada.
not_available I still paint, but it's all shit.
not_available And the only person who buys my art Is my rich patron of a mistress.
not_available Do you know the humiliation involved in that ? I'm sorry.
not_available We all go through fallow periods When we must let the soil rest To prepare for new growth.
not_available Really ? You think that's true ? 
not_available Oh god, please let it be true, Otherwise I'm doomed.
not_available I'd have to stop teaching and start driving a cab.
not_available You don't drive.

not_available Ah, theater.
not_available Don't touch me ! This is going to be pretty inconvenient when I want to butter 
not_available My toast in the morning.
not_available Use a spoon.
not_available Chopsticks ? You can kill a man with a chopstick, David.
not_available Don't you think this is a little drastic ? 
not_available He pulled a knife on me.
not_available You scared him.
not_available Gotta get a stronger lock for his bedroom door.
not_available That way we know when we put him in there he stays in there.
not_available What if there's a fire ? 
not_available Let him burn.
not_available I was nervous about seeing everyone tonight.
not_available Like they were all moving forward with their lives And all doing amazing things While I was going nowhere, but God, they're all exactly where I left them.
not_available And that makes you feel ? I am feeling good.
not_available I had a lot of fun tonight.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available So, I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had no idea eating dinner on a pillow could be so much fun.
not_available It makes me want to throw away every chair in the house.
not_available If you want to take the full experience, You'll have to let me take you to morocco.
not_available Where would you like to enjoy our aperitif ? Your sun porch ? I was thinking we could take it upstairs to the bedroom.
not_available What ? All the way back I was practicing how to say that.
not_available It sounded so silly.
not_available I should have just done this.
not_available He won't even consider that what I'm saying Might actually be valid.
not_available He just wants me to agree with him And say, "wow, Nate ! Gee, yeah.
not_available Quakers.
not_available I never thought of it like that." He hates the fact that I'm questioning Why he's being drawn to something that he knows we can't possibly share.
not_available Brenda, please shut the fuck up.
not_available I can't do this anymore.
not_available All day long I have to listen to my students complain about their problems, And when I finally get a break, I have to listen to you go on about yours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Honestly, I should tape one of your monologues Because you say the same fucking thing every time.
not_available If you want to change the dynamic of your relationship, Then you need to change.
not_available If you want him to open up to you, you need to open up to him.
not_available There, I've said it.

not_available I was expecting you to try to make this work.
