not_available An Open Book So I want you to meet this guy I'm going out with tonight, OK? He's kind of a dork, but in a sweet way.
not_available He seems real, at least.
not_available And he's kinda rich, I think.
not_available Kinda.
not_available Of course, so was Kadeem, and that was a fucking waste of two years of my life.
not_available And ya know what? I knew you never liked Kadeem so I'm gonna bring this guy home to meet you, and this time, I swear, I will pay attention to what you think, because I am one fuckin' hot shit bitch, and he?s fuckin' lucky to have me.
not_available Ooh, that feels so good.
not_available Hey, Tito, come hang with me, OK? Thank you.
not_available Who's my lover? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Aren't you glad I rescued you? You'd better be fuckin' glad.
not_available Cost me 800 bucks in vet bills at a time when things were particularly tight for Mommy, I might add.
not_available One good thing about this guy tonight he's got a big, fat dick, and he fucks like a jackhammer! Those never last.
not_available "JEAN LOUISE McARTHUR 'VIVECA ST.
not_available JOHN' SEPTEMBER 9, 1957
not_available FEBRUARY 17, 2001" David, so glad to see you here.
not_available It's always nice when someone comes back to the fold.
not_available Oh, I've been going to church.
not_available I've just been going to a different church.
not_available Really? Which one? St.
not_available Stephen's.
not_available In the Palisades? No, St.
not_available Stephen's in West Hollywood.
not_available Well, I hope you always feel as welcome here as you did there.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, your father was a deacon here, and we still haven't replaced him.
not_available I think it would be good for this church to listen to a younger voice.
not_available If you're at all interested, I could submit your name to the bishop.
not_available Me? A deacon? David, that's wonderful, your father would be so proud.
not_available Well, sure.
not_available I'd be honored to be considered.
not_available Ruth, how are you holding up? I'm doing OK, Father.
not_available Each day is just a little bit easier.
not_available That's what I love hearing.
not_available Wow! What a small world! Do you go to this church? I just joined.
not_available I was raised Catholic, so I like the whole, you know, ritual part of it.
not_available Oooh, you smell good.
not_available What is that? Who are you? Oh my God.
not_available I can't believe I've never introduced myself.
not_available It seems like we've known each other forever.
not_available I'm Tracy Montrose Blair.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm David
not_available Fisher.
not_available I know.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available OK.
not_available Why? Because my Uncle Walt was buried at your funeral home.
not_available Old guy.
not_available Cancer.
not_available Had a tattoo of a roulette wheel on his back.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available I have a tattoo.
not_available A butterfly.
not_available I think you should know that I'm not really available.
not_available You have a girlfriend? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Serious? 
not_available We're engaged.
not_available Oh, well, good for you! Most men your age are so commitment
not_available phobic it's pathetic.
not_available Yes, men are pigs.
not_available Or they're gay.
not_available Well, I'm certainly glad to find out you're not gay.
not_available I have to go.
not_available My mother's waiting.
not_available She seems nice.
not_available She seems nuts.
not_available Hello! Out here! Hey.
not_available This is the life, huh? Apparently.
not_available So how often do Mommy and Daddy go away? Oh, constantly.
not_available They're very important people.
not_available Very important places to go.
not_available Lucky for them, I have absolutely nowhere to go.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm good.
not_available It's chilly today.
not_available Aren't you cold? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Jeez, it's like a hot tub in here.
not_available Mommy and Daddy keep it this hot all the time, even in summer.
not_available They're very wasteful.
not_available That's just wrong.
not_available Man, you areWhat? 
not_available You're unlike any woman I've ever met.
not_available Good.
not_available You scare me a little.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available There's just so much I don't know about you.
not_available Me? I am an open book.
not_available I'm so glad you're bringing your friends home.
not_available You know, you haven't done that in years.
not_available What are you doing here? You said you'd be gone through the weekend.
not_available Yes, it's Sunday.
not_available It's the end of the weekend.
not_available Nate, these are my parents, Margaret and Bernard Chenowith.
not_available Margaret and Bernard, this is Nate Fisher, the man I am having sex with.
not_available Hello.
not_available Brenda has told us absolutely nothing about you.
not_available Well, you know what? I'm not surprised.
not_available I'm not sure there's that much to tell.
not_available Oh, don't be so modest.
not_available Nate's studying for his funeral director's license.
not_available Well, Nate, you'll have to tell us all about that.
not_available Won't you stay for lunch? At least a drink or two? 
not_available I'd like to, but I really have to study.
not_available Well, then you'll have to join us for dinner some time.
not_available Uh
not_available that sounds great.
not_available Great.
not_available OK, Mrs.
not_available Fisher, I've asked you here today so we could talk about your relationship with Claire.
not_available I told her it wasn't my idea.
not_available Uh, now, Claire feels that being the youngest child, perhaps, she might have missed out on a time when the family was happier.
not_available No.
not_available That's what you said.
not_available I told you.
not_available I don't think there was a time that this family was ever happy.
not_available That is not true.
not_available There was lots of happiness.
not_available When the boys were young.
not_available When you were young, Claire.
not_available You were a very happy little girl, and you know it.
not_available Just because I was too young to realize what freaks we were.
not_available Why would you come into this man's office and tell him we were never happy? I don't know.
not_available Because I grew up in a house that was usually filled with total strangers who were crying all the time.
not_available Oh, boo hoo! I grew up in a two
not_available room apartment over a barber shop, and I spent my teenage years taking care of my grandmother after one, and then both, of her legs were amputated.
not_available Life's hard! / Mrs.
not_available Fisher
not_available You had a roof over you head.
not_available You didn't go hungry.
not_available You see, she gets up on this cross, and then there's just no talking to her.
not_available You did not have to go begging for food on the streets of Calcutta.
not_available What? Because I wasn't dropped in a dumpster somewhere, I'm not supposed to want things to be better? This is good.
not_available This is good for you to talk like this.
not_available These are obviously things you need to say.
not_available So what? Are we just supposed to fight and get on each other's nerves? I prefer the not talking thing.
not_available I think you should try to have more of a dialogue.
not_available Make time for it.
not_available Schedule it.
not_available Remember, any relationship is work.
not_available OK? Excellent session.
not_available That's it? Now that's up to you, isn't it? He does this for like five different schools.
not_available She should look spectacular.
not_available You know, that's the most important thing.
not_available We'll make sure that she looks her best.
not_available She was the real deal, you know? She was a star.
not_available And I can assure you we will give her a funeral that befits the star that she was and always will be.
not_available You know who she was? Absolutely, and I'm a big fan of hers.
not_available Hey, Rico.
not_available Holy moley! Feel.
not_available They're really hard.
not_available Uh.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Like a rock.
not_available You see how they're all cockeyed? They've got this low
not_available cut flimsy thing they want her in, and they said absolutely no bra.
not_available Shit.
not_available I don't know what the heck I'm gonna do.
not_available Maybe I could like tape 'em together somehow.
not_available Do you know where this stuff goes? If I put it in the wrong place, David will bitch at me for a week.
not_available Top left, above the purple stuff.
not_available Well, boys, this might just be our highest profit
not_available margin funeral this year.
not_available She's rich, huh? The guy who's paying for it is.
not_available Huh, she looks so familiar to me.
not_available She was an actress.
not_available Viveca St.
not_available John.
not_available Oh my God, you're right! That's her? Oh, fuck! And apparently she was quite talented.
not_available She was a porno star.
not_available What?!? David, she was huge like back in the mid to late 80s.
not_available Come on, you never saw any of her videos? No, Nate, I missed those.
not_available Oh, man! This chick fucked a snake.
not_available This chick fucked like 30 guys at one time.
not_available I saw that! I saw that! My cousin Ramone showed me when I was like 12.
not_available On the diving board, OK? They were like wrapped around the pool.
not_available Did you see the one where the guy's riding this motorcycle that she's strapped to, so he's fucking her while he's riding around in circles? Oh, shit! Nate, can I speak to you outside for a minute? Dammit, Nate! The woman on that table is just as deserving of dignity as anyone else we prepare, and Federico is an employee.
not_available It's up to you and me to set an example for him, alright? Alright, I'm sorry.
not_available Show some respect.
not_available These are human lives we're dealing with here.
not_available These are not organic blackberries or granola in bulk.
not_available I said I'm sorry.
not_available I don't want you to be sorry.
not_available I want you to remember that what we do here is serious.
not_available Because it really sucks for me always having to be the spoilsport.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, Bernard Chenowith.
not_available Hi.
not_available Margaret and I were wondering if you would join us for dinner.
not_available Tomorrow night.
not_available Tell him we're not gonna take no for an answer.
not_available You hear that? Well, actually, I have a lot of studying to do for this exam.
not_available I'd really like toNate, we'd really love to be able to get a sense of who you are, and I'm sure you're curious about us as well, right? Uh
not_available Good.
not_available Shall we say seven
not_available ish? Can I bring anything? Hello? Suck on that, you little fuck! Hi, there's this thing called knocking.
not_available It's like protected in the first amendment.
not_available I rented some videos.
not_available I thought you and I could watch them tonight.
not_available Remember when you were in middle school? You and I used to go to the movies every Monday night.
not_available Remember how much fun we had? I remember seeing a lot of really bad movies.
not_available What'd you get? Runaway Bride and The Nutty Professor.
not_available Cool.
not_available It'll be good for business, too.
not_available Dad was a deacon there, and it's a big congregation.
not_available People die, families don't know where to go, and the church sends them our way.
not_available They know you're gay? I think Father Jack has a pretty good idea.
not_available You think he likes you? Keith
not_available Does this mean that you're not going to be going to church with me anymore? Well, if they make me a deacon, I'd have to go there all the time, yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know.
not_available Sunday's sort of been our day.
not_available I think it's great.
not_available I really do.
not_available The things I love about you, it's the fact that your religion means so much to you.
not_available Besides, I think it could be kind of hot, you know? Dating a man of the cloth.
not_available I need you to do something for me.
not_available What is it, my son? You know the Gay Firemen and Police Officers Club I belong to? Well, we're having a party in the Laguna this weekend.
not_available I want you to be my date.
not_available Your date? Will I get a corsage? I want you to start meeting some of my friends, David.
not_available I'd like that.
not_available Oh, forgive me, Father, for I am about to sin.
not_available This is an entire movie about expelling gas.
not_available I think that's why people like it.
not_available I don't want to watch this.
not_available Good, because neither do I.
not_available Claire, look.
not_available I know you probably think I'm old and stupid.
not_available No, Mom, I don't.
not_available But I love you just as much as I ever did, and I'm worried about you, and I don't know how to help.
not_available I don't need help! Why is everyone acting like I'm in the Trenchcoat Mafia? You stole a foot! A human foot! OK, you wanna know why? Because some guy who totally scammed me into having sex with him because I thought he actually cared about me
not_available he told the entire school that I sucked his toes, and then when I confronted him about it, he showed entirely no remorse, so when I saw Nate drop the foot on the floor, I just grabbed it, just to get back at that asshole, OK? It wasn't premeditated.
not_available I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer.
not_available I don't get off on hacked
not_available up body parts.
not_available You're having sex?!? Oh, Jesus.
not_available No, I'm sorry, I cannot have this conversation with you.
not_available And I'm really sorry, but I don't think we're ever gonna have one of these touchyfeely mother
not_available daughter relationships like you see on TV and the movies, because, you know why? They don't exist! Ah, here's our guest! And he brought us a bottle of.
not_available OK, a man who knows his wine.
not_available My, I'm liking you more and more, Nate.
not_available Well, I worked at a food co
not_available op in Seattle for a long time, learned a little bit.
not_available A co
not_available op? So there's a little hippie in there, huh? That makes sense.
not_available Brenda would find that attractive.
not_available She likes to think of herself as being wildly countercultural, but I think she's actually just jealous that Bern and I really were hippies
not_available briefly.
not_available Now, can I offer you a drink? Sure.
not_available You have any beer? No.
not_available We have vodka, scotch, bourbon Uh, I'll have a little bourbon.
not_available Manly but not elitist.
not_available Just her type.
not_available Down, girl.
not_available So where is Brenda? Brenda? Oh, Brenda's not coming tonight.
not_available Really? 
not_available Well, she felt, and I really have to agree with her, that we'd have a much better chance of getting to know each other if she weren't here.
not_available You know, she does tend to take center stage, so to speak.
not_available Huh.
not_available I kind of wish somebody'd thought to tell me about this.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I assumed she did.
not_available There you are.
not_available David was raised in this church.
not_available He was christened and confirmed here.
not_available He served as an altar boy, and he was president of the Youth Ministry in high school.
not_available How old are you, David? I'm 31.
not_available What do you do for a living? 
not_available I'm a funeral director.
not_available Ah.
not_available His father served as a deacon for over a decade.
not_available He just recently passed away.
not_available So, you see this as a sort of passing the torch? No, sir, I see it as a chance to serve God.
not_available Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.
not_available Because that's what it is.
not_available Being a deacon here is more than just having access to the church mailing list and passing out your business cards after Mass.
not_available Sir, I won't deny that I run a business providing service to people in times of need, but I would never exploit my relationship to the church for marketing purposes.
not_available Frankly, I would consider that to be a pretty grave sin.
not_available No pun intended.
not_available St.
not_available Bartholomew is an old church, a conservative church, a church that doesn't need to have its boat rocked.
not_available Which is precisely why I feel that David is such a good candidate.
not_available How many men his age have values as strong as his? I think he would be an excellent role model.
not_available Are you married? 
not_available Uh, no, sir.
not_available I was engaged briefly.
not_available Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about yourself before I consider this? No, sir.
not_available Is there anything specific about me you'd like to ask? I'll let you know my decision in a few days.
not_available You impressed him.
not_available You think? Yes.
not_available Oh, by the way, one of our parishioners recently lost her father to liver cancer
not_available Sharon Murdoch.
not_available I gave her your name.
not_available You may be getting a call.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Again, with the not knocking.
not_available Pack some things.
not_available We're going to San Bernadino.
not_available What? We're spending the night at my cousin, Hannah's.
not_available Mom, I'm doing homework.
not_available Well, stop.
not_available I have school tomorrow.
not_available I'll write a note! You know, it's been such a long time since Brenda's wanted us to meet any of the men in her life.
not_available What was that last one? A chiropractor? 
not_available Oh, he was a rolfer.
not_available He was an idiot.
not_available Well, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure Brenda ever meant for us to meet.
not_available I don't think she really expected you guys to come home that day.
not_available Oh, Nate, where Brenda's concerned,there are no coincidences.
not_available You think she planned all this? Of course.
not_available She is a master manipulator.
not_available I mean, I love her dearly, but you really oughtta know what you're getting into.
not_available Now, would you like another bourbon? Uh
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Can I ask you guys something? As long as it doesn't involve asking us for money.
not_available Uh, no, it doesn't.
not_available Does the name, "Nathaniel," have any significance to you? Well, sure.
not_available Nathaniel and Isabel.
not_available Brenda adored these books as a little girl.
not_available She could read by the time she was three.
not_available What are they about? Two orphans who had adventures.
not_available They ran away from an orphanage.
not_available There was a malevolent nurse who was always hunting them down, but they always managed to outsmart her.
not_available Typical infantile wish
not_available fulfillment.
not_available Hmm.
not_available I've never heard of them.
not_available They're British.
not_available Quite dark.
not_available People die in them all the time.
not_available When Brenda's brother was born, we expected serious displacement anxiety from her, but there was none.
not_available She would sit next to his crib, and read him these stories for hours.
not_available She was what then, Bern, 4? 
not_available 5 at the most.
not_available It's all in the book.
not_available This book? You mean she didn't tell you about that either? Ruthie, I am so glad you called.
not_available Ginnie and I would never allow ourselves this kind of food unless it were a really special occasion.
not_available We are definitely gonna have to do another spinning class this week.
not_available Tomorrow morning.
not_available Who's teaching? 
not_available Derrick.
not_available Oooh, I am so there! Mom and I have the biggest crush onthis spinning director at the "Y." He is hot, hot, hot.
not_available So, Claire, have you thought about college? Yeah, I'd love to go to, like, NYU or Columbia, but I don't know if I'd ever get in, so
not_available Well, there are some great schools in LA.
not_available Well, yeah, but why would you wanna go to school in the same town you grew up in? I go to Cal State, right here in San Berdo.
not_available Well, whatever rocks your boat.
not_available Claire
not_available Hey, I love it.
not_available By living at home, I'm saving a ton of money for grad school.
not_available I'm not stuck in some crappy dorm where everyone's smoking pot and playing loud music all the time.
not_available And I don't have to call campus police every time I wanna walk home from the library so I don't get raped.
not_available And I like to stay close to my mom.
not_available She probably just stays so I get to do her laundry.
not_available Oh, that's not true! I love my mom, and I'm not ashamed of it.
not_available Thank you, honey, and I love you too.
not_available OK, anybody want more? So how was it? 
not_available Oh, it was quite informative.
not_available I know what "Nathaniel" means now, I know you have an IQ of 185, 
not_available I know you had a book written about you.
not_available Here, I signed it for you.
not_available Why didn't you just tell me about this? People always change towards me after they read it.
not_available I was just trying to make the fun part last.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available So you're kind of scarily brilliant.
not_available I can handle that.
not_available What I can't handle is the way you keep mindfucking me for your own personal entertainment, and it's really starting to piss me off.
not_available Well, I'm sorry I'm not some well
not_available behaved little nothing that never challenges you, but if that's what you're looking for, you might as well just leave right now.
not_available So, what, are you trying to drive me away? Oh, yeah, I'm trying to drive you away, Nate.
not_available It was my mother's idea that I not be there, which is fine by me.
not_available I don't really enjoy their company.
not_available She said it was your idea.
not_available Yeah, she would.
not_available She probably believes it.
not_available She's out of her fucking mind! You could have warned me what I was walking into.
not_available You wouldn't have gone.
not_available I just wanted to get it all out of the way.
not_available Them.
not_available The Book.
not_available Everything.
not_available Yeah, well, I felt like a fuckin' lab rat over there.
not_available Yeah, that's what they do! I'm 6 years old.
not_available I score through the roof on some standardized, culturally
not_available biased test, and it all becomes about them.
not_available They hand me over to strangers, experts, a bunch of academic fucks who scrutinize everything I did or said or thought even.
not_available It is a fucking law of physics that the very act of observation changes that which is being observed.
not_available And now you're gonna read that book and think that you know me.
not_available Well, you know what? You don't.
not_available Yeah, because you won't let me.
not_available OK.
not_available Fine.
not_available What do you wanna know? Ask me anything.
not_available Did you burn down that house that we made love in? You think I burned down the house? Really? That is so weird! Well, what am I supposed to think? You put my brother and me in the bus that killed our father, you get weird phone calls from screaming people that you won't explain, and now, oh, you want to make me feel stupid for being suspicious.
not_available Well, give me a fuckin' reason not to be! I just wanna know what this is.
not_available Why you
not_available Am I just another step along your way? OK, look.
not_available We obviously have an intense sexual connection, and, yes, I would like for there to be something more than that, but that can't ever happen until you trust me, which, apparently, you don't.
not_available Should I trust you? Yes.
not_available Come here.
not_available R RA RAK RAK
not_available E.
not_available Woo! Triple letter score for "K." Good one, Mom! H HE HEL HEL
not_available L.
not_available HELL
not_available O.
not_available Hello! D DE DEF DEF
not_available T.
not_available Deft.
not_available What is "deft"? Well, it's a laundry detergent from when Ruth and I were kids.
not_available No, it's a word.
not_available It means "skilled.
not_available " Really? 
not_available Use it in a sentence.
not_available "He deftly juggled his responsibilities.
not_available " Deft.
not_available Huh.
not_available Or, "Deft, where ith thy thting?" So how are you both doing? You know, with Nathaniel's passing? 
not_available Better every day.
not_available Yeah, you know, shit happens.
not_available You know, it's such an awful thing losing someone you love.
not_available In terms of stress, it's right up there with moving and getting fired.
not_available Mm hmm.
not_available I know when Ed and I split up, I was just devastated.
not_available I didn't even want to get out of bed.
not_available I just wanted to curl up and die.
not_available And all I can say is thank God for my precious daughter.
not_available Well, I just wouldn't let her mope.
not_available Just wouldn't let her.
not_available Dragged her ass, pardon my French, out of bed and took her to spinning class with me.
not_available And I hated her for it at the time, but it really got me back on track.
not_available You know, endorphins really are nature's anti
not_available depressants.
not_available Mm hmm.
not_available Life goes on.
not_available It doesn't go on by itself.
not_available Sometimes you just gotta kick it in the butt.
not_available But Ed didn't die.
not_available He's still alive.
not_available You can still see him.
not_available When Ginnie gets married, you'll both be there.
not_available When she has children, they'll be able to know him.
not_available He's not gone forever.
not_available Oh, well sure, but in terms of the impact it had on both of our lives, it's similar.
not_available I had the greatest idea! You guys are coming to spinning class with us tomorrow morning, bright and early.
not_available No offense, but I'd rather drive a rusty railroad spike through my skull.
not_available Oh, just try it once.
not_available You might be surprised how it changes the way that you feel.
not_available I feel fine.
not_available You know what, Ginnie? That is an absolutely inspired idea! OK, ladies, let's get to bed, because if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 AM, Derrick doesn't let us in.
not_available So these tits do nothin' for ya, huh? Well, I can appreciate that they are beautiful.
not_available In their own completely artificial way.
not_available Men loved them.
not_available Well, real men.
not_available Do you think God cares that you're gay? Do you think God cares that you fucked 30 guys at once? Oh, so you equate being a fag with being a whore! 
not_available No.
not_available One's OK but one isn't? 
not_available I think God appreciates it when there's love involved.
not_available Oh, honey, I loved every man I ever fucked while I was fuckin' him What are you doing? 
not_available Watching you.
not_available Claire, wake up! Get dressed! Why? 
not_available We're leaving early.
not_available Jesus, Mom, I'm starting to feel like Anne Frank! If we don't get out of here fast, we'll have to go spinning! 
not_available Oh my God! Thanks for buying me breakfast.
not_available Thank you for finding my G
not_available spot this morning.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Oh, I have something for you.
not_available Wow! 
not_available Oh, come on, it's just a key.
not_available No, no, no, this is great.
not_available I'm just a little surprised, that's all.
not_available I'm too nervous to eat.
not_available I'll just drink coffee until I start twitching and sweating.
not_available Why does being a deacon mean so much to you now? It wasn't even a consideration for you a week ago.
not_available Look, I know you think it's naive, but I see it as a chance to make a difference, make the world just a little more tolerant.
not_available David, we have our own church in West Hollywood, which means the other churches and dioceses don't have to tolerate us.
not_available Frankly, I resent the notion that we need to be tolerated.
not_available So what? We should just allow ourselves to be ghettoized? Why do you embrace an organization that doesn't embrace you? 
not_available The church embraces everyone.
not_available Oh, yeah, right.
not_available Hate the sin, love the sinner? The operative word being "hate.
not_available " What is it with you? The other night you said you liked the idea.
not_available I had a chance to think.
not_available Isn't that your brother? Hey, can we just have breakfast without feeling like I'm George Will and you're Cokie Roberts with PMS? You'd probably like George Will.
not_available Dave.
not_available Uh, hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Keith, you remember my brother, Nate, don't you? Yeah, how's it going? 
not_available Hey.
not_available This is Brenda, my uh
not_available my girlfriend.
not_available I prefer the term "fuck puppet.
not_available " So what are you guys doing here? You just play racquetball? Uh, no, we just worked out.
not_available So you guys work out together? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available Oh, well, uh, that
not_available that's great.
not_available Uh, OK, great OK, you guys, have a great day.
not_available You, too.
not_available Bye, David.
not_available Oh my God, I think David is gay.
not_available I think David is lucky.
not_available Did you get a look at that guy? Claire? I had an affair.
not_available For the last two years, I was seeing someone.
not_available Your father never knew about it, at least I hope he didn't.
not_available And I called it off after he died.
not_available It's not something I'm proud of.
not_available Why are you telling me this? 
not_available Because it's the truth, and whatever relationship you and I have, I want it to be honest, even if you hate me.
not_available Mom, I don't hate you.
not_available I remember going to the movies on Monday nights.
not_available But I'm 17 years old now, and I have my own life, and there's things I have to figure out on my own,and that's, like, normal.
not_available And I know stealing a foot is weird, but, hello, living in a house where a foot is available to be stolen is weird.
not_available I've gotta get to school.
not_available Did you see his face? Oh, man, I know I shouldn't be laughing,but he just looked so stupefied! The way he was all, "Great, great.
not_available I'm hip, I'm cool.
not_available " I'm proud of you, man.
not_available So, listen, this thing we're doing Saturday night.
not_available I got us a room at the Surfin' Center.
not_available You ever been there? No.
not_available Oh, man, it's gonna be great! It's got a fireplace overlooking the ocean.
not_available Keith, I don't think I can make it after all.
not_available I shouldn't miss church, not while they're considering me for deaconship.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fine.
not_available We'll come back Saturday night.
not_available That'll work.
not_available I can go to church with you on Sunday.
not_available It's not a good idea.
not_available This hasn't been a good idea from the beginning, has it? Fine.
not_available Why don't we cut our losses and call it quits right now? What?Look, as long as you feel the need to keep our relationship a secret David, you're ashamed of it, man.
not_available I'm not having any of that.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I just came out to my brother! One step forward, now you wanna take a giant leap backwards right into the arms of the enemy! So now I'm a Nazi collaborator? You know, a lot of African Americans might saythe same thing about you being a member of the LAPD.
not_available You're a fucking coward! Keith, please dont
not_available It works! I must have left the stereo on again.
not_available So, you are not too freaked out? 
not_available A little, maybe.
not_available It certainly makes David more interesting.
not_available No, I mean about me giving you a key to my apartment.
not_available Oh, come on, what do you think I am? Some sort of aging Peter Pan who's gonna disappear at the first sign of something a little more permanent? Well, yeah.
not_available Yeah, well, you're one to talk.
not_available You wouldn't even allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend.
not_available Don't mind me.
not_available I thought we agreed that you would call before you came over.
not_available I did.
not_available The hot water's out at my building.
not_available I needed to take a shower.
not_available Oh, don't be mad at me.
not_available You know, I hate it when you're mad at me.
not_available Satisfied? 
not_available I am going to make a cup of tea.
not_available Hey, I'll take one of those.
not_available Hey, you behave yourself.
not_available Hi, what's your name? 
not_available Nate.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available I'm Billy.
not_available Hi.
not_available So how long have you known Brenda? Uh
not_available a few months.
not_available So, uh
not_available What? Who am I and why am I in your girlfriend?shouse practically naked? Yeah.
not_available She's my sister.
not_available She's my mother.
not_available Sister.
not_available My mother.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Nobody's ever laughed at that.
not_available I should know better.
not_available Well, it's nice to meet you.
not_available So, you meet the parents yet? 
not_available Yes, last night.
not_available Wow.
not_available You've made it pretty far.
not_available So why haven't I heard about you? No idea.
not_available Well, I guess I'd better go put some clothes on.
not_available How'd you get her breasts synchronized? By some industrial epoxy? Would you ask Colonel Sanders for his secret recipe? Oh, come on, who am I gonna tell? I stuck a can of cat food under each one.
not_available My sisterin
not_available law did a cat food commercial.
not_available I've got like ten cases.
not_available Hey, I'm Larry Wadd.
not_available You know, I met Viveca St.
not_available John before she even did her first video.
not_available She was, uh, she was the fluffer on the set of "Dirty Larry III." She was, uh, friendly, she was eager, and I could honestly say I never received a better blowjob in my life.
not_available Nobody was even filming it! When I first met Viveca, I met her on "Deep Diving.
not_available " Thank you.
not_available And I had never gone down on a girl before, so, naturally, I was nervous, but Viveca was so warm and relaxed about it.
not_available She really put me at ease.
not_available Well, her and the two Zanex she gave me.
not_available And when I first had to do a double penetration, I was like a total wreck.
not_available But Viveca came through like, you know, like such the pro she is I mean was.
not_available Nate, what the hell is going on in there? Uh
not_available Funeral.
not_available For whom? Prostitute? A woman who was a star of adult videos.
not_available Mom, we're gonna clear like 8 grand from this.
not_available We can finally pay for that air conditioning work.
not_available I'm just glad your sister is at school.
not_available It was awful.
not_available They're like best friends.
not_available And they're both like cheerleaders, this totally plastic way of life.
not_available Like spinning class solves everything.
not_available And they're both like hot for the same guy.
not_available It was creepy.
not_available My mom's
not_available My mom's just so fucking sad.
not_available I wish I could help her.
not_available So help her.
not_available Now, Mrs.
not_available Murdoch, some people prefer the solemnity of a church, and St.
not_available Bartholomew is a beautiful setting.
not_available Here, however, one is more free to customize the service.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just had to tell somebody Viveca looked so great.
not_available Her tits have never looked better.
not_available She was like a sister to me.
not_available I'm so glad that you're pleased.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We want to remember her at her very best, don't we? 
not_available Now, I'm sorry, but I'm helping some other people right now.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll talk to you after the service.
not_available OK.
not_available I think we'll have Dad's service at the church.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm not a religious man, but I do believe in God.
not_available If I were to make a list of the things I thank God for the most, fucking Viv would be at the top of the list.
not_available She was a goddamned force of nature.
not_available And I loved her.
not_available And I know God loved her, too, and I know that he knew just what he was doing, and how much joy she would bring to the world.
not_available For David James Fisher, chosen deacon in your church, we pray to you, O, Lord.
not_available That he may faithfully fulfill the duties of this ministry, build up your church, and glorify your name, we pray to you, O Lord.
not_available That by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, he may be sustained and encouraged to persevere to the end, we pray to you, O Lord.
not_available For all who fear God and believe in you, Lord Christ, that our divisions may cease and that all may be as one as you and the father are one, we pray to you, O Lord.
not_available O Lord, hear our prayer.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available Way to go, Dave.
not_available All we have to do is join the Koanis Club and Fisher &amp; Sons will have all our bases covered.
not_available Hey, where's Keith?
not_available He's just a friend, Nate.
not_available So, Mom, what are you doing tomorrow night? Nothing as far as I know.
not_available Why? I thought maybe you'd wanna go see a movie or rent a movie or something.
not_available OK.
not_available But if you cry, the whole thing is off.
not_available Thanks for coming today.
not_available I know you must have found this all a little
not_available Are you kidding? I loved it.
not_available All that pageantry.
not_available It's so trippy.
not_available It's like a Fellini movie.
not_available Well, it was kinda cool being with you here, in front of God and everybody.
not_available You don't really believe in God, do you? Well, yeah.
not_available I mean, I don't believe in some bearded old white man up on a cloud.
not_available But I believe in something.
not_available Some sort of undefinable creative force.
not_available I think it's just all totally random.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available We live, we die.
not_available Ultimately, nothing means anything.
not_available How can you live like that? I don't know.
not_available Sometimes I wake up so fuckin' empty, I wish I'd never been born, but what choice do I have?
