
not_available Why didn't you accept the complimentary map of the trail? I've done this hike a hundred times before.
not_available You're the one who insisted on making a left at the last marker.
not_available Because the other way didn't look like a trail.
not_available That was the trail! Fine.
not_available Everything in the entire world is my fault.
not_available Not everything.
not_available Just the fact that we're now totally lost and I'm totally dehydrated.
not_available If you were so sure about the damn trail, which you weren't, then why didn't you What is that down there? I told you there was something.
not_available You never believe me, you get just like your mother.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Just be honest for once.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Something's moving.
not_available Somebody's in there.
not_available They're trapped.
not_available No, they're not.
not_available Must have driven off that dirt road up there.
not_available It's been sitting here for years.
not_available Why would they have an accident and just leave their car to rot? Maybe because they're still in it.
not_available OK, I'm fading.
not_available I can't even keep my eyes open.
not_available I need to get a cup of coffee.
not_available You fell asleep on the phone last night.
not_available I did not! I was talking for 30 minutes straight and I was thinking, "It's so good to get these things out," and then I'm sorry.
not_available I haven't slept in three nights.
not_available I've been devouring this Camille Claudel biography.
not_available Remember me saying my brother's getting married on Saturday? To the woman with no chin.
not_available That's right.
not_available So I didn't totally bore you.
not_available I know it's kind of last minute, but I was thinking if you weren't doing anything I mean, if it wouldn't be completely painful for you to come with me It's not a date.
not_available It sounds like a date.
not_available But it's not.
not_available OK, it's a date.
not_available You can be my date.
not_available Sure.
not_available I mean Why not? Of course I'll go with you.
not_available OK, it got weird, didn't it? And I did it.
not_available I hate life.
not_available Claire, I really like our friendship and I would never What's with the chitty
not_available chat? You can focus on your work or you can gossip like old blind women.
not_available It's your decision.
not_available Finally you draw what you see, not what you think you see.
not_available I like it.
not_available Claire, you and I should talk.
not_available Look, everything I do sucks today, I know.
not_available This isn't about your work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Of course.
not_available You're not gonna believe this.
not_available Olivier asked me to be his assistant.
not_available I start tomorrow.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I feel like I just won something.
not_available I never win anything.
not_available Me neither.
not_available I guess any of these would be fine.
not_available Honey, you actually have to pick one.
not_available Chris, how am I supposed to know what kind of casket Will would want? He disappeared over 25 years ago and I can hardly remember how he took his coffee.
not_available I myself like the deluxe Aegean.
not_available It's a little on the high end but it's very calming, it's like a slow, lulling ride on on the Aegean, I guess.
not_available I need to sit down.
not_available Take your time.
not_available We know how hard this is for you.
not_available He went out for a newspaper one day, and never came back.
not_available So I figured he'd deserted me.
not_available Which made sense, because we were one of those horrible got married too soon for all the wrong reasons couples.
not_available Now I find out he didn't run away at all, he died in a freak accident.
not_available What am I supposed to do with all these years of feeling like he deserted us? Honey, we don't even need to do a funeral.
not_available It's just an empty ritual.
not_available Actually, the closure it provides is quite powerful and quite healing.
not_available The strange part is where they found him, in that canyon.
not_available It was ten miles from where we lived.
not_available What was he doing there? 
not_available Maybe he got lost.
not_available Right.
not_available Looking for a newspaper on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere? Do you think he was seeing someone else? I have no idea.
not_available He could have been.
not_available Diane, let's make a decision on the casket and get out of here.
not_available Will was Jewish, so The Sampson.
not_available It's plain cedar.
not_available Got it.
not_available I can finish out the week, if you need.
not_available Claire, you got another job, go do it.
not_available It's an amazing opportunity to learn from Olivier Castro
not_available Staal, maybe help him with his art, do something meaningful instead of just You know? Fine.
not_available I wasn't crazy about you doing pickups and deliveries anyway.
not_available We have enough actual employees here.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Wait, this is for you.
not_available What's that, a goodbye gift? It's a box of bones I just picked up from the coroner.
not_available William Jaffe.
not_available Here, catch.
not_available Just kidding.
not_available I'm not sure this is a good idea.
not_available It's perfect.
not_available We were saving some by using Claire.
not_available We can save a lot with an apprentice.
not_available I've crunched the numbers.
not_available You can crunch numbers? 
not_available Of course I can.
not_available It's free labour.
not_available We give him a place to live, he gets credit from mortuary school and we don't have to pay him bupkiss.
not_available As Mr F used to say.
not_available Well? I don't know, I think this house is already a little crowded.
not_available You mean with your wife and baby? I'm just saying that How do we even know someone will want the job? I've got five seniors from Cypress lined up, dying to interview.
not_available I think we should do it.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available Isn't someone going to ask me how I feel about this? After all, since none of you actually live here, I'd be the one who's forced to coexist with a stranger who could kill me.
not_available She's right.
not_available It's not fair to her.
not_available Mrs F, we can save up to $10,000 a year, according to my projections.
not_available I don't want loud rock music in this house.
not_available No rock music.
not_available Got it.
not_available So you guys wanna look at the resumes they faxed over? Are you kidding? I'm dying to.
not_available Mom, you don't have to be a martyr.
not_available It's for you.
not_available You need to make more money now that Lisa's a stayat
not_available home.
not_available A what? A stayat
not_available home mother.
not_available They're called that now, like you have some bracelet on your foot that will ring if you leave your house.
not_available Lisa's going back to work.
not_available Of course.
not_available When Maya goes to kindergarten.
not_available Why are you holding a mousetrap? 
not_available I found a box of them.
not_available Remember when we had that infestation? 
not_available Those things are cruel.
not_available Mice have germs.
not_available They deserve to die.
not_available Let's just hope that bad rehearsal means good show tomorrow.
not_available Good night, everybody.
not_available David.
not_available What? Was my solo awful? No, no, it's it's good.
not_available It is.
not_available But I think you need to stop trying to make it so perfect.
not_available Just try to be more relaxed with it.
not_available See you tomorrow night.
not_available We're going out for a drink.
not_available It's only gonna be A drink, yes, absolutely.
not_available Dennis can kiss my lily
not_available white ass.
not_available It's not like it's the Met.
not_available Hey, he's just trying to I mean, your solo is a little What? 
not_available It's prissy.
not_available It's like a little girl's doll house.
not_available It's like a kitty
not_available cat greeting card.
not_available Like a poofy white cutesy
not_available pie.
not_available Thanks, Terry, I get the point.
not_available God.
not_available I was just trying to make it sound pretty.
not_available That's the point, dear 
not_available don't.
not_available Just sing from someplace real.
not_available God, when did I become 400 years old? On your last birthday.
not_available Not that you would remember anything.
not_available He was trying to convince this guy that he used to be in Cirque du Soleil.
not_available Show him the "coming down from a trapeze" look.
not_available I have to go to the bathroom.
not_available I'll get a check so we can get out of here.
not_available He is obsessed with trading spaces.
not_available We're lucky we got him this long.
not_available Look, I know I'm not supposed to say anything but I will.
not_available I feel weird not acknowledging it.
not_available What? 
not_available You know.
not_available It.
not_available How we know each other.
not_available From chorus? 
not_available Fine, just pretend.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available From the bathroom at Sears.
not_available It was about seven, eight years ago? You jerked me off.
not_available The second stall.
not_available The security guy almost caught us.
not_available You're confusing me with someone else.
not_available Come on.
not_available You checked me out in automotive supplies, I followed you into home appliances.
not_available We met in the secondfloor john 
not_available This wasn't me.
not_available Please.
not_available Fine, be that way.
not_available Is that enough? Do you need more? I think 40 is too much.
not_available So, David, is your boyfriend coming to the concert? Yeah, he's supposed to.
not_available I can't wait to meet him.
not_available Goddammit.
not_available Aren't there instructions? A page of hieroglyphics showing nothing that came in this box.
not_available What are you doing? I'm circling problem purchases on the Visa bill.
not_available Problem purchases? Things we've bought that maybe we didn't need or could buy less of.
not_available You mean things I bought.
not_available Are the smiley faces good purchases? No, I was just doodling.
not_available I don't see why these are problem purchases.
not_available This is lunch with David.
not_available I had to eat.
not_available You didn't have to spend $55.
not_available What did you have? A couple of sandwiches.
not_available This country's insane.
not_available You dropped $80 at Book Soup.
not_available I guess you haven't heard of libraries.
not_available Libraries are depressing.
not_available Nate you're not single any more, you can't keep spending like you are.
not_available I'll try to cut down.
not_available Until you get back to work.
not_available Actually, I'm holding off looking for another job.
not_available Really? For how long? I don't know.
not_available We'll see.
not_available Because my mom seems to think it's until Maya starts kindergarten.
not_available This is not a decision you can make without me.
not_available That was a late rehearsal.
not_available Yeah, we just The concert's tomorrow night, so What time should I be there? I don't get off until nine at the earliest.
not_available You can't make it? David, I did everything I could to change my schedule.
not_available I understand.
not_available You can come to the next one.
not_available Boy, just twist the knife in deeper.
not_available I oughta talk to Frank about this.
not_available You really don't have to come.
not_available It's not a big deal, I'm not angry.
not_available Really? Thank you for being so aware that this isn't about you.
not_available We really are making progress.
not_available This is really fucked up.
not_available Missing your concert for this lame
not_available ass job.
not_available I should just call in sick.
not_available No, don't.
not_available How did my life become so meaningless? I used to make a difference.
not_available I used to protect people's lives.
not_available Now I just protect their stuff.
not_available I give you some meaning, don't I? You give me meaning.
not_available Of course.
not_available But we can't be everything for each other, that's just not possible.
not_available I'll be done in a few minutes, Arthur, you're a little early.
not_available I was a lot early, so I walked around the block for a while.
not_available An elderly woman who was almost completely bald told me to get off her lawn.
not_available May I ask you a personal question? 
not_available You can ask.
not_available Why did you choose me over the other applicants? I'm looking to improve my interview skills.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available It was between you and Judy Lindeman.
not_available We just thought you would fit here better.
not_available Based on? 
not_available Well There was something in the way you talked about your grandmother.
not_available My great
not_available aunt Pearl.
not_available She was a very special woman.
not_available I barely knew my parents.
not_available They burned to death in a fire when I was five.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Aunt Pearl gave up everything for me.
not_available She home
not_available schooled me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You seem a little home
not_available schooled.
not_available Ah, shit.
not_available These collagen lips are such a bitch.
not_available I'm guessing Aunt Pearl didn't like cussing.
not_available Not one bit.
not_available She would've tarred me for that language.
not_available Rico, have you? Mrs F, this is Arthur Martin, our new apprentice.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Have you seen Nate? Lisa's looking for him.
not_available That'll be 62.90.
not_available There you go.
not_available I have to talk to my manager.
not_available I need credit approval.
not_available This CD is so great for taking diet pills and cleaning your bathroom.
not_available What are you doing? Do you even listen to me when I talk or do you just hear static? I'm 
not_available How do you expect Maya to go to college? You're throwing everything we have away for fucking Beck? Just sign here, please.
not_available You know what? I don't want these, I changed my mind.
not_available Can we just cancel this purchase? Come on, Claire, the early worm catches things.
not_available Where's your studio? 
not_available My house.
not_available Why's that your business? Isn't that where we're going? 
not_available We're going to the Century City mall.
not_available The mall? 
not_available Best mall in the world.
not_available I used to like Livingston Mall but Bamberger's went out of business and it all went to hell.
not_available You need an assistant to shop? I need an assistant to drive me.
not_available My licence was taken away by fascists.
not_available I don't know why I'm always persecuted but it's always been so.
not_available So I'm your driver? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can we go now? Brentano's are having a sale.
not_available And if I ever catch you with my toothbrush again, you're dead meat.
not_available This is my brother, Nate.
not_available Nate, this is Tom Jaffe.
not_available William Jaffe's son.
not_available I didn't realise he had a Look, I'm so sorry for your loss.
not_available I was only a few months old when he When it happened.
not_available I never even knew him.
not_available Tom was dropping off some of his father's belongings.
not_available Seems strange considering that there's no real body.
not_available In situations like your father's, it helps the family to put his belongings to rest also.
not_available I hope this'll do.
not_available Was your father a little person? No, this was the only suit of his that my mother could find.
not_available It was in some box his family had.
not_available It's from his Bar Mitzvah.
not_available And there's this.
not_available It was in the same box.
not_available It either belonged to him or my uncle.
not_available My mother thinks she remembers my father liking Blue Bayou.
not_available I'm gonna get fired if I'm not back by two, so if that's all Yes.
not_available We'll see you tomorrow at the funeral.
not_available What's wrong with you? I don't know.
not_available Can you imagine being so calm about your father's death? He probably thinks of his stepfather as his real father.
not_available As he should.
not_available He doesn't know anything about his dad, not a thing, whether he even liked Linda Ronstadt.
not_available Do you know if our dad liked Linda Ronstadt? As a matter of fact I do.
not_available In his record collection there was a copy of a Heart Like A Wheel.
not_available Here are the teacups.
not_available And these are dinner plates.
not_available Those up there are for casseroles.
not_available And these are the cereal bowls.
not_available Please feel free to use any of the dishes.
not_available Is there one I shouldn't use? Silly.
not_available That one was David's special yellow bowl.
not_available He got upset when anyone else used it.
not_available I'm sure he won't mind any more.
not_available Let's not take the chance.
not_available We'll keep it out of rotation.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, you see the chart I made? Each meal time is divided into two shifts, one for each of us.
not_available So we never have to suffer the awkwardness of eating at the same time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's very thoughtful.
not_available We just sign up each day for the one we want.
not_available So my dinner can be from six to seven or from seven to eight.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Which do you want tonight? I'll take seven.
not_available Actually, I'll take six.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I had a late lunch.
not_available Just use that pen there to initial it.
not_available Of course, other people also use the kitchen.
not_available If you want to make a schedule with them, feel free to use my system.
not_available Laundry facilities are in here.
not_available Sunday nights are off limits.
not_available I'm sorry but that's when I do my linen.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I understand completely.
not_available I should make a note about not aiming the shower at that tile.
not_available No need.
not_available It's all in the little booklet that's hanging by the sink.
not_available What a lovely room.
not_available Such warm light.
not_available It does the trick.
not_available "Second drawer sticks "unless you lift as you pull.
not_available " Thank you.
not_available That's very kind.
not_available All right.
not_available That's the end of the tour.
not_available You're on your own now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nate.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I shoulda called first.
not_available I was afraid you'd I need to talk to you.
not_available It won't take long.
not_available I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I've got a lot of errands today.
not_available Can I come with you? Please.
not_available It seems like I just got this smog
not_available checked last month.
not_available I called you when I first got back into town.
not_available Couple of months ago.
not_available I hung up when you answered.
not_available I just wanted to make sure that you were alive.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available After everything we went through, to not even know if you're alive, that's sad.
not_available But apparently your surgery was a success, right? Yeah.
not_available Well, the AVM ruptured in the middle of it and all hell broke loose but they fixed it.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Use your fucking signal, woman! You can go up my ass.
not_available Claire.
not_available I once had an affair with an older, married woman.
not_available Her name was Astra.
not_available That means star.
not_available Did you know that? Have you ever committed infidelity? No, not yet.
not_available But someday, hopefully.
not_available Infidelity is not funny, Claire.
not_available It's tragic.
not_available All betrayal is tragic.
not_available I was 21 when we first met.
not_available The radio was playing.
not_available I Wear My Sunglasses At Night.
not_available Such an insipid song.
not_available But now it always makes my heart feel squished.
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available She's the best fucking thing that ever happened to me.
not_available So what's gone on with you? Went to Santa Fe for a while.
not_available I was in Austin, Texas.
not_available Couple of weeks in Tahoe, but I really hated it.
not_available What were you doing there? Just trying to find a place to make me feel better.
not_available Are you still living in Venice? 
not_available I'm staying at my mom's.
not_available How's that? It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
not_available Bad news, your car didn't pass.
not_available I can fix it but I'll need about half an hour.
not_available All right.
not_available Totally fucks up my whole afternoon.
not_available You know, I saw a place up the street.
not_available We could get a drink.
not_available So what's your life like? You're married, a father It's great.
not_available It's really great.
not_available I'm glad.
not_available You so deserve to be happy after everything you've been through.
not_available I mean, it's hard sometimes.
not_available You know.
not_available Relationships aren't easy.
not_available Really? You just have to work at it every day.
not_available Can't expect everything to be perfect all the time.
not_available Can't get shaken when it isn't.
not_available And if there's a moment where I feel like I'm in prison I just have to think about all those moments when it feels safe and remind myself that those moments outweigh the prison moments.
not_available Being alone is the prison, just thinking about yourself, just being trapped in this vortex of always watching yourself.
not_available Which, I suppose, is OK if you're interesting.
not_available Truth is, nobody's that interesting.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Let's just talk about movies or something.
not_available I haven't seen a movie in a year.
not_available Anything else? Just the check.
not_available Ah, fuck.
not_available So, Bren, what's this catching
not_available up session all about? I'm not sure.
not_available Actually, I am sure.
not_available This is so difficult.
not_available I apologise for having sex with other people while being in a relationship with you.
not_available For not showing up to our shared reality by altering my consciousness with various substances.
not_available But you already apologised.
not_available You're making amends.
not_available I hate that word.
not_available Still doing the whole 12
not_available step thing? I'm doing a lot of different things.
not_available My life is complicated right now.
not_available Yeah, well, whose isn't? No, let me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I don't even know if she's alive now.
not_available All I know is that, before I met Astra, I was consumed by this passion to create.
not_available A passion I seem to have lost.
not_available I was never really in love with her.
not_available Of course you were.
not_available You ripped a jasmine bush out of the ground and put it in her car.
not_available I had just had my first real success and all eyes were on me.
not_available What was I going to do next? I was a coward.
not_available I focused on another person.
not_available I could have been great.
not_available And so can you.
not_available If you get lonely, have sex.
not_available But if you meet somebody who you think means something to you, you're doomed.
not_available Car 438, do you receive me? Yeah, go ahead.
not_available Alarm going off at 5636 Fremont Place.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available You're a little late.
not_available Insider job.
not_available Must've known the owners were away.
not_available Got the jewellery upstairs and the cash box in the library.
not_available Real clean.
not_available You boys gonna be OK closing up by yourselves? I think we can handle it.
not_available Fucking cops.
not_available Think they're such hot shit.
not_available Dion Corelli.
not_available Keith Charles.
not_available You were hoping for some action, right? 
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available I know that feeling.
not_available How about I buy you a drink? Is that comfortable? 
not_available I don't know when I got so clumsy.
not_available I never used to be this way.
not_available I think it's too tight.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available It was so strange.
not_available I put my finger right on that nail when I heard you coming up.
not_available I'd seen it sticking out of the wall 
not_available Why didn't you tell me about it? It was almost like somebody pushed me.
not_available Like some kind of invisible person wanting to hurt me.
not_available And earlier in the day, I twisted my ankle coming down the stairs.
not_available I was looking for you.
not_available Or something.
not_available It was around four.
not_available Couldn't find you anywhere.
not_available I went out for a drink.
not_available With Brenda.
not_available Why? She showed up.
not_available I was running errands, she came along.
not_available Getting a drink is an errand? What did she want? To apologise for being such a crazy bitch when we were together.
not_available Actually, it was pretty decent of her.
not_available What? Lisa, it was just one beer.
not_available I really don't appreciate finding out about it after the fact.
not_available It's no big deal but next time, please tell me first before you go do it.
not_available I'm supposed to ask permission? No, but you could've said, "I want you to meet my wife," then said you were gonna catch up with an old girlfriend.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Relax, guy, the owners are in Antigua, they're not gonna mind.
not_available We shouldn't be doing this.
not_available Come on.
not_available We deserve it.
not_available It's not like we're gonna get caught.
not_available We're the only ones who would catch us.
not_available This is some place.
not_available I bet the people don't even appreciate it.
not_available Probably not.
not_available No one appreciates what they have.
not_available Especially the ones who have more of it.
not_available Fucking rich people.
not_available What can you do? Don't you ever just wanna That felt so good.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available Let's fuck this place up.
not_available Those idiot cops didn't check in here.
not_available We'll go to town and say the robbers did it.
not_available Let's break some shit.
not_available Teach those rich fuckers a lesson.
not_available You're crazy.
not_available Come on, guy.
not_available You know you want to.
not_available Cut it out.
not_available Cut it out! Jesus.
not_available You did a great job tonight, David.
not_available You were amazing.
not_available Dennis.
not_available Can I borrow you for five seconds? This is the part where Patrick makes me go over every syllable he sang, describing why each was so unique and wonderful.
not_available Hey, Terry.
not_available Where's your boyfriend? He had to work.
not_available It was me in the Sears bathroom.
not_available Honey, I know it was you.
not_available I never forget a face.
not_available God, it feels so good to say it.
not_available I don't know why I wouldn't admit it yesterday.
not_available It just seemed so 
not_available Sleazy, repressed, not that pretty? Something like that.
not_available That time for me was so difficult.
not_available I mean really difficult.
not_available I tried to compartmentalise that part of my life but you can't.
not_available Sweetie, you don't need to explain it to me.
not_available I don't know why things have to be so hard.
not_available I think it's because we make them that way.
not_available So you ever jerk off anyone else in the chorus? Of course not.
not_available You? 
not_available A couple.
not_available So if let you up, no more crazy stuff? No, sir.
not_available Holy shit, man.
not_available You didn't have to play so hard.
not_available I was just blowing off a little steam.
not_available Get your things and get out of here.
not_available You ever a cop? Whatever you are, you got a lot of shit to deal with.
not_available I could always talk to Will because he was my best buddy.
not_available So my wife said, "Pretend that he's here.
not_available "What would you tell him?" So I thought I'd give it a try.
not_available So I say, goddamn you, Will, I'm mad at you.
not_available You're not getting bald and flabby like the rest of us old, married folk.
not_available Yeah, you had the right idea 
not_available cut out while you were in your prime.
not_available Hangover.
not_available What trouble did you boys get into? 
not_available None.
not_available Keith had to work, I had a concert.
not_available You did? Why didn't you tell anyone? Next time.
not_available I'm gonna go lie down for a few minutes.
not_available You're glad that you're not like us, tied to the old ball and chain, unable to do whatever we want when we want like you always did.
not_available THE PANIC ROOM Why do you look so sad? I won't be gone forever.
not_available I'll be back from Montana in a month or so.
not_available As soon as I can get Marcie out of jail and into counselling, which I'm sure she'll resist.
not_available Always does.
not_available Does your daughter have these episodes often? Pretty often.
not_available She's a real nut job.
not_available But what can I do? I'm her mom.
not_available She really needs me.
not_available Oh, God, kids are such a drain.

not_available up, weird, private shit.
not_available I'm gonna miss you so much.
not_available I've had so much fun with you.
not_available I'd never crouch here and spy on Arthur with anyone else.
not_available Doll, you gotta learn how to make your own fun.
not_available He's not exactly what I would call eye candy.
not_available "Swallowed my tongue.
not_available " And I know that everything that happens happens for a reason.
not_available I only wish that Will could have known his son, Tom.
not_available There's so much he could've taught him.
not_available That's a load of bullshit.
not_available You met my kid, he turned out fine.
not_available He didn't need a fuck
not_available up like me to stick around.
not_available Me driving off the road was the best thing for everybody.
not_available Seriously, Diane and I had a shit relationship which totally would've screwed up that kid.
not_available Just like you and Lisa are gonna screw up Maya.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available You just wanna stay in this to prove what a good guy you can be, not because you love Lisa.
not_available This isn't just about me.
not_available There are other lives at stake.
not_available Don't give me that shit.
not_available You are so fucking trapped.
not_available Yeah? Well, who isn't? The only way not be trapped is to not have anything.
not_available You look me in the eye and tell me that sometimes you don't wanna get in your car and just start driving and never look back.

not_available It's about my brother's wedding.
not_available Get this, there's a rehearsal dinner.
not_available Russell, maybe it's not such a good idea for us to, you know, date.
not_available It's so weird that you say that.
not_available It's so weird that you say that because I was thinking the same thing and I didn't wanna say it cos I thought I'd sound crazy, being the one who started this whole thing.
not_available So you're OK just staying the way we are? Totally.
not_available Totally.
not_available Yes.
not_available Great.
not_available I have to give this stuff to Olivier.

not_available Are you just waking up? I was up.
not_available Then I went back to sleep again.
not_available Why are you home for lunch? 
not_available I wanted to see you.
not_available I thought you'd be home last night.

not_available What time did you get in? 
not_available Late.
not_available I thought your shift ended at eleven.
not_available It did.
not_available I drove around.
not_available Needed to think.
not_available About what? This job was supposed to be temporary but it's really starting not to feel that way.
