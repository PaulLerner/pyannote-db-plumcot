not_available new baby.
not_available How is this any of your business, George ? Any ? She's all Ruth has right now.

not_available That's not even funny.
not_available Come on, brenda, he's your soul mate.
not_available All I ever was, all anybody's ever been, is a substitute for Billy.
not_available That would be so easy for you to believe that, wouldn't it ? It's not your fault.
not_available You were raised to be impaired.
not_available You were grown wrong like one of those square watermelons They cultivate in Japan.
not_available Don't laugh and miss the sorrow of it.
not_available I love Billy as my brother.
not_available That is natural And it's right.
not_available Just because you're incapable of having any real feelings about any human being unless you're fucking them.
not_available Brenda, listen to me.
not_available Pack up your stuff, take Billy and go.
not_available You can be together.
not_available Go someplace far away like, you know, Nova Scotia.
not_available Tell people you're married They'll never know.
not_available You'll live together, you can love each other, you can fuck.
not_available I am so glad you're dead.
not_available Brenda, I am pretty sure that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver Are brother and sister and they're making it work.
not_available Just shut the fuck up.
not_available I'm just saying you only get one life.
not_available There's no God, no rules, no judgments Except for those you accept or create for yourself.
not_available And once it's over, it's over.
not_available Dreamless sleep forever and ever.
not_available So why not be happy while you're here ? Really.
not_available Why not ? So then he came back inside, threw the keys at me and left.
not_available So does that mean he quit ? 
not_available No, nobody's quitting.
not_available Why'd you give him the keys ? We were fighting.

not_available He just wants to have a conversation.
not_available I know.
not_available I just need some time to sort things out before we talk about it.
not_available Could you take my side on this, please ? I 'm taking your side 
not_available It doesn't feel that way I'm taking your side by trying to help you get some perspective about this.
not_available My brother's dead, Keith ! I don't need anymore fucking perspective ! I just need to be loved ! Oh, shit.

not_available Oh, don't spill that.
not_available Here.

not_available Right.
not_available Until we become so honed by Our experiences and Time and Nobody else understands.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That sounds about right.
not_available Be sure to tell the baby that.
not_available First thing right when it comes out.

not_available I miss you so fucking much ! I miss you too.
not_available You know how I always used to tell you you weren't dad After dad died ? Yeah.
not_available It was such a waste of time thinking that way.
not_available No, it's just part of how you dealt with it, that's all.
not_available It kept you from missing dad so much.
not_available No, it kept me from ever knowing you Like as much as I really could have.
not_available And now you are so completely fucking gone ! It's It's just
not_available Claire.
