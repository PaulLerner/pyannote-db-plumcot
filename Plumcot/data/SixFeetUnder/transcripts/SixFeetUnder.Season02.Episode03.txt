
not_available Okay, let's go then.
not_available Are you packed? Don't forget the dog, honey.
not_available Don't forget the dog, honey.
not_available How are you feeling? He's not in the car, is he? Why is he talking about a dog? What dog? 
not_available We had a dog in Boulder.
not_available What is this? 
not_available We're in the hospital.
not_available You're sick, remember? But you're gonna be just fine.
not_available Rita, lying to him doesn't help anybody but you.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Nurse! 
not_available It's okay to let go.
not_available I'm going to beat it.
not_available But maybe you can't.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available Why would you say that? I don't want you to be scared.
not_available I don't want to die.
not_available I'm not gonna die.
not_available That's just your body.
not_available It's not you.
not_available That's bullshit, Eileen.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Here you go.
not_available We're going to increase your morphine, all right, Mr.
not_available Piper? Do you see? Rita, above his head.
not_available The light.
not_available Oh, yes, he's a good boy.
not_available Better hurry up.
not_available We've got Mrs.
not_available Piper at 8:30.
not_available Yeah, I'll be right there.
not_available What are you doing, Dave? Downloading pics from mansluts.
not_available Com? Great, Dave, thanks.
not_available I thought we should have all the information.
not_available I have all the information.
not_available I don't think you do.
not_available If you don't get this treated you could have seizures with muscular twitching, loss of verbal skills.
not_available You could even have some kind of hemorrhage at some point.
not_available Or I could be in the wrong airplane at some point, or so could you.
not_available All right? Come on.
not_available The Parliament.
not_available It's very elegant.
not_available Yes.
not_available I like it.
not_available But Michael thinks it's tacky.
not_available That's the Cleveland.
not_available It's a more affordable choice.
not_available But, as you can see, it's not quite as gracious.
not_available Really? No, but it's just so self
not_available effacing.
not_available But why? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Piper? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can you excuse me for a moment? I can't carry on two conversations at once.
not_available It's exactly like that horrible IKEA couch your mother bought us.
not_available Michael claims to love this one.
not_available In my opinion, he's trying to do what he thinks his mother wants which is typical, really.
not_available Fine, deny it.
not_available Why change now? Would you like to sit down for a minute? I'm fine.
not_available It's just Michael's here.
not_available He didn't want to deal with this stuff when he was alive.
not_available You know, the funeral.
not_available Now he's very opinionated.
not_available I'm a psychic, so, you know That must be very interesting for you.
not_available It's just more information.
not_available This room has a lot of pain in it.
not_available Well, yes.
not_available You have a lot in your mind.
not_available On your mind, I mean.
not_available Don't you? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available It's okay, all right? It's all gonna be okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, honey, if it's what you want.
not_available It's your funeral.
not_available Look, she gave me her card.
not_available "Spiritual Consultation and Past Life Regression"? For God's sake, who does this? Who spends $100 to be told they were once Eleanor of Aquitaine? Or whoever, the Marquis de Sade.
not_available So what do you think happens after we die? Heaven? 
not_available Or Hell.
not_available Really? But with angels, devils, or brimstone, or whatever? I don't know what it looks like, or who's there but I do believe there are consequences for the way we live our lives.
not_available You know, sometimes I kind of feel like Dad's around.
not_available Do you ever? Nope.
not_available You know we have the Independent Funeral Directors' lunch today, right? Why do I have to go? That's your thing.
not_available It's your thing, too, now.
not_available These are your colleagues.
not_available You need to know them.
not_available I know who they are.
not_available I met them in Vegas.
not_available They're freaks.
not_available They're not freaks.
not_available Nobody likes the Brazil nuts, David.
not_available Not the local guys.
not_available I'm sure the LA morticians are a lot more fun than those from Montana.
not_available You're an LA mortician now, Nate.
not_available This is your community.
not_available It's polite for the first person downstairs to make the coffee.
not_available Even if that person has a penis.
not_available It's also polite for the first person who uses the bathroom to spend less than 45 minutes in there.
not_available Even if that person has a vulva.
not_available Oh, goodness, everyone's here.
not_available With all their genitalia.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Mom, would you like some toast? No, thanks.
not_available I have to be in the Valley by 10:30.
not_available What's in the Valley? 
not_available I'm going to a seminar.
not_available What seminar? 
not_available Something Robbie invited me to.
not_available The Plan.
not_available Isn't that a cult? No, it's one of those self
not_available actualization things from the '70s where they yell for 12 hours and don't let you go to the bathroom.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Really? Should I bring some kind of jar? A jar? 
not_available I suppose that's not much of a solution.
not_available You're on your own for dinner.
not_available I won't be back until after midnight.
not_available The thought of Mom being self
not_available actualized is kind of making me nauseous.
not_available You sure it's not the thought of Mom pissing into a jar? So, Tahira, why can't you forgive your father? When I was 16 he had a dream that I had given myself to a man who was not the husband I had been promised to.
not_available For that, he set me on fire.
not_available I was able to save myself.
not_available But I had to leave the country so he would not kill me.
not_available And always I will have the scars from this.
not_available That's horrible.
not_available Truly horrible.
not_available How could he do this to me? But as long as you hold on to that anger toward your father you will be on fire.
not_available You may have left the country, but you are still living in the same house.
not_available And in that house, there is a room that is still burning.
not_available Who lives in this room? I do? 
not_available Your father is still living in this room.
not_available So you never invite anyone in, and you go through life alone.
not_available You must open that door.
not_available Put out the flames.
not_available You must invite your father to come visit you.
not_available But he won't even speak to me.
not_available That is your old blueprint.
not_available That is what you want to believe because you are too afraid to tear down the walls and rebuild.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stop blaming the victim.
not_available All right, who here thinks I'm being unfair? Be honest.
not_available Ruth, do you agree? Until Tahira forgives her father she will never feel safe in her home.
not_available Well, maybe, but 
not_available Speak up.
not_available We all paid to hear you.
not_available Why don't you stand? Her father did such a terrible thing.
not_available I don't see why she has to have him as a houseguest.
not_available If you don't agree with me, why didn't you raise your hand? I was just trying to understand your point.
not_available Or do you think that your opinion doesn't matter? That perhaps you are just a guest here? Are you a guest in your own house, Ruth? I don't think so.
not_available Yes, she tiptoes around herself like she's afraid of waking someone up.
not_available The only person sleeping in your house is you.
not_available I do have three children.
not_available See? She's not even listening.
not_available Ruth, you have to get out of bed open the windows, and let some light into your house so that you can see the way things are.
not_available Then, and only then can you begin renovating your life.
not_available So, Tahira, are you ready to renovate? Yes, I think so.
not_available So, when you call your father, what will you say first? Hello? Sorry, my beaker exploded.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Catch your breath.
not_available How's it going? I have hydrochloric acid in my hair, but other than that, I'm fine.
not_available Really? No, but I'm incredibly bored with myself right now.
not_available Let's talk about you.
not_available How's your girlfriend? What's her name? Jenny.
not_available Fine, thanks.
not_available How's it going with Gabriel? I have no idea.
not_available I haven't even talked to him in two weeks.
not_available Is that her? What does she do? 
not_available She's a jewelry designer.
not_available Really? Does she have a store? No, she has clients and she caters.
not_available But we're not here to talk about Jenny.
not_available It might help to tell me what you're going through right now.
not_available It's no big fucking mystery.
not_available I mean, it sucks.
not_available It sucks to be pretty much in love with a guy who's too fucked
not_available up for life.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Nothing really.
not_available Just Whatever.
not_available It's not even his fault.
not_available And it fucking pisses me off.
not_available His whole family thing is so fucking unfair.
not_available And I really just thought he needed I don't know.
not_available You? 
not_available No.
not_available But someone, maybe.
not_available Some person on the planet who gives a fuck about him, for once in his life.
not_available Yeah, I did think that would matter.
not_available It does matter.
not_available No one can ever solve someone else's life.
not_available So, basically, your job is totally pointless? No one but a guidance counselor, I mean.
not_available There they are.
not_available That's the community? I thought this was an event.
not_available It's an event.
not_available Didn't I meet one of those guys in Vegas? 
not_available Bobo from Peaceful Haven.
not_available Right.
not_available He spits.
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available Stan, Jack, Bobo.
not_available This is my brother, Nate.
not_available Nice to see you, Nate.
not_available Nice to meet you, Jack.
not_available Good seeing you, Bobo.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available We heard you just got your license to operate a moving funeral.
not_available Yep, finally went pro.
not_available Well, sit.
not_available No, go ahead.
not_available No, after you.
not_available Age before beauty.
not_available Right.
not_available David tells us that you are very gifted.
not_available He does? We were just giving Stan grief for poaching our customers with false advertising.
not_available That sounds like something Kroehner would do.
not_available Fucking Kroehner.
not_available Those cocksuckers.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Those cunts.
not_available So this family goes off the 405.
not_available We get five bodies, right? In truth, my walk
not_available in only holds three.
not_available So my guy is working overtime to get everyone juiced.
not_available But sometimes you have to leave them out for an hour or two beyond regulation.
not_available It happens, right? But those Kroehner fucks are just waiting for a chance to send in their flacky at the DCA, and boom! I get hit with a giant fine and a lawsuit.
not_available I will ram a plastic screw up my anus before I give in to those fucks.
not_available No offense.
not_available Do we have a waitress? 
not_available Yeah, she'll be back with the fries.
not_available Those fucks.
not_available They are fucks.
not_available They're fucking evil fucks.
not_available They're sucking up all the momand
not_available pops.
not_available Businesses that people spent their lives building up They don't care about people and lives.
not_available All right, we appreciate your passion, but No, all they care about is money.
not_available It's not just our industry.
not_available It's everywhere.
not_available When corporations try and squeeze out all the competitors the further management gets from labor, the more alienation in the workplace 
not_available the more meaningless all our lives become.
not_available Fuck, yeah! It's hopeless, isn't it? 
not_available No, I don't think it is.
not_available We have to stick together and save our energy to fight Kroehner.
not_available You know, Stan? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I love this guy.
not_available Terrific! I don't know, Gary.
not_available Twice in one day? Claire, this is Detective Reese.
not_available Why don't you sit down, Claire? Any idea where Gabriel Dimas is? Why would I? 
not_available He's a friend of yours, isn't he? Yeah, so I know where he is every second of the day? You have noticed that he hasn't been in school for the last two weeks? Yeah, but I don't know where he is.
not_available I don't.
not_available Did you know that he held up a convenience store with a gun? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you give or sell him embalming fluid? No.
not_available My God.
not_available So how do you think he got it? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available The Internet? Don't they have catalogs for that stuff? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Be a lot easier to get it from you, don't you think? No, because I would never do anything like that.
not_available I don't even know where they keep that stuff.
not_available So it's between Ethics of Evolution and Biogenetics, I think.
not_available Biogenetics? Really? 
not_available What? Yawn, kind of, right? Biogenetics might sound dull to you, but it's actually very smutty.
not_available It's all about sperm competition and cryptic ovulation.
not_available Oh, yeah? What else you taking? 
not_available I'm only doing one class.
not_available I thought you were going back to school.
not_available I said I was gonna take a class.
not_available I still have to work, you know.
not_available Fuck, if it's only one class, why not pick something interesting? How about this religious studies class? "Cross
not_available Cultural Perspectives on the Afterlife." Yawn.
not_available It's not boring.
not_available It's spiritual.
not_available Double yawn.
not_available Why don't you sign up for that and we can meet in the quad for lunch? That would be so fun.
not_available We could make out in the stacks sneak into the pool at night and go skinny
not_available dipping on acid.
not_available Sounds like you did a lot of work at college.
not_available I was only in school for two years, but I learned a few things.
not_available About breaking into school property while tripping? That'll help you in life.
not_available What? Come on, Bren.
not_available I was just in the middle of something.
not_available Look, it's been a while.
not_available It's not that long.
not_available It's been threeanda
not_available half weeks, and on Tuesday it'll be four weeks.
not_available Not that you're counting.
not_available Yeah, I'm counting.
not_available I mean, have you not even noticed? It's normal, after a certain point, for sex to slow down.
not_available Yeah, slow down, okay.
not_available But stop? People can go months after a certain point.
not_available After a certain point, okay.
not_available Like, six years, maybe.
not_available But six months? 
not_available Seven.
not_available Not that you're counting.
not_available You've never been with anybody long enough to know this but there is a certain ebb and flow that happens.
not_available Not for everybody.
not_available It does.
not_available There will be times when you are not attracted to me at all.
not_available It's just a normal ebb.
not_available How long does a normal ebb last? I don't know, but that's the kind of question that prolongs the standard ebb.
not_available Did you hear about the guy at the nuthouse that walked around naked except for a hat and gloves? And this nurse came up to him and said.
not_available "What do you want? You can't walk around" Mom? And the guy says, "It's okay.
not_available Nobody comes around here, anyway.
not_available " And the nurse says, "Well, what do you have on the hat and gloves for?" 
not_available It's so late.
not_available I was kind of worried.
not_available It goes until midnight.
not_available Was it fun? It was horrible.
not_available So you're not going back? 
not_available No, I'm going back.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't want to be rude.
not_available They don't care about that.
not_available They already got your money.
not_available Well, there's that, too.
not_available Don't you get bored around here? 
not_available Well, sometimes.
not_available Do you want some tea or something? All right, what did you break? Nothing.
not_available I was just being nice.
not_available God! I'm sorry.
not_available I was imposing my old blueprint on you.
not_available Excuse me? In the old blueprint of my old house you're only nice to me when you've done something bad or when you want something.
not_available That makes me feel like shit.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But it really does seem that way to me.
not_available I should go do my homework.
not_available They give you homework? I have to write a letter to my dead mother and forgive her for all the terrible things she did to me.
not_available That sounds fun.
not_available And then I have to write a private letter to myself outlining how I want to renovate my life.
not_available Good night, dear.
not_available Good night.
not_available The shovel's in the truck! 
not_available That's good.
not_available Rico, you forget something there? Shit.
not_available Sorry, man.
not_available I got about two hours of sleep last night.
not_available Augusto? 
not_available No, Angie, Vanessa's sister.
not_available She walks out on her boyfriend and comes over to wail in our living room all night long.
not_available Women.
not_available Yeah, I'm telling you, man.
not_available And she shows up with this suitcase, like she's got some right now that She has fancy Hollywood friends who flash their money around all the time.
not_available I'm like, "What, you can't go somewhere there's a guest room?" Rico, I'm really sorry about that loan.
not_available It's just a really tight budget.
not_available That's okay.
not_available We got the house.
not_available Something else came through.
not_available That's great.
not_available Yep, the escrow closes next month.
not_available That is super, man.
not_available You and Vanessa have been together, what five years now? Married five, together eight.
not_available Man, can you believe that shit? Okay, so this is sort of a personal question.
not_available You don't have to answer but do you guys still, you know pretty much have sex? We've got two kids now, so it slows down a bit.
not_available Right.
not_available How slow? Right after the baby, Vanessa's got all the wrong hormones and stuff.
not_available So now, maybe three or four times a week.
not_available That's too bad, man.
not_available Yeah, that sucks.
not_available It's not like the first two years.
not_available Yeah, you better enjoy it while you got it.
not_available No kidding, right? This moron always goes over.
not_available I should go in and correct his selfish ass.
not_available Let them finish their game.
not_available We go over sometimes.
not_available So how's Eddie? 
not_available He's good.
not_available Things are good, I guess.
not_available Keith, what's going on? I think my sister's fucking using that shit again.
not_available My mom's come up from San Diego to watch over her, like that's gonna fix anything.
not_available According to her, everything is just fine now.
not_available I'm the one that's overreacting.
not_available I don't think you're overreacting.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Eddie hates racquetball.
not_available Really? Why? Poor depth perception.
not_available Can't play pool, either.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available Let's not beat around the bush, shall we? Biology has a long history of being abused as an ideological instrument to justify social inequities and amoral behavior.
not_available For those of you who have not yet read my book the central argument I posit in Genes Out of the Bottle.
not_available Evolution in Biotechnology is that genetic engineering is, in and of itself the most effective argument against biological determinism.
not_available Why? The thesis that you present so brilliantly is that though biology manifests in behavior as we can see in the instinct of human males to seek a variety of sexual partners the fact that we have the technology to modify genetics confirms the supremacy of culture over biology.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Other thoughts? I have a question.
not_available Isn't natural selection still operating though, since members of the species who have access to genetic technologies are more likely to survive and procreate? That kind of reasoning leads us into a very questionable ethical terrain.
not_available Other comments? 
not_available What kind of reasoning? Scientific? You can call it scientific, but as I discussed at great length in Chapter 2 your argument is a political assertion that privilege is biologically determined.
not_available I haven't actually read your book but you can't tell me that survival isn't easier for people who are born with a private chef and health insurance.
not_available Maybe you should read the book before commenting on its thesis.
not_available Other comments? Yes? 
not_available Excuse me, I'm sorry.
not_available Are we not allowed to disagree with you? I'm just asking because I'm new in the class.
not_available We certainly don't interrupt our classmates.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available In your discussion of bisexual genital rubbing among pygmy chimps you note the exchange of sex for meat.
not_available I was wondering how this might pertain to contemporary human behavior.
not_available Any theories? So, where do you think he is now? According to his wife, he's still here.
not_available There's a big chunk of dead meat in a cheapo box that's still here.
not_available But do you really believe that's him? The essence of who he was? The part of him that hoped and dreamed, and all that other crap? You tell me.
not_available You're the one who has all the answers now.
not_available I never said that.
not_available You'd think getting hammered by a bus would make you a little less of a dick.
not_available Sure, it's possible that we go on after we die.
not_available It's also possible that, once the light goes out, it stays out.
not_available You'll never know, buddy boy, till it's your turn.
not_available See, that's what you were hanging onto.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Michael.
not_available Is he here? He's been with me the whole time.
not_available You think he'll stay with you? 
not_available Not like this.
not_available He's just helping me get used to it.
not_available I hope you don't mind, but do you get a sense of my father at all around here? No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That doesn't mean he's not here.
not_available This room is packed.
not_available I can't get to everyone.
not_available I think everything is ready.
not_available I do see a child coming into your life.
not_available No.
not_available Well, it might be you.
not_available I seriously doubt that.
not_available I'm not sure which one of you I'm reading but I'm quite sure there's gonna be a child here very soon.
not_available I'm heading out now, okay? This is Federico Diaz, our embalmer, and his baby, Augusto.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Piper.
not_available I'm sorry for your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You made his body look very nice.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Actually, his body gave me a lot to work with.
not_available Hardly any decay for a cancer death 
not_available Okay, Rico, see you tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nice to meet you, ma'am.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Eileen asked that I close with a reading from Michael's favorite poet, Walt Whitman.
not_available "What do you think has become of the young and old men? "And what do you think has become of the women and children? "They are alive and well somewhere "The smallest sprout shows there is really no death "And if ever there was, it led forward life "and does not wait at the end to arrest it "And ceas'd the moment life appear'd "All goes onward and outward nothing collapses "And to die is different from what any one supposed "and luckier" Let us pray.
not_available O Lord, bless the departed soul of our brother, friend, and son, Michael I'm just hanging around to help you get used to it.
not_available I am used to it, Dad.
not_available It's been six months.
not_available Seven.
not_available Not that you're counting.
not_available God is strength.
not_available In him, I will trust.
not_available Amen.
not_available Are you done? 
not_available Pretty much.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I wanted to ask you something.
not_available Okay.
not_available Get this.
not_available Bobo sold to Kroehner.
not_available Bobo sold? My Bobo? 
not_available Your Bobo.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available He was so committed.
not_available Think he's got a plastic screw in his anus about now? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available That old son of a bitch.
not_available I'm gonna call him.
not_available What's the matter with you? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Where's Karla? 
not_available She's just working late.
not_available Why are you fronting? 
not_available Go to your room now, Taylor.
not_available Mama hasn't been home since Tuesday.
not_available What? 
not_available Now.
not_available But my stomach hurts.
not_available I'll get you some Pepto
not_available Bismol.
not_available I don't want none of that nasty shit.
not_available Then go on.
not_available Shit, bitch, I gotta get my goods.
not_available Don't talk to your grandmother like that.
not_available Is she sick? She says that every night.
not_available She just wants the attention.
not_available Can you blame her? Her mother's off, doing God knows whatever.
not_available Karla's fine.
not_available She just had to go out of town.
not_available You talked to her? 
not_available I wasn't in when she called.
not_available But she left several messages.
not_available Besides, I'm here with Taylor.
not_available Don't blow this out of proportion like you always do.
not_available Hey, Mama, I'm not coming home tonight.
not_available Derek needs some papers, and I gotta go Can't she send him his papers? 
not_available You remember how Derek was.
not_available Always getting her to do this and that for him.
not_available Yeah, like raise his kid without a dime from him.
not_available Sorry, I dropped the phone.
not_available Shut up! Anyway, I'll call you as soon as I can, okay? Give Taylor kisses for me.
not_available To get the phone company records, we'll have to file a missing persons report.
not_available Keith, why must you always think the worst of her? Let's just wait till she gets home.
not_available We don't even know 
not_available What are you gonna do? Move up here and take care of her all your life? She has a child! Jesus, she needs help.
not_available You covering up for her is not what I mean.
not_available Who do you think you're talking to? I am your mother and you will respect that or I will smack the black right off of you.
not_available Hi, there.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hard day? How can you tell? I'm good at people.
not_available Are you? 
not_available Gotta be.
not_available Tax law.
not_available I'm Scott.
not_available Scott Axelrod.
not_available Candace Bouvard.
not_available Nice to meet you, Candace.
not_available Are you an actress? No.
not_available I teach sign language to the newly deaf.
not_available Really? 
not_available How noble.
not_available No, it's very lucrative.
not_available And I really enjoy communicating with my body.
not_available I get that.
not_available You know what? My friend is here, but it's been great getting to know you.
not_available I would love to take you to dinner sometime.
not_available Can I give you my card? You sure can.
not_available How was school? All right, you have 20 minutes to do what's most important in your life now.
not_available What did you write to yourself in your private letter? Where are you locked out of your own life? If you learn today that your relationship with your mother has been blocking the door to your happiness, then make that repair.
not_available Right now.
not_available Waiting only gives you more chances to make excuses.
not_available There are phones in the hall.
not_available See you in 19 minutes.
not_available Where can I find a Snickers bar? Can't you think of more productive ways to use this time? Like what? Taking up smoking? Why not try rebuilding with someone right now? I read your private letter to yourself.
not_available If you really want closeness in your life you're gonna have to start major renovations.
not_available In fact, I would gut.
not_available You read my private letter? Why don't you try calling your kids? 
not_available I don't even know where my kids are.
not_available The last thing they want is for me to call on a Friday night so I can put in new flooring.
not_available I've wanted to hear that my whole life, Dad.
not_available Oh, fuck! I love you, too, you sadistic old fuck.
not_available Start with Claire.
not_available Only you can be the architect of your life.
not_available I was 12 years old.
not_available This is your mother.
not_available Yes, well, I just wanted to tell you that I feel like even though I've been trying to be closer to you it hasn't really been working.
not_available I wish you felt you could confide in me and maybe you don't because you feel my opinion is worthless.
not_available Because I don't really live in my house and so I suppose that's the infrastructure I built.
not_available And so I'm sorry.
not_available And? 
not_available And I love you.
not_available That's so good.
not_available I gotta pee like a racehorse.
not_available You have exceeded the time limit.
not_available If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1 now.
not_available Hello? Claire? Where the fuck have you been? 
not_available I'm fucked up.
not_available Gabe, what is going on? Everything is all fucked up, Claire! Look, it's gonna be okay.
not_available You just have to calm down right now.
not_available Look, I need you to come and get me.
not_available Please.
not_available You know the cops are seriously looking for you? I know that, okay? Why do you think I need you to come out here and get me? Where are you? I'm up past Woodland Hills.
not_available Academia is one huge circle jerk.
not_available All the sequestered people desperately defending the one good idea they have ever had in their lives.
not_available So, what, that's it for going back to school? Yep.
not_available Next? How was your day? 
not_available It was weird.
not_available Buried that psychic woman's husband, and she was still talking to the guy.
not_available That's sad.
not_available Not for her.
not_available I mean, she really believed he was there, you know? Well, she has to say that, right? If she claims she's a psychic.
not_available You don't think that that's possible? What about you saying that things happen that leave marks in people, in places, in time? 
not_available That's physics.
not_available Energy affecting matter.
not_available Talking to dead people is delusional.
not_available So you definitely don't believe in any kind of a life after death? I think people live on through the people they love and the things they do with their lives.
not_available If they manage to do things with their lives.
not_available But that's it? That's all there is? There's nothing more? There's nothing bigger? Just energy.
not_available But there's no plan? 
not_available No, there's definitely no plan.
not_available Just survival.
not_available Should I have ordered the salmon? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How can you live like that? What if you found out you were gonna die tomorrow? I've been prepared to die tomorrow since I was 6 years old.
not_available Really? 
not_available Pretty much.
not_available We never got butter.
not_available Why since you were six? Because I read a report on the effect nuclear war would have on the world and it was pretty clear to me at that point that this was definitely gonna happen.
not_available When you were six? And I wake up every day pretty much surprised that everything is still here.
not_available I don't understand how you can live like that.
not_available Well, I thought we all did.
not_available Who was that? 
not_available I went to high school with him.
not_available He's clearly had a nose job.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available Go on.
not_available And imagine that everyone in this room thinks you're an idiot.
not_available Total fool.
not_available Complete moron.
not_available Absolute ass.
not_available Feel familiar? It's how you feel in the world, isn't it? I want you to feel it deeply now.
not_available Really feel that everyone in this room thinks you're an idiot.
not_available Close your eyes, Ruth.
not_available Feel you're an idiot.
not_available Now tell me when you get the joke.
not_available Do you get the joke, Ruth? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm an idiot.
not_available Who wants to explain the joke to Ruth? So we all feel the same way, right? So who's really the asshole? We all are? 
not_available Ruth, stand up.
not_available Tell me what you wrote in your private letter to yourself.
not_available It was a private letter.
not_available To myself.
not_available Tell me where your house needs repairs.
not_available Yeah, and don't bullshit the lady, cupcake.
not_available I have a very nice house.
not_available I have nice children, and a nice job, and a nice gentleman friend.
not_available Can't anyone just be happy? I'm happy.
not_available Who's buying Ruth's house? We don't believe your house is structurally sound, Ruth.
not_available Who knows 
better Me or a room full of complainers? What do you really want to complain about, really? The fact that the blood stopped circulating to my rear end four hours ago.
not_available Okay, what else? You want me to complain? All right, then.
not_available Fuck this.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Fuck all of you, with your sniveling self
not_available pity.
not_available And fuck all your lousy parents.
not_available Fuck my lousy parents, while we're at it.
not_available Fuck my selfish bohemian sister and her fucking bliss.
not_available Fuck my legless grandmother.
not_available Fuck my dead husband and my lousy children with their nasty little secrets! And fuck you, Robbie, for dragging me to this terrible place and not letting me have a Snickers bar! I'm going to get something to eat! Congratulations, Ruth.
not_available You have just leveled your fleabag hovel.
not_available Now you can build the house of your dreams from the ground up.
not_available Yes! Fucking yes! Excellent.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Okay, let's hop.
not_available Hi? 
not_available We should just get going.
not_available Okay.
not_available But you could tell me where the fuck you've been Yeah, like you care.
not_available What? Why did I just drive my ass way the fuck out to nowhere? Can we just talk about this while we're driving, okay? Jesus, it's hot as hell in this car.
not_available Can you tell me where we're going? Let's just head out to Angela's Crest or something.
not_available Angela's Crest? That's where serial killers go to dump bodies.
not_available You think you can think up someplace a little creepier? I don't care where we go.
not_available I just want to go somewhere where we can be alone for a minute and we can just talk, you know? Whatever.
not_available Are you fuckedup right now? 
not_available What the fuck do you expect, Claire? I'm freaked out.
not_available Everything's really fucked
not_available up for me right now.
not_available So what are you gonna do? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm trying to it figure out.
not_available What's to figure out? Claire, just chill out, okay? Jesus.
not_available Look, they know you gave Andy the fry, or whatever the fuck it's called.
not_available They know you robbed that store, Gabe.
not_available You have to turn yourself in.
not_available That is a genius fucking plan.
not_available Hey, baby, you like to drink blood? 
not_available That's incredibly original.
not_available Shut the fuck up, scumbag! Look, you got a corpse in the front seat.
not_available I said, shut the fuck up! 
not_available Oh, God! Go.
not_available Is he all right? It's okay.
not_available Just keep driving.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available We have to go back.
not_available Are you insane? We have to go back and make sure that guy is okay.
not_available I didn't hit him, all right? 
not_available How do you know? Are you sure? I saw.
not_available He's fine, all right? Then let's just go back and make sure that he is all right.
not_available I cannot go back there! God, I am fucked! 
not_available You know this is just making it worse.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I need you to just help me right now, okay? Please.
not_available I can't help you! I can't help you anymore! I can't.
not_available Let's just keep going, okay? Let's just keep going, I'll figure out what to do.
not_available I will figure it out.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available I'm going back.
not_available Claire, don't do that.
not_available Get off me.
not_available Claire, give me that.
not_available Okay, you have to get out now.
not_available Don't do this to me.
not_available Get out! 
not_available Get out.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm just gonna get my bag, all right? Thanks.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available So, where do you think I am? Heaven or Hell? Apparently, you're here at the moment.
not_available You think I'm in Hell.
not_available Yeah, sure, I went to church.
not_available That was just for business.
not_available I didn't really believe in God.
not_available I mean, not as anyone who you had to please or impress to get promoted.
not_available The only God I know is a mean
not_available spirited comedian in ugly pants whose every joke has the same damn punch line.
not_available And I'm thinking, that kind of attitude lands me straight in Hell.
not_available On the bright side, that means you'll have a familiar face waiting for you.
not_available Look it up.
not_available Leviticus 20:13.
not_available I don't believe that anymore.
not_available And I don't think you're in Hell.
not_available But you can't quite see me hanging around with Gandhi and Mother Teresa up there.
not_available I miss you, Dad.
not_available I thought you were at Brenda's.
not_available She had a late client, so I thought I'd, you know 
not_available help clean up.
not_available Thanks.
not_available At this hour? That is a late client.
not_available Some of them like her to put them to bed, you know? That's very sad.
not_available How long did you go out with that cop? 
not_available About six months.
not_available Sex ever slow down? 
not_available I was hoping you weren't gonna go there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Forget it.
not_available David, I need some help.
not_available What happened? "Fuck my legless grandmother.
not_available "And fuck you, Robbie, for not letting me have the Snickers bar." Oh, my goodness, the language.
not_available I was so rude.
not_available It was fantastic.
not_available Quel breakthrough.
not_available Robbie, I don't even know how to thank you.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available Just change.
not_available So, what are you gonna do tomorrow to start the renovations? That's none of your fucking business.
not_available Any idea where he'd go? What was he wearing? You know, it's gonna be much easier on him if we can bring him in before something else happens.
not_available But he doesn't even have the gun.
not_available You think he can't get another gun? He was wearing jeans and a green T
not_available shirt, I think.
not_available You're doing the right thing.
not_available You know that, right? 
not_available I feel like shit.
not_available You'll feel worse if someone else gets hurt.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available When that cop asked me if I knew about the 7
not_available Eleven thing, I said I didn't.
not_available But I did.
not_available Is that really bad? 
not_available It's not great.
not_available But you're telling the truth now, right? So don't worry about that.
not_available They wouldn't make me testify against him or something, right? That's not up to me.
not_available But, anyway, that's a long ways off.
not_available Okay, 'cause I don't wanna do anything like that.
not_available Why are you still protecting this loser? 
not_available Because she loves him.
not_available And we understand that, Claire.
not_available I really wish you'd told us about this sooner.
not_available How long did you know about the embalming fluid? Not that long.
not_available And I tried to tell Nate.
not_available When the fuck did you try and tell me about this? She's telling you now, all right? Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available When you're ready, we're gonna get in the car and drive down to the station.
not_available A couple of detectives there are gonna ask you pretty much the same questions.
not_available Will you be there? 
not_available Yes, I'll be there.
