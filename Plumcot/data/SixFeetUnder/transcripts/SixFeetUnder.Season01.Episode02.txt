
not_available Six Feet Under Season1.
not_available Episode 2.
not_available The Will You can have anything you want.
not_available It's yours for the taking.
not_available Now, we've been conditioned to think that this isn't fair somehow, that that's taking away something from someone else, right? Right, right.
not_available Wrong.
not_available The bounty of the universe is without limits.
not_available What exactly is Beauty Vision, anyway? Oh, it's a personalized life management system.
not_available Sounds kinda culty.
not_available Everybody wants a better life.
not_available Shit, two years ago, I was living out of my fuckin' car.
not_available He told me the first time we went out, he was going to marry me.
not_available It was unbelievably romantic, and now I have this beautiful baby.
not_available And this is what Beauty Vision is.
not_available It's a way of seeing the world without fear.
not_available Now, these new territories, they're gonna go so fast.
not_available Franchise fee is 45,000.
not_available Sign me up.
not_available Are you really ready for this? Fuck, yeah.
not_available Well, welcome to Beauty Vision.
not_available Your husband is gorgeous.
not_available / Thank you.
not_available He spends an hour on the Stairmaster every day.
not_available Jesus, is that blood? Shit! Must have hit his head on the bottom of the pool.
not_available Chandler Chandler! Oh my God! CHANDLER JAMES SWANSON Wake your tired ass up, sleepyhead.
not_available What's for breakfast? / Me, stupid.
not_available Now, uh, which one of you is the wife? No, no, keep going, keep going.
not_available I'm kind of curious as to how this works.
not_available No breakfast? Why'd you let me sleep so late? I didn't have the heart to wake you up.
not_available You looked so relaxed, which I don't see that often.
not_available Today's the reading of Dad's will.
not_available You know about that.
not_available It'll all be over real soon.
not_available Thank you for sleeping over.
not_available You snore.
not_available Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow night.
not_available You think I'd miss a meeting of gay police and firemen? You'll like these guys.
not_available They're cool.
not_available I'll pick you up around 7.
not_available We'll get a bite to eat first.
not_available Call me before you head over.
not_available So you can weasel your way out of it? I never know when I'm gonna have to work, Keith.
not_available And this is a busy time for us.
not_available A lot of people hold on for one last Christmas and then buh
not_available bye.
not_available I always thought shiatsu was more intense than this.
not_available Oh, we'll get there.
not_available I'm just trying to find out where you're wounded.
not_available Wounded? I got stabbed in the thigh with a Bic pen once.
not_available I wasn't speaking literally.
not_available Aah! / Oh, here's a good one.
not_available Old but recently reopened.
not_available / You're so full of shit.
not_available We're all wounded.
not_available We carry our wounds around with us throughout life and eventually they kill us.
not_available Things happen that leave a mark in space, in time, in us.
not_available Alright.
not_available / No.
not_available I'm sure this is all very deep and profound, but I get enough death at home.
not_available You're supposed to be my haven away from all that.
not_available I'm not supposed to be anything.
not_available Morning, Dave.
not_available Aren't those the same clothes you had on yesterday? Everything I own looks alike.
not_available I sense you're not being completely honest with me, Dave.
not_available Have you changed any since you were 14? Hey.
not_available I'm all for you getting laid, believe me.
not_available Morning.
not_available You gotta try these.
not_available They're hydroponic.
not_available Put them in water.
not_available I know the guy who grows them.
not_available He's a big supplier to the co
not_available op.
not_available So my peaches are no good? What? No, they're fine.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hickey wants us there on time for the reading of the will.
not_available We should all go in the same car.
not_available Great, I have to miss another day of school? What am I, like some poor knocked
not_available up Victorian waif who has to stay hidden from view? Fine.
not_available Go to school.
not_available Stay out all night.
not_available Live in the streets.
not_available See if I care.
not_available Was she like this when you were growing up? 
not_available No, not really, but she was well on her way.
not_available Morning.
not_available We are looking quite spiffy in that suit, Dave.
not_available That's so clever.
not_available You're talking like the computer in the movie.
not_available Wow, you're funny.
not_available Hey, have a hydroponic raspberry, grown by a guy named Gunther, once slept with Stevie Nicks.
not_available Eew! So, Dave, you gonna tell us about her? Who? / Well, he's got a friend.
not_available Hey, are you and Jennifer back together? No.
not_available Have you met someone else, Dave? 
not_available Leave him alone.
not_available Someone from outside your pod? Shut up, asshole.
not_available Thank you, Claire.
not_available Why are you still here, anyway? Why don't you go back to Seattle? Because I would miss the joyful sense of belonging I get here.
not_available I have no idea what kind of service he'd want.
not_available Well, the scale depends on who he was and how he saw himself, the statement that he made with his life.
not_available He was He was like, so dynamic.
not_available He had his own business
not_available Beauty Vision.
not_available The infomercial? Chandler invented it.
not_available Large scale.
not_available I'll arrange viewings for tomorrow and the next day at Cedar Hill.
not_available Service 4,200.
not_available Now, we should choose on an appropriate resting vessel, one that befits a man of his stature.
not_available May I ask what kind of car your husband preferred? He drives a BMW.
not_available Do you know which model? The biggest, fastest one.
not_available I recommend the Titan Series.
not_available Solid mahogany, pan finished with burwood accents, the same wood used in luxury automobile interiors.
not_available Looks expensive.
not_available It's more than just a casket.
not_available It's a tribute, really.
not_available OK.
not_available Are we finished? Major credit card to get us started.
not_available Hi! I, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, a resident of Los Angeles County, California, declare this to be my last will, and revoke all former wills and codicils.
not_available First, to my wife, Ruth, I leave all cash, bank accounts, stocks, and bonds that are in my name.
not_available That's in addition to the life insurance.
not_available Second, I bequeath the company, Fisher &amp; Sons Funeral Home, and all real property in business interest, attached as 
follows and 50% to my son, Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, Jr.
not_available What?!? Was he high? Why would he do that? David! Wow, I guess I don't even rate.
not_available No, he set up a trust for you.
not_available / David, hey wait.
not_available David, David, David, David.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Well, excuse me while I go contemplate the irony of that.
not_available What's my recourse here? Recourse? Your entire college education is provided for.
not_available So I don't get anything? You get education, Claire.
not_available A privilege that not everyone gets.
not_available Well, what if I don't wanna go to college? Well, you need it these days, not just to succeed but to survive.
not_available OK.
not_available Spare me the tough love rationalization.
not_available Just bottom line it, please.
not_available Should you decide not to go to college, the money will become available to you when you're 25.
not_available So this is like blackmail from beyond the grave! What in the hell was Dad thinking? Is this some kind of sick joke? It's Fisher and Sons.
not_available You're the sons.
not_available Mom gets half a million in life insurance, which is completely fair, but I have these huge strings attached? Let's not talk about what's fair.
not_available Mom, you can have my half.
not_available / No, your father knew exactly what he was doing.
not_available He wanted everybody happy, and we will be happy! I guess what I want is totally irrelevant! Dave, listen.
not_available I think this is all wrong.
not_available It should be yours.
not_available Or yours and Mom's.
not_available I really don't wanna discuss it now.
not_available Maybe I'll move to Florida.
not_available That's ridiculous, Mom, and it's not helping.
not_available You're all adults, and Claire will be leaving next year.
not_available Yeah, to join the Marines! I wanna learn to kill, kill, kill! Is that Mr.
not_available Swanson? How does he look? Easy.
not_available Head split open.
not_available Some scalp work, hair extensions to cover the stitches.
not_available Maybe.
not_available You guys are in my way.
not_available Mrs.
not_available F.
not_available Vanessa just called.
not_available We've got a fresh one at Baybury's.
not_available You pick it up.
not_available I'll get Swanson started.
not_available No can do.
not_available I've still got to finish Mrs.
not_available Huffington.
not_available Federico, her viewing is at 3 o'clock.
not_available Yeah, well, she's majorly jaundiced.
not_available Well, just crank up the pink pen spots over her casket.
not_available David, the woman looks like a banana.
not_available I don't dare brush her, the family's gonna freak! You wanna put her out like that? Then take my name off the certificate! Nate, I need you to pick up at Baybury's Nursing Home.
not_available Uh I don't really know how.
not_available You put him on a gurney, put the gurney in the car, bring it home, take the elevator to the basement, put him in the freezer.
not_available You think you can handle that? You own half the business now.
not_available Start pulling your weight.
not_available Newsflash! Other people exist! Hey, uh.
not_available Give me 20 minutes.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So did Dad ever say anything that might explain why he'd do this? Like, "Hey, Federico, I've lost my fucking mind!" It's a good business.
not_available Steady.
not_available I guess he was still pissed at me for not going into it, but what does he think? He can force me? Maybe he was pissed at Dave.
not_available Hey Do you wanna go to a thing tonight? I'm really not in the mood for a thing tonight, Gabriel.
not_available Come on, don't go through this alone.
not_available Fat chance.
not_available It's like I've got a big sign on my head that says, "Freak with the dead dad.
not_available " And like all these people who are so tragic even knew him.
not_available I met your dad once.
not_available Remember? He buried my grandmother, Alice.
not_available Why are you talking to me? You think I'm a jerk? / Yes.
not_available You know, you're different now.
not_available You can see through walls.
not_available Uh huh.
not_available Don't your skanks need to be walked? I wanna see you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fisher? I'm Matthew Gilardi.
not_available Do you have a moment? Did David mention me, by any chance? I don't think he did.
not_available Well, I thought I'd drop off the details of our buy
not_available out offer so you can look it over.
not_available The terms are quite generous, especially the stock options.
not_available Who are you to buy us out? I never saw you before in my life.
not_available I represent Kroehner Services, International.
not_available A chain? Kroehner is a family of quality death
not_available care facilities, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available We have 157 units in Southern California, and we're inviting you to be 158.
not_available You really should discuss this situation with your son, David.
not_available I have two sons.
not_available Really? I was only aware of one.
not_available I know how many sons I have, Mr.
not_available Gilardi.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Just look at the numbers.
not_available I'll let myself out.
not_available Good morning.
not_available How are you folks today? Don't expect to be popular.
not_available Hey, baby! Nate, look at you.
not_available Look at you! Four and a half months, and this one wants out already.
not_available Mr.
not_available Suarez ready to go? Yeah, honey.
not_available We got a little problem.
not_available My sister can't pick up Julio from pre
not_available school.
not_available She got another callback from that cat food commercial.
not_available / Your sister.
not_available Well, what about my career, huh? I can't do it.
not_available Not today.
not_available David's head would explode.
not_available Nate, you oughtta remind your brother how many clients I have referred to you guys from here, and tell him to cut Rico some slack.
not_available Rico, go.
not_available I'm the new boss, right? OK.
not_available I'm telling Dave you said I could.
not_available Yeah.
not_available / Yeah.
not_available I can do this.
not_available I just need some help getting him onto the gurney.
not_available You can touch him if you wear one of these.
not_available Believe me, he won't mind.
not_available Alright.
not_available Pull the bed back.
not_available Line it up with the gurney.
not_available Alright.
not_available Like this? / Yeah.
not_available Let me take this off for a second.
not_available Alrighty.
not_available You grab his shoulders.
not_available On 3.
not_available Ready? Whoa! Angel lust.
not_available Does that happen a lot? A fair amount.
not_available You can be dead, but you're never really dead.
not_available Hello? / So I've been thinking.
not_available We skipped way too many steps.
not_available We need to have a first date.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm at Pino, Hollywood.
not_available Know where that is? You mean right now? / Yeah.
not_available Uh, I'd love to, but I've got a dead body in the car with me.
not_available Wow, I can certainly understand why you wouldn't want to get away from that.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just a glass of wine.
not_available 15 minutes.
not_available The dead guy won't mind.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Keep out of the sun.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I'd forgotten.
not_available They make these noises, and air comes out.
not_available It's like
not_available Dad knew that I hated this whole fucked up business.
not_available He should respect that.
not_available And poor Dave, I'd be pissed, too, although he does seem to take to this extra Old Testament level.
not_available So does that mean you're not going back to Seattle on Sunday? Fuck! OK.
not_available Don't think about it.
not_available Tell me about yourself.
not_available Like this is our first date and we never had sex before you knew my name.
not_available You mean the recap of major life events told in a humorous and self
not_available deprecating manner, which almost always gets me laid? No.
not_available / Why not? I'm not that guy with you.
not_available Who are you? I don't know.
not_available Somebody new.
not_available It's because of your father.
not_available You were with me at your most vulnerable.
not_available You felt comfortable.
not_available You felt really accepted.
not_available You always analyze guys on the first date? Only if they're interesting.
not_available Oh, so you think I'm interesting? Oh, yeah.
not_available I don't meet that many men with dead guys with hard
not_available ons in their car.
not_available So when Mrs.
not_available Swanson's credit card didn't go through, I ran a credit check, and they were in debt up to their ears.
not_available We have a $3,200 Titan Casket being delivered tomorrow.
not_available Why didn't you tell me there's an offer to buy us out? I know what you and Dad thought of Kroehner Service, International.
not_available You don't know what I think.
not_available Not that it matters to you.
not_available And Nate is not your enemy.
not_available He'll do whatever you want.
not_available Why do you say that? He spent his entire life doing what he wants.
not_available Dad must've really hated me.
not_available Hush! It's Fisher &amp; Sons, and that's gotta continue.
not_available And you're never gonna have any kids.
not_available Well, it's about time.
not_available What took you so long? I stopped to eat.
not_available I wish you'd called.
not_available I think Mr.
not_available Suarez kinda shit himself.
not_available Is that normal? / You stopped to eat? Do you have any respect for human life at all? I have a huge respect for human life.
not_available I just didn't know they can take a dump when they're dead.
not_available Well, they can.
not_available Make a note.
not_available Boys, I don't like this bickering.
not_available Yeah? Well, I don't like you sleeping with hairdressers.
not_available Look, don't take this out on Mom.
not_available What is it you wanna say to me? Well, there's a body that spent over two hours in a van, unrefrigerated, decomposing at a rate much faster than you could ever imagine.
not_available Thanks for making my life just that much more difficult.
not_available Thanks for undermining my authority with our employees.
not_available And thanks for making it so clear to me that my choice to dedicate myself to this business and to this family was really stupid, because, apparently, I would've been rewarded just the same for wasting my life.
not_available Oh, my life is a waste? Fuck you! At least I enjoy it.
not_available Well, lucky you.
not_available Dave, at least let me help.
not_available You've helped enough.
not_available It's just not fair that my whole life is being decided by other people.
not_available Hey, college is paid for, they have great parties, no student loans to pay off.
not_available I'm not exactly a party person.
not_available By the way, that shit you gave me the night my dad died, it really fucked me up.
not_available I'm sorry about that.
not_available You should be.
not_available Why is college like the only option? I don't even know what I wanna do.
not_available I just feel like there's something inside me.
not_available I'd just like to figure out what it is before I get like completely reprogrammed.
not_available Hey, nobody could reprogram you.
not_available You're the most original girl in the school.
not_available Come on.
not_available Look at this car that you drive.
not_available This face that you drive.
not_available Thanks a lot, liar.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available You know how much guts it takes to be somebody like you? You can touch him if you wear one of these.
not_available Believe me, he won't mind.
not_available He won't care.
not_available Well, whaddaya got there, David? Who is that? That's him? That's Mr.
not_available Bloomberg? Put him right down next to him there, and see if it is.
not_available Oh, my goodness! Yeah, you're OK, David.
not_available Mom wants to see us.
not_available I'm going on a hike with someone.
not_available OK.
not_available OK?!? / I am not asking your permission, David.
not_available I am your mother.
not_available How dare you? You both have private lives, and I know it.
not_available Why shouldn't I? You should.
not_available Go.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need her to meet with Mrs.
not_available Swanson.
not_available It's Fisher and Sons.
not_available Well, this sucks.
not_available I have to got to fight for a hole in the ground at Rosemont Cemetary, or Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Suarez won't be buried together.
not_available They'll be on opposite sides of the goddamned freeway.
not_available Dave, listen.
not_available Can I do anything to help? Can you tell Adele Swanson we know she's broke and can't afford the funeral she ordered? Can you do that? I guess.
not_available Yes.
not_available The Swansons are con
not_available artists.
not_available They run a franchise pyramid scheme.
not_available They have no money, and they're not gonna con us too.
not_available I made some notes in case you're not familiar with credit reports.
not_available You know, I work with vendors.
not_available Big ones.
not_available National ones.
not_available I'm not an idiot.
not_available I can do this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shit.
not_available What? Do you have to be anywhere tonight? Not really.
not_available The other Mrs.
not_available Fisher recommended the $9000 coffin.
not_available I didn't ask for it.
not_available I think cremation is much more dignified, and it's within range, given the financial situation.
not_available Chandler created Beauty Vision.
not_available We have franchises in 13 states and the nation of Uruguay.
not_available How much did you know about your husband's business? Because he's been running up bad debts for some time.
not_available We were always moving.
not_available I just thought it was because he was making so much money.
not_available Each place was nicer than the last.
not_available His former partners are suing him.
not_available He had several credit cards maxed out, run
not_available ins with the IRS dating to 1996, and Yale University would like him to stop telling people he went there.
not_available This can't be happening.
not_available I have a baby.
not_available I can't go back to waitressing, and now you're telling me we can't even afford a coffin? What will people think? Mrs.
not_available Swanson, I'm sitting here thinking why don't you rent it? How much would that be? How much do you have? I don't know.
not_available My ATM card's not working.
not_available We'll work something out.
not_available And afterwards, we'll give you his ashes in an urn.
not_available You really loved him, didn't you? OK.
not_available ItAs OK.
not_available ItAs alright, let it out.
not_available I think it's good you told your boys about me.
not_available Are you kidding? It was insane.
not_available I certainly didn't choose to do it.
not_available It just happened.
not_available / It was brave.
not_available It was guilt.
not_available I loved my husband.
not_available I know you did.
not_available Hiram, when I think of us now, I feel like I'm watching the whole thing on some sex channel on cable TV.
not_available Is that right? Yes, and that my husband might be watching us, too.
not_available I want some changes made, I"ll tell you that.
not_available I'm not answering dead calls all night long anymore.
not_available Let them hire somebody, or sell the business, or whatever.
not_available I want to take you somewhere away from all of this.
not_available No.
not_available / They're adults.
not_available They can take care of themselves.
not_available I have 2 plane tickets to Costa Rica a week from Monday.
not_available Separate rooms.
not_available I was 19 when I got married.
not_available I've never been on my own.
not_available I wouldn't even know how.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're a very kind person, and you've been good to me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Good choice in music.
not_available It's from his car.
not_available It's the last CD he ever heard.
not_available Adele Swanson, your husband owes me $45,000! Listen, he kept it all from her.
not_available Now she's broke with a baby, and you're going to leave her alone.
not_available Who the fuck are you? 
not_available I own this place.
not_available Now get the hell out before I call the cops.
not_available You people suck! What was that? Some freak Swanson owed money to.
not_available Nate, I notice Mr.
not_available Swanson is in the Titan Casket.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's giving it back.
not_available I made the deal for cremation.
not_available They can't give it back.
not_available By law, it has to be burned with him.
not_available You just cost us $9000, you fucking moron.
not_available What?!? How was I supposed to know that? I'm so sorry about your father.
not_available Jennifer.
not_available I was in Boca Raton.
not_available My mom had to have her hip replaced.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available How is she? She's fine, thanks.
not_available So I didn't find out about Mr.
not_available Fisher till yesterday.
not_available I'm just heartbroken about it.
not_available I'll miss him.
not_available / Well, he adored you.
not_available Oh, David, I won't be answering the phones anymore.
not_available Uh
not_available ok.
not_available Now every part of your body has a new meaning to me.
not_available We should go.
not_available / Like your nose.
not_available Come on.
not_available And your little hand.
not_available Hands, I get.
not_available And your toes.
not_available / You're tickling! Alright, here, try these.
not_available You can play with mine.
not_available You're right.
not_available Now I don't feel anything.
not_available See? It's perfect.
not_available Would you, um, no, I'm embarrassed.
not_available / What? Would you rub it? OK.
not_available You're making my toe hard.
not_available Do you wanna kiss it? / Your toe?!? No.
not_available / Come on, I'll do something for you.
not_available Anything.
not_available Aren't you forgetting something? Oh Please! Uh Filthy Shit Fuck.
not_available Hey, Nate.
not_available Keith.
not_available I met you at your Dad's viewing.
not_available Oh, yeah, David's racquetball partner.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is David inside? No.
not_available He went out for dinner with his ex
not_available fiancee.
not_available She missed DadAs funeral, and they were pretty close, so
not_available Yeah, that's cool.
not_available I understand completely.
not_available I have his cell phone number, if you wanna give him a call.
not_available Already gave it a shot.
not_available He didn't answer.
not_available Hey, is David any good? At racquetball? Because we used to play when I was in high school, and he was pathetic, running into walls
not_available Yeah, I think you'd be surprised just how good he's gotten.
not_available Well, I'll tell him you came by.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dear God! I need to get his watch.
not_available I need to sell it for the money.
not_available My life is over! This is a hard time.
not_available The hardest.
not_available It was all a lie! He left us with nothing, because there never was anything.
not_available Bastard! I almost died when I saw our engagement pictures still on your mantle.
not_available Why? My family loved you.
not_available My father especially.
not_available He loved you.
not_available Yeah, he had a funny way of showing it.
not_available I'm drunk.
not_available Then I can ask.
not_available Are you happy? I'm still me.
not_available Your father knew.
not_available We had coffee once, and he said he understood why we couldn't be together.
not_available He said you spent so much time trying to make other people happy, you never thought about yourself.
not_available He worried about that.
not_available So, do you have anyone now? Can you tell me about him? You're completely wrong about my father.
not_available You didn't know him at all.
not_available Nobody did.
not_available Let's get a room at a hotel, and fuck our brains out.
not_available How about it? Jesus, David! Hi.
not_available I got your message.
not_available Sorry I didn't call you back.
not_available I had to go out to County Hospital.
not_available The body's still in Long Beach.
not_available Autopsy's not even finished yet.
not_available It's unbelievable.
not_available How was the meeting? Everyone asked about you.
not_available They wanna meet you.
not_available I wanna meet them.
not_available I'm a little drunk.
not_available You might have to undress me.
not_available OK.
not_available Right after you stop lying to me.
not_available Um, Brenda.
not_available Yes, Nate? Why is my name tattooed on your ass? It's not your name.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available You're not the only person named that.
not_available Nate, it's a coincidence.
not_available It's not you or anyone you know.
not_available Come on, you think I'm so enamored with you, I had your name burned into my flesh? Then how come I never saw it before? We've had sex twice.
not_available Once with our clothes on, and once in the dark after three martinis a piece.
not_available Well, you obviously liked some guy enough to have his name burned in your flesh.
not_available I would have done a lot more than that for him.
not_available It's about time, you fucking moron.
not_available What are you doing in there? Could you help me out, you fucking moron? Why can't you just climb out? I think we both know the answer to that, you fucking moron.
not_available You really should do something about this.
not_available It's really deep.
not_available Might as well be bleeding.
not_available Could you be a little more dramatic? Oh, I could be a lot more dramatic.
not_available What are you doing today? Dave and I have to go get the registration out of the wrecked hearse.
not_available Insurance won't replace without it.
not_available What time? Take your cell phone.
not_available OK.
not_available Promise me you will.
not_available Alright.
not_available Oh, I don't feel like carbs this morning.
not_available Do we have any more of those Stevie Nicks raspberries? Claire, do you have an eating disorder? What?!? No, Mom, I wish.
not_available Are you being helped? Yeah, my pop's here
not_available Suarez.
not_available Of course.
not_available The Titan Series.
not_available Quite beautiful.
not_available Give me a number.
not_available You guys oughtta get your act together.
not_available You see, your brother said that this was on special, so why don't we start there? That's not legal, reselling a coffin.
not_available There are fluids that seep, OK? And Mr.
not_available Swanson, he seeped.
not_available What did you tell Mr.
not_available Suarez? Hey, he wants a quality coffin.
not_available We happen to have one available.
not_available I don't agree with this at all.
not_available It's against my beliefs.
not_available Thank you, Federico.
not_available And it's insanitary.
not_available Well, they're dead.
not_available What disease can they possibly catch? It's too late, Nate.
not_available It's a $9000 retail item.
not_available Our cost is 3200.
not_available We eat that, plus we lose the profit.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's a $6000 mark
not_available up? Mr.
not_available Suarez, we cannot let you have that casket.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available We can't legally sell it to you, because, very briefly, it was occupied by another person.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available David, don't be a fucking moron.
not_available Look, fellas, let's split the difference, because I've gotta get a haircut before the service.
not_available My brother has no authorization
not_available Mr.
not_available Suarez, it's a $9000 product.
not_available It's used one night.
not_available You're getting it at cost to us.
not_available Would you be willing to stipulate that you understand the condition of the coffin? Sure, whatever.
not_available May I make a suggestion? You've closed.
not_available Don't overclose.
not_available It kills the wordof
not_available mouth.
not_available Is that the best anybody could come up with? "Father, husband, caregiver"? How would you prefer? "Introvert, sadist, mindfucker"? Excuse me, Mr.
not_available Fisher? Matt Gilardi.
not_available Kroehner Services International.
not_available I understand you're now part owner of the business.
not_available You are aware we've made a very rich buy
not_available out offer for your unit.
not_available OK.
not_available This is a one time offer.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available You think you can hold out? We control suppliers now.
not_available Where are you gonna get your chemicals? How about your caskets and liners? What about this Diaz kid? I mean, this guy is a top
not_available notch restorative artist.
not_available Are you threatening to put us out of business? We look at it as a partnership.
not_available In the death care industry now, it's consolidate or die.
not_available Decide which, Nate, and give me a ring, 'cause we will put things into motion, either way.
not_available He'll put things in motion either way? Ooo hoo! Tough guy! / Shut up.
not_available Right in here.
not_available Sign this right here.
not_available Well, it's totaled.
not_available The insurance company was right about that.
not_available Fuck! There's still blood on the wheel! OK, let's go.
not_available Jesus, don't you feel anything? Yeah, I feel betrayed.
not_available Hello? Meet me at the corner of Sunset and Borden.
not_available Now.
not_available It's important.
not_available What? Bring your brother.
not_available Trust me.
not_available You need to do this.
not_available I spoke to Gilardi.
not_available And? He says we sell or they put us out of business.
not_available Fuck.
not_available I think we should sell.
not_available And erase everything this family has meant for fifty years? That might not be such a bad thing.
not_available Hey.
not_available Brenda.
not_available Uh, this is my brother, Dave.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on, let's do this.
not_available This is the bus.
not_available What bus? The bus.
not_available Brenda, this isn't funny.
not_available This is fucked up.
not_available What gives you the right to do something like this? He's I never
