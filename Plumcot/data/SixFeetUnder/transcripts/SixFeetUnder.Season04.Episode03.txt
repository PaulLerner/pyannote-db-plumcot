
not_available Okay, Ashley, your turn.
not_available Pick someone.
not_available "Gupta, Sandeep." 
not_available No Indian people.
not_available We're gonna get in trouble, you guys.
not_available We should stop doing this.
not_available How about Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Gerald Gurvitz? 
not_available Yes, do them.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi, is Gerald there? What time is it? Who is this? Um, he'll know.
not_available Honey, wake up.
not_available Something's wrong.
not_available May I ask what this is regarding? Tell him he left his underwear here.
not_available Shh! Excuse me? What is it, honey? Hang up! 
not_available Put it on speaker! There's a woman on the phone and she says that you left your underwear at her house? That's not possible.
not_available God damn it, Gerald! I could kill you, Gerry.
not_available What did you do? Hang up, Ashley.
not_available I'm dying! Oh, Jesus.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's just kids.
not_available I'm gonna call the police.
not_available I've got caller ID, you little idiots.
not_available Kaitlin.
not_available Oh my God! Kaitlin, are you okay? Oh my God, Mrs.
not_available Stolte! Kaitlin! Kaitlin! Mrs.
not_available Stolte! Mrs.
not_available Stolte! I am so so sorry.
not_available Cancer? Yes.
not_available Yes, cancer.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm here for you.
not_available Okay, better.
not_available But use "we're here" not "I'm here." You're not their friend.
not_available Right.
not_available And easy on the touching.
not_available Even funeral directors have to beware of transference.
not_available David, you are, quite simply put, the best I've ever worked with.
not_available Arthur, I'm the only one you've ever worked with.
not_available Okay.
not_available This one's all you.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Something youthful, something white.
not_available Perhaps white with her favorite color.
not_available Her favorite color is light blue.
not_available I thought it was purple.
not_available It used to be purple.
not_available This year it changed to light blue.
not_available Sky blue.
not_available She's only 14.
not_available That is so young.
not_available It is.
not_available It is so young.
not_available Might I suggest white with a periwinkle silk lining? Periwinkle is sort of in between purple and light blue.
not_available I think she might like that.
not_available She would like that.
not_available That's good.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's all we need for now.
not_available I'll send photos over later.
not_available We didn't know we were supposed to bring photos.
not_available Of course not.
not_available How could you? I'll see you out.
not_available Claire, could you come get this? 
not_available Nice.
not_available People collect those.
not_available It's kind of racist.
not_available That's why I put it way up there back in the '60s.
not_available Just put it with all the other things in that pile over there.
not_available Did you start making piles in your room yet? Um, I still have to go through some old piles, then I'll start making some new ones.
not_available I've made a schedule for the garage sale.
not_available I thought if we put a plan in place we'd be free to deviate.
not_available As long as we're free to deviate.
not_available So are we just selling our stuff to make room for George? Or is he gonna get rid of some of his stuff, too? Like perhaps his Tupperware thing full of shit? Sorry.
not_available What are we calling it? We're not calling it anything.
not_available It's long gone.
not_available There are a lot of things in this house that aren't even mine.
not_available Like that Mammy cookie jar.
not_available That comes from your father's side.
not_available A lot of stuff needs to just go.
not_available I'd personally prefer it if people could just come upstairs and, like, bid on my entire room.
not_available And I'm sure Nate has a few things he probably doesn't need to have around.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Ah.
not_available Ah.
not_available Monkey.
not_available Monkey.
not_available I have to say I'm crazy about the new Range Rovers.
not_available You can't drive an SUV these days with a straight face.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I don't see another way.
not_available Certainly not a minivan.
not_available Oh, no, fuck that.
not_available Hey, there's that poor guy whose wife drowned.
not_available I know, that is so sad.
not_available He's hot though, huh? 
not_available Shh.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you two? We are fine, thank you.
not_available You're Nate, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available I'm Madeline.
not_available Madeline, hi.
not_available This is Linda.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, how are you? 
not_available And I know Maya.
not_available Hello, Maya.
not_available You want to get down and play? All right.
not_available There you go.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, you guys going to Jimmy's thing tonight? I'm so sick of Jimmy's things.
not_available I actually think we're not going.
not_available Well, we're all going.
not_available It's not like there's anything better to do.
not_available What time are you guys getting there? Don't forget about that thing in Chinatown.
not_available We should go to that.
not_available Maybe we can go there first and get to Jimmy's at like 10:00.
not_available Excellent, good.
not_available I will see you there.
not_available Not going.
not_available God, that mustache is repulsive.
not_available I can't believe I loved him.
not_available I thought you guys were just friends.
not_available No, he was, like, my serious boyfriend like all of freshman year.
not_available I could have sworn he was gay.
not_available He's knitting.
not_available Haven't you noticed? A lot of straight guys knit these days.
not_available It's like a macho thing.
not_available Like, I'm so straight I can even knit.
not_available Oh, okay, so he's actually not gay? Don't even ask me.
not_available At the time he had, like, severe bi
not_available curious issues.
not_available Why don't you want to go to Jimmy's thing? He's like the Matthew Barney of LAC Arts.
not_available Oh, right, he wishes.
not_available I already told Edie we were going.
not_available She's going? Oh, yeah, she's always at his things.
not_available Hmm.
not_available # The wheels on the bus go round and round # # Round and round, round and round # # The wheels on the bus go round and round # # All through the town # # The driver on the bus yells move on back.
not_available # Not bad.
not_available Okay, if Jessica Simpson is the poor man's Britney, what's Celeste? 
not_available Maybe a thinking man's Britney.
not_available Her music is supposed to be inspirational to young girls.
not_available I'm not just an object, I am somebody.
not_available Oh, like Christina.
not_available Like Christina, but without the ass 
not_available hanging out of the chaps.
not_available Got it.
not_available I'd like to see your ass hanging out of some chaps.
not_available Okay, never.
not_available You know I hate that shit.
not_available So do you get to meet Celeste tomorrow? No, I'm like third line of defense.
not_available You don't get to meet the big stars until you've proven you're not a freak.
not_available Remember Cameron Diaz? Okay, definitely do not do that in front of Celeste or any of Celeste's people, okay, freak? # You could be the one, shave my legs for free # "Shave my legs for free"? I don't think those are the words.
not_available # You could be the one, shave my legs for free # Condom.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available You got it? Okay? 
not_available Almost, almost.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available I hate these things.
not_available Let's just do something else.
not_available Let me just make you come.
not_available No, I want to make you come.
not_available No, and then there's this expectation.
not_available I hate expectations.
not_available Just let me try.
not_available I don't want to try.
not_available No, here 
not_available Okay.
not_available Just lay down.
not_available Yeah? Lay back.
not_available And shush.
not_available I can't get rid of this goofy smile.
not_available But if I can get this right, I think I can bring her lips own a little bit.
not_available May I ask what technique you'll be employing? Yes.
not_available It's called a full MacKew.
not_available As you can see, I've already threaded ligature through her nasal cartilage.
not_available I thought that was called a half MacKew? If I'd stopped there, it would have been a half MacKew.
not_available But watch.
not_available I'm going downward through her gum line here and using her jawbone to anchor the thread before I tie it off.
not_available Fascinating.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Arthur, you ready to go? Federico, if it's all right with you, I'll return in approximately one and one half hours.
not_available Maybe a little while longer if we decide to get lunch after.
not_available I'll wash up, and meet you in the foyer.
not_available You guys are getting lunch? Shopping, then lunch.
not_available Wow, shopping.
not_available Would you like to join us? 
not_available No, no, I have work to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available This one won't stop smiling.
not_available I wish I knew what the fuck was so funny.
not_available Hello? Oh, hey.
not_available Hi, come on in.
not_available Look, Jaden.
not_available Tu amiga is here! Hey, Maya, hi.
not_available Hey, if she wants to go and play, you can just let her go.
not_available Oh, l she hasn't really played with that many kids yet.
not_available Oh, well, at this age, they play next to each other, not with each other.
not_available It's called parallel play.
not_available You want to get down? You wanna go play? There you go, go ahead.
not_available There she goes.
not_available Oh here, I'll take that.
not_available Um, Gladys! Okay, Miss Madeline.
not_available Come, mija.
not_available So, um, you want a smoothie? Uh, sure, sure.
not_available Wanna play with the monkey? You like monkeys? Must be a late wedding present.
not_available The card says, "To Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available George Sibley"! I like the sound of that, Mrs.
not_available George Oh, dear.
not_available What did we get? Ew, what's that smell? It appears to be excrement again.
not_available No way.
not_available Except this time someone went to the trouble to place one inside a decorative tin.
not_available "To Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available George Sibley." Hmm, no signature, imagine that.
not_available This is a catastrophe of the highest order.
not_available This involves both of us now! Who knows you live here? Why don't you care about this? I've made a lot of enemies through the years, Ruth.
not_available You take the back
not_available stabbing world of academia, throw in a controversial field like geology, you've got real trouble.
not_available Geology is controversial? Oil, Claire.
not_available Oil.
not_available Look, this is from a person who quite obviously is looking for a reaction.
not_available Somebody who needs attention.
not_available Let's not give it to him.
not_available That person isn't in the room.
not_available He can't see my reaction.
not_available That's a good point, Mom.
not_available Maybe it's one of your mother's old lovers.
not_available My lovers? 
not_available The Greek one.
not_available He was Russian.
not_available Are you leaving, Claire? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Toss this in the dumpster, then, would you? Oh, I think I'll let you do that, George.
not_available Oh, Lord.
not_available Put back to me.
not_available I like you in brown.
not_available Is this brown or is this gray? Charka.
not_available See, chocolate.
not_available I thought he said charcoal.
not_available Charka.
not_available Okay, take off now.
not_available What'd you find? Normally I'd never shop in the Valley, but this place ain't too bad.
not_available There's a whole rack of marked
not_available down Jil Sander.
not_available Plus some John Varvatos, Hugo Boss and a pair of Prada shoes for like $100.
not_available Where's Arthur? Changing.
not_available Maybe we should buy him a whole new wardrobe.
not_available Do they ever do that? "Queer Eye for the Gay Guy?" I don't think Arthur's gay, I think he's "A." I don't know, I think asexual people are asexual because they don't wanna come out of the closet.
not_available You really think Arthur might be gay? Uh, yeah.
not_available Aw.
not_available That breaks my heart.
not_available I'm gonna go try a couple of these on.
not_available You'd look good in this.
not_available David, I need new clothes for work, not gay ski weekend at Mammoth.
not_available I'm gonna buy you the suit, okay? Oh no, I couldn't possibly let you do that.
not_available I want to.
not_available Besides, it's a business expense.
not_available If I had a father, this is the kind of thing he'd do for me.
not_available Or even an elder sibling.
not_available It's just a suit.
not_available Hey, Nicole.
not_available You like the way this sounds, huh? But the guy goes if I wanted my food stamps, I should have been on time.
not_available So he said I had to call the social worker, but she's out all week.
not_available Anyway, my friend's here, so I'm gonna go right now.
not_available 'Bye.
not_available We should get Nicole some toys.
not_available That top is kid safe.
not_available But, yeah, she needs some new toys.
not_available I didn't know you got food stamps.
not_available Yeah, they're from before I was working at the club.
not_available I can afford food of course.
not_available It's just if I get the food stamps.
not_available then I can save the cash for something else.
not_available Hey, you okay? I don't want Nicole to see me cry.
not_available It's just I've been a little freaked out lately because I'm completely exhausted.
not_available I think it's because I have lupus.
not_available Oh, shit, are you serious? No, what 
not_available It's caused by leaking implants.
not_available Seriously, I feel like one of 'em ruptured and there's this like poison silicone roaming around my body.
not_available Oh, Jeez.
not_available Did you see a doctor? Not yet, not yet.
not_available Oh my God, Sophia.
not_available Hey, listen, it's gonna be okay.
not_available All right? Maybe we should maybe we should pray? Rico, I don't need prayer.
not_available I need surgery! Medical surgery! Plus if I get one boob done, they're not gonna match.
not_available So I have to get them both redone, which is like five grand! Unless you put the payment plan, which is like $1,500 deposit.
not_available I'm not asking you for the money.
not_available God, I should have never told you! If I were to give you the $1,500 for the deposit, do you think that maybe you can, you know, pay me back? I don't know where I could get $1,500 in a chunk like that.
not_available Well, you can pay me back whatever you have whenever you have it.
not_available I'll just give you the money.
not_available Oh my God, are you serious? My angel.
not_available Nicole, God sent us an angel.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You have a great life.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Do I need a coaster? No, you can put it anywhere.
not_available Uh, okay, so this is the book I was telling you about.
not_available His name is Thich Nhat Hahn.
not_available And he says that it all starts with learning how to breathe.
not_available So 
not_available Thich Nhat Hahn.
not_available So, if I read this book, I'll be happy? It's not that simple.
not_available So what is it? You seem to be happy.
not_available You ought to know.
not_available Oh, God, well um, I don't know.
not_available I guess for me, it all started with my divorce, actually.
not_available And then making the decision to be a stayat
not_available home mom.
not_available I mean it's hard, not working.
not_available But I love being with Jaden, so When she's not with her nannies.
not_available Okay, one is a nanny and the other is a housekeeper.
not_available Okay.
not_available So this is this what you wanted your life to be? This is actually better than I expected.
not_available It smells so good in here.
not_available Thich Nhat Hahn.
not_available That's right.
not_available That fireplace work? Yeah.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What's okay? All right, let's do this.
not_available Well, about fucking time! Everybody kept asking me, when are Claire and Anita getting here? And I said, how the fuck should I know? How 'bout it, my ladies? Whoa! 
not_available You're quite the host.
not_available Everything I do, I do for you.
not_available Do you have a lighter? I've got fire.
not_available Go, your serene hotness.
not_available Better now.
not_available Me, me.
not_available Better not be you, Russell.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Hey, how long have you been here? 
not_available Too long.
not_available Hey, I like your skirt.
not_available Did you make it? 
not_available Maybe I did.
not_available You are so talented.
not_available Gimme some of that.
not_available # Oh, Froggy went a courtin' and he did ride # # Oh, Froggy went a courtin' and he did ride # # Oh, Froggy went a courtin' and he did ride # # With a sword and pistol # By his side # Ugh, this always happens, I get stoned and then I'm locked in this prison.
not_available What, you're paranoid? Please, no one thinks anything bad.
not_available You're like the beautiful fair
not_available skinned untouchable art princess.
not_available Miss Mousey! No, I'm not so much paranoid, more like I'd rather choose to just be this observer.
not_available Because for one, I know that if I feel any vibe about any guy, I should know it means red flag, red flag! Beyond that, basically I hate everyone.
not_available I hate her.
not_available And her.
not_available And that guy with the fucking Boy Scout jacket.
not_available Like, is that supposed to be ironic? Yeah, I would say more misanthrope than paranoid.
not_available Yeah, but I'm also so tired of hating everything, you know? I mean, truly.
not_available # Froggy went a courtin' and he did ride # # And a sword and pistol # # With a sword and pistol # Check one, two.
not_available People, focus! The person on stage needs to be looked at.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you incredibly stoned? 
not_available No.
not_available Does she do this kind of thing a lot? All the time.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Shut it.
not_available the great American art school poseur jerk
not_available off extravaganza.
not_available Anyone near the stage, we call that the splash zone, so you may want to stand back.
not_available I'm not responsible for dry cleaning bills.
not_available Yeah, baby.
not_available Yeah, baby! Jesus Christ.
not_available This girl's ding
not_available dong out of her mind.
not_available Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! You're the only girl here.
not_available Yeah, baby! Yeah yeah, baby! I wish I had my camera.
not_available Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! Yes yes yes, yeah! Please enter.
not_available Well.
not_available Hello.
not_available Mrs Ruth.
not_available Arthur, I have something to say.
not_available Please.
not_available What we had was very special, but it's in the past.
not_available We can't continue to hold grudges and be angry with one another.
not_available I hold no grudges with you.
not_available I'm happy that you appear so happy.
not_available Arthur, this has to stop! I know that you sent us the feces box and the feces gift basket! Ruth! Do you know how horrified I am that you think I could commit an act so heinous? You don't know me at all, do you? I know that you're frustrated, Arthur, sitting idly by as George and I fall deeper and deeper in love each day.
not_available But we had our chance, we had our time We never had a chance! So you are harboring feelings! I do harbor feelings.
not_available I'm human.
not_available And I'm a man.
not_available You of all people should know that.
not_available But I would never send those things to you.
not_available I could never send you poo.
not_available Ever! I wish I could believe you.
not_available I wish you could, too.
not_available Now I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
not_available # I keep my butterfly close # # When you don't wanna be bothered # # Don't go waking me up # # 'Cause I ain't giving you nada # # 'Cause I got me a toy # # And it works for me # # It lasts longer than the battery # # So you'd best believe that # # A toy, every girl must have a toy # # The way it make you feel # # Every girl must have a toy # # A toy, every girl must have a toy # Is this the line? Yeah.
not_available # I used to wish that you would love me # # And fantasize on how we used to be # # Until I discovered something better than you # # I don't need, don't need # So, this course I'm taking, "Recovery from Madness," the woman who teaches it was actually or is bipolar.
not_available Do you have to be bipolar to get in? Yeah, it helps.
not_available Anyway, she wrote this incredible book explaining what it feels like.
not_available She's kind of a pioneer.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available I could wait on you hand and foot all day.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available It would make me a very happy man.
not_available So, you know, last night when I was putting on that condom Oh, listen, you don't have to explain.
not_available I should just go back on the pill and it won't be a problem.
not_available No no no no, you know, I used to think that I had, like, a problem staying hard or whatever.
not_available Hey, no, it's okay, really.
not_available No, then I realized that I'm totally hard when l you know, like when people role I really like that dynamic when, like, one person is boss and the other person is sort of like more dominant or the other person is a little more sub I'm not explaining this very well.
not_available No, you're 
not_available you're explaining it fine.
not_available It's actually You don't need to explain it anymore.
not_available You know, look, I know everyone has their thing.
not_available I've known prostitutes and dominatrixes.
not_available I've been to sex clubs and leather clubs.
not_available I've heard of guys who can only come if the I don't know, the girl is sitting on a balloon.
not_available I wrote this whole erotic novella about a girl who I was hoping that we could be 
not_available We can be anything.
not_available No, l I was hoping that we could have normal sex.
not_available Like normal sex? 
not_available Yeah, normal sex.
not_available You know, the way normal people do it.
not_available I mean, normal people have sex, right? 
not_available Yeah, I presume so.
not_available Yeah! They don't turn it all into some fantasy or get drunk or smoke pot to make it interesting.
not_available We can smoke pot.
not_available I can get pot.
not_available No, I don't want to smoke pot.
not_available I smoked so much pot, it was it made me me.
not_available Now all those things just seem like an escape from sex.
not_available All right, well, I'll put some thought into exploring my normal side.
not_available Oh, that's not what I was saying.
not_available But anyway, look, I should go to bed.
not_available I've got class tomorrow.
not_available So, I'm going home? 
not_available If you need to.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yuck.
not_available Spinnies.
not_available Are you gonna barf in my bed? Nah.
not_available 'Cause I can get a garbage can and put it next to you if you want.
not_available Nah.
not_available I can't believe I drank so much and didn't even have fun.
not_available I can't believe I made out with Russell.
not_available He's a really good kisser.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So is Edie, like, fulltime lesbian or is she just like art school bi
not_available girl? Nope, hard core.
not_available Like, totally lesbian feminist.
not_available Is she going out with that girl? That red
not_available haired girl with the wife beater? You okay, Anita? Maybe I could use that garbage can.
not_available Arthur? "To the wonderful Fisher family.
not_available I am sorry to inform you that effective immediately, I am resigning from Fisher &amp; Diaz as well as releasing tenancy of my room in the Fisher residence.
not_available I no longer feel comfortable in these surroundings.
not_available Best, Arthur." 
not_available Who's Arthur? Who are you? This is my friend Anita.
not_available That's my brother David.
not_available And this is my brother Nate.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available Arthur quit.
not_available Oh, that's too bad.
not_available What the hell happened? I just bought him a suit.
not_available Well, I got to go.
not_available I have to take Maya over to her new friend Jaden's house for a play date.
not_available Oh, cool.
not_available No, leave.
not_available Maya has places to be.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I didn't know twoyear
not_available olds had actual friendships.
not_available Yeah, they met at Mommy and Me.
not_available They really hit it off.
not_available Oh, where's all your garage sale stuff? I don't have any.
not_available Look, everything I have, I need.
not_available Don't ask.
not_available I wonder if Arthur left because he felt pressured.
not_available Like Keith and I were trying to welcome
not_available wagon him into Gayland.
not_available Gayland? Please, Arthur had a thing with Mom.
not_available In fact, I'm pretty sure they were fuck buddies.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Arthur and Mom? Yeah, she was very vague about it, but I know something went on.
not_available Scott, I'm putting you out in the audience, in case some freak has gotten in.
not_available Keith, I'm making you the designated for Celeste.
not_available Got it.
not_available I want you to park it outside of her dressing room and do not let anybody in except for the rabbi and lawyer.
not_available Just those two guys, check.
not_available No, they're the same guy.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Fred, I think I've already made this perfectly clear.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, I'm fine doing the crappy Kid's Choice Awards, but I will not present with Hillary fucking Duff.
not_available There has to be someone else.
not_available Come on, think a little harder than that.
not_available The Olsen twins? What, is that supposed to be funny? At the tone leave me a message.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Where are you? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hello.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available She in there?

not_available Oh, I understand, but I'm Ellen.
not_available It's my show, so 
not_available Right.
not_available Not a threat.
not_available That's a pretty blouse.
not_available That doesn't sound manly.
not_available Nice shirt.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is that mauve or mauve? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pretty.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Celeste.
not_available Hmm? 
not_available Hi, I'm Ellen.
not_available I know that! Oh, well Pineapple? 
not_available No thank you.
not_available It's like my brain is encased in this fluid and if I move, then the fluid moves and my brain kills.
not_available Or it could be encephalitis.
not_available Here, try my soda.
not_available Looks like you sold my TV.
not_available Oh, yeah, I got 50! Your little boys are so cute! The big one looks exactly like his daddy! Yeah, his daddy's just gonna buy some more junk and we're gonna spend the 50 we just made.
not_available "Control Freaks" is the movie.
not_available And Colin Farrell, who she's just friends with I am.
not_available We're just friends.
not_available He's really sweet though.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available And so let's talk a little bit about the CD.
not_available "Me.
not_available Here.
not_available Now!" 
not_available "Me.
not_available Here.
not_available Now!" And is it me comma, here comma, now? No, me period, here period, now.
not_available Exclamation.
not_available Exclamation mark.
not_available It is strong.
not_available It's about me being here right now.
not_available I mean, I want all my fans, all the girls out there to know that the most important thing is to be yourself and to be here now.
not_available That's right.
not_available And this is who you are in the now.
not_available But if you were someone different say yesterday or even tomorrow that's still who you are, it's now.
not_available Although it was before or maybe later.
not_available But it's you in the then.
not_available Uh
not_available huh, and it comes out in two weeks.
not_available Oh my God, creepy Colin Farrell just left me another creepy message.
not_available Can't we do something about that? You know, legally? 
not_available Well, I guess that's it.
not_available Keith, did you use the bathroom in Celeste's dressing room? Yeah, but that's when she was doing the show.
not_available No one was around so I thought Yeah, dude, it's not cool, okay? Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available You do not use the client's can ever.
not_available Got it.
not_available I think I know who sent us the the The shit? 
not_available Yes, the shit.
not_available I believe it was Arthur.
not_available Arthur? George, Arthur quit today after I confronted him.
not_available And you should probably know that Arthur and I once had something.
not_available I don't know why I didn't tell you.
not_available No need.
not_available It's none of my business.
not_available But he doesn't seem like someone you'd be attracted to.
not_available Well, it wasn't it wasn't a relationship.
not_available But we did care deeply for one another.
not_available We understood one another, we had similar interests.
not_available Similar interests? Like sex? No, no, it wasn't like that.
not_available We had our own language.
not_available We nuzzled.
not_available I don't know what you mean.
not_available The way horses nuzzle.
not_available Like a head rubbing.
not_available A head butting.
not_available You butted heads? Oh, you make it sound so sordid! Look, we did this.
not_available Stop it.
not_available It was quite lovely.
not_available It wasn't funny.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, maybe we were a little crazy.
not_available It's called a folie a deux.
not_available Two people confusing a momentary insanity for love.
not_available Is that what it's called? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Oh! 
not_available Oh! I'm sorry, Jaden and I have to go meet some people at The Grove in a few minutes.
not_available No, it's fine, I just thought Hey! Did you get my bed all wet? 
not_available I thought you were coming back.
not_available I wish.
not_available Well, if you want, Maya and I could stay here with the nanny.
not_available I could pop in a movie for her and we could be waiting when you get back.
not_available You're funny.
not_available God, these sheets feel so good.
not_available I've never felt anything like them.
not_available Where are they from? Um I need you to leave.
not_available Right.
not_available So it's that easy? 
not_available What is? I mean, how are people supposed to do this exactly? Am I supposed to just avoid that particular Mommy and Me class? Or you're just gonna send your nanny so you can avoid looking at me and seeing me and seeing what I thought I saw in you? And so I just cease to exist? And so do you? Nate.
not_available Are you okay? I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know why I'm doing this.
not_available You have to leave.
not_available We'll go.
not_available Okay, I'll wait for you downstairs.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available You got in trouble? What, did you ask for her autograph or something? Or look her in the eye? 
not_available No, worse.
not_available I peed in her john.
not_available What, you mean like on the toilet seat? No.
not_available I lifted the seat.
not_available I just used the same toilet she did, which apparently is a major faux pas.
not_available Well, if it helps, my day sucked too.
not_available Arthur quit.
not_available Yeah, I'm in hell.
not_available And I'll probably never be home in time for dinner again.
not_available So where's your other brother? What's your problem? You in love with my brother now? I just asked where he was.
not_available God, if no one buys this stuff, I am not dragging it back upstairs.
not_available I'm just not feeling this like hippy
not_available dippy paisley crap anymore, you know? It's like, suddenly I just feel modern and simple.
not_available I just want like white plastic furniture.
not_available So why don't you just trash all the shit you don't want or take it to the thrift store? Yeah, or burn it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom, why don't we just burn what's left over? We can't.
not_available Some of this stuff is valuable.
not_available Sure you wanna save this? That was Arthur's pouch.
not_available A couple pennies in it.
not_available I think you're right, Claire.
not_available Let's burn it.
not_available Let's burn it all.
not_available I missed you.
not_available You were so far away.
not_available All the way across the courtyard.
not_available It was nice knowing where you were even when we weren't talking.
not_available Were we not talking? Not officially, I guess.
not_available So this question of normal sex I know.
not_available It is so silly.
not_available I don't know why I said it.
not_available I don't even know what I meant.
not_available I think I just wanted so much to do it right this time.
not_available And I thought 
not_available Funny, 'cause the more I thought, the more normal sex just kinda seemed like, you know, bad sex.
not_available I know.
not_available I think, ideally sex for me should be this revealing of myself.
not_available Ourselves, maybe.
not_available I think that can be a loving thing too.
not_available Right? 
not_available Mmm.
not_available Don't take Brenda apart and just sort of hand me the good stuff.
not_available I want all the stuff, even the bad stuff.
not_available What? Oh.
not_available Mmm.
not_available So what was it that you wanted to say? Well remember when I said I could wait on you hand and foot? # I'm on a roll # # I'm on a roll # # This time # # I feel my luck # # Could change # # Kill me, Sarah # # Kill me again # What's this? # It's going to be a glorious day # You look weird.
not_available Hey, can you hold her? Don't let her get too close to the fire.
not_available Okay.
not_available # Pull me out # # Of the lake # # 'Cause I'm your superhero # # We are standing on the edge # # The head of state # # Has called for me # # By name # Mom.
not_available I'm moving back into the house.
not_available Okay.
not_available You can have Arthur's room.
not_available Can I have the coach
not_available house then? Well, I don't see why not.
not_available # A glorious # # Day # # I feel my luck # # Could change # # Pull me out # # Of the aircrash # # Pull me out # # Of the lake # # 'Cause I'm your superhero # # We are standing on the edge # # We are standing on the edge.
