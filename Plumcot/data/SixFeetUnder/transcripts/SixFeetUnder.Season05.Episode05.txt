
not_available Saison 5 Episode 5 "Eat A Peach" I hope everybody saved room for dessert.
not_available How come uncle danny doesn't like clean peaches? "Cling" peaches, not clean.
not_available As in clingstone.
not_available And who says uncle danny doesn't like cling peaches? Uncle danny loves cling peaches, he just can't have any.
not_available Why can't he have any? Because he has the diabetes.
not_available Hit me.
not_available Hit me again.
not_available We used to have that plum tree in the backyard.
not_available That wasn't a plum tree.
not_available You got 16, you should hold.
not_available It was nectarines.
not_available Don't tell me when to hold.
not_available Hit me.
not_available You sure it was nectarines? 
not_available I thought it was plums.
not_available She never listen.
not_available First thing that goes is the memory.
not_available Well, I made ham for christmas.
not_available She doesn't like ham.
not_available I made her a capon, But she still didn't like that everybody else was eating ham.
not_available That's so like her.
not_available When her daughter got a tattoo she said, "I don't have a daughter.
not_available " I remember! How can anyone say that, that they don't have a daughter? She's so vindictive.
not_available Nothing was ever good enough for her.
not_available It was so sweet.
not_available She's a big girl.
not_available No, she got her stomach stapled.
not_available She did that? Yeah, she lost almost 200 Ibs.! No kidding? 
not_available Yeah, she got married.
not_available She did? 
not_available She married a foot doctor.
not_available She was so sweet.
not_available Yeah, and then she married a foot doctor.
not_available I went to the foot doctor.
not_available For your corns? For my bone spur.
not_available You had a bone spur? 
not_available Painful like you would not believe.
not_available Did you get the surgery? 
not_available They did.
not_available Doctors! What they can't do today.
not_available Staple your stomach, shave off a bone spur.
not_available That was That was lovely.
not_available Wasn't it? I know how hard this has been on you.
not_available I know you.
not_available I want to make it up to you.
not_available You don't have to make anything up to me.
not_available I wanna try to close this distance between us.
not_available What distance? I think we should travel.
not_available Travel? George, you're not You're not well.
not_available No, I'm feeling much much better.
not_available Where onarth would we travel to? Anywhere we wanted to.
not_available Anywhere the wind blows us.
not_available Could we talk about it another time? Yeah, sure.
not_available Of course.
not_available You know, I was thinking about inviting Maggie over some time.
not_available What for? 
not_available She's new in town.
not_available She doesn't really know anybody, except for George and my mother.
not_available I don't know, I think you'd like her.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to go potty.
not_available Oh, well, I am running a little late, So mommy will take you, okay? Maya, do you remember your other mommy? What are you doing? 
not_available Just asking her an honest question.
not_available It's important that we're honest with her, That she grows up with a coherent narrative, That she understands where she came from, and How I came into the picture.
not_available I am all for her growing up with a coherent narrative, But I think that we have to pick the right time To start telling this particular story.
not_available I mean, don't you think? I need to go potty! What better time than the present? Well, how about after she makes potty, for starters? Okay.
not_available Come on, mommy is gonna take you to make potty.
not_available Should we call mary? No, we don't wanna pressure her.
not_available Pressure? We just inseminated her.
not_available Has she tried to call you? You inseminated her, okay? Well, not personally I didn't.
not_available Has she tried to call you on your cell phone? Keith, relax.
not_available I'm sure if she was pregnant, We'd be the first people she called.
not_available I'm not sure I wanna do this.
not_available Do what? Go to this adoption fair.
not_available First of all, it's not a fair, it's a picnic.
not_available Second of all, we have to.
not_available Sissy pasquese wenthrough a lot of trouble to get us moved up the list.
not_available It just it seems weird.
not_available Weird how? Like we're going to look at puppies.
not_available We're not going to look at puppies.
not_available We don't know if mary is even pregnant, Or ever will get pregnant.
not_available Besides, we always agreed we'd keep moving forward On both prongs of the two
not_available Pronged approach Until one of the prongs pays off.
not_available Look at us.
not_available You know what we look like? Homos.
not_available He wanted to be cremated.
not_available No, he didn't! 
not_available We had a conversation.
not_available He was my brother.
not_available He was my brother too.
not_available And if carl says he wanted to be cremated, That's what we're gonna do.
not_available Over my dead body! Fine with me! Can we please take it down a notch? 
not_available She was always difficult.
not_available You leave her alone.
not_available Is there something in your faith that might provide us with some 
not_available Guidelines.
not_available We have no faith.
not_available We did when we were children.
not_available This is america.
not_available Since when do we have to have a faith in order to bury our brother? I didn't mean to imply, sir We're catholic, but lapsed.
not_available You may be lapsed.
not_available Vera and i still go to mass every sunday.
not_available It's a waste of time! There is no god.
not_available All I know is danny did not want to be cremated.
not_available He did! He told me himself six months ago at bingo.
not_available He told you he wanted to be cremated at bingo? Look, I think what we all need to do Is take a collective deep breath, And try to be honest about what we think, uh Daniel would have wanted.
not_available Not what we might want.
not_available I feel like everyone's just here to scope out the most adorable kid.
not_available They're all adorable
not_available On the surface.
not_available All these kids have gone through some serious damaging shit in their lives.
not_available Like we haven't? This whole thing's a little weird, don't you think? 
not_available It's just kids playing.
not_available It's not.
not_available They're acutely aware that they're being observed Like some animals in a zoo.
not_available Have you seen my brother? What about her? She's adorable, but she's surrounded.
not_available We've got to get in there.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available You keep getting sand in your shoes? That's why I hate sandboxes so much.
not_available There's so much sand in them.
not_available Such a battle in which the marines Had a high
not_available Tech advantage, and you're looking through it.
not_available They moved forward in pitch black using night vision
not_available Thanks though.
not_available I wasn't sure if you did or not.
not_available In my younger days I did.
not_available But, uh Right now I'm not sure it would mix so well with my meds.
not_available You could eat downstairs with us, you know? Yeah, I don't know if you've noticed, But I'm kind of trying to avoid mom right now.
not_available You might wanna take it easy on her.
not_available She's been through a lot lately.
not_available That puts her in the same boat as the rest of us, doesn't it? I really like that piece.
not_available God! Why is that like the one thing that people like? You know? So I tore up some photos, Who cares? It's like everybody wants that to be the one thing that I can do.
not_available I just think it's very provocative, and Disturbing.
not_available And beautiful.
not_available Isn't that what art is supposed to be about? Just right now, With all the shit going on in the world, Art seems kind of besides the point, you know? Yeah, I do know.
not_available Plus, I'm just not like inspired.
not_available Well, if the muse isn't with you, the muse isn't with you.
not_available Exactly, George.
not_available George! Here you are.
not_available You had me so worried.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What on earth are you doing up here? I'm
not_available I'm just, uh Hanging out.
not_available Do you need me for something? No, I just wanted to know where you were.
not_available You left your laundry in the dryer.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Is that my food? It's from the fridge.
not_available The family fridge? Yeah, so? 
not_available I'm coming down.
not_available No, don't please.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Your phone's ringing.
not_available I know.
not_available I just thought You know Maybe you were too stoned.
not_available Hello? I've never been in one of these before, have you? This is fun, huh? You know something? If I don't stop doing this, I think I'm gonna throw up.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah, just a little queasy, that's all.
not_available There's no way you could ever be an astronaut.
not_available Why not? 'Cause you can't throw up if you're gonna be an astronaut.
not_available I've never really thought about it that way, but I guess you're right.
not_available My mom's coming back to get me.
not_available She is? 
not_available As soon as she gets out of rehab.
not_available That's in six more weeks.
not_available I couldn't break through the gauntlet.
not_available This is anthony.
not_available Hi, anthony.
not_available Anthony, this is Keith.
not_available Hi.
not_available Anthony's not up for adoption.
not_available You're not? 
not_available No.
not_available My mom's coming back to get me.
not_available Good for you.
not_available The moon bounce make you hurl? 
not_available No.
not_available almost.
not_available He gets motion sickness.
not_available He could never be an astronaut.
not_available No way.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you, but your kid was picking on my kid during recess.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Tell her.
not_available He pushed me down in the bathroom And tried to take my "yuGi
not_available Oh" backpack.
not_available No, that's can't be true.
not_available He must have julio mixed up with some other kid.
not_available No, he said it was your kid.
not_available That's not true, is it, julio? Because you would never do something like that, would u? Your kid made a mistake, you see? It was him! 
not_available He just said he didn't do it.
not_available He did it, he's lying! My son doesn't lie.
not_available Julio? I didn't do it.
not_available He says he didn't do it, that's good enough for me.
not_available He did it! 
not_available So what, it was just a stupid game.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available How are you? I'm good.
not_available Yeah? I'm good too.
not_available I'm, uh, I'm back on my meds.
not_available Good.
not_available Is there some specific reason you couldn't tell me that on the phone? I just needed to see you.
not_available I could use some closure.
not_available That's all.
not_available Okay.
not_available Should we order? 
not_available I'm not really hungry.
not_available Yeah, me neither.
not_available Is that it? Have we achieved closure? Yeah, I guess.
not_available I just
not_available What? I just want you to know that I still care about you.
not_available Okay, I think I know that.
not_available Do you still care about me? Yeah, of course I still care about you, But we're broken up now.

not_available We're here.
not_available With the food.
not_available Okay, well, tomorrow then.
not_available Yeah yeah.
not_available With food? Who said anything about food? The cold cuts for during the viewing.
not_available Danny would've wanted there to be food.
not_available So we brought cold cuts.
not_available And bacon
not_available Wrapped ham balls.
not_available It's what he would've wanted.
not_available Well, of course, fine.
not_available Where do we put 'em? Downstairs in the refrigerator.
not_available Oh, but wait, you have to let me take those.
not_available I'll put them down there.
not_available I got 'em.
not_available It's okay.
not_available He doesn't even want to be adopted.
not_available Of course he's gonna say that.
not_available He's gotta protect himself from further rejection.
not_available I just thought he was special.
not_available Not retarded special.
not_available You connected with him too, you know? He has serious problems, David.
not_available You liked him, you know you did.
not_available He was kinda cute.
not_available He was, wasn't he? Yeah, in a fuckedUpWithSerious
not_available Problems kind of way.
not_available I want him.
not_available Are you serious? I think we could give him a happy childhood.
not_available We can't undo anything that's already happened to him, you know that.
not_available Yes, I know that.
not_available It's not gonna change anything That's already happened to you either.
not_available I know that too.
not_available I just think it's doable.
not_available What are you doing here? I heard julio got into some trouble at school today.
not_available Who did you hear that from? I'm on the carnival planning committee.
not_available One of the moms told me and I thought i'd stop by to see if I could help.
not_available Since when are you on the carnival committee? I don't see them every day at home.
not_available I think it's important that I be involved at school.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He picked on one of the other boys.
not_available For no reason? 
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Oh sure, it's no big deal.
not_available Just like us sleeping together is no big deal, right? Let's just pretend like it never happened.
not_available It's just boys being boys, Rico! Yeah, where is he? I wanna talk to him.
not_available It's late.
not_available He's in bed.
not_available They're both in bed.
not_available When I was a kid, when I got into trouble my old man took a belt to me.
not_available It's a good thing you're not your old man.
not_available Can I come in? 
not_available No, you cannot come in! Not tonight, Rico.
not_available I'm taking care of this.
not_available Go home.
not_available Is she asleep? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I wanna talk about what happened this morning.
not_available Okay.
not_available First of all, it made me angry that you would say that to her Without us talking about it first.
not_available You're right.
not_available I am sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But Nate, it's always better to acknowledge the truth.
not_available Yes, I am all in favor of being honest with her About where she came from and who she is.
not_available I just think that we should follow her lead on this one.
not_available When she's old enough to start asking those questions, then we'll answer them.
not_available But just because she doesn't have the language to ask the questions Doesn't mean that she isn't mentally capable of asking them.
not_available Right I just think that you're gonna confuse her.
not_available Okay, listen.
not_available One day she's gonna find out That I am not her biological mother.
not_available Now, I'm trying to avoid that moment of horrible explanation.
not_available There doesn't have to be a horrible moment of anything.
not_available Kids need to know their stories, it's how they integrate their sense of self.
not_available Kids don't need to know everything.
not_available There is such a thing as too much information.
not_available You of all people should know that.
not_available So I grew up with parents who had no boundaries.
not_available You grew up with parents that had nothing but boundaries.
not_available Do you think that was so much better? I just don't want you throwing shit at her From some book you haven't even finished reading yet! She's my daughter and i get to decide that much.
not_available It's gotten so bad I can't even stand to sit at the dinner table with him.
not_available Relationships change.
not_available They do, they do.
not_available Does he bite his fork? I had a boyfriend once who bit his fork, And it so gave me the chills.
not_available No, he doesn't bite his fork.
not_available He's not being abusive in any way, is he? No no no, he just insists on talking About everything, all the time.
not_available I can't stand the sound of his voice.
not_available It's like fingernails on a blackboard.
not_available You know, I know what this is.
not_available What? A friend of mine nursed her husband though cancer a few year ago, And when he was cured, she was done.
not_available With him? It wasn't his fault, it wasn't her fault, She was just done.
not_available You know, we were talking About going to tangier for a little somethin'.
not_available You wanna come, yeah? I can't.
not_available I have to go home and fix dinner for George.
not_available Oh, Ruth! You need to do things For yourself every now and then.
not_available It's important
not_available Care of the self.
not_available It is.
not_available It is.
not_available Okay.
not_available I had a dream about anthony last night.
not_available See, I knew he got to you.
not_available He kept putting blankets on top of me.
not_available Each one weighed like a ton.
not_available My ribs felt like they were gonna break and I couldn't breathe.
not_available Well, at least he made an impression.
not_available Hello.
not_available Guess who's pregnant! You are? That's right, I'm having your guys's baby! 
not_available Mary's pregnant.
not_available She is? At first I thought I was just late, But now I'm really late, plus i've been craving carne asada.
not_available And you know what that means! Well, maybe you don't, but I do.
not_available Should I tell her we're happy? 
not_available I guess so.
not_available I mean yeah.
not_available David and I are both very excited.
not_available Me too, I mean, at the very least this means I can start having sex with my husband again.
not_available He will be so fucking happy.
not_available Yay! Listen, I gotta go.
not_available I got diarrhea like you would not believe.
not_available Which by the way, is also A very positive sign.
not_available But i'll call you guys later, okay? Okay.
not_available Hey, mary? We're gonna be dads! What about anthony? Well, somebody else will find him.
not_available Look, except for taylor, We really don't have much experience with kids.
not_available And I think taking on more than one right now Would be, uh
not_available Would be crazy.
not_available Do you disagree? No, I don't.
not_available Hello? Claire? Hi, it's Margaret, Margaret Chenowith.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Listen, I hate to call you like this, But there's a serious problem with Billy.
not_available Is he okay? Well, perhaps it would be better if we spoke in person.
not_available Oh okay.
not_available I just want to apologize to the both of you For my son's behavior.
not_available Your wife wasn't very apologetic.
not_available Then I apologize for her behavior as well.
not_available You see, my wife and I are separated, so as you can imagine 
not_available This has been a difficult time for julio.
not_available Of course.
not_available And my wife has been on antidepressants.
not_available So she's been a little lax on doling out discipline.
not_available Plus she was dating this guy who back in high school was a total pothead.
not_available And for all I know, still is.
not_available I just think all the stuff at home has contributed to julio acting out
not_available With your son.
not_available And I've already talked to julio and he would like to apologize to your son.
not_available Tomorrow morning, before school, if that's okay.
not_available Yeah yeah.
not_available Uh, that would be lovely.
not_available Well, I wish we had more fathers like you in this school.
not_available Yeah well, I'm a funeral director.
not_available And perhaps that's why I'm a little better at dealing with people than my wifeWell, my almostEx
not_available Wife.
not_available So
not_available Do you think that It's our impending divorce that's causing julio to You know, misbehave? I suppose it's possible.
not_available Thank you for being honest with me.
not_available You know There's some other things that have been going on as well.
not_available Frankie yankovic was his favorite.
not_available Frankie yankovic was not his favorite.
not_available He was his favorite.
not_available He had all his records.
not_available All of them! Herbie hancock was his favorite.
not_available He wanted herbie hancock played at his funeral.
not_available He told me that, years ago.
not_available Okay, look Maybe he had two favorites.
not_available You ever think of that? Who the hell has two favorites? I have two favorites.
not_available In fact, I have at least three favorite songs.
not_available And my daughter
not_available You know what her favorite color is? Blue and green.
not_available So here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna play frankie yankovic And herbie hancock.
not_available How's that? You said this was some kind of emergency.
not_available I've never said emergency.
not_available Yeah, but you definitely kind of implied it.
not_available Billy has harmed himself in the past.
not_available He could do it again, you know? Okay, that's not my problem.
not_available Billy told me everything, Claire.
not_available And believe me, I understandGiven the family you come from
not_available Why you ended it.
not_available My family doesn't have anything to do with it.
not_available You know Billy also told me that the sex was erratic.
not_available Now that was his fault.
not_available And by the way, he's on a new medication with fewer side effects.
not_available But he did say that when he was able to, And when he was up for it, the sex was very good.
not_available For Billy, that's really saying something.
not_available He told you about our sex? Of course he did.
not_available I'm his mother! You know, when you were with him, There was this light behind his eyes.
not_available I haven't seen that in him since he was I don't know, four? You were really good for him, Claire.
not_available He's better off without me.
not_available And even if he isn't, i am better off without him.
not_available What do you need from him to make this work? 
not_available This isn't a negotiation.
not_available Everything is negotiable.
not_available I have a son who tried to kill himself in the past.
not_available Now he still really loves you.
not_available And I think you still love him.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's my girl doing, huh? 
not_available Good.
not_available Are you good, yeah? You helping mommy make some dinner? All right.
not_available Is everything okay? Do you need help with anything? Yeah, you cannot act like an a
not_available Hole tonight at dinner.
not_available Now why would I act like an aHole at dinner tonight? Because you were an a
not_available Hole last night.
not_available She's not just your daughter anymore.
not_available Do you know how offensive that was? Can we put a pin in this, please? Is that okay with you? Okay, fine! 
not_available Hello? Hi.

not_available Honey, you be sure and call me later, okay? 
not_available Let me know how it goes.
not_available Okay, mom.
not_available I'll take this.
not_available You planned this? II
not_available I just Wasn't completely sure if i made myself clear yesterday.
not_available If there is ever a moment Anytime in the future, Whether it's in a hour Or a month or a year, When you change your mind About you know, Us, I want you to know that I would be open to that.
not_available You used your mother to ambush me? It wasn't an ambush exactly.
not_available I am so out of here.
not_available Look, I know, I know! I just didn't want you Out there in the world Not knowing how I feel.
not_available Okay, I get it.
not_available I know how you feel, But that is never going to happen.
not_available You know beyond any doubt That you're never going to feel that way about me again? Pretty much, yeah.

not_available You told him about our situation at home? I didn't go into details, no.
not_available But he's the principal at our son's school.
not_available And he was looking for some sort of explanation for julio's behavior.
not_available He was very concerned.
not_available He is? He said our divorce is causing julio to lash out, And frankly, he's surprised that it hasn't caused him More problems than it already has.
not_available He did? He was very sympathetic.
not_available It's been hard for me, Rico.
not_available The boys are getting older, I'm doing this alone.
not_available But I didn't realize there was that much of a problem.
not_available It's okay.

not_available So if he's more or less all better, why can't you leave him? I can't do that.
not_available The way he looks at me, I just see the little boy in him, you know? That's always been my problem with men.
not_available It doesn't matter if they're 10 or 80.
not_available I see them standing there Like children in short pants.
not_available Just skinny little boys, lost.
not_available Why do I always pick men with such skinny legs? I'm a horrible train wreck of a person.
not_available Oh, you are not a horrible train wreck! 
not_available I am.
not_available You're not, you're human.
not_available And there's a limit to how much you can take! But I made a vow to this man! 
not_available Oh god, she feels everything so deeply.
not_available Ruth, Marriage, especially to someone who is making you miserable, Does not have to mean till death do you part.

not_available Law, what was his name? Hoyt.
not_available Did they ever determine for certain if he was involved in Lisa's death? Dad
