
not_available Fuck, we're bleeding.
not_available Great.
not_available Now I got brain coming out of the wound.
not_available Raise his head and give him 100 grams of Mannitol.
not_available Let's put him in burst suppression.
not_available What's his blood pressure? 
not_available 117 over 72.
not_available Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion? Body temperature's 34.5 
not_available 117 over 72.
not_available Are we maintaining cerebral perfusion? Body's temperature's 34.5.
not_available We've loaded him with Dilantin and Decadron.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Julie, I need two Fraziers and some aneurysm clips.
not_available We've got to stop all this bleeding.
not_available I'll need Gelfoam and cottonoids.
not_available We got to stop this bleeding.
not_available This aneurysm.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Gelfoam and cottonoids.
not_available The CT scanners will come in after surgery.
not_available If we make it that far.
not_available If we make it that far.
not_available That shit smells awful.
not_available Fenugreek.
not_available Fenugreek? What the fuck is fenugreek? Try some.
not_available It's delicious.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available You put a little maple syrup on it.
not_available Can you hurry up? I don't want to be late for my funeral.
not_available Relax.
not_available We got plenty of time.
not_available You've got nothing but time.
not_available Which doesn't exist anyway, so You don't know what you're missing.
not_available Damn it, David.
not_available I told you I wanted to be cremated.
not_available You can do this.
not_available Cat.
not_available Tac.
not_available No, reverse it.
not_available Cat.
not_available Cap.
not_available Almost.
not_available Cat.
not_available Let's try another one.
not_available Duck.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Close.
not_available Goat.
not_available Go Let's take a break.
not_available Go She's definitely got your nose.
not_available And your eyes.
not_available Look at that face.
not_available Look at this little person we created.
not_available I love it when she does that.
not_available When she sort of jerks right before she falls off to sleep.
not_available Wakes herself up.
not_available You freaked out the first time she ever did it.
not_available I remember that feeling of falling when I was little.
not_available Like I was falling out of bed.
not_available It always woke me up.
not_available Like I was scared of what I was going to fall into.
not_available That never happens to me any more.
not_available God.
not_available We lose so much, you know? Oh, great! 
not_available Great.
not_available He's got the hiccups again.
not_available So shake him and scream in his face.
not_available The world is a hostile, terrifying place.
not_available He needs to learn that.
not_available If your mom says what a gassy baby you were and how he gets it from you, I'll scream.
not_available And I'll start farting.
not_available Thank God we got high before we came.
not_available Call me crazy, buddy boy, but I don't think it makes a damned difference who won.
not_available They're all crooks.
not_available How can you not care? That bullshit acceptance speech! 
not_available Language.
not_available "I was not elected to serve one party.
not_available " 
not_available The operative words being "not elected".
not_available Want the end piece? 
not_available I don't eat red meat.
not_available I made you chicken.
not_available Nate, if you didn't want Bush in the White House, why did you vote for Nader? Sorry I'm late.
not_available The traffic was, like, severely ridiculous.
not_available Ruth.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Claire.
not_available You don't look well.
not_available I may be coming down with a cold.
not_available Let me feel your head.
not_available The end piece? 
not_available It's OK.
not_available People get colds.
not_available Anybody want the end piece? Nate? 
not_available Sure, I'll take it.
not_available Everyone save some room for dessert.
not_available Mother, are you trying to sabotage my diet? Of course not, Tricia.
not_available I support your commitment to hating yourself for not having the ass of a tenyear
not_available old boy.
not_available Why do you have to be so crude? Because God is punishing you through me.
not_available Fisher Funeral Chapel.
not_available Nate Fisher speaking.
not_available I'm so terribly sorry.
not_available Yes, we are open today.
not_available Any time before eleven.
not_available I wish we could make it through Christmas dinner without somebody dying.
not_available We'll be waiting for you.
not_available Heart attack.
not_available Thank God for small favours.
not_available Ah, shit.
not_available I've seen this one before.
not_available That was Dr Schr√∂dinger.
not_available Kitty didn't make it.
not_available What are we watching this for? Cos it's what's on.
not_available Quit flapping your trap.
not_available I like this show.
not_available So, the universe is split in two.
not_available Two? Try two billion.
not_available What's gonna happen to us? There, there.
not_available We always end up in a universe in which we exist.
not_available Remember Copenhagen? Oh, yes.
not_available The Eigenvalues in bloom.
not_available You just keep telling yourself, everything that can happen does.
not_available Somewhere.
not_available Shit.
not_available I seen this one before.
not_available Tell me what's going on.
not_available I need you to answer some questions.
not_available Do you believe your consciousness affects the behaviour of subatomic particles? Am I alive or am I dead? Do you believe that particles appear in all possible places at once? And if I am dead, is this heaven or hell? Do you believe the universe is splitting into billions of parallel universes? What the fuck do I care? 
not_available You only get one choice.
not_available Think about this.
not_available Just tell me.
not_available Am I dead? Yes or no? Yes.
not_available And no.
not_available Some places you're dead, some you're alive.
not_available Some places you never existed.
not_available Possibly.
not_available Theoretically.
not_available Or who knows? This could just be the anaesthesia talking.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Open the box.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available No, I never actually flatlined.
not_available I just woke up.
not_available Later they told me the AVM ruptured in surgery.
not_available What does that mean, ruptured? Well, just, you know, exploded.
not_available My head actually exploded.
not_available I should have died or had brain damage but I pulled through and seven months later, nothing even shows up on an MRl.
not_available Wow.
not_available You're really lucky.
not_available So fucking lucky.
not_available So fucking lucky.
not_available Right? 
not_available Oh, that is so beautiful.
not_available His doesn't have the inlay.
not_available Where did you get this? My boss, Carol, had to have a lot of jewellery made for this King Arthur cable movie.
not_available She turned us on to the guy who did it.
not_available I still can't believe how fast you two got married.
not_available It wasn't that fast.
not_available We've actually been together eight years.
not_available You know, on and off.
not_available Between here and Seattle.
not_available Well, you look really happy.
not_available I am really happy.
not_available Good.
not_available My sisterin
not_available law's an astrologist.
not_available And a drunk.
not_available And she was telling me about this weird thing her profession is facing.
not_available When did astrology become a profession? You know, with the whole possibility of interplanetary travel.
not_available This pasta salad is so good.
not_available I want to spend a weekend alone with it.
not_available That makes me feel weird.
not_available Say in your chart, Mars is in Scorpio.
not_available Well, what about when people are born on Mars? Their Mars isn't in anything but their earth, it's in Virgo.
not_available Honey, no one's listening.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm boring myself.
not_available Oh, I made some pasta salad without tuna in it for you.
not_available No, I'm nursing.
not_available I need the protein.
not_available Spencer! Put the kitty down.
not_available So the breastfeeding thing is better now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm taking fenugreek.
not_available Fenugreek.
not_available Oh, I've heard of that.
not_available How? 
not_available It's amazing.
not_available Nursing was so painful for me at first.
not_available My milk production would never catch up with her demand.
not_available Put the kitty down! But now there's always enough.
not_available The only drawback is my sweat smells a little like maple syrup.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Breasts are actually modified sweat glands.
not_available And I hardly ever sweat.
not_available Which is maybe why it was so painful for me at first.
not_available I wish I got more of those elliptical ones.
not_available They're better for your knees.
not_available But I'm sure I wouldn't be using that one either.
not_available Todd, thanks for having us.
not_available Taking off so soon? 
not_available I got to work tonight.
not_available Want a hit for the road? 
not_available I'd better not.
not_available All right.
not_available I think I know somebody who wants to buy a motorcycle.
not_available Somebody already bought it.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks again.
not_available I'll see you next time.
not_available All right.
not_available Later.
not_available It was fun.
not_available Yeah, I like them.
not_available She's nice.
not_available He's a little weird.
not_available The food was good.
not_available Nate, we totally grabbed the wrong bag.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available All right.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Keys.
not_available I feel judged.
not_available I feel criticised.
not_available I feel like nothing I do is good enough.
not_available I feel ashamed of who I am, like I'll never be the person you want me to be.
not_available I don't want you to be anyone except you.
not_available Keith, now is about you listening.
not_available You'll get your chance in a moment.
not_available Yeah, OK.
not_available I feel like I'm living in a minefield.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Your anger is so random and arbitrary.
not_available Let's try to avoid making judgments about Keith's behaviour right now and really stay focused on what you feel.
not_available I'm afraid of pissing you off, so I'm constantly editing myself.
not_available I guess I'm confused.
not_available I don't even know who I am any more.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Now, Keith.
not_available What did you hear? A lot of whining.
not_available Perhaps you have some feelings of your own you'd like to share? Yeah.
not_available I hate my job.
not_available I feel like a fucking loser driving around in a Home Alert uniform answering alarms set off by poodles and sucking up to rich assholes who make more in a day than I make in a year.
not_available I ought to be able to blow off steam when I come home without you taking it personally because it's very rarely about you.
not_available David? 
not_available I don't think that's fair.
not_available You don't want me to have any feelings.
not_available No, I'd just like to have fun now and then like we used to.
not_available We don't have fun? 
not_available Rarely.
not_available Rarely? On occasion.
not_available How's your sex life? It's kind of great.
not_available Yeah, that part works.
not_available So it seems engaging passionately is comfortable in that arena but not so in other areas.
not_available What other things do the two of you like to do together? We go to movies sometimes.
not_available We go to dinner.
not_available We used to play racket ball.
not_available He was so much better than me it was a joke.
not_available I wasn't challenging enough.
not_available I never said that.
not_available It made me feel inadequate.
not_available What kinds of things do you do on your own? 
not_available Besides work, work out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My job kind of keeps me from doing much else.
not_available Friends? Most of my friends are cops.
not_available But I don't see 'em any more since I left the force.
not_available David never really had any close friends.
not_available That's not true.
not_available There's a group of independent funeral directors I get together with every month.
not_available You hate those guys.
not_available We're out of time.
not_available This week, should any conflicts arise, try to focus on expressing what you're feeling instead of criticising and blaming, OK? Change.
not_available Good, Russell.
not_available Change.
not_available Fuck, it's almost five.
not_available Rico's gonna have my head.
not_available Mom.
not_available Hello.
not_available How is my precious girl doing today? She has the hiccups again.
not_available She gets that from her daddy.
not_available He was a very gassy baby.
not_available Yes, he was.
not_available I'll get her some gripe water.
not_available Do you burp her often when she's nursing? 
not_available Of course.
not_available What's wrong with you? Uh, I don't know.
not_available I think I just had the weirdest deja vu.
not_available Hello! Every time I pop by, there are more people here.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Carol Ward, Lisa's boss.
not_available I'm Ruth Fisher, Nate's mother.
not_available We've met several times.
not_available You're not living here now too, are you? I'm kidding.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I hate to keep harping on this.
not_available I parked in the driveway again.
not_available There are two cars today.
not_available Sorry, I didn't know.
not_available Oh, please, it's no biggie.
not_available I'm sure you didn't know.
not_available What's your excuse? 
not_available I was just dropping off I could get a sign made.
not_available "Nate, back it up.
not_available Put it on the street.
not_available " 
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available If you want, I'll move it right now.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available Whenever.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Sooner rather than later.
not_available Lisa, I'm having dinner with Penny Marshall tonight so I want you to cook.
not_available OK.
not_available But I'm hosting an impromptu gathering tomorrow.
not_available I'm trying a new pitch on friends.
not_available Shouldn't be more than 
not_available OK.
not_available You have time to go over a menu with me? Now? Yes! 
not_available Take your time, dear.
not_available I've got all afternoon.
not_available Nice to meet you, Nate's mother! She's energetic.
not_available She's a lunatic.
not_available Hey, Rico.
not_available Nate, hey.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Good.
not_available Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.
not_available Listen, I don't know if you're aware of this, or if you even care, but we have two viewings tonight.
not_available 6..
not_available 30, and one at eight.
not_available Yeah, I'm on my way.
not_available Good.
not_available Because your brother is nowhere to be found.
not_available And he's not answering his cellphone.
not_available And there's only so much I can do.
not_available Sure.
not_available I can't be in two places at the same time.
not_available I get it, Rico, OK? Lay off the lecturing.
not_available I'm not your kid.
not_available I'm not your employee, I'm your partner.
not_available I am a licensed funeral director now.
not_available OK? You guys took my money, you made me a partner, it's time you treated me like one.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available So, Claire, how's art school? It's OK.
not_available What kind of stuff are you doing? Well, yesterday, we had to draw this naked guy in, like, 30 seconds.
not_available Well, that sounds fun.
not_available Not really.
not_available It's hard.
not_available And, like, I don't even wanna be an illustrator or painter or whatever.
not_available But they say we need to know how to do everything, like Picasso.
not_available It's intense.
not_available But you get to be creative every day.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Hello, pumpkin.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available It could not be going any better.
not_available Would you look at this little girl? Is that the face of God or what? There's stuff coming out of God's nose.
not_available Who's precious, is it you? Yes, it is.
not_available Can you help with her today? Lisa's got to help Carol.
not_available Carol's having this big Hollywood ass
not_available lick dinner.
not_available Of course.
not_available You guys, she took the most amazing poop this morning.
not_available Who, Lisa? Seriously.
not_available It was just so perfectly formed, so healthy and compact.
not_available It was like an adult poop.
not_available It made me so happy.
not_available When you live with a baby you see the world as being totally new all over again.
not_available They're just so pure and uncorrupted.
not_available It's a fucking privilege.
not_available How come neither of you's been over to visit recently? Because being a father has turned you into a dithering idiot.
not_available Wow.
not_available You're so tough and cool and above it all.
not_available I wish I was you.
not_available Does anybody want the end piece? Oh, Nate.
not_available Can you drop Mrs Folger at the crematory this afternoon? No.
not_available I've got the Polp funeral.
not_available Yeah, well, I've got the Bennett funeral.
not_available Can't Rico do it? His exact words were, "No fucking way, I'm not your fucking gofer any more.
not_available " Claire, can you give us a hand? Sorry, I have homework.
not_available Pay you 50 bucks.
not_available You'd pay a delivery service more than that.
not_available All right.
not_available As long as I don't have to touch dead skin.
not_available She's all boxed up.
not_available I can't do it till around four, cos I have to practise drawing a perfect circle.
not_available That takes seven hours? I have to be able to do it on command in class tomorrow.
not_available It's not as easy as it sounds.
not_available Is that the box that needs to go to the crematory? The? Yeah.
not_available Well, I can take it now.
not_available You're taking it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They hired me to do runs since nobody else wants to do it.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah, for 50 bucks a shot.
not_available But you're gonna need to help me get that into my car.
not_available So what kind of music do you guys play? It's kind of like early Peter Gabriel meets Tool.
not_available Emotionally vulnerable like Sunny Day Real Estate but politically conscious, like Public Enemy.
not_available We're still working on it.
not_available When you guys play, let me know.
not_available I'll come.
not_available Why don't you hang out, while we practise? I don't think I can.
not_available I've got this thing, I'm supposed to OK.
not_available I'm Phil.
not_available I'm Claire.
not_available You want a beer? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You really amaze me, Lisa.
not_available Why? 
not_available Your energy.
not_available It's boundless.
not_available You should be bottled as an alternative energy source.
not_available You'd save the world.
not_available Well, that's kind of funny because I feel tired all the time.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think it comes with being a mom.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not that I'm complaining.
not_available I mean, Maya's totally transformed my life.
not_available I can't even imagine going back to the way things were before.
not_available Wow.
not_available So what if I have to work extra hard? I want to.
not_available It's worth it.
not_available It is so worth it.
not_available Carol? Don't pay any attention to me.
not_available I'm just nervous.
not_available Nervous about this meeting next week.
not_available I have to pitch to McG in person.
not_available Whoa, is he intimidating.
not_available Can I make you some camomile tea? For Christ's sake, I'm not your grandmother.
not_available I'm your boss.
not_available Stop looking at me, Lisa.
not_available Carol, I'm always here for you.
not_available Also, I swim laps in the morning.
not_available I used to be able to do that naked.
not_available Which was a great way to start the day.
not_available Like I was Artemis.
not_available I went out feeling like a warrior, a huntress, which is what you have to do in my business.
not_available Now I can't do that any more because there's a man here.
not_available I'm sure Nate wouldn't mind.
not_available I would.
not_available I don't appreciate the hostility he shows by parking in the driveway.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I will talk to him about it.
not_available I'm going to swim some laps.
not_available Are you ready for the pakchoi? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Adding pepper.
not_available I already added pepper.
not_available OK, I feel shamed.
not_available What? 
not_available When you said, "I already added pepper.
not_available " My perception was that you were irritated with me for not knowing that and that you were angry with me, that I shouldn't have done it.
not_available Why would I be angry with you? Maybe you don't want me to be involved in the cooking process.
not_available Maybe you just want me to prepare the ingredients, maybe you want total control over what happens in the wok.
not_available So we have a little extra pepper in the wok 
not_available it's not a big deal.
not_available I know it's not a big deal.
not_available OK.
not_available I heard what you said.
not_available It was not my intention to shame you.
not_available I know.
not_available Good.
not_available I love you.
not_available Are the carrots ready? I grew up in a family where people express their anger on a regular basis.
not_available So that's what intimacy feels like to me.
not_available You grew up in a family where no one expressed anything.
not_available We also never hit each other.
not_available So whenever I'm slightly irritated, it scares you? Right.
not_available It just means I'm comfortable with you.
not_available It doesn't mean I don't love you.
not_available Did you pick up the dry
not_available cleaning today? Yeah, it's in the closet.
not_available There.
not_available Isn't that delicious? Your daddy used to love peanut butter too.
not_available Yes, he did.
not_available So did your uncle David.
not_available Not your aunt Claire.
not_available She absolutely hated it, always did.
not_available Still does.
not_available Isn't it funny? They were all little babies once too.
not_available But their daddy's mommy never liked spending time with them the way I like spending time with you.
not_available She never really liked me, and she never liked my children.
not_available She was convinced I'd gotten pregnant on purpose to trap Nathaniel into marrying me.
not_available Which wasn't true at all.
not_available I certainly never intended for that to happen.
not_available Especially when I was so young.
not_available I was terrified when your daddy was born.
not_available Absolutely terrified.
not_available Hey, Mom.
not_available Goodness, you startled me.
not_available She give you any trouble? Heavens, no.
not_available She's an angel.
not_available Are you ready to go home, angel? I made you a chicken breast.
not_available No, thanks, I got to be getting home.
not_available But put it in the fridge.
not_available I'll eat it tomorrow.
not_available If you and Lisa want a night off, I'd be happy to watch her.
not_available You could go out to eat, see a movie.
not_available I could keep her here overnight.
not_available Thanks, but Lisa's working tonight and Maya hasn't slept outside the family bed yet.
not_available Well, maybe it might be better for her to try a night sleeping on her own.
not_available Mom, we know how you feel about it.
not_available You're very clear on that.
not_available We feel differently.
not_available She's almost nine months old.
not_available She's going to have to leave the family bed sometime.
not_available Maya will let us know when she's ready to leave, all right? Good night.
not_available Good night, Grandma.
not_available Good night.
not_available Are we having sex? OK.
not_available Just let me take a shower first.
not_available Morning.
not_available What time is it? A little before ten, I think.
not_available How do you take it? Black.
not_available So what do you have to do today? Class.
not_available What kind of class? 
not_available Drawing class.
not_available We're learning how to draw a perfect circle.
not_available That sounds cool.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's stupid and tedious.
not_available And pointless.
not_available I went to art school to be expressive, not to perform some pointless task like a lab rat.
not_available You want to play hooky? Yes.
not_available Nate, I need you to do me a big favour and cover the Folger funeral today.
not_available Who's Frank Muehler? 
not_available Frank who? Muehler.
not_available He's in the date book every Wednesday at two.
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Must be somebody Rico put in there.
not_available There's a phone number.
not_available I'm gonna call and find out.
not_available All right, no.
not_available Keith and I are in couples counselling.
not_available Really? 
not_available It's not that big a deal.
not_available Are you guys OK? 
not_available Of course we're OK.
not_available We're just seeking the advice of a professional to help us to establish boundaries and write the rules of our relationship together.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Nothing happened.
not_available Keith has anger issues he inherited from his father and I have a lot of doormat issues I inherited from Mom.
not_available Can we never talk about this again? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You're OK though? Can we never talk about this again? 
not_available Got it.
not_available And how are you and Lisa? We're great.
not_available It's still a little bizarre to me.
not_available All the possible ways my life could have gone.
not_available I mean, it's just about a year ago I got engaged.
not_available You remember that? I thought I loved Brenda.
not_available Maybe I thought I could make it work just out of sheer will.
not_available But you just never know.
not_available You have no fucking idea what life has in store for you.
not_available So can you cover the Folger funeral for me or not? Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine.
not_available I've got an audition for the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles.
not_available What? 
not_available That sounds fun.
not_available I'm trying to create something for myself outside of my job and my relationship.
not_available I could use your support.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available The Folger thing's a walk in the park.
not_available You just knock 'em dead.
not_available No pun intended.
not_available I'm so nervous.
not_available David, you'll be great.
not_available From your mouth to God's ears.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks, Nate.
not_available Any time.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi, it's Lisa.
not_available Hello.
not_available Ruth, did you give Maya peanut butter? Yes, and she loved it.
not_available Nate You never give babies peanut butter under the age of one.
not_available They can develop horrible allergies.
not_available Didn't you know that? No, I didn't.
not_available Is she all right? Yes, but that's not the point.
not_available You should never give her peanut butter.
not_available Or honey, or strawberries, or egg whites.
not_available Please.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'm sorry to be so abrupt with you.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available Peanut butter was never a problem when my children were young.
not_available Are you sure she's all right? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Do you need any help with her today? I could come over.
not_available Ruth, no.
not_available You spend so much time over here.
not_available I feel bad.
not_available It's no problem, I like 
not_available Seriously, take some time to yourself.
not_available I hardly saw Maya at all yesterday.
not_available I really just wanted it to be the two of us today.
not_available OK.
not_available But thanks.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Thank God.
not_available It's very frightening.
not_available I didn't know who to call.
not_available Ma'am, calm down and tell me what happened.
not_available Come.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available It's weird when you find stuff like that out later in life.
not_available I mean, I had no idea that I wasn't planned.
not_available I'm not sure what difference it makes.
not_available I mean, Maya wasn't planned and we couldn't love her any more.
not_available It's just I don't know.
not_available What? I don't like knowing that my whole existence is an accident.
not_available It's just too fucking random.
not_available Yeah, but that's the way it happened.
not_available Things happen the way they're meant to, Nate.
not_available See, that's a kind of fatalism that I just don't buy.
not_available Well, what's the alternative? We make choices.
not_available But maybe your parents never would have chosen to get married if you hadn't happened.
not_available And then not only would you not exist, but Claire and David wouldn't either.
not_available It's just not what was meant to happen.
not_available But surely we're more than just things that happen? Maybe we are, maybe we're not.
not_available I love it when she does that.
not_available When she sort of jerks.
not_available Right before she falls off to sleep.
not_available Wakes herself up.
not_available You freaked out the first time she ever did it.
not_available I remember that feeling of falling when I was little.
not_available Like I was falling out of bed.
not_available It always woke me up.
not_available Like I was scared of what 
not_available You were going to fall into? Yeah.
not_available It never happens to me any more.
not_available Don't be so sure of that.
not_available What's going on with you? 
not_available I think I dreamed this.
not_available What? This moment.
not_available Just this.
not_available This life we have together.
not_available You and me, Maya.
not_available Here.
not_available Now.
