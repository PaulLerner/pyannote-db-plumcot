
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Hi, no one's here right now.
not_available Please leave a message and we'll get back to you.
not_available Hey, hon.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available We've been circling L.A.X.
not_available for about an hour and a half.
not_available I'm so sorry I asked you to stay up.
not_available So, I'll be home I don't know probably about Okay, see you soon.
not_available Bye.
not_available What are you doing? I can't go to work like this, the bereaved will freak out.
not_available David, you can take a little more time off.
not_available Four days of daytime TV is my personal limit.
not_available If I see another triumph over weight loss, I think I'll kill myself.
not_available We can go out to the beach I can't, Rico's totally overwhelmed.
not_available He had to deal with the whole Thornton family nightmare.
not_available The what? 
not_available The family of the body I lost.
not_available You didn't lose it.
not_available Well, horribly misplaced then.
not_available For several days in the wasteland of Echo Park.
not_available I just talked to Mitchell.
not_available He said the prints they got off the van didn't bring up a match.
not_available What does that mean? He doesn't have a record? I guess not.
not_available But there might have been a camera at the ATM, so they're looking into that Keith, I think I'd like to not talk about this anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available I appreciate that you want to help, I really do, but it's enough that you came home for a few days.
not_available You don't have to solve the case.
not_available Maybe we should call off your birthday party for tomorrow night.
not_available My mother's been planning for weeks.
not_available So? Your family has to understand I don't want make a big deal out of this.
not_available Pretending it was a robbery is just bullshit! I just don't want to upset everyone.
not_available You should tell your family.
not_available Would you tell yours? Look, I just want everything to go on as planned.
not_available Okay.
not_available So I got Cassidy for tomorrow night.
not_available What's tomorrow night? David's birthday dinner.
not_available Or did they cancel it? Oh shit! I completely forgot.
not_available Fuck.
not_available With everything 
not_available It's okay, I got Cassidy.
not_available Julio's not in love with her, but at least she doesn't smoke.
not_available Unless you think it doesn't matter if I go.
not_available Well, you don't have to go if you don't really want to.
not_available Not if you want me to go.
not_available Maybe for David, you know.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Yeah, and it'll be nice for us to do things together.
not_available Oh yeah, it's a real romantic evening, dinner at the Fishers.
not_available Come on, Julio, let's go! What's goin' on? What's happenin' with you? Look at Garbo.
not_available She usually hates men.
not_available So, food co
not_available op, funeral home.
not_available Nothing with animals at all? Yeah.
not_available Uh, no.
not_available But they're all related in a way, you know? No.
not_available Well, people in grief, you know, they're a lot like dogs in the sense that you just have to be with them in a totally instinctive way.
not_available I never hired anyone with no dog experience.
not_available How many you got at home? I had one when I was a kid.
not_available It was a terrier, but he died suddenly and my Mom got so upset that she never let us get another one.
not_available Hey, look, I learn fast.
not_available Why don't you just give me a trial run? What do you say? The thing is, hon, this job doesn't pay much.
not_available Well, I don't need much.
not_available I just can't stand to be around people in pain anymore.
not_available You know? And every time I walked by this place, it just always looked like life.
not_available Oh, here's Maile.
not_available Thistle.
not_available Hey, Thistle.
not_available Hey, speak, speak.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Good boy.
not_available What? Just the slow murder of the middle class.
not_available Oh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Are you sure you don't want some tuna salad, dear? Mom, I just woke up.
not_available The Japanese eat fish for breakfast every day.
not_available Great.
not_available So what's the dress code for this evening? Well, you know, academic cocktail attire.
not_available I don't know, dear.
not_available That's why I'm asking.
not_available Well, I'm going straight from the office and I'm wearing this.
not_available With which jacket? My brown blazer.
not_available But no tie? 
not_available That's right.
not_available This with a blazer.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Oh good, there's coffee.
not_available Is this fresh? Yeah, I just made it.
not_available How are you? I'm fine, how are you? I'm okay.
not_available Are you feeling tired, dear? 
not_available I'm fine, Mom.
not_available Would you like some lunch? No, thank you, I had a late breakfast.
not_available Your bruises look much better.
not_available Yes, because I'm fine.
not_available Have they found the carjacker? Since yesterday? No, Mom, I'll let you know if they do, okay? David, I was just wondering, if this person had a gun, you didn't try to argue with him, did you? No, Mom, I didn't try to argue.
not_available Well, if all he wanted was the van, and you let him have it, why would he hurt you? I don't know, it all happened very fast.
not_available I told you.
not_available I just don't understand why, with so many fancy cars in this city, someone would want to take that stinky old van.
not_available Are you trying to find a way to make this my fault? No, oh, I am so sorry.
not_available It's just none of it makes any sense.
not_available I'm sorry, sometimes bad things just happen, and it doesn't make sense.
not_available But at least, you know, I'm okay and it's over now, all right? How's the scoring session? Brutal.
not_available It's a medieval fantasy epic, so I had to blast out this inane heroic theme music every time the good prince walked in.
not_available Five billion times.
not_available Here.
not_available # It may feel so real inside # 
not_available Thank you.
not_available # But don't forget it's just a ride # # Truth we don't want to hear # # It's too much to take # I found us a house.
not_available A house? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I walked by this place on my way back from lunch.
not_available I was gonna call you, but the guy had to go, so I made an appointment to look at it tomorrow afternoon.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's extremely perfect.
not_available I think.
not_available And big.
not_available And it's affordable.
not_available Kind of.
not_available I think.
not_available And this would be for, like, now? Yeah, first of the month.
not_available Wow.
not_available We're going to need a place to put the kid, right? 
not_available If there is one.
not_available I'm not going to want to walk across the courtyard every time I have to change a diaper.
not_available # It's just a ride, it's just a ride # # Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes # # It may feel so real inside # Are you ready for all this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you? # Oh, so very slowly # 
not_available Yeah.
not_available # Except that # # There's no getting off # # So live it # You don't think we're just talking out of our eggs, do you? I'm not talking out of my eggs.
not_available I'm talking out of my basket.
not_available Did you want us to include the cause of death in the obituary? No, thank you.
not_available Just say he passed away suddenly, please.
not_available And did you want us to contact a clergy person for the service? We already went over this.
not_available We did? 
not_available We're atheists.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available And if I wasn't before, I sure as hell would be now.
not_available Of course.
not_available I polished his shoes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, what happened to this guy? She didn't want to say, so it must have been a suicide.
not_available Do you have his certificate? I can't find it.
not_available I'm sure it's in the office.
not_available Man, he must've been pretty desperate.
not_available What an awful thing to do to your wife.
not_available Hey, I've got to make a quick phone call.
not_available Could you sew him up for me? I'm gonna just go out here.
not_available It's better reception.
not_available Hi, please leave a message.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Um, listen, I can't do dinner tomorrow night.
not_available I have to work.
not_available But I'll call you later and we'll figure something out.
not_available Okay, bye
not_available bye.
not_available Do you need some hangers? My Mom's got like No, that's okay.
not_available I don't have anything nice enough to hang, and it should only be for a few days, hopefully.
not_available Hot dress.
not_available I'm so glad we're the same size.
not_available I can't believe that cunt changed the locks on me.
not_available I guess she really didn't want you playing with her turtles.
not_available This is the last one.
not_available Thanks.
not_available These are great.
not_available Totally apocalyptic.
not_available Yeah, they're better than my stupid self
not_available portraits, but I still feel like they're I don't know pointless? All these real horrible things happen in the world every day that have so much more impact than art does.
not_available Like my brother getting beaten up by some random asshole.
not_available It's horrible.
not_available But even some old lady spits at you, and it seriously affects your outlook on things.
not_available Did an old lady spit at you? No.
not_available I mean, yes, actually, but it doesn't matter.
not_available But that's what's so great about what you do or like Aleksandra Mir's work, is that it happens to people.
not_available It's not just some image hanging on a wall doing nothing.
not_available I think these images are doing something.
not_available Is this all because Carolyn reamed you out for being vacant? No, it's because I want to make work that does something.
not_available We should make something together.
not_available Like what? Like some kind of mixed media thing in some space that people kind of have to be in.
not_available Like an elevator? 
not_available Bigger.
not_available Like a mall or something, and we'd invite artists who make totally different kinds of work and we'd be doing our things while people wandered around.
not_available To make it unavoidable.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I totally love that.
not_available Hey, Rich.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available George, hello! Ruth, this is the famous Dean Kekalos.
not_available Howard, this is my wife.
not_available The famous Ruth Sibley, hello.
not_available It's a pleasure.
not_available No, the pleasure is mine.
not_available We're all very grateful for the calming influence you've had on George.
not_available Oh, no, he's been the calming influence on me.
not_available Well, good for you.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Hey, Seamus.
not_available Hey, Sibley.
not_available Thank you so much for the geode nut dishes.
not_available We just love them.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Terrific.
not_available I didn't tell you this? We'd been dating for six months and he calls me from his car and starts saying something like, "Maybe we should be seeing other pe", 
not_available and he loses cell reception.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available And that was the last time I ever spoke to him.
not_available Did you call him? Of course, and I sent him several e
not_available mails.
not_available Nothing.
not_available "Maybe we should see other pe", 
not_available the parting words of George Sibley.
not_available He's just a raccoon.
not_available He pulled the same move on Delia in the Classics Department.
not_available He was the sweetest man while we were dating.
not_available He probably met someone else.
not_available Yeah, well, when I heard he'd gotten married, I stopped waiting for him to come out of the canyon.
not_available How many? Five, and I had to do "Are you my mother?" twice.
not_available How much sugar did you give him? They pumped him up with popsicles over at Sammy's.
not_available Now you have to work tomorrow night? After I killed myself to get Cassidy, I had to cancel her.
not_available What? Didn't you say you have to work tomorrow night now? On the machine? Oh, no, that was wrong.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available David told me that and then changed it again.
not_available What happened? Someone came back to life? Man, they just kept changing the viewing time.
not_available They kept changing their minds back and forth, these people.
not_available You know, the mother wanted one thing, the wife another, calling all day, changing the casket.
not_available So I shouldn't have canceled Cassidy? Can you get her back? I hope so.
not_available Did you hear him going on about global warming? 
not_available No.
not_available He was trying to make the point that we don't have enough oil left in the earth to generate the emissions to create a greenhouse effect.
not_available Was one of your ex
not_available girlfriends at the party? I don't think so.
not_available A very thin woman, with a mysteriously international accent? Oh.
not_available I did date a lady from the Archaeology Department some time ago.
not_available And how did it end? Gosh, I don't really remember.
not_available Did you lose cell phone reception and never call her back? Did somebody tell you that? 
not_available Did you? I have no idea.
not_available It was a long time ago.
not_available It couldn't have been that long.
not_available As I recall, we just drifted apart.
not_available That's not how she recalls it.
not_available Did you talk to her? I happened to overhear a conversation.
not_available Well, that's not the best way to get information, now is it? In any case, the greenhouse effect will definitely come to pass if we start to burn coal as oil supplies dwindle over the next But I don't think even we could be that stupid.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How're you doing? I'm fine.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Okay.
not_available This helps the bruises.
not_available It's homeopathic, it works.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I used it when I got the shit kicked out of me.
not_available Stay.
not_available Stay.
not_available Stay.
not_available Stay.
not_available Okay, go find him! Go find him! Go on, go on! Good dogs! Good doggies! Did you time it? The winner is Shakti at six seconds! Down.
not_available So do you want to be a trainer? Uh, no, not really.
not_available Do you? I used to.
not_available I really want to be a vet.
not_available I'm waiting to hear from U.C.
not_available Davis for next year.
not_available I'm sure you'll get in.
not_available It's pretty competitive.
not_available You should think about being a trainer.
not_available You're good with them.
not_available Well, thanks, but I'm kind of just enjoying doing this right now.
not_available So, Teri said you used to work at a funeral home? Yeah.
not_available Kinda depressing? Kinda.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Hey, do you think Teri would mind if I brought my little girl in here? 
not_available You have a little girl? Yeah, she's two and a half.
not_available I didn't know you were married.
not_available I mean, you're not wearing a ring.
not_available I'm not married anymore.
not_available Hey, Boo.
not_available Good dog! Claire would take pictures of whoever was there, I'd interact with whoever showed up, maybe have random instruments around, and Jimmy, you could make those big whale installations 
not_available around people.
not_available And videotape it.
not_available What would I do? String beads in the corner? People could do that with you.
not_available Yeah, but what's the point? What are we saying with this? I want to do something really confrontational.
not_available I mean, the world is ending out there, and people are just getting cosmetic surgery and watching debutantes get screwed up the ass.
not_available That's what my work is totally about.
not_available What, screwing debutantes up the ass? American bloat, our national compulsion to consume food, energy and the rest of the world until we're so fat, we literally explode.
not_available Oh, that's what your work is about.
not_available That works with your idea of doing it in a mall.
not_available Well, good luck getting a permit.
not_available You know, it's really hard to be creative with that kind of negative commentary, fuckhead.
not_available I brought some A.M.T.
not_available Thank you, Jesus.
not_available What's A.M.T.? 
not_available Alphamethyltryptamine.
not_available It's like X but groovier.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available Now? It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
not_available Well, you have to do hard drugs during the day, that way you can sleep off the harsh landing.
not_available It seems kind of early.
not_available Oh my God, a dining area.
not_available This is not an area.
not_available No, this is a room.
not_available We could entertain.
not_available Oh, we're going to entertain.
not_available I've always wanted to be one of those people who throws fabulous dinner parties where everyone sits around discussing the nature of reality.
not_available This is definitely the house for that.
not_available I will need a set of hostess pajamas.
not_available I'm gonna need a set of matching pots and pans.
not_available Okay.
not_available Am I sounding like Lucy van Pelt? Lucy van who? 
not_available The "Peanuts" character.
not_available She was always talking about getting saucepans when she married Schroeder.
not_available Was he the genius? Yeah.
not_available He was the musician.
not_available And she was an aspiring psychoanalyst, actually.
not_available Oh.
not_available # Do you know something, Schroeder? # # I think the way that you play the piano is nice # # What would you say if one day you and I # # Should get married? # Yay! That was lovely.
not_available I think we should get all new bedding.
not_available I have really nice sheets.
not_available I was thinking, you know, new house, new bed.
not_available You are such a little bride.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Okay, we get new sheets.
not_available Have you got a condom? Do we need one? I don't know, do we? What are we waiting for? New house, new life.
not_available # The rhythm of my footsteps # # Crossing flood lands to your door # # Have been silenced # # Forevermore # It's like, how many evildoers do you have to kill before you become one yourself, you know? Totally.
not_available Smooth.
not_available I'm insanely thirsty.
not_available # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer # # I need you so much closer.
not_available # So, do you think we did it? Oh, I don't know.
not_available We might have.
not_available Really? Yeah, it's definitely possible.
not_available Why are you making all those beeping sounds? I'm sorry, I'm programming my new cell phone.
not_available Well, that's the one good thing about getting robbed, right? It's a great excuse for getting a new gadget.
not_available I hope it happens again so I can get a new Palm Pilot.
not_available I've always been too I don't know intimidated or something to say this, but I seriously think you're like a total genius.
not_available No way, man.
not_available Let me tell you something.
not_available You are a genius, okay? I was fully humbled by your brass
not_available knuckle baby sculpture.
not_available That was amazing.
not_available God, this is so incredible! You guys gotta come take a shower with me! Mmm.
not_available It's so, like, soothing.
not_available Where's Claire? 
not_available I'll call her.
not_available So, Keith, what's Celeste like, man? Oh my God, that's right.
not_available Even Julio's like, # Gimme gimme some of your candy! # I heard she's kind of crazy in real life.
not_available No, she's just in a crazy situation.
not_available They must have you working around the clock, huh? The hours can get long, but traveling around the country will be a lot better than just sitting in the security car trying to stay awake.
not_available Which cities are on the tour? 
not_available All of 'em, it seems like.
not_available But I'm really looking forward to Austin.
not_available Very vibrant university town.
not_available Boulder's supposed to be beautiful.
not_available Miami I really want to see.
not_available Compared to being a cop, it must be like a vacation.
not_available Yeah, I may not be making the streets safer, but I feel like Celeste really inspires people, you know? I mean, the audiences go home just so high to be alive.
not_available It's kinda cool to be part of that.
not_available Claire? I don't know if you have friends over there or what, but dinner's started and you should really get over here.
not_available Oh fuck! My brother's birthday party is tonight.
not_available My hair.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Mmm, Mom, this is delicious.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's a pumpkin mulligatawny.
not_available I made it in honor of David's love of Indian food.
not_available You love Indian food? 
not_available He did as a child.
not_available I did as a child.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We were making art.
not_available Yum! So Nate, how's the new job? It's amazing.
not_available Awesome.
not_available Really? Working at a kennel? Uh, it's not a kennel.
not_available It's a canine retreat.
not_available What's so great about it? Um it makes me feel like I'm 25 again, life is simple and nothing horrible has ever happened to me.
not_available And the great thing about working with dogs is that they seem to care about me as much as I care about them.
not_available Sounds nice.
not_available Maybe I should go work with dogs.
not_available Seriously, we should all go work with dogs.
not_available I've always preferred cats.
not_available Mom, you should totally get a cat.
not_available Why do you deny yourself so much? Well, I I always had children.
not_available We should all just let ourselves have what we want in life.
not_available As long as we're not, like, greedy imperialists.
not_available I mean, it's your birthday and you just had this awful thing happen.
not_available You so deserve to be happy.
not_available Thank you, Claire.
not_available Claire, will you help me clear? I'd love to, Mom, but I can't have it be just the women who clear.
not_available Now it's just the women and people of color who are clearing.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Thank you, Nate.
not_available He really gets it.
not_available Oh, I met your friend the other day.
not_available Sophie? Sophie? 
not_available I think it was Sophie.
not_available A very outgoing kind of a person? Sasha maybe? Where'd you meet her? She stopped by here to say hello to Federico, I believe.
not_available Stopped by here, a friend of mine? That's what he said, I think.
not_available Maybe I misunderstood.
not_available Wow.
not_available This is beautiful.
not_available Keith, nice.
not_available I noticed your old one got chipped when you got that old one was ugly.
not_available This this is a seriously upscale accessory.
not_available It is upscale.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mine isn't meaningful enough.
not_available I'm sure it's meaningful enough.
not_available No, I want to make it better.
not_available I'll give it to you later.
not_available That one's from me.
not_available That was very nice of you.
not_available What'd we get him? 
not_available A tie.
not_available A gravy boat.
not_available No, it's a neti pot.
not_available A neti pot.
not_available It's an ancient Ayurvedic instrument for cleansing the sinus passages.
not_available May I see that? You fill it with warm water and add some salt.
not_available And then pour it through the sinus like so.
not_available That's okay, I get it.
not_available It'll keep you from getting sick.
not_available I've used one every day for 30 years, hardly had a cold in all that time.
not_available Every day? I've never seen you do that.
not_available I do it in the kitchen when I get back from my morning walk.
not_available You do that in my kitchen? Over the sink.
not_available Where do you keep your nostril pot? Neti pot.
not_available On the top shelf of the cupboard.
not_available Where I can't reach it.
not_available So I won't know about it! Where it's out of the way.
not_available No, you just want it to be one of your nasty little secrets! Ruth, that's enough.
not_available Claire? Could you help me find something tart? Oh yeah.
not_available This is my friend Jimmy.
not_available He's a really amazing artist.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available You know you're not wearing any clothes? Is David all right? He barely ate a thing.
not_available Well, it's a shock, any kind of incident that gets physical.
not_available Those bruises.
not_available Why would anyone hurt someone who was doing what they were told to do? I don't know, Ruth.
not_available There's a lot more insanity in the world than people realize.
not_available Sometimes I'm surprised it's just not total mayhem out there.
not_available Eww, it totally smells like sex in here.
not_available You missed a great show.
not_available Somebody better be planning on washing my sheets tonight.
not_available How was dinner? 
not_available It was kind of amazing.
not_available I feel like I really connected with my family.
not_available I wish you'd been there.
not_available I wish you'd been here.
not_available All these guys want to do is lick each other all night.
not_available I just want to go roll in the grass.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We have some really amazing grass outside.
not_available Tonight? Isn't there any way I can catch up with y'all in Portland? Replace me for the whole tour? That's cold.
not_available I just don't know if I can make it in tonight, dog.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available "Dog"? "We should all be working with dogs." Oh my God.
not_available They were all in full form tonight.
not_available The neti pot? So do you have to go back tonight? I told him I didn't think I could make it in tonight.
not_available Keith, I'm okay.
not_available If I needed you to stay, trust me, I'd tell you.
not_available I don't trust that you would tell me if you need me.
not_available Look at the show you put on for your family tonight.
not_available I don't want you to lose your job.
not_available Who cares? They'll just put me on somebody in L.A.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available So what then? You're more important to me than a job.
not_available I want my pool.
not_available Come on.
not_available Be real with me on this.
not_available I am, I swear.
not_available If you lost your job because of me, it would make me feel so much worse.
not_available It really would.
not_available Good night.
not_available You're going to sleep? Unless you have something you want to talk about.
not_available No.
not_available I just have to brush my hair.
not_available And you want me to just lie here and watch you? No.
not_available That's really beautiful.
not_available That's perfect.
not_available Just put your face in the light a little more.
not_available Just a little bit more to the left now.
not_available Okay, try not to look sexually objectified.
not_available You sicko! Come here.
not_available Wait! 
not_available You have to feel this right now! Wait! Come here.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available This feels amazing.
not_available Can you believe nature just makes this? Nature doesn't really make it.
not_available The landscapers do.
not_available But nature came up with it and it's just lying around all over the world for people to roll around in.
not_available No one ever does.
not_available It's so fucking sad.
not_available Did you ever play rolling pin when you were a kid? No.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Wow, you can't even see the wound.
not_available Where was he shot? 
not_available Point blank in the head.
not_available Oh my God, oh my God.
not_available They had him tied up for hours, apparently, and then they just shot him in the head.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Could they tell from the autopsy if he suffered? I haven't seen the autopsy.
not_available Oh, I thought you were in on all of that.
not_available No, we're just we just take care of the funeral.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available emergency? Hello? 
not_available What are you reporting? I can't breathe.
not_available Please hold for a paramedic.
not_available Are you starting a new home or just making a new start? We've got everything you'll need to make your home a haven of tranquility and style.
not_available Do you have a history of heart problems? No.
not_available Are you clammy, cold or sweaty? 
not_available Yes! Do you have a history of panic attacks? No, is that could this be that? Sure, shortness of breath without skin discoloration or heart pain.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Have you been under any unusual stress lately? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay, sir, just stay calm and relaxed and we'll have someone there shortly.
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available I think I might be okay.
not_available Sir, to be safe we should probably send someone No, thanks, I think I'm okay.
not_available David? I'm here.
not_available You okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
not_available You don't look so great.
not_available I had a panic attack.
not_available I called 911 because I thought I was dying.
not_available How humiliating is that? I thought I was dying when I woke up this morning.
not_available What were you on last night? I don't even know, some X
not_available like thing.
not_available I guess it was really strong.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's fucked up to get carjacked.
not_available It was more than that.
not_available Yeah, I can see that.
not_available It was more than this.
not_available What do you mean? It went on for hours.
not_available At first, I thought he just wanted money.
not_available Well, no, at first I thought he was just this cute boy in distress.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I've fallen for like 50 cute boys in distress.
not_available But then it was like I tried to do everything right, but it just made him want to torture me more.
not_available Torture you? He poured gasoline on me and he put a gun in my mouth long enough for me to think, "My life is over, and I know nothing.
not_available I don't even know how to go." My mind kept spinning, trying to grab onto something, but nothing was enough, not even Keith or anyone.
not_available Nothing was enough.
not_available I forgot to pray, can you believe that? I totally forgot to pray.
not_available That's okay.
not_available God saved you anyway, right? I'm not going back.
not_available I can't! I'll go insane if I have to come back to this.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available He doesn't even want me to tell you.
not_available Well, okay then, it's not that bad.
not_available It is that bad.
not_available What, you think he can't work at all? I think he seriously cannot deal.
not_available Well, I don't know, maybe we can hire somebody.
not_available I'm not sure that having some stranger come in here is really going to be all that helpful.
not_available It would've been nice if Mom hadn't fucked our only intern.
not_available I've finally got a life I can stand.
not_available He would do it for you.
not_available Are you available for chopping? If you so wish.
not_available If I so wish? What does that mean? It means I'd appreciate it if you would just ask me directly, "Will you chop the cucumber?" 
not_available I did ask you directly.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available You were making a point of my not helping you with dinner instead of just asking me to help.
not_available You've been very mean to me all day.
not_available I have not been mean to you.
not_available I've been upset with you.
not_available What have I done to you? You embarrassed me in front of your entire family instead of confronting me directly with what's bothering you.
not_available I did confront you directly, and you made it very clear that you did not wish to be confronted directly.
not_available That is completely untrue.
not_available I answered every question you asked me, as I always do.
not_available You pretended not to remember something that happened less than a year ago.
not_available You forget things that happened yesterday! Look, Ruth.
not_available The past is not important to me.
not_available I just want to be here in the present with you.
not_available Yes, but there was a time when you wanted to be in the present with that woman at the party.
not_available She had no idea you were going to leave her.
not_available She went from being in the present to being in the past without even realizing it! You're really starting to sound hysterical.
not_available I just want to know what changed for you with that woman or your first few wives.
not_available It doesn't matter! 
not_available It does matter! Why would you leave so many Because they asked too many fucking questions! That's why! A very outgoing girl named Sophie, she said.
not_available Oh, Sophia.
not_available Yeah, she's a young mother from church that I'm helping.
not_available A young mother from church that you're helping? Yeah, I told Father Deegan that I wanted to do some charity work and he gave me this family to help.
not_available You know, like a big brother thing.
not_available How come you never told me about any of this? You know, it was just between me and the father.
not_available This outgoing young mother, what kind of help are you giving her? Just like, cans of food.
not_available Old clothes and toys and stuff, like from the Fishers.
not_available You're giving her stuff from the Fishers, but Ruth doesn't know? She knows, she just doesn't know that Sophia is the young mother in need.
not_available I just don't know why you would keep charity a secret.
not_available That's the way you're supposed to do charity, sweetie.
not_available Oh, come on! You tell your wife.
not_available Well, the truth is, this is something I started doing when you were you know, not that easy to tell things to.
not_available When your own family needed you, you started helping someone else? Sometimes it helps to make your own problems seem less bad, when you help someone who's got it even worse than you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available What are you what are you what's up? Oh, I don't know.
not_available Are you okay? I don't know.
not_available Maybe it's just who I am.
not_available Do you want to sit down? I don't think that I can change.
not_available I just can't become this totally different person living this simple, happy little life.
not_available Neither can I.
not_available Mmm.
