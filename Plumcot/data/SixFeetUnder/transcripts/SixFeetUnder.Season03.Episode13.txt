
not_available OK, sweetheart, time to say goodbye.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available We have to.
not_available God has other plans for her.
not_available I'll miss you, birdie.
not_available I know, sweetheart.
not_available But by rescuing her, nursing her back to health and now setting her free, we are doing a good deed.
not_available Good deed.
not_available When we do something kind, even for a little lost bird, we give a gift that resonates throughout all humanity.
not_available Humanity.
not_available Say bye
not_available bye.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Be free, little lost bird.
not_available Be free.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available You motherfucker.
not_available Fuck me! It's broken.
not_available A bird crapped on my hat.
not_available I need to wash it.
not_available All right.
not_available Just use the sink.
not_available Toilet broken.
not_available And hurry up.
not_available I'm going to close.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available I told you it's broken.
not_available Fuck you, motherfucker.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Fuck off, you! What are you saying? You wanna leave? 
not_available Leave? I'd have to leave because I moved my life to this shithole city.
not_available Not for me, you didn't.
not_available You wanna split up? Maybe, yeah.
not_available Who would leave a child alone like that? Don't be too hard on him.
not_available He's not himself right now.
not_available Besides, Maya's far from alone.
not_available Aren't you, little lady? You wanna go to Grandma? 
not_available There you go.
not_available So is Nate a total alkie now? Shall we do something? He's just numbing the pain.
not_available He has to.
not_available Sometimes he goes outside to smoke and he paces underneath my window.
not_available He talks to himself.
not_available I know.
not_available Seriously, like whole conversations.
not_available Why is everyone in my house? Maya was crying her little heart out.
not_available Where would you go at 4.30am? 
not_available I was having a cigarette.
not_available In Pomona? 
not_available We heard her crying all the way in the house.
not_available Poor little baby, you thought no one loved you.
not_available Mom, I can take her.
not_available Where's her blankie? 
not_available I have it.
not_available Are you living here now? 
not_available Nate.
not_available Tell you what, I'm gonna make a big pot of coffee and then we'd like to talk to you guys.
not_available In the kitchen in, say, about ten minutes? You're getting married? When? The day after tomorrow.
not_available A small ceremony.
not_available Just me and George and all of you.
not_available You guys met last week.
not_available Six and a half weeks ago, actually.
not_available Mom.
not_available When were you planning on telling us? 
not_available We booked the wedding chapel last night.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available Nate, I love your mother and she loves me.
not_available Yeah, it's so fucking moving I can hardly stand it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Do whatever you want.
not_available What do I care? Mom, maybe with Lisa and everything 
not_available Life doesn't stop, all right? We didn't die.
not_available We have this precious gift of life and it's so terribly fleeting and that is why it's important to keep on living, to not give up hope.
not_available Fine, don't come.
not_available If no one's going to celebrate this with us, I don't want any of you there.
not_available Let's go back to bed.
not_available It's upsetting to you that your kids don't approve, isn't it? Do your children approve? They're supportive.
not_available Maggie says to just send pictures.
not_available Brian said six and he's done.
not_available I don't need their approval.
not_available Not one of them has ever had a relationship I'd want.
not_available George, I don't wanna wait.
not_available I feel like I've spent my entire life waiting.
not_available Then let's not wait.
not_available The day after tomorrow? They don't even know each other.
not_available Maybe that's the best time to marry someone, otherwise you'd never do it.
not_available How are you holding up through all this? Not that good.
not_available You wanna talk about it? How can I? With Lisa just gone and Nate's like totally losing it.
not_available I feel I don't have a right to have my own problems.
not_available Of course you have a right.
not_available Is it Russell? 
not_available God, it's so much more than that.
not_available A year ago I was like, if I can just get into art school, then maybe finally my life will start to be about something.
not_available And then I do and it's just so sickly political and dumb and full of evil, hateful freaks.
not_available Now I just despise the one thing that was my only hope.
not_available Your whole relationship fell apart too, huh? No, I wouldn't say Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't forget to bring back your coffee cup.
not_available We're running out of coffee cups in this kitchen.
not_available People keep leaving with them.
not_available A plane.
not_available A plane going to Burbank airport.
not_available Just before landing They call it blue ice.
not_available A ball of chemicals for toilet of aeroplane.
not_available It come off.
not_available Right down to Anahid.
not_available In our own yard.
not_available One minute I am talking to her on telephone, next minute You believe this? And now I find out it happens all the time.
not_available Big companies are keeping it quiet so people like me and you don't realise that blue ice is a killer.
not_available Are you not listening to me? You are here just to take my money? You take it from people when they are vulnerable.
not_available What is this, some kind of fucking business? Goddamn right, it's a business.
not_available You think I'm here for the love of humanity? You think I wanna be with people on the worst day of their lives? 
not_available I want to talk to your boss, please.
not_available I am the boss and I want you out now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Go on, get the fuck out.
not_available I'll have your wife brought to wherever you end up.
not_available Free of fucking charge.
not_available Out of the goodness of my heart.
not_available I'm in this business because I love people.
not_available And I love helping people! I felt so free for a week, but then within days I went from, "Yay, I'm independent," to, "Holy fuck, I'm gonna die alone.
not_available " I keep switching between, "We're meant to be together "and we can grow together into who we fully are together " Know what I mean? 
not_available Not really.
not_available And then I completely flip over to, "We're poison for each other.
not_available This is abuse.
not_available " You always go through tough patches, David.
not_available You just have to work through them.
not_available Have you and Vanessa gone through a time where you felt that by staying with her your sense of self would be obliterated? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't think so.
not_available Vanessa and I have our issues.
not_available Mainly because other people try to come between us.
not_available Would that be Angelica? I swear, David, I wish I could just kick her sorry ass out.
not_available Vanessa always takes her side.
not_available It's like I have a two
not_available headed wife.
not_available As opposed to a noheaded wife? 
not_available That's good.
not_available That's really 
not_available Unhook her.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Just fucking unhook her.
not_available What's wrong with you? The husband changed his mind.
not_available Wait until I get the cannula out of her.
not_available I should aspirate before we move her.
not_available Did we get outbid again? Yeah, the priest or pastor from their church wanted to use a different place.
not_available Armenian place.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Make sure we charge them extra for embalming.
not_available It's gonna be free.
not_available Why did you do that? 
not_available You just lost us $500, Nate.
not_available I made a mistake, all right? I made a fucking mistake.
not_available You wanna take it out of my fucking pay cheque? Fuck you guys.
not_available I'm so alone.
not_available You're not alone.
not_available You have me.
not_available But do I, Philip? Do I really? How can I ever trust you after Budapest? 
not_available I had amnesia.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need you to watch Maya for me.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Nate, I wanna help you.
not_available I can't imagine what you're dealing with.
not_available But I am as out of it as you are.
not_available I don't think my energy would be good for Maya.
not_available No, you're better than me.
not_available Maybe it's just too much to ever forgive.
not_available Or maybe when it comes to forgiving, you need to start with yourself.
not_available One more? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you guys sell any food here? Peanuts.
not_available Some eggs over there.
not_available I could order you a pizza.
not_available No, I can't eat a whole pizza.
not_available I'll have a slice with you.
not_available Hawaiian? Ham and pineapple? Sorry, I'm not a pineappleon
not_available pizza kind of guy.
not_available Oh, yeah? What kind of guy are you? The kind of guy who wants to fuck you senseless.
not_available Am I too loud? 
not_available No, I was just curious what the sound was.
not_available French horn.
not_available Nobody ever knows what it is.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Don't lie.
not_available There's no need.
not_available It's not one of those instruments that's meant to be heard alone.
not_available I'm Brenda.
not_available Joe.
not_available I just moved in a month and a half ago.
not_available Welcome.
not_available I've been here for about eight years.
not_available It seems like a nice enough place.
not_available Yeah, I like it.
not_available It's cheap, so I don't have to work a lot.
not_available I do session work mostly.
not_available These days people prefer the synthesised pseudo
not_available horn to that of an actual human.
not_available Do I sound angry? I'm not angry.
not_available No.
not_available It's fine.
not_available It's nice to talk to someone.
not_available You just get out of prison? Something like that.
not_available Have you checked out the neighbourhood, figured out where stuff is? 
not_available No.
not_available No? No, I just mostly stay at home.
not_available If you want, I'll walk you down.
not_available I know the area looks dicey, but there are some great places.
not_available There's a great Cuban bakery that makes a really good cafe con leche.
not_available I'm not gonna have sex with you.
not_available OK.
not_available Just to get that out in the open.
not_available I didn't realise that was an option.
not_available It's not an option.
not_available I got it.
not_available Sorry to be so blunt.
not_available It's just I've been celibate kind of a long time and it's been kind of a good thing for me.
not_available You're really attractive.
not_available But you know that, right? So yeah, I'll have coffee with you but I don't drink or smoke pot.
not_available I'm pretty boring, actually.
not_available Somehow I find that hard to believe.
not_available Well, then, it's nice meeting you.
not_available And your horn.
not_available Yeah.
not_available ..
not_available taking some punishing blows.
not_available What is keeping these guys up? I can't figure.
not_available Oh, and that hurts very bad.
not_available That hurts.
not_available He's wobbling now.
not_available He's certainly wobbling.
not_available Hey.
not_available Travis, clear out.
not_available Momma's got company.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available I don't know if this kid's gonna have his title before this night is over It's two in the morning.
not_available You left at dinner time.
not_available Just go back to sleep.
not_available God, you're so fucking sad.
not_available I know.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm just happy to see you.
not_available You are? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm happy to see you too.
not_available Call him.
not_available You know you want to.
not_available Yeah, but should I? Why not? You miss him.
not_available I miss a lot of people.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But you really miss him.
not_available I miss having sex with him.
not_available You can have sex with anybody.
not_available Yeah, I did that.
not_available I saw.
not_available Slut.
not_available So what if I shut the door on Keith like he's dead to me? I'll end up replacing him with someone else like Mom is replacing you with George.
not_available Is that all life is, replacing people? 
not_available Pretty much.
not_available Some people do it faster and more often than others.
not_available Don't touch those.
not_available George reminds me of you, you know.
not_available Huh.
not_available I don't really see that.
not_available Just enough to make me sad.
not_available Enough to make me wish I could see you and Mom together again.
not_available That man is alive and I'm dead.
not_available I think that means he wins.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Listen, I Would you like to come to church with me this morning? You have to be real quiet so we can sneak up on him.
not_available I don't think he's gonna like that.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Got another beer? 
not_available Fridge.
not_available You gotta stay real close and keep quiet.
not_available Really quiet.
not_available What you doing? 
not_available Watching the baby.
not_available Literally.
not_available The little ones.
not_available There's a reason to hold it together.
not_available We forget our own reasons.
not_available You're not gonna try and lay some instant bonding horseshit on me, are you? Cos that'd be seriously obnoxious.
not_available We're all very worried about you.
not_available We who? Your mother, your family, which, like it or not, I'm gonna be part of.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available You need your family now, more than ever.
not_available George, you can sit in our TV room and rent movies, you can bone my mother day and night, but don't you dare come in here and act like you're my fucking father, cos you're not, you never will be.
not_available It's time for Maya's nap.
not_available I only wanted to 
not_available Just leave me the fuck alone, all right? Sorry, babe.
not_available I remember the first time I saw you, out there in the parking lot.
not_available Really? I thought we met downstairs at that buffet thing.
not_available Yeah, that's where we met, but I'd already seen you a couple of times, getting out of your car, all studly.
not_available You looked so intense, the way you pointed your alarm thingy at your car.
not_available "Fuck you, car.
not_available Now you're locked.
not_available " 
not_available Please.
not_available Somebody told me you were a cop.
not_available And for the next couple of Sundays I timed it so I'd pull in next to you.
not_available You were watching me? Stalker.
not_available I loved that you were a cop.
not_available The thought of being with you made me feel safe.
not_available I can't imagine what I thought I needed protection from.
not_available I just liked knowing you were strapped to a gun all day.
not_available I saw you before we talked too.
not_available Really? You were checking me out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I saw you and I thought, "Who is that beautiful new white boy?" 
not_available Stop.
not_available I did.
not_available I couldn't stop looking at you.
not_available It's funny.
not_available Why is that funny? Don't you know I think you're beautiful? No.
not_available And kind and smart and loving.
not_available You didn't know that? No.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available You looking for me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where the fuck is your grave? You're not even close.
not_available It's way over there.
not_available Come on, I'll take you to it.
not_available So how's life? How's death? 
not_available It's good.
not_available Made some new friends, joined the chess team.
not_available Glad you came today.
not_available Is it some kind of special occasion? 
not_available No, it's like this every day.
not_available Hello, precious girl.
not_available Mom, I've got to tell you I think you're making a big mistake marrying George.
not_available You don't know him.
not_available I know he's a presumptuous fool and a knowitall, OK? 
not_available Plus, he's selfish.
not_available It's so obvious.
not_available How is he selfish? Mom, he wants you to take care of him.
not_available He's not thinking of how much Maya will need you.
not_available Maya's going to need strong, happy people in her life, and I love George and I feel strong and happy with him.
not_available That helps Maya.
not_available It's a help to go off with some stranger and leave Maya with no family at all? Jesus Christ, her mother is fucking missing.
not_available Maya still has one parent.
not_available A lot of kids don't even have that.
not_available You didn't come home until 2.30 last night.
not_available I had a sitter.
not_available You had Claire.
not_available You can't expect us to be there every time you wanna check out.
not_available Why the fuck not? I stuck around after Dad died.
not_available I had a life.
not_available I was ready to go back to Seattle.
not_available I never asked you 
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available You asked me to stick around.
not_available "Just for a few fucking days.
not_available " But that's only because nobody in this family can say what they really mean.
not_available You know you wanted me to stay for good.
not_available Don't you dare fucking act like you didn't.
not_available Goddammit! I've changed everything in my fucking life because of you.
not_available Maybe if I hadn't, none of this shit would have happened.
not_available Please! And now, when I need you, you refuse to fucking help me.
not_available How can I help you? I'm trying to pull you out of the water and you're strapping on lead boots.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available Watch you self
not_available destruct? I can't do that.
not_available I won't do that.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available Thanks for fucking everything.
not_available So those are all your cats? No, they're the building's.
not_available But if I don't feed them they're gonna eat dead diseased birds or something.
not_available So you're a giver? 
not_available Yeah, I'm so fucking noble.
not_available Not enough to catch them, get them spayed, find them homes.
not_available Why don't you take them in yourself? 
not_available I'm allergic.
not_available Sorry if I unloaded too much personal stuff on you yesterday.
not_available No problem.
not_available So is the coffee thing still an option? Sure, if you want it to be.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available OK.
not_available Now? 
not_available Yeah, I could.
not_available No, they're closed Sunday.
not_available And I have to do laundry today.
not_available Sure.
not_available OK, it's fine.
not_available Well, we could do dinner later tonight.
not_available There's a Korean barbecue nearby.
not_available I don't think Think of it as lunch in another time zone.
not_available I already know sex is not an option.
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Good.
not_available Monkeys? 
not_available You think monkeys don't die? Yeah, Anthony, good catch, man.
not_available Over here.
not_available He's dead? 
not_available Don't ask me.
not_available This is your thing.
not_available Man, I was just so constantly aggro.
not_available Know what my problem was? I couldn't relax.
not_available I wish I could have helped you more.
not_available Claire, there was nothing anybody could do.
not_available Life just wasn't the right environment for me.
not_available But don't you miss it? No, not really.
not_available Actually, I like it better here.
not_available I'm taking care of Anthony and I'm doing the whole home
not_available school thing.
not_available I feel like I have a purpose for the first time.
not_available I never could have done that when I was alive.
not_available I was just so fucking selfish.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When I hang out with my niece sometimes it's like just by spending time with her I get to re
not_available experience the sort of eternal youngness of things.
not_available But then I think about it and it just goes away.
not_available So, you seeing anybody? No.
not_available I gotta go to the bathroom.
not_available All right, let's go to the bathroom.
not_available Come on.
not_available Well, I've got to run.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Come here.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you too.
not_available OK.
not_available Come on.
not_available It was always more like I had no choice.
not_available My belief was all fear.
not_available The whole Catholic thing, even though I'm Episcopalian.
not_available "You have to do right or you'll be punished.
not_available " I got that too, only not from my religion, from my dad.
not_available I believe we should do the right thing but not because we'll be rewarded in heaven.
not_available No, we should do the right thing because we can and we choose to, even if it's gonna make life harder, which it often does.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just don't know if it's right for us to be together.
not_available I don't know if it's wrong, either.
not_available I've just been so unhappy for such a long time.
not_available I slept with Patrick.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, look.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I love you with all my heart and I'll do anything to work through this because I don't wanna lose you.
not_available I can't promise you anything.
not_available Just don't give up.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Where are you going? I don't want to sit around like a pig in my own filth for one Sunday, if nobody minds.
not_available Sweetie, why don't we go to church? Why don't we do something? Baby, Angie just rented the kids a bunch of movies.
not_available Whoa, Angie, that's not for kids.
not_available Put on something else.
not_available What they get they get.
not_available What they don't get goes over their heads.
not_available That doesn't make any sense.
not_available It does.
not_available I have to go to the potty.
not_available Will you put it on pause? 
not_available That's my shirt.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I just slept in it.
not_available I'll wash it.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Your sister has got to go for good.
not_available She's been looking.
not_available She needs to find a roommate first.
not_available She hasn't been looking.
not_available She's in hog heaven over here.
not_available Rico, that is my sister.
not_available And I am your husband.
not_available We wouldn't be in this house if it weren't for her.
not_available We paid her that money back.
not_available We needed help.
not_available Now she needs help.
not_available Rico.
not_available You better not slam that door.
not_available I'll wait for you out here.
not_available You're not allowed to smoke in there.
not_available Claire.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Please tell me you're just visiting.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So you're 
not_available Couldn't be better.
not_available OK, I'm so not getting this.
not_available There's nothing to get.
not_available Lisa, if I'd known you were gonna die I'd have hung out with you more.
not_available You're so sweet.
not_available Isn't he beautiful? Don't worry.
not_available I'll take good care of him.
not_available And you take care of Maya for me, OK? You know, I miss you and I think about you all the time.
not_available Right back at you.
not_available It's so weird that Mom's getting married.
not_available It's like you're being erased or something.
not_available Aren't you pissed off? No.
not_available That's you.
not_available I think this is what you're looking for.
not_available Yeah? Mr Fisher? Yeah? 
not_available This is Deputy Wheeler.
not_available I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, sir.
not_available You might want to sit down.
not_available OK.
not_available We found a body, sir, and it matches with your wife's dental records.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Three basics.
not_available And turn.
not_available Merengue.
not_available You read all these articles, how Austin's supposed to be this hot enclave of artists, but it was more than just hot.
not_available A million degrees at all times.
not_available I'd be laying around my apartment going, "I know to I need to experience that edgy local songwriter at the fabulous new club, "but I'm just so damn hot.
not_available " Is that why you came back to LA? 
not_available My dad got sick.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available He died, actually.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's OK.
not_available The oddest part is that I actually returned with the intention of reconnecting with my family, and then within a matter of months I'm in this place where, without saying too much and scaring you Say whatever you want.
not_available I actually have no one.
not_available I don't think I've ever been so by myself.
not_available But, believe it or not, I'm not lonely.
not_available I know that one day I need to start well, I want to start dating again Fuck dating.
not_available Dating is stupid.
not_available But this is a date, isn't it, kind of? Well, it is if we want it to be.
not_available Do you want it to be? Can I get back to you on that? 
not_available Take your time.
not_available See you next time.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available I know the woman that teaches salsa on Tuesdays.
not_available She's delightful.
not_available Cool, I'll check it out.
not_available I'm taking off.
not_available I think they're having a private party here tonight.
not_available We probably should clear out.
not_available OK.
not_available Would you like to get a drink? You look like you have some time.
not_available I've got nothing but time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's your car? 
not_available In the lot.
not_available Why don't you follow me? 
not_available OK.
not_available So what'll it be? A shot of tequila.
not_available You wanna get to your sister's before dark.
not_available You wanna get rid of me.
not_available Keep it coming.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available Hello, dear.
not_available You look beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How long before we leave? 
not_available A couple of hours.
not_available Good.
not_available I was afraid I was gonna be late.
not_available Want me to bag up the video camera? 
not_available No, they provide that at the chapel.
not_available Maybe you could take care of Maya tonight at the wedding.
not_available George has her right now.
not_available Where's Nate? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available I've tried calling his cellphone all afternoon but there's no answer.
not_available I have something for you.
not_available They're antique, so they're old, but I just bought them, so they're also new.
not_available Technically I'm giving them to you rather than letting you borrow them but they're blue, right? I love you, Mom.
not_available I'm so happy that you've found your soul mate.
not_available Thank you, my sweet darling Claire.
not_available You don't know how much this means to me from you.
not_available Do you like them? 
not_available They're beautiful.
not_available Nothing to worry about, kid.
not_available Just a place to get a drink.
not_available I know.
not_available I just normally don't do this.
not_available These ladies, they're very nice.

not_available When are you gonna dance again? Would you please stop doing that? If you can give me a good reason to.
not_available Because it's driving me fucking crazy.

not_available You're picking on my style.
not_available This cake is pretty good.
not_available Not really.

not_available Fuck you.
not_available What are you waiting for? 
not_available Quit grandstanding.
not_available Do it.
not_available Shut the fuck up.
not_available Look at you.
not_available You're such a mess.
not_available You'll take anyone if they'll fuck you or fight you.
not_available Let me tell you, buddy boy, those are just wisps of nothing compared to the nut you'll bust when this car rips through you, tears your ass in half.
not_available You'll shit a million stars.
not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available Go ahead, honey.
not_available It's the least you can do for me.
not_available You fantasised about me being gone.
not_available You've got what you wanted.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available There's a very simple way you can make it up to me.
not_available I don't wanna die.
not_available Coming up on the right.

not_available I don't wanna die.
