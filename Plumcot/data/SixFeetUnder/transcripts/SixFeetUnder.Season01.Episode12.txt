
not_available I just remembered, I owe you money.
not_available Well, thank you for sparing me the awkward confrontation.
not_available Are you starting to feel exploited? 
not_available Yeah, but in a good way.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you looking at my balance? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Size isn't everything.
not_available Funny.
not_available So does bad music make people deaf or do deaf people have really bad taste in music? Well, there is Beethoven.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available What the fuck is that shit? 
not_available Hurry.
not_available My receipt.
not_available Come on, that's all right, just 
not_available Look, it's all yours.
not_available Do you think you can do that kind of offensive shit in public? We're sorry, man, we didn't 
not_available Oh, he's sorry, huh? Look, Pete, let's go.
not_available Fuck you, man! 
not_available Fuck you! Fuck! Run! Help! The other one got away.
not_available Fucking freak! Fucking pervert! Read a Bible, you pervert! Johnny, come on.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay, here we go with Uncle Nate.
not_available You got him? 
not_available Just about.
not_available Put your hand under there.
not_available There we go.
not_available All right, I got him.
not_available I got him.
not_available Okay, but don't hold him like he's a football.
not_available It's more like you're carrying a watermelon.
not_available All right.
not_available See? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Adjust, adjust, adjust.
not_available There you go.
not_available Hey, there, little guy.
not_available Who looks just like his daddy, huh? When a baby's born it always looks more like its father which is nature's way of establishing paternity.
not_available We're hoping he grows out of it.
not_available Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he will.
not_available Oh, yes, yes.
not_available David, come meet Augusto.
not_available I just have to get Mr.
not_available Perlmutter dressed for his viewing.
not_available David, please, come take one look at him.
not_available Nate was an extremely gassy baby, always crying.
not_available David, on the other hand, hardly ever made a peep.
not_available When are you guys gonna grow up and make this woman a grandmommy? Well, certainly not until after Mr.
not_available Perlmutter's got some clothes on.
not_available You know, it's kind of funny, me coming back to school in a hearse.
not_available It's hilarious.
not_available This sucks.
not_available Does everybody know? I don't know.
not_available Who'd you tell? No, I mean, like, did they make an announcement or something? Don't you think you would've gotten, like, a couple of cards if they had? No.
not_available It's not cool to OD.
not_available Freaks people out.
not_available Who gives a fuck what these people think? Everyone's too obsessed with what people think about them to think about anyone else.
not_available You're a freak.
not_available Yeah, well, so are you.
not_available Is that supposed to make me feel better? 
not_available That's the guy who OD'd.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available What the fuck are you looking at? What, you called me over here to show me a picture of you and the gravedigger? I need your key back, because you've crossed a line and I don't feel like I can trust you anymore.
not_available You think I took that picture? 
not_available I will not play this game with you! I won't deal with you when you're off your meds because I don't even know who you are.
not_available For someone with so much animosity towards the psychiatric profession you sure love to push pharmaceuticals.
not_available Makes sense, as you're no stranger to medication yourself.
not_available You're sick, Billy.
not_available You have to stay on your medication or you get scary, okay? You're not scared of me.
not_available I'd never hurt you.
not_available You're the most important person in my life.
not_available Yeah, well, did you ever stop to think that maybe that's fucked up? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available Just Just take the meds.
not_available Okay.
not_available I promise.
not_available Now give me the key.
not_available I just told you I'd take the medication, Brenda.
not_available I just I just told you I'd take the medication! Jesus Christ, you don't have to be such a bitch! When did you turn into Mom? Okay.
not_available I don't give a shit.
not_available You want your fucking key? Great.
not_available Here, take all the fucking keys.
not_available I could have an extra copy at home.
not_available Yeah, I could always change the locks.
not_available Do you know how easy it would be to break into this place? I'd like you to go now.
not_available Get your wet suit, clothing, robes.
not_available Take them.
not_available I just told you I'd take the medication, Brenda! I told you I would take the medication, please.
not_available You have to take care of yourself now.
not_available I can't do it, not anymore.
not_available Please, Brenda, you're the only person I can talk to.
not_available You're the only one that hears me.
not_available Billy, you have to get a life of your own, okay? Please.
not_available You probably read about it.
not_available It was on the news what happened to Marc.
not_available Yes.
not_available The coroner still has his They still have him.
not_available In situations like this, when there's been violence the family may prefer a closed casket.
not_available No.
not_available Honey, I think he looks pretty bad.
not_available I have to see him.
not_available I brought some pictures, so you'll know what he looks like.
not_available Wasn't he such a beautiful boy? Why does a thing like this happen? Come on, now, we all know why this happened.
not_available That is not a reason.
not_available It's the only reason.
not_available If he wasn't He'd be alive today.
not_available You know, I was always so worried about AIDS.
not_available I never even thought that just being out on the street What is wrong with people? Could've told him this happens.
not_available I would've too if he'd ever just talked to us about it, ever come out and told us what he was.
not_available Well, what do you expect, Marcus? You can't even say it.
not_available Hey, Dave.
not_available I'll be right with you.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Okay, Cinderella we're gonna have to work overtime to get you ready for the ball because men don't make passes at girls with big gashes.
not_available That was funny, right? Daddy's Mr.
not_available Funnyman.
not_available Let me just run Augusto upstairs, and I'll be right back down to do him.
not_available I can handle this, Federico.
not_available Why don't you take the rest of the day off? That's a pretty tough job, Dave.
not_available The skull's all shattered up there.
not_available You might have to rebuild the tissue on his cheek.
not_available I can do it.
not_available Hey, thanks, man.
not_available I'm so damn tired I can barely see straight.
not_available Get some rest.
not_available You bet.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Let's go, buddy.
not_available Let's go, buddy.
not_available Let's go.
not_available And I told him not to come around for a while.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Oh, what else could I do, Nate? You could talk to the police.
not_available You could get a restraining order.
not_available I don't need you to tell me how to handle this.
not_available That is so arrogant and patronizing.
not_available I just need you to listen to me.
not_available You can't just wait for the next fucked
not_available up thing Billy does.
not_available You need to do something now.
not_available Do you think that was easy for me, just cutting him off like that? Do you even comprehend what it's like to be responsible for someone your whole life? Do you even get the concept of loving somebody that much? Yes, I get that concept.
not_available He's sick.
not_available He's not just sick, he's dangerous.
not_available He built a bomb.
not_available He broke into our hotel room and took pictures of us in bed.
not_available What's he gonna do next time? 
not_available I took his key away from him.
not_available Yeah, well, he didn't have a key in Vegas.
not_available That didn't keep him out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know you don't trust your parents but I really think they're right on this.
not_available He needs to be somewhere.
not_available This is so not how I need you to be right now.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I don't wanna discuss this with you.
not_available In fact, you know what? Why don't we just take some time off? You dump Billy, so now you're gonna dump me? Don't you fucking analyze me! You might as well throw away your key, because I changed the lock.
not_available Where's Claire? Well, she claims to be at a movie, but what do I know? Nobody ever tells me what's really going on.
not_available That boy who got beat up on the street was he doing something? He was getting cash.
not_available Didn't you read the paper? Yes, I just thought you might know more about it.
not_available Do you like the hen? Yeah, very much.
not_available What did you stuff it with? Chestnuts, bread crumbs, celery.
not_available Do you wanna know all the ingredients? No, thanks.
not_available Are you going out tonight? No, not tonight.
not_available Are you? Me? No.
not_available But, you know sometimes I do see Hiram on occasion.
not_available And I know you don't like that but I also know you love me no matter who I see in my private life.
not_available Well, that's good, Mom.
not_available Why'd you drop jazz vocals sophomore year? Because the music teacher was a crackhead.
not_available I'm serious, Claire.
not_available So am I.
not_available He got busted and fired, and then jazz vocals was discontinued.
not_available Do your homework.
not_available What happened with the literary magazine? Censorship.
not_available I wrote this totally, like, harmless like, cartoon story about this girl who can make people's heads explode and apparently it was too disturbing to publish.
not_available The debate team? They debated what the prom theme should be.
not_available I mean, God, the people in this school, they have the mentality of teenagers.
not_available You are a teenager.
not_available Yes but I actually think about things beside trying to figure out how to puke after lunch without anyone noticing.
not_available So, what do you do for fun? I don't know.
not_available What do you do for fun? I go bowling with my friends.
not_available I take hikes with my girlfriend.
not_available I bake.
not_available You bake? Your turn.
not_available I read.
not_available I go online and make up freaky cyber identities.
not_available You know, sometimes I'm a Scientologist.
not_available Sometimes I'm a young, Christian wife.
not_available What about friendships that are based on the truth? Any of those? Sometimes I hang out with Parker McKenna.
not_available I kind of like her even though she's pretty much a split
not_available personality freak.
not_available Dating anyone? Dating? You mean, like, getting drunk and screwing? 
not_available Lf that's what it is.
not_available Yeah, that's what it is.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Keith, got a minute? Yeah, sure.
not_available What's up? I wanna put you on security for the Marc Foster funeral on Thursday.
not_available Okay, why? The wackos turn out for these things.
not_available Why me? 
not_available Come on, Keith.
not_available You're a good, smart cop, and you use your head before you use your gun, all right? So it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm gay, right? What do you wanna do, sue me for discrimination or show up and protect this kid's family? Oh, God, I look like something Chef Boyardee makes.
not_available So you never told your parents you were gay either? Oh, please, they knew.
not_available I just didn't want my dad making me feel guilty about it all the time.
not_available Maybe he could've accepted it if you'd given him a chance.
not_available You heard him.
not_available He thinks it's my fault I'm dead.
not_available That's not what he was saying.
not_available He was saying it's a sick world.
not_available I'm the one who was sick.
not_available Shut up.
not_available So I liked men.
not_available I never should've given in to it.
not_available It's not what God intended.
not_available I could've had a family and a normal life.
not_available You could've too.
not_available That life would've been a lie and unfair to your wife and children who would've hated you.
not_available Not if I never looked back.
not_available Not if I had faith.
not_available God challenges us like this, so we'll choose good so we'll triumph over evil.
not_available Only thing is, so few of us do.
not_available It's not a choice.
not_available God already made the choice for you.
not_available That's just liberal propaganda to justify your own depravity, Jim.
not_available No matter how nice you fix me up, I'm still going to hell, and you know it because you're going there too.
not_available Brenda, pick up the phone.
not_available Don't just lay there and say, "Fuck you." Okay, I'm sorry I pissed you off.
not_available I know you're under a lot of pressure but so am I.
not_available So let's talk about it, okay? Call me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yes, this is Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available Can I help you? I'm terribly sorry.
not_available Yes, we can pick up the body The deceased.
not_available Which morgue? A residence, okay.
not_available What's the address? Robbie? Oh, I'm sorry, did my tree hit you? Do you have a moment? 
not_available Well, I don't know, Ruth.
not_available I got a whole big bunch of ferns out back I gotta cut up so you can make some more of those beautiful, oneofa
not_available kind arrangements.
not_available How did you tell your parents you were Into flowers? Well, it was obvious from the beginning.
not_available My first word was "perennial." How did you tell them you were gay? What makes you think I am gay? Just because I have a refined aesthetic you make assumptions about my personal life? I'm so sorry.
not_available You're not gay? Yes, I'm gay.
not_available But I certainly don't see how that's any of your business.
not_available Do I ask you about your intimate sexual life even though it is on full display in the workplace? No, I do not.
not_available I tolerate the repercussions, but I don't pry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm asking because my son Oh, dear Lord, save it for Geraldo.
not_available Someone in the family shows signs of homosexuality and suddenly it's a national crisis.
not_available Coming out to my parents.
not_available Honestly, why don't you tell me the most horrible moment from your intimate past? It was horrible? 
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available I'm sorry I offended you, Robbie.
not_available That is a shitty place for the lily.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jacoby? Oh, fuck.
not_available Jesus, Billy, you fucking psycho.
not_available Did I get you? Come on, man, it's paint.
not_available Why aren't you laughing? I don't think it's funny.
not_available Oh, no, it's just plain fun.
not_available You know, if you mix up the letters in "funeral," you get "real fun." How much do you love that? You stay away from my sister.
not_available She's just a kid.
not_available Now, that's kind of ironic, don't you think? You telling me that.
not_available What'd they tell you? They tell you I made a bomb? They tell you who it was for? I know you wrote things about your family.
not_available Liar! Don't fucking lie to me.
not_available He thought he was such a genius, everybody thought.
not_available He even had Brenda fooled, which blows my mind.
not_available Well, okay, she was young.
not_available Are you talking about Dr.
not_available Feinberg? 
not_available No, Trevor, you fucking moron.
not_available Trevor.
not_available Perfect fucking Trevor.
not_available He thought he was the king of Brenda, which is such adolescent shit as if you could know somebody for a few months and replace their whole life.
not_available Their family.
not_available Brenda's not allowed to love anyone as much as she loves you? Able.
not_available She's not able.
not_available You know what? You're right.
not_available Bren never even told me about Trevor.
not_available She doesn't trust me.
not_available You don't get to call her that.
not_available You call her Brenda.
not_available You know, she broke up with me today.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Took away my key.
not_available Well, it's probably for the best.
not_available You and Brenda was never a good idea.
not_available Yeah, tell me about it.
not_available Listen, I gotta go, so you take care.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Ready to go? 
not_available Yeah, just give me a second to recover.
not_available Still bad, huh? It's just fucking tiring trying to act normal all day.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available So, what's the stupidest thing anyone's said to you today? Packy Walker told me that he once had to get his stomach pumped because he ate his dog's deworming pills.
not_available He thought they were ludes.
not_available Well, isn't it comforting to know that being miserable is still better than being an idiot? All right.
not_available You wanna hear the most horrible moment from my intimate past? No, sister, I do not.
not_available I was married to my husband for 30 years.
not_available I never slept with another man until I started having sex with my hairdresser.
not_available And the first time my hairdresser friend and I had intercourse he asked me to pleasure myself, so he would know you know, how I did that.
not_available And I couldn't.
not_available Because I had never pleasured myself in my life.
not_available I was 52 years old.
not_available And I had to learn how to Masturbate.
not_available From a hairdresser.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Well, Ruth, thank you for sharing that.
not_available But I'm still not gonna tell you about coming out to my parents.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because I never did, cupcake.
not_available My daddy would've never spoken another word to me and my mother would've just gone insane, right there on the spot.
not_available How do you know? A child knows what his parents need him to be.
not_available My mother is one of those women that never did anything but raise children.
not_available So, if you came out wrong, like the opposite of what she was trying to make you into, then, you know her whole life is a failure.
not_available I'm not like that.
not_available Did he ever actually threaten you? Telling the new boyfriend you wanted the old boyfriend dead while you're playing with a knife.
not_available Yeah, that seems like a threat to me.
not_available How come you never told me about Trevor? It's such ancient history.
not_available You said you'd never been serious about anyone.
not_available I was 18.
not_available Did you love him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So, what happened? Billy got sick.
not_available Trevor went to Yale without me.
not_available Billy got rid of him because he was jealous.
not_available Everyone was jealous of Trevor.
not_available He was ridiculously gifted one of those people everybody secretly hates because he's good at everything and always gets what he wants.
not_available Well, he didn't get you.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available He could do better.
not_available He did, actually.
not_available The woman he married won the National Book Award last year.
not_available You know, you're ridiculously gifted too.
not_available You could be one of those people who has everything.
not_available If you don't wanna deal with this, I might have to wanna call your parents.
not_available Well, you might have to wanna call my parents but unfortunately, they're in South Africa at the moment.
not_available I have absolutely no idea how to contact them.
not_available Would you stop fucking around? I love you, and I'm sure whatever you feel about me you don't wanna see me dead.
not_available Are you okay? No.
not_available Do you want me to take you to a doctor? What, now you think I'm crazy too? No, no.
not_available Goddamn it, why are you shutting me out? I just wanna be alone, okay? I just wanna go to sleep.
not_available Well, good night.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about your relationship with Gabriel Dimas? I guess I just wasn't in the mood for a lecture on inappropriate friends.
not_available What makes you think I'd do that? Well, some people don't think he's the greatest influence.
not_available And what do you think? I think that I'm as much of an influence on him as he is on me so it's not like it only goes one way.
not_available Right.
not_available Relating to another person is a way that we relate to a part of ourselves.
not_available It's like, he's, like, an extreme version of me, you know? I can see that.
not_available But what he's going through, it's so much more.
not_available But I understand, you know? Feeling like you've got this shadow over you all the time.
not_available What's your shadow? Death, I guess.
not_available Death and silence.
not_available Is that crazy? What's the silence? I don't know.
not_available It's, like, sadness or fear, maybe.
not_available It's, like, you know, everybody's so scared that they're gonna say the wrong thing because, like, you know, when you bury someone that's, like, the most sensitive time in a person's life.
not_available So it's, like, my family, they're just so careful.
not_available It's like they almost become invisible.
not_available That was heavy.
not_available What's going on? Nothing.
not_available I'm just being a freak.
not_available You don't have to be afraid that you'll say the wrong thing.
not_available That's just it.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I mean, I do say the wrong thing.
not_available But, it's, like, this is gonna sound stupid but, like, I talk so much shit all the time, you know.
not_available And that's just another way to not say Whatever.
not_available To not say what? I'm not here for the school or for your mom.
not_available I'm just here for you.
not_available This is confidential, right? Gabe didn't OD by accident.
not_available He did it on purpose, I think.
not_available Well, most ODs aren't really just accidents.
not_available Right, so, what can I do as the friend of a person who would do something like that? Like, I know all the "I can't save him" stuff, and I went to the websites.
not_available And it's all, like, what you can't do.
not_available So, what can I do? Try not to make yourself invisible.
not_available This isn't about me.
not_available That's not a very good start, is it? At least my tie can be straight, right? You should've left me the way I was.
not_available Let the world see me for who I really am an abomination of nature.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Who you are is nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available That's a little hard to buy, coming from somebody who cruises for dick on the Internet and has unsafe sex with prostitutes.
not_available They made a shrine at the place where you died with pictures of you and flowers.
not_available People go there and hold candles in your honor.
not_available What people? 
not_available Your friends, your community.
not_available Bleeding
not_available heart faggots with nothing better to do.
not_available Guys who fucked me when they were drunk and then never called me back.
not_available There are people who love you.
not_available But not as many as hate me and you.
not_available Nice job.
not_available Man, that is the best work you've ever done, David.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Nice, very nice.
not_available Hey, there's, like, 200 homos outside.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Already? It's only a quarter of.
not_available You'd think the family wouldn't want all of that coming in here, you know? All of what? There's this one guy, he's dressed like Jackie Kennedy.
not_available You think this guy's mother really needs to see that today? How'd you get those abrasions on his cheek so smooth
not_available looking? I used diaper rash cream.
not_available You left some.
not_available You know, Rico, I'm a homo.
not_available I may not dress like Jackie Kennedy, but I have sex with men.
not_available Don't Don't talk to me about that.
not_available All right? Why should I hide it from you? You change your baby's diaper in my house.
not_available You show me a videotape of your wife giving birth.
not_available Where I come from if men need to do that sometimes they don't talk about it.
not_available They don't leave their families.
not_available They're men.
not_available I am a man! So I took the height of tree A and divided it by the length of shadow B.
not_available So do you see how I got to tangent C? Since when were you such a trig bitch? Don't get me wrong.
not_available I know it's totally pointless.
not_available Just somehow, teaching you makes it seem more interesting.
not_available It must be the power.
not_available Well, you are a very stimulating teacher.
not_available I love your grasp of the material.
not_available Well, maybe we should grasp the next one.
not_available Which one? Number five.
not_available Come on.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Oh, nothing.
not_available Allergies.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available I'm scared.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm scared too.
not_available I'm scared you're gonna disappear.
not_available I'm not gonna disappear.
not_available What are you scared of? I'm scared I'm not gonna finish my math homework.
not_available Hey, I told you.
not_available I'm scared that you are too good for me.
not_available Oh, you're crazy.
not_available I finally find a woman I wanna commit to, and she makes it totally impossible.
not_available You think that's a coincidence? What is that supposed to mean? Maybe if she made it easier, you wouldn't be so eager.
not_available I need more garlic.
not_available You've always been bored with the girls you could have and fascinated with the ones you couldn't.
not_available Yeah, well, whose fault is that? Your brother's gay, isn't he? I think that's a question for him.
not_available Has he told you? No, he has not told me.
not_available But it's obvious.
not_available Everyone knows.
not_available Am I supposed to say something? I tried to discuss it.
not_available He wouldn't let me.
not_available I guess he doesn't wanna talk about it.
not_available It's not good for him to skulk around like that.
not_available He's very tense.
not_available It's not good for him.
not_available Breathe, Mom.
not_available I know how to breathe! I don't appreciate you blaming me for all your problems, thank you very much.
not_available Your carrots are burning.
not_available Haven 't you seen a little girl called Bunny? About your age, No, A new girl, 
not_available No, With a dress, just like yours, Look, there's no point in questioning the children, What are you doing here? I know what to do.
not_available I know how to fix it.
not_available Yeah? Fix what? Oh, it was a big mistake.
not_available But I'm gonna fix it, okay? Oh, my God, Billy, what have you? Did you hurt him? 
not_available No, no, no, I fixed it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available See, I can't be him anymore.
not_available He's somebody else now.
not_available I did it for you.
not_available Now we can bury him.
not_available And the best part is now the nurse won't ever be able to find him.
not_available You've lost a lot of blood.
not_available Let me get a towel.
not_available We just have to get yours now.
not_available This way, you'll be safe from her too for the first time.
not_available Then we can bury them, and you and I can be new people.
not_available And we can forget about everything bad that they wrote.
not_available I don't want us to be new people.
not_available I like us the way we are.
not_available Well, I already did it, Brenda, so you have to do it too.
not_available Okay.
not_available Give me the knife.
not_available I wanna do it.

not_available Lf that's what you want.
not_available That's not what I want.
not_available Are you sure? Yes.
not_available I'm sorry for how I was with you when we were together.
not_available I don't know why it's so hard for me.
not_available It's hard for all of us.
not_available But you know that you're right, that you're a good man.
not_available For me it's like I agree with them, you know? Like it is my fault, and I should be able to fix it.
not_available There's nothing to fix.
not_available But it's not who I wanna be.
not_available I wanna be the guy at church with the kid on his knee.
not_available You can have a kid on your knee, David.

not_available I feel like my father would hate me if he knew.

not_available And he never said anything.

not_available Mom? Are you okay? I have a terrible headache.

not_available Why didn't you ever tell me? 
not_available I am telling you.
not_available Before, before.
not_available Don't you trust me? 
not_available What do you mean? I'm telling you.
not_available But I've tried to discuss it with you several times.
not_available Look, I just wasn't comfortable, okay? What does it matter now? Why not? When I was clearly trying to be open? 
not_available You know, Mom you may be trying to be open now and that's great.
not_available But that's not how you've been for all my life.
not_available You and dad, no one talked about anything.
not_available None of us are like that, except Nate and that's just because he has no other way to distinguish himself.
not_available I've always loved you.
not_available I know you love the part of me that's your son.
not_available What part of you isn't my son? You're all my son.
not_available I don't think you know me very well.
not_available Well, whose fault is that? I'm sorry.
not_available And, you know, when you've tried to bring it up before or now even it's like you've decided you should know who I am.
not_available You're willing to see me how you look at something horrible like a corpse, because it's your job, your duty.
not_available It revolts you, but you make yourself bear it.
not_available Well, you're wrong.
not_available You don't revolt me! I don't choose which part of you I love, like some kind of chicken! It was just so much easier when you were little and you would tell me everything.
not_available And when you were upset, I could always fix it.
not_available I don't know how to take care of you anymore.
not_available Just let me Just let me take care of myself.
not_available But do you? I'm afraid that you don't.

not_available We're having veal.
not_available Well, Mommy still loves you.
not_available Does that make everything better? 
not_available Yeah, I didn't think it would.
not_available What are you still doing here? I could've come out to every mother in the world, and I'd still be dead.
not_available Oh, what, you're gonna interrupt him and his matching love stud? Both of them will be in hell with us, by the way.
not_available But something tells me they're gonna have a lot more fun.
