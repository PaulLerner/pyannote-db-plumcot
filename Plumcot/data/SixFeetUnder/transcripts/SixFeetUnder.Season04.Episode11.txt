
not_available Why is it always up to me, Cindy? I end up doing everything.
not_available I'll bring the food, but I think Ann should bring the drinks.
not_available What's their address again? 
not_available On Orange, just off Crescent.
not_available She brought one lousy pizza for the whole team to the last game.
not_available I need the exact address.
not_available I know how to get there.
not_available I want to use the GPS.
not_available You're dead! What game are you playing? 
not_available Mortal Kombat.
not_available Is that violent? 
not_available It's not violent.
not_available Where did you get that game? I need a new DVD! 
not_available Just use that one again.
not_available I need the exact address.
not_available It's Bobby's.
not_available Cindy says no way is Bobby allowed to play that game.
not_available She wants to know where he got it.
not_available We just passed Crescent.
not_available I want a new DVD.
not_available Turn left on Crescent.
not_available Which way? I need the address.
not_available I'm waiting.
not_available Just a second, honey.
not_available Just give her one.
not_available Go left! 
not_available Here? You have quite an extensive personal collection as well.
not_available There's something weird about twins.
not_available About these twins, anyway.
not_available They're cute.
not_available They always smell like bananas.
not_available You just don't think any kid's as good as Maya.
not_available Well, they're not.
not_available 'Cause you're perfect, aren't you? Why yes.
not_available We could have a pretty great kid.
not_available What time are they coming down? Tomorrow afternoon sometime.
not_available Are we supposed to cook for them? Because I really don't feel like making dinner for someone who hates me.
not_available Barb doesn't hate you.
not_available She was just surprised to see you.
not_available Okay, maybe you're not her favorite person, but this is a chance for her to get to know you.
not_available Sure you don't want me to hide in the garage? 
not_available I can curl up real small.
not_available Bren.
not_available So about that thing I just said, that thing that you completely ignored? I heard you.
not_available We could have a great kid.
not_available So 
not_available So, it's something to think about.
not_available To think about.
not_available Yeah, I already had a kid without thinking about it, and I don't want to do that again.
not_available So when were you thinking about thinking about it? Because I'm thinking sooner rather than later.
not_available What's the rush? Well, um I'm kind of at an age where I can't commit to a relationship that doesn't have the possibility of having a child.
not_available So look, if you're saying no I'm not saying no, I just It's overwhelming just dealing with one child and all this, kind of new.
not_available You know, it takes a couple our age on average like a year to get pregnant.
not_available So even if we started trying now we might not have a baby for two years.
not_available I'm not saying no.
not_available I promise.
not_available Okay.
not_available You got groceries? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Chandler walnuts from the farmers' market.
not_available All of that is walnuts? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available What are you going to do with them? We're going to eat them.
not_available Some of them we can process into walnut butter, but mostly we'll eat them.
not_available They're full of protein and omega
not_available 3s.
not_available Oh.
not_available I got the brochure from the Loving Couples Center.
not_available What's that? 
not_available The retreat Kyle and Becky went on.
not_available It's quite a list of weekend workshops that they offer.
not_available They sent a videotape as well.
not_available "Intimacy and Healing," "Finding the New in Your Partner," and "Tantric Love," which you seem to have circled.
not_available Hoping to add some spice to our sex life? It's becoming very popular.
not_available Woody Harrelson, Jill Eikenberry and Sting are all practitioners.
not_available I mean, not with each other, but you know Ruth, if this is something you'd like to do, I'd be more than happy to go.
not_available Really? I'm so pleased.
not_available I'll fill out the application.
not_available Oh, I was wondering.
not_available Where do you keep your extra water? There's a pitcher in the refrigerator.
not_available No, I mean for earthquakes and other emergencies.
not_available You should always have some extra water on hand, flashlights, batteries, some canned food.
not_available Do you know something? Is there going to be an earthquake? Is that why you got the walnuts? No, I got the walnuts because I like walnuts.
not_available And yes, there most certainly is going to be an earthquake.
not_available We can't pinpoint exactly when, but could be tomorrow, could be 100 years from now.
not_available Oh, you had me concerned.
not_available Well, you should be concerned.
not_available We should all be concerned and prepared, if not for an earthquake then a terrorist attack, or a catastrophic drought, or who knows what else? George, lately it seems if it's not one thing with you, it's another.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Wow.
not_available Wow, these are amazing.
not_available Really.
not_available Amazing, Claire.
not_available Yeah, they're so cool.
not_available They remind me of that guy what's his name? The guy who does people in swimming pools.
not_available David Hockney.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And he did this one thing of photographs like of the desert 
not_available "Pearblossom Highway." Yeah, that.
not_available But it's like you took it You made it personal.
not_available You know, Jean Baudrillard once said every possible art form has already been explored and all that's left is to deconstruct and play with the pieces.
not_available That's literally what you did.
not_available Explain the process.
not_available Well, I'd take a whole bunch of closeups of someone, like every inch of their face, and then print those actual size, and photocopy them, and then papier
not_available mâché pieces over the person's face and make an actual mask.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Then when that dried I had them put the mask back on and then I would take a portrait in a setting that hopefully reveals something new about the person.
not_available Yeah, there's so much depth to them.
not_available Exactly, they're like sculpture.
not_available Is that what you were thinking? I don't know.
not_available I guess I was thinking more emotionally, like how many layers there are to a person, and how we all wear masks, even if that mask is our own skin.
not_available But I think it was my background in sculpture that really allowed us to make that leap.
not_available You know, when I first put the pictures of Claire's open eyes over her closed eyes, I was thinking of her as sculpture.
not_available So you helped her with these? In terms of creating the original concept, yeah.
not_available We worked together.
not_available I mean, she's a photographer.
not_available I'm a sculptor, and somehow we combined those two elements and created something new.
not_available I think they turned out great.
not_available You look just like your mother.
not_available Yeah, that's what everyone says or said.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Such a tragedy.
not_available I still can't even quite It's just too much.
not_available Does your family have a burial plot? I don't know, I doubt it.
not_available Cremation is a popular option.
not_available Yeah, do that, but then buried.
not_available I want them somewhere all together, 
not_available where I can go see them.
not_available We can arrange that.
not_available Have you thought about what kind of service you want? I don't even know what kind of services there are.
not_available Just a regular one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did your family have a lot of friends? They had friends, but I don't know who all of them are.
not_available Okay, well, we can post a notice in the paper.
not_available We're also happy to make any calls.
not_available Do you have any other family? I don't think you should be dealing with this alone.
not_available One grandmother left, but she's in a home.
not_available And an aunt and an uncle in Florida, but I don't really know them.
not_available So it's just me.
not_available My whole family Basically, what we're looking at here is battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pasquese suffered a torn earlobe, inflicting acute pain and requiring meticulous surgical resculpturing.
not_available The pain's rendered him unable to work and he's had to drop out as producer of a major motion picture.
not_available What?! 
not_available Additionally, his irreplaceable earring was lost during the course of the attack.
not_available It was just a little hoop! Who wears earrings now anyway? Mr.
not_available Pasquese has also suffered recurrent nightmares and has been unable to enter a sushi establishment, greatly lessening his enjoyment of life.
not_available For these reasons we are asking for restitution of $500,000.
not_available Are you out of your fucking mind?! We'll leave you to consider the details.
not_available If they're not to your liking, we'll institute a civil case and consider pressing criminal charges.
not_available Oh my God! This is ridiculous.
not_available She can't possibly be serious, can she? How strong is his case? 
not_available Did you bite his ear, Mr.
not_available Fisher? 
not_available Well, yes! Well, then his case is quite good.
not_available But what am I supposed to do? I don't have that kind of money.
not_available Can't we do a temporary insanity plea or whatever? I mean, his therapist thinks he's suffering from post
not_available traumatic stress disorder.
not_available In the event that this case goes to trial, that's a possibility.
not_available But do you really want this to go to trial? Because that's when things become very expensive.
not_available I like this restaurant.
not_available How'd you hear about it? Joe.
not_available Oh, have you been speaking to him lately? No, he hasn't called and I feel too guilty to call him.
not_available I think he feels like I betrayed him and I never took him seriously.
not_available Well, you certainly did betray him.
not_available Well, yeah, Mom, I know that, thank you.
not_available Come on, darling.
not_available I'm not judging you.
not_available I've done far worse.
not_available The thing is, is that I did take him seriously.
not_available I really believed that I was going to settle down and have his baby.
not_available I never thought that I could have that with Nate.
not_available That he would forgive me and want to take me back.
not_available Well, I think Nate's been going through some life
not_available changing experiences himself.
not_available Oh, he's still going through them.
not_available I think I understand his relationship with Lisa better now how you can settle for someone who's just not the person you should be with.
not_available You know, you and Nate sound like me and Bern, the way we knew each other.
not_available I mean, we understood each we understood each other like nobody else could.
not_available God help you.
not_available Oh.
not_available The chicken Caesar salad, please.
not_available Mom? I'm going to have the Porterhouse steak, medium rare.
not_available You're having steak for lunch? Yeah, I'm just feeling a little anemic lately.
not_available Yeah, you do look a little pale.
not_available No, I think I'll go to the bathroom.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Hi, my name is Albert Gross.
not_available I was wondering if you might have a moment to discuss your eternal happiness.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Through a global preaching campaign, God is making known the good news about His kingdom governed by Jesus Christ.
not_available Those who respond are gathering into a place of spiritual protection and healing.
not_available Soon we'll experience freedom from all injustice and suffering.
not_available Seems to me like just the opposite is happening.
not_available That's because human government is 
not_available still under the control of Satan.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available The perfect government is in heaven.
not_available From there the King Jesus Christ will rule all the earth.
not_available So how do you think King Jesus plans to address the everwidening holes in the ozone layer, hmm? Or the missing stockpiles of weapons
not_available grade plutonium? Well, I think that God will solve all of mankind's problems in His own way.
not_available Albert, look, this is an enormously complex world we live in, and its problems are multiplying every day.
not_available Now, we're not going to solve those problems by going door to door and asking people to get down on their knees and pray to the sky! Shouldn't a bright young man like you be doing something constructive? I'm going to write down a couple of websites for you to check out that will hopefully enlighten you a little bit.
not_available Excuse me, are you Brenda Chenowith? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Your mom needs you in the ladies' room.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Mom? I'm in here.
not_available Do you have any pads? No, why do you need a pad? Don't tell me you had that vagina surgery.
not_available No, I just went in for a consultation.
not_available Listen, I've been bleeding a lot lately.
not_available Oh God, Mom! It won't stop.
not_available It just won't stop.
not_available I'm calling 911.
not_available Don't worry, Mom.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available # She says, "Wake up" # Claire, it's me Mom.
not_available # I'll keep stealing, breathing her # I have your laundry.
not_available Oh, you didn't have to do that.
not_available But it gives me an excuse to come up and visit.
not_available Well, you can come up anytime you want.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There's no one in the house anymore.
not_available It's so quiet.
not_available I know that smell.
not_available # Naked as we came # # One will spread our # Is this marijuana? # Ashes round the yard # 
not_available Uh, yeah.
not_available Oh.
not_available I used to smell it on Nathaniel every once in a while.
not_available I always thought it was some sort of embalming chemical.
not_available He never gave it to you, did he? No.
not_available Oh, God, no.
not_available I discovered it on my own.
not_available How funny that Nathaniel would keep it a secret.
not_available Do you smoke it a lot? 
not_available Not too much.
not_available That's good.
not_available I read somewhere that you should treat it as a spice just a little pinch here and there.
not_available Okay.
not_available How striking.
not_available You used to make collages as a little girl.
not_available I did? You were always tearing up my magazines before I could read them.
not_available Oh wow I mean, sorry.
not_available Well back to my quiet house, I suppose.
not_available Well, you got George in there.
not_available He's not much of a noise
not_available maker.
not_available Hey, are things okay? Oh yes, definitely better.
not_available I can see he's trying, and so am I.
not_available He's a good man, he just needs to let me in a little.
not_available I still want to grow old with him.
not_available I mean, I'm almost there already.
not_available Oh, please, you have a long way to go.
not_available He agreed to go to a Loving Couples workshop with me.
not_available Really? That's cool.
not_available On tantric love.
not_available Mom! I know! Don't tell the boys.
not_available Hey, guys! How was the movie? Augusto was scared.
not_available You took them to see a scary movie? 
not_available No, it was a cartoon.
not_available They're too young to see scary movies.
not_available It wasn't scary.
not_available You guys go brush your teeth.
not_available Get ready for bed.
not_available So, Julio tells me that what's her name? Kenny's sister, Julie, has been watching them.
not_available Isn't she some kind of druggie? Oh, please, she smoked a little pot in high school.
not_available We all did.
not_available I didn't.
not_available I know, Rico, 'cause you were boring.
not_available It's just weird that Kenny's whole family is moving in here.
not_available You're so ridiculous.
not_available I'm a single parent.
not_available I need help.
not_available Julie's a good babysitter and she's coming over tomorrow.
not_available You're not a single parent.
not_available I can watch the kids.
not_available I don't want you here all the time.
not_available So I have to keep paying for a babysitter? I work as much as you do.
not_available You're not paying for anything.
not_available Don't we have any rice? How am I supposed to make risotto without any rice? That's what risotto is, it's rice.
not_available So, we'll have pasta.
not_available I don't want fucking pasta! David, calm down.
not_available Don't tell me to calm down.
not_available We're going to lose everything.
not_available This lawsuit is going to bankrupt us.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Yes, it is! My liability insurance won't cover any of this.
not_available He's going to sue us and take everything we have, that stupid motherfucker! David, take a deep breath.
not_available Now, hold it in.
not_available Now, slowly let it out.
not_available Do it again.
not_available Feel yourself relax.
not_available Instead of focusing on the negative, think positive thoughts.
not_available Does that include beating the shit out of Roger fucking Pasquese? Look, even if he does sue us, we'll be okay.
not_available He can't take anything of mine 'cause I had nothing to do with this, and legally he has no right.
not_available Maybe this is the upside to us not being able to get married.
not_available He's going to take my part of the funeral home and garnish my wages for the rest of my life.
not_available No, he won't.
not_available Of course he will.
not_available He wants revenge.
not_available You notice he didn't say a word the whole meeting.
not_available I think his lawyer is putting him up to this.
not_available He's probably a reasonable guy.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Maybe we should try talking to him away from his lawyer, see if we can settle this ourselves.
not_available He'll never agree to it.
not_available Well, I'm going to call him tomorrow.
not_available We got nothing to lose.
not_available The Loving Couples Center offers many different workshops.
not_available Whatever your needs, we're sure you'll find one suited to you.
not_available Maybe even more than one.
not_available Let's not be pushy, Bob.
not_available I hope those people aren't going to be there.
not_available I think they're just celebrity spokespeople.
not_available They're celebrities? Who are they? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Mom, can you come downstairs, please? Now? 
not_available Now would be good.
not_available That's a lot of water.
not_available Yes, it's a lot of water.
not_available What is it doing in there? What happened to my cremains urns? 
not_available I put them in the smaller closet.
not_available You did this? I told you I was going to order some extra water.
not_available This is a good deal more than I anticipated.
not_available Well, I thought you understood, Ruth.
not_available This is only the bare minimum of what you would need 
not_available in case of an emergency.
not_available Sorry, but we can't keep it in here.
not_available Well, I can't just put it out in the driveway.
not_available Maybe one of the spare bedrooms.
not_available Fine, just get it out of here.
not_available Or maybe that old bomb shelter would be better.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You have a bomb shelter? Oh, Brenda! Bren, stop! I'm just trying to make you more comfortable.
not_available Well, then get me some more Vicodin! 
not_available You just had some.
not_available I tell you what I need, and you say no.
not_available Mom, could you try to just be a little bit more reasonable? No, don't be reasonable.
not_available Be as mean as you want.
not_available Let it all out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's exactly what I'm going to be a nasty old crone, now that I'm no longer a woman.
not_available Mom, this doesn't make you any less of a woman.
not_available Oh really? Then give me your uterus.
not_available Hey
not_available hey.
not_available Maybe I should come back? Of course not, have a seat.
not_available Yeah, stay.
not_available Mom, I brought you your favorite flowers, as did Brenda.
not_available Flowers are for pretty girls, not someone like me.
not_available She's not a woman anymore.
not_available Come on, you're still young and beautiful.
not_available Of course they're going to say nice things to you.
not_available They're your kids.
not_available But me, I'm a miserable prick who cares nothing about anyone but myself, and I look at you in your hospital bed, tired and worn out from surgery, and I selfishly wonder how long must I wait before I can fuck you.
not_available Wow, finally somebody said something right.
not_available It would have been weird if I'd have said it.
not_available Not in this family.
not_available Darlings, would you please give us a little privacy? Oh God! Mom, you're not going to I just want to be with Olivier for a minute.
not_available Now go.
not_available Go on, go.
not_available Get something to eat.
not_available Look at all the flowers.
not_available Ooh, a plastic monkey.
not_available Look it, it's like a parade float without the parade.
not_available These flowers are amazing.
not_available If they used an actual tiger that would occasionally maim an innocent passerby, then maybe I'd like it.
not_available Isn't it sad though? Nothing we can ever create will be as beautiful as this flower.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Those Lego dinosaurs you made were pretty fucking amazing.
not_available Why are you so above everything? Excuse me, but you can't do that.
not_available It's okay, Dick Cheney is my uncle.
not_available Hey, what's your problem? What's my problem? I can't fucking believe you would try to take credit for my work.
not_available I wasn't taking credit for your work.
not_available I was taking my share of credit for our idea! Oh, please.
not_available Jesus Christ, are you really that insecure you have to take credit for everything? I don't want to have this conversation.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Because you know you're wrong.
not_available You know I tore that photograph and put the pieces on your face.
not_available That was the idea.
not_available That was the fucking idea! I can't believe you would try and take credit for that.
not_available You tore up a picture.
not_available Big fucking deal! I'm the one who told you to photograph it! I'm the one who saw the potential! 
not_available Great.
not_available So if Picasso painted a picture, it would be all right if you took photos of it and then tell everyone it was yours.
not_available I can't believe you would compare yourself to Picasso.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Look, one of the coolest things about this was that we did it together.
not_available I like that, just working with you.
not_available Excuse me, young lady! I need to speak with you.
not_available Run! 
not_available Fuck.
not_available Did you want soup? No, I always have such ridiculously high expectations of hospital soup, and I'm always so very disappointed.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, I should probably You don't have to say anything.
not_available I will though.
not_available I know, but you don't have to.
not_available You think I should tell Mom I slept with Olivier once in college? I kind of wish you hadn't told me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It would be fun to see Mom's reaction.
not_available We are the most sexually inappropriate people in the world, aren't we? Yeah, well, look who our mother is.
not_available I don't think we had a choice.
not_available Yeah, but it's a little bit too easy for me to blame her 
not_available for all my horrible behavior.
not_available Oh no.
not_available If you stop blaming her, I'll have to do the same.
not_available Maybe it's time.
not_available What about Dad, can we blame him? I'm thinking about having kids.
not_available With Nate? Yeah.
not_available You think I'm crazy.
not_available No no, not at all.
not_available I think it's great.
not_available I think you are going to be a great mother.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available Nathaniel's father had it built during the Cuban missile crisis.
not_available His mother used to keep her canned goods in here, but I haven't been down here in ages.
not_available This door is lined with lead.
not_available See, it's just an old 
not_available Not a drop of moisture.
not_available Somebody knew what they were doing.
not_available The boys used to play down here.
not_available And David, when I'd scold him this was his little hideaway place to sit and pout.
not_available It's so dusty.
not_available It smells like 
not_available Life.
not_available It smells like life.
not_available Yes, sir, this'll do just fine.
not_available I always put black actors in my films.
not_available Even if the part doesn't say it's a black guy, I always think, "Why not a black guy?" Hmm.
not_available You ever do any acting? Me? No.
not_available You should.
not_available You got a face like a movie star.
not_available Don't you think he should be in movies? Uh, sure.
not_available I'm pretty happy doing what I'm doing.
not_available Mm, ex
not_available cop who becomes a security specialist, that's a movie right there.
not_available I love cops.
not_available Sorry this'll just take a second.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Check.
not_available Okay, not only is he suing me, now he's hitting on my husband.
not_available I've met so many guys like him with their big black sex cop fantasies.
not_available He hasn't the faintest idea that I'm a real person.
not_available I'm not sure he cares.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available I'll pay this up front.
not_available No, let us get that.
not_available What, you think you can buy me off with a dinner? No, I was just 
not_available It's not personal, you know, David, but you really fucked up, and, well, someone's gonna pay.
not_available Did he just make us an offer? I think he'll drop the lawsuit if I let him blow me.
not_available I think you're right.
not_available Hey, I hate to play the cop, but I'm thinking you've been drinking, and I should drive you home.
not_available Play cop all you want.
not_available It's a Porsche.
not_available Follow us.
not_available You working on a new one of these? Yeah.
not_available I really like making them.
not_available What's the deal between you and Russell? Anita said he was talking about it like it was his idea.
not_available I am so sick of him.
not_available He thinks it was his idea because he was there when we when l you know what? I don't give a shit.
not_available Did he help with any of those photos you gave me? No! He was just the one who tore up the first photo.
not_available So he needs to lay off, then.
not_available Let him do his own thing with them, Jesus.
not_available Everything's derivative of everything.
not_available I just wish he wasn't connected to it in any way.
not_available I showed them to my gallery manager.
not_available Really? He went all crazy over them.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available He said he wanted to meet with you.
not_available Holy fuck! I can't believe you did this for me.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who is it? It's me, Rico.
not_available Hey, Julie.
not_available Wow, I haven't seen you since high school.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are the kids? 
not_available Asleep.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Well, you can go now.
not_available What? I'm here.
not_available You can go now.
not_available Yeah, but Vanessa didn't say you were coming by.
not_available They're my kids too.
not_available Araucanas, you really should get some.
not_available They're beautiful, beautiful chickens.
not_available We got four right now.
not_available There's Petey, Pepe, Polly and 
not_available Pogo.
not_available Pogo.
not_available Well, we don't have room for chickens.
not_available Lisa loved animals.
not_available Did anyone want coffee? 
not_available Sure, I'll have some.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nate, we should probably tell you why we wanted to see you.
not_available It's about Lisa.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Her ashes, how come they weren't, you know, processed? Uh, what do you mean? They were all chunky.
not_available They weren't pulverized.
not_available The funeral director in Cur d'Alene said it was very old
not_available fashioned.
not_available Huh, I'm not aware of that.
not_available That's not something you oversee.
not_available No, no, we have a regular crematorium that we use and I don't know, I mean, sometimes I guess they just rushed the last step.
not_available Then I want their number so I can look into this.
not_available Oh, Barb, please, I'll take care of it.
not_available I'd really like to see it through.
not_available It was suggested that they may not even be Lisa's ashes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, look, I need to tell you guys something, l I gave Lisa what she wanted.
not_available What do you mean? I mean, you know, she didn't want to be cremated, so I I buried her in the desert.
not_available What? I know, I should have told you, but I thought it would be less complicated this way.
not_available So those aren't even Lisa's ashes? 
not_available No.
not_available Whose are they? Somebody's ashes that were never claimed from the '70s.
not_available Sometimes people don't pick them up.
not_available So, in Lisa's vault, with her name on it, where my parents go to visit her and pray, are some complete stranger's ashes? Look, I wanted to honor her 
not_available And where is Lisa? The desert, what desert? The Mojave.
not_available You dumped her by the side of the road somewhere?! No, of course not.
not_available I buried her.
not_available It's really beautiful where I buried her.
not_available There's a tree and Was it off the 62 towards Joshua Tree? No, I drove out toward Palm Springs Is there a marker? How do I go see her? You see any Joshua trees around you? They're these short 
not_available I know what a Joshua tree is.
not_available No, there's no marker, per se.
not_available Lisa didn't want to have a I'm sorry.
not_available As you can imagine, I was a little out of it.
not_available It sounds like you were completely out of it.
not_available What you did is probably illegal, Nate, and it really pisses me off that you lied to us.
not_available Look, I gave her what she wanted, okay?! I thought that's what you wanted too! No, what I want is for Lisa to still be alive, and not have her daughter be raised by a woman that she hated! Barb! 
not_available This is fucked up! You completely erased her off the face of the earth, like she never even existed.
not_available This raises a lot of questions, Nate.
not_available What questions?! 
not_available This is crazy! I can't talk about this anymore.
not_available Come on, Hoyt, we're leaving.
not_available It raises a lot of questions, Nate.
not_available So, you gonna drop the charges? Yeah, forget it.
not_available I'll call the lawyer in the morning.
not_available But get your boyfriend some Prozac or a muzzle or something.
not_available He just went through a really awful experience and is having problems dealing with it is all.
not_available Yeah? How about you? Me? I'm trying to be there for him, you know? Be strong.
not_available Doesn't that get a little old? No.
not_available Well, sometimes it's kind of Tell me.
not_available I understand, he went through something really traumatic.
not_available I'm completely empathetic, but sometimes I do get tired of hearing about it.
not_available You're not his mother.
not_available I wish he would figure out a way to deal with it rather than have these episodes.
not_available Well, at least I finally got him into therapy.
not_available That's a lot for you to handle.
not_available You must be real tense, a little angry.
not_available Exhausted.
not_available It's like living with an invalid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know, if you ever need anyone to unload on Thanks, I'll deal with it my own way.
not_available Really, though, anytime you need to let off a little steam I'm thinking this is the last time we see each other.
not_available Yeah, I figured.
not_available You better go find your boyfriend before he bites my cat or something.
not_available How was it? I need to get home and shower.
not_available Hello? Yeah, Julie called and she said you sent her home.
not_available I'm tired of my kids being left with some babysitter every single night of the week while you go out with Kenny fucking Sims.
not_available It's none of your goddamned business what I do.
not_available And I have a right to see my kids whenever I want.
not_available Oh, you got the right? You can stay with them all night, 'cause I'm not coming home.
not_available It's called a subscription.
not_available Look, it's what she wanted, all right? I understand, it was obviously a highly meaningful thing for you.
not_available I'm just I'm disappointed that you didn't feel that you could share something that meaningful with me.
not_available Okay, one, I'm not your patient 
not_available Oh, nice.
not_available so stop talking to me like I am 
not_available That's very constructive.
not_available and two, what I did was between Lisa and me.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm just upset.
not_available Yeah, well, it really sucks that you keep things from me.
not_available Uh
not_available huh, okay.
not_available Why don't you just tell me, okay? Tell me when you're ready to let me in and make me part of your fucking life.
not_available Oh God.
not_available You guys have your lunches? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I made your peanut butter and jelly.
not_available I know you like it.
not_available I made it really good, too, with extra peanut butter.
not_available Hi, Mommy! 
not_available Hi! Hi! Are you guys all ready for school? Okay, Julio, go put your brother in the car, okay? And buckle him up in his baby seat.
not_available Bye! 
not_available Bye.
not_available So, did you have a good night? Very nice.
not_available It's nice to be with a man who knows how to treat a lady.
not_available Really? So what did you guys do? 
not_available You know charity work.
not_available I've had enough of this.
not_available I'm coming home.
not_available I am coming home.
not_available If you ever step foot in this house again without my permission 
not_available I'm calling the cops.
not_available The cops won't do anything.
not_available This is still my house, and you have no right to keep me out.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'm still calling them, and I'll let you explain that to them.
not_available Nate.
not_available Barb.
not_available Hoyt and I have been talking.
not_available We're really upset about this.
not_available I don't want Maya growing up in this house.
not_available What? 
not_available We don't want her in a place where Lisa isn't honored.
not_available Look, Barb, I know this is really weird for you I don't want to hear a word from you! I know all about you! Hey, you're completely out of line.
not_available We want Maya to come live with us.
not_available Yeah, well, no fucking way! Maybe just part time 
not_available Are you people crazy? No, but apparently you are.
not_available The last time I came here you said some psychic told you Lisa was still alive You know what? I was still in shock, I think, okay? Anyway, I was high.
not_available Look, you know what you did with Lisa was wrong, and I hate to contact our lawyer My God, what are you saying? but if that's what it takes Get the hell out of here! Get the fuck off my property! 
not_available Calm down now.
not_available We're trying to do what's best for Maya.
not_available You don't care about Maya.
not_available Now, get the fuck out of here! You're not going to get away with this, Nate! You're not! Hey Don't you worry, baby.
not_available Don't you worry, nobody's going to take you away.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available There's no way.
not_available I know this is scary It's not like enough bad shit hasn't happened to me already.
not_available She has absolutely no legal right.
not_available I mean, who the hell am I, Job? There is no way that she can take Maya.
not_available I'm not taking her to day care.
not_available Leave her with me.
not_available I have one class this morning, I can skip it.
not_available Please please, I don't want to let her go.
not_available Hey, just come inside for a while.
not_available Everything will be okay.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Just come in for a minute.
not_available Beautiful, Claire.
not_available Complex alluring and they're fucking creepy.
not_available I love 'em.
not_available How did you come up with the concept? It's something I've done ever since I was a kid, tearing things up.
not_available A genius from birth.
not_available Well I have a new show in a couple of weeks.
not_available Let's put 'em in.
not_available Really? All of them? Oh fuck, yes, all of them.
not_available That's great! Shit.
not_available It's kind of hard to know what to say.
not_available My family is gone and no one can ever replace them.
not_available But this is what life is, right? Pain.
not_available Pain followed by more pain.
not_available Everything you have can be taken away, and it will be, you know that.
not_available Lisa was just the beginning.
not_available You're crazy to even think of having another baby, because I promise you, from now on only bad things will happen to you.
not_available Have you seen George? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't seem to find him anywhere.
not_available They were so much a part of me that I never imagined life without them.
not_available But as deeply sad as I am that they're gone George? 
not_available I'm down here! Oh my.
not_available The extension cord is only temporary, of course.
not_available We're going to need at least a 5,000
not_available watt generator.
not_available I just got a call that there's been a cancelation in the tantric loving workshop.
not_available They can fit us in this weekend if we'd like.
not_available This weekend? 
not_available Yes, this weekend.
not_available Oh, I don't think so.
not_available I've got this guy coming over first thing Saturday morning who's going to give me some advice on the air filtration system.
not_available Well, how long is that going to take? Oh Jeez, I'm not sure.
not_available It's not the sort of thing you want to rush now, is it? I don't know.
not_available I was thinking hammocks against this wall.
not_available How does that sound? What's with the baby monitor? I feel safer knowing what's going on in there.
not_available I don't trust Barb.
not_available Oh come on, you don't think she'd I didn't think she'd do anything weird or crazy, but she already has.
not_available I think Barb is still trying to deal with Lisa's death, and it's driving her a little wacko is all.
not_available You can relate.
not_available I don't care what she's going through.
not_available She's never seeing Maya again.
not_available I'm sure this will all blow over.
not_available Just let her work through it.
not_available Well, when someone threatens my family, they don't get to work through anything.
not_available Your family is going to be fine.
not_available I promise.
not_available And I'm sorry, but this is definitely not a good time for us to have a baby, so I'm just saying.
not_available I'm sorry, but we've got to focus on Maya right now, just Maya.
not_available Oh man, what a day.
not_available Would you believe I spent the last six hours standing outside this Japanese businessman's hotel room, and then found out he wasn't even in there.
not_available Did you make anything for dinner? I'm starving.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I'm going to fucking kill him.
not_available He promised he'd drop the lawsuit.
not_available It's not that.
not_available Then what is it? The police called.
not_available They arrested someone whose fingerprints match the ones taken off the van.
not_available I have to go in and identify him.
