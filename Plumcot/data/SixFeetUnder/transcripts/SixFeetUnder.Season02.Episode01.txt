
not_available Tad? Is that you? You're early.
not_available Time to kiss your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.
not_available Seriously, several people told me that my scene is really the only one that's even remotely scary.
not_available Becky, you make a major impact in this movie.
not_available Somebody even said that Angelica's scene, it wasn't even scary at all.
not_available Like, it was funny, and not in a good way.
not_available We have to make sure you don't get pigeon
not_available holed now which is why I think you shouldn't show your tits anymore.
not_available What a piece of shit! I know, it makes fucking Blair Witch 2 look like Titanic.
not_available It's just so fucking gratuitous! I think that what makes this movie different is that the violence isn't so gratuitous.
not_available It's more like the whole movie is about the whole psychological nature of fear.
not_available I totally maxed out his Visa card paying for it.
not_available Then somebody in Joe Roth's office saw it and said it was genius.
not_available And now we have three meetings.
not_available Seriously, you could write it.
not_available I've read your poetry and it's really good.
not_available I think I should direct it, too.
not_available Yeah, and we should have this really hot sex scene, all gritty and real.
not_available You know, like, European.
not_available I'm not showing my ass.
not_available My manager says I need to stop showing my ass.
not_available You have a piece of toilet paper stuck to your shoe.
not_available Shut up! Where? 
not_available Honey, it's not working.
not_available What? No, no.
not_available It's not gonna happen for me.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's not gonna happen for me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Don't take it personally.
not_available Don't make this about me.
not_available What? Am I not allowed to not have sex for once? Is that what our relationship is now? Wait a minute.
not_available You woke me up by going down on me.
not_available I don't know what's wrong with me.
not_available Maybe that car accident we had gave me some weird, OliverSacksblowtothe
not_available head disease.
not_available Sorry.
not_available My whole life seems like a bad dream.
not_available It's like somebody else's life.
not_available Like, if my life were a movie, I'd fall asleep or I'd walk out.
not_available You still not seeing any clients? 
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't face it.
not_available You know sometimes you just got to force yourself to be active.
not_available When you're, you know Like what? When you're what? You think I'm depressed? Are you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Doesn't mean I wanna talk about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is my sisterin
not_available law, Angie.
not_available Angelica.
not_available It's nice to meet you.
not_available Likewise.
not_available And this is Brody Farrell.
not_available Are you the next of kin? 
not_available No.
not_available Becky's parents died when she was two.
not_available She was raised by her grandmother, who also died.
not_available She didn't really have anybody, except us.
not_available I see.
not_available Can I ask who will be 
not_available The cast of the movie.
not_available We're all pitching in to pay for it.
not_available We're going to need one person to be designated as the 
not_available Brody will do that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was sort of my girlfriend.
not_available Do you know what kind of service you'd like? Cheap.
not_available We provide a variety of services for the more budget
not_available conscious client.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Just let me turn this off.
not_available Take it.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Please excuse me.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Hi, David.
not_available It's Kevin Miller.
not_available You answered my personal ad in the LA Weekly.
not_available I'm the fireman.
not_available Yes, hi.
not_available Of course.
not_available We can start with the most simple of traditional funerals which would include our American Eagle casket here.
not_available I don't think we should bury her.
not_available Becky was totally terrified of the dark.
not_available We can still have a viewing during which the casket will never be closed, followed by a cremation.
not_available That's good.
not_available And then we could scatter her ashes some place she really liked.
not_available Like Griffith Park, or the Lava Lounge on La Brea.
not_available I mean, I think we can skip the casket.
not_available You sound like a really nice guy, too.
not_available I am a really nice guy.
not_available So, do you want to meet for coffee later this afternoon? This afternoon? Sure.
not_available I have something at 3:00, but I can meet you after that.
not_available Great, let's say at 4.00, at the Up All Night Coffee House.
not_available I'll be wearing a red baseball cap.
not_available Great, I love red.
not_available It's one of my favorite colors 
not_available of which I have several.
not_available Okay, see you then.
not_available This is a beautiful and unusual cremains vessel.
not_available The ashes actually fill these dolphins, which are carved out inside.
not_available She wasn't really into dolphins.
not_available I remember somebody suggesting she boycott tuna because of the whole dolphinsgettingcaughtinthe
not_available net thing.
not_available And she 
said "Fuck dolphins.
not_available I want a Nicoise salad." What are these? 
not_available Those are keepsake miniature urns.
not_available Sort of like lockets, if you will.
not_available So everybody can get a piece of her.
not_available Yes, it's an old custom from Thailand.
not_available Becky loved Thai food.
not_available So what did I miss? I'm sorry I'm late.
not_available Why weren't you at school today? I was in school today.
not_available I just wasn't in American History.
not_available I mean, who needs to know that shit anyways, right? Somebody who wants to have a concept of how the world works so they can have a fucking chance in life.
not_available What crawled up your ass? It's all lies anyways.
not_available Where were you? Andy and I skipped out after lunch.
not_available We went to the car museum.
not_available Did you get high? I'm 18 years old, living in fucking California.
not_available I'm not allowed to get high? I'm worried about you, Gabe.
not_available In case you don't remember, I have good reason to be.
not_available I'm sorry, okay? But you don't have to worry about me, I swear.
not_available Just please don't lie to me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm okay and I'm gonna stay okay as long as I have you.
not_available Let's take a look at your test results.
not_available Well, I have some very good news.
not_available You tested negative for the HIV antibody.
not_available Thank God.
not_available You need to be tested again in six months, just to be safe.
not_available Let's see, negative for chlamydia, all hepatitises, syphilis.
not_available Positive for gonorrhea.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have you had any pain or difficulty urinating? 
not_available No.
not_available Any penile or anal discharge? No.
not_available Gonorrhea can be completely asymptomatic but if it's left untreated, it can lead to severe problems down the line.
not_available I'm gonna give you some Cipro.
not_available It usually knocks it right out.
not_available Well, this is certainly embarrassing.
not_available Did you engage in unprotected sex? Yes.
not_available Bad boy.
not_available How was school? 
not_available Dull and depressing.
not_available What are you reading? Now That You Know.
not_available Now that you know what? That David is gay.
not_available I take it you knew already.
not_available How do you feel about it? Are you hurt? Angry? Do you wish he wasn't gay? 
not_available No.
not_available Those are all valid feelings, you know.
not_available I don't care if he's gay, just as long as he's happy.
not_available According to this book we should all be very open to how we feel and we should try to express those feelings because the foundation of intimacy is truth.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have you ever had any feelings of same
not_available sex attraction? What? No, Mom.
not_available It's nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available I know.
not_available When I was your age I actually had a little crush on Jane Fonda.
not_available She's single again, so now's your chance.
not_available I just never got into that whole promiscuous thing, you know.
not_available First guy I had sex with I ended up in a relationship with for four years.
not_available One
not_available man kind of guy.
not_available Always have been.
not_available What about you? Definitely.
not_available Sex just for the sake of having sex, what is that? Don't get me wrong.
not_available I love sex.
not_available I'm a very sexual being.
not_available I just think it's better when there's something emotional going on behind it.
not_available I credit my parents for that.
not_available My mom and dad have been together for almost 40 years.
not_available They're still hot for each other.
not_available And they've never been anything but 100% supportive of me.
not_available Wow.
not_available I gotta get to work.
not_available Listen, it's been great meeting you.
not_available This was fun.
not_available Would you like to do it again? I don't think so.
not_available You seem like a really nice guy, but I gotta be honest.
not_available I didn't feel much of a spark.
not_available Can't make it happen if it's not there, right? It definitely looks like AVM.
not_available Fuck.
not_available So now what? Well, that depends.
not_available Remind me what your symptoms have been.
not_available Headaches.
not_available All the time? No, just occasionally.
not_available Mostly on the left side of my head.
not_available Any seizures? Impairment of vision? Sense of smell? Once I had a flutter, just on the edge of my vision.
not_available I'm as blind as a bat.
not_available Once I woke up, I could see perfectly out of my left eye.
not_available Lasted for a day and then it went away.
not_available Who knows what the hell that was? So what next? Well, let's see.
not_available It's in a not overly
not_available eloquent brain area.
not_available You lefthanded? 
not_available No.
not_available That's not good.
not_available Why not? And it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.
not_available Yeah, it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.
not_available Okay.
not_available You want options, I'll give you the big 
three Cranial surgery.
not_available Not a picnic.
not_available Embolization.
not_available Closing off the blood vessels by injecting glue into them.
not_available Sometimes we use platinum coils instead.
not_available And finally, radial surgery.
not_available Focused radiation.
not_available Die, you little motherfucker! If I'd never been in a car accident and gotten a routine x
not_available ray of my skull this would've never even come up, right? Until something happened.
not_available It's possible that I could go my entire life without it ever creating a problem.
not_available Anything's possible.
not_available Do you think I need surgery? I can't really say, without more tests.
not_available I think you might benefit from embolization.
not_available However, anytime you close off the large arteries going into an AVM the smaller blood vessels feeding it tend to increase in size.
not_available Okay, so it doesn't really work.
not_available There's only so much we can do.
not_available Oh, God! Fuck! Fine.
not_available You know what? Just don't do anything, okay? I'm going to put this all out of my head, no pun intended, and just get on with life.
not_available I'm not sure I don't give a fuck what you think, you arrogant piece of shit.
not_available Okay, even if we decide not to do anything at this juncture There's no "we." I decide.
not_available I'd still like to get another MRI on you in 12 months.
not_available And I'd like a fucking straight answer, asshole.
not_available It's kind of ironic.
not_available You don't smoke, you run every day, eat all that healthy crap.
not_available Shut up! Now me, I smoked, I drank, I ate any old thing I wanted.
not_available And I inhaled embalming fluid for God knows how long.
not_available You know what? If it wasn't for that bus, I'd have lived to be 93.
not_available It's the first time I've driven since then.
not_available You may want to fasten your seatbelt.
not_available Well, who's the dead man in this car? It's not me! Fuck you! We thank you, Heavenly Father for this and all thy blessings in Christ's name.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available I've invited Nikolai to dinner Sunday night.
not_available I'd like you all to be there.
not_available Nikolai the flower guy? Yes, he and I are having a sexual relationship now.
not_available I'm not sure if it's something that's going to last, but there it is.
not_available We're all adults.
not_available We're all sexual beings.
not_available We should acknowledge that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nate, I'd like you to invite Brenda.
not_available Claire, I'd like you to invite Gabriel Dimas.
not_available And, David, if you have a special friend, I'd like for him to come, as well.
not_available Why is my friend special? All right.
not_available If you're having sex with anyone, I'd like to meet him.
not_available Is that better? Not really.
not_available Stop acting like children! Where are you going? 
not_available I'm just getting an aspirin.
not_available Do you have a headache? No, I read you should take an aspirin a day.
not_available It keeps the blood thin.
not_available Please, if our blood were any thinner, we'd evaporate.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Is that some sort of insult? We're thin
not_available blooded? Mom, no, it was a joke.
not_available I'm more thin
not_available blooded than any of us, probably.
not_available Are you seeing anyone? No.
not_available Why not? Sex is an important and healthy part of life.
not_available It's nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available Yes, I know that.
not_available Unfortunately, I'm not having any right now.
not_available What happened to that cop the black man? He met someone else.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You don't have any free time tomorrow? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I'd really like to see you.
not_available I have three shiatsu appointments.
not_available You're the one that wanted me to get on with my life.
not_available You can still come Sunday night for dinner, right? Even if just for the entertainment value.
not_available It's bound to be a freak fest.
not_available I think so.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I miss you.
not_available You just saw me.
not_available I know, I just would really like to be with you at this moment in time.
not_available Right now.
not_available I'll see you soon.
not_available Sunday, okay? I love you.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Hey, Rico.
not_available Hey, boss man.
not_available I've got a favor to ask you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Could you please drop her off at the crematorium for me tonight? Come on, man.
not_available Vanessa's just a bit overwhelmed at home.
not_available Julio's got a cold and Augusto hasn't slept through the night for a month.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I'm sorry, Rico, but I can't.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you at least help me put her inside the box? Sure.
not_available So, cardboard box? Classy.
not_available She obviously didn't think her life was worth anything, so it makes sense to me.
not_available On three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available It's kind of sad.
not_available It's not.
not_available She threw her fucking life away.
not_available It's not sad.
not_available It's pathetic.
not_available We tend to forget how many gifts God has given each and every one of us because our lives are so filled with distractions crowded with messages competing for our attention encouraging us to be unhappy with our lives.
not_available If only we looked younger had perfect skin zero body fat.
not_available The truth of the matter is God loves us just the way we are.
not_available Some people said, "Congratulations.
not_available You've really shaken things up." Whatever.
not_available Most people in the congregation wouldn't even make eye contact with me after that.
not_available So now I'm back at St.
not_available Stephen's.
not_available So, how are you guys? 
not_available Good.
not_available We're good.
not_available Just got back from a weekend in San Diego.
not_available Spectacular.
not_available We went parasailing.
not_available Keith won't admit it, but he was scared to death.
not_available I was not scared.
not_available Might have had a little rush of adrenaline but that's the point, right? I'll have him hang
not_available gliding by the end of the year, if it kills me.
not_available In your dreams, fool! I am not breaking every bone in my body just to impress you.
not_available Seven years I've been hang
not_available gliding.
not_available I never broke anything.
not_available You're just lucky.
not_available Don't I know it? Ladies and gentlemen, only one of these men will be crowned Mr.
not_available Gay Black America! Did I tell you I'm moving? Where? 
not_available Same building.
not_available A bigger place opened up.
not_available We've been wanting to get a dog.
not_available Great.
not_available Do I seem more tense than usual? You're not supposed to talk, remember? It takes us both out of it.
not_available The only conversation is between your body and my hands.
not_available Correct me if I'm wrong, but we're on my dime here.
not_available I discovered one of the worst things about selling 3 million books is constantly feeling like I have to apologize for it, you know? It's like, "I make a ton of money, so I must be part of the problem." 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, what? You do seem more tense than usual.
not_available I'm not responsible for cancer.
not_available I'm not responsible for world hunger.
not_available What if I'm just happy, and that's my contribution to the world? I'm thinking of pitching a book to my publisher.
not_available Bit of a cultural history, tracing the how, and the why, and when 
not_available it became such a sin to be happy.
not_available Drop.
not_available Who knows, it might help some of those poor sad fucks who are incapable of experiencing joy.
not_available Get out of my house.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Get the fuck out of my house.
not_available What is wrong with you? You don't have any respect for me or what I do.
not_available I'm just another servant who has to listen to your bullshit and pretend like I don't think you're the stupid asshole windbag that you are.
not_available You crazy bitch.
not_available I'm paying you for a shiatsu, and I intend to get a shiatsu.
not_available I don't need your fucking money.
not_available I do not allow people to treat me like this.
not_available Yeah? Well, if you don't get out of my fucking house right now I'll call the LA Times and I'll tell them about the lipo scars on your ass.
not_available Right now.
not_available Get out! So this is where the magic happens.
not_available Yeah, this is it.
not_available What's that smell? It's like Disinfectant, burnt coffee, embalming fluid.
not_available "For the velvety look and feel of actual living tissue." No fucking way! 
not_available You do not even want to know.
not_available They have these plastic screws, only bigger that they stick into people's orifices, so stuff won't spill out.
not_available That's some kind of fucked up.
not_available Welcome to my world.
not_available So this is where my brother was? Jesus, I'm sorry.
not_available I shouldn't have brought you down here.
not_available I'm the one who asked to see it.
not_available What? You're the first guy I've ever brought home to meet my family and I feel weird, you know? I feel nervous.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I will be on my best behavior.
not_available Okay? Come on.
not_available Your mother is a good woman.
not_available Yes, we're aware of that.
not_available David, give him a break.
not_available Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother.
not_available He's been majorly cranky ever since he stopped getting laid.
not_available How old you are? Thirty
not_available one.
not_available Good.
not_available I had a son.
not_available He would be a little bit older than you.
not_available He was a student of medicine.
not_available Look who's here.
not_available Hello.
not_available I've got major cotton mouth.
not_available Who wants to say grace? 
not_available I will say grace.
not_available "The poor shall eat, and be filled.
not_available "And those that seek the Lord shall praise him.
not_available "Their hearts will live forever and ever.
not_available "Glory be to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit "both now and forever "and unto the ages of ages.
not_available "Amen.
not_available "Lord have mercy.
not_available "Lord, bless.
not_available "O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God "for the sake of the prayers of thy most pure mother and all the saints "have mercy on us.
not_available "Amen." Nikolai, you are so beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're such a beautiful person.
not_available There is this total light coming out of you.
not_available That's a very unusual compliment, Nate.
not_available Your brother is high.
not_available I know, look at his eyes.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I am more than all right.
not_available I haven't felt this good in I don't even know how long it's been.
not_available Yes.
not_available You know how long it's been since I've heard you do that? Remember when we were first going out, you used to laugh all the time.
not_available I miss that.
not_available Your laughter's like music.
not_available Nate.
not_available What? You're high.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Am I? Look at the light.
not_available Oh, my God, I am high.
not_available I love the little They're like halos.
not_available What is he high on? I wouldn't know.
not_available I am so not hungry.
not_available I think this went pretty good tonight.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available It was awkward and embarrassing.
not_available What? I mean, my son is high on drugs! What am I supposed to do about that? Should I intervene? Join a support group? He just seems happy.
not_available We're going to the movies.
not_available Good night, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Thank you for dinner.
not_available What movie? We haven't decided yet, but we'll be back late.
not_available Mom, you said yourself, we're all adults.
not_available We'll be back late.
not_available Good night.
not_available It's all about flowing.
not_available It flows up, it flows down.
not_available And then, sometimes, things stop it from flowing.
not_available You stay.
not_available It's like you just move in a little pool.
not_available You're like a little eddy.
not_available And that's what it all comes down to.
not_available Everything in my life, every thing You know, this thing in my head it's all about flow.
not_available Flow? Oh, my God! That was so totally you! That was just so totally David! I love you.
not_available Okay, I'm out of here.
not_available No, you have to take him with you.
not_available Hope I did nothing to fuck you up when we were kids.
not_available Not when he's like this.
not_available Did you know I taught David how to masturbate? No, I didn't, and you know what, Nate? That's fascinating, but I have to go.
not_available No, just wait a second.
not_available I just want to say goodbye.
not_available Come here.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available I love you so fucking much.
not_available You're so fucking high.
not_available But how'd I get that way? You can't just get high out of nowhere.
not_available You have to take drugs.
not_available I didn't take any.
not_available Did you take any aspirin? Yeah.
not_available There may have been a stray tab of Ecstasy in the aspirin bottle in the kitchen cabinet.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available You call me when you crash.
not_available No, call me after you crash.
not_available You know what? Call me next week.
not_available I hope you like her.
not_available It's important to me that you like her.
not_available I do like her.
not_available 'Cause you're the only brother I have.
not_available Time to kiss your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.
not_available Yeah, slice her up! That was hostile.
not_available Isn't that the girl that you guys are burying? 
not_available She's hot.
not_available She's hot and dead.
not_available This calls for someone with experience.
not_available Someone who knows her way around Griffith Park.
not_available That's me.
not_available In the daytime.
not_available You gotta love her.
not_available In fact, if God gave me the ingredients and told me to make a woman I'd make her just like my wife.
not_available They lost no time in tucking into the wonderful meal Boris had prepared.
not_available And then there was a dessert.
not_available I guess Boris knows I always like to have lettuce for dessert, don't you, Boris? I hope the meal was satisfactory.
not_available It was delightful, Boris! You're a wonderful cook.
not_available It was nothing, Martha.
not_available Straight out of the cookbook.
not_available It's yummy, Boris.
not_available I couldn't eat another thing.
not_available Yeah, it's not bad for a first effort.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Buddy boy! Come on, saved a place for you.
not_available Chinese checkers.
not_available I always hated this game.
not_available That's because you never played for money.
not_available Nate, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
not_available Well, honey, this is the man.
not_available Death.
not_available The Grim Reaper.
not_available Cigar? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Good for you, baby.
not_available That stuff is nasty.
not_available And this is 
not_available My partner.
not_available That sounds so professional.
not_available I love it.
not_available Life.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Oh, yeah, it's a whole yin
not_available yang thing.
not_available You telling me you two are in business together? Honey, me and him are in all kinds of shit together! Let's just say it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.
not_available It's your turn.
not_available Shouldn't I wait for you to start a new game? This game ain't never gonna end.
not_available You're either in the game, or you're out of it.
not_available "On or off the bus," if you prefer.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available You gotta put something in the kitty, son.
not_available What are you betting? 
not_available Everything.
not_available All right, I'll bet everything.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'm shaking.
not_available Hey, buddy boy, no.
not_available You don't wanna get this guy mad, believe me.
not_available I don't get mad.
not_available I have people who do it for me.
not_available Showoff! But that always gets me going.
not_available You wanna fuck me, puppet head? Momma! Yeah, baby! That's it.
not_available Go to town, big daddy! Big cosmic mystery.
not_available Right here, right in front of you.
not_available You can't say your old man never took you any place interesting.
not_available Yeah, but I'm high.
not_available I know I'm high.
not_available "All that lives, lives forever.
not_available "Only the shell, the perishable passes away." Fuck, yeah.
not_available "The spirit is without end.
not_available Eternal.
not_available "Deathless." Now take this over here and Look at that, folks.
not_available Look at that for a holiday dinner.
not_available If we had some mint jelly, that would be fabulous.
not_available Unbelievable! 
not_available Smell that.
not_available So all I get to do is smell it? 
not_available Show them.
