
not_available 
not_available I did.
not_available No.
not_available I swear.
not_available I was like majorly, intensely worked up like never before.
not_available Trust me, that's so not it.
not_available Quit looking at me like I'm the new zoo baby.
not_available I did come.
not_available Honey, there's no way.
not_available I was there, remember? There was no funny face, no funny noises.
not_available You didn't melt into a smoking little puddle of Claire yet.
not_available This sucks.
not_available What is wrong with me? Nothing.
not_available We're just getting started.
not_available You wait and see, I'll make you scream.
not_available I hope so.
not_available George, come to church with me.
not_available Agnostics don't usually go to church, Ruth.
not_available That's part of the appeal.
not_available It would make me so happy to be there with you.
not_available Sweetheart, this is my day to catch up.
not_available I've got a million things to do.
not_available It's only an hour.
not_available Then you won't miss me for long.
not_available Morning, all.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I get you anything? How are you? Uh, orange juice.
not_available I'm great.
not_available Well, my stomach is burning a little.
not_available Maybe too much coffee.
not_available Oh, for goodness sake, you need water.
not_available Juice would produce more acid.
not_available No bodies in the prep room.
not_available You think death spared Los Angeles last night? 
not_available Highly doubtful.
not_available Then what are you doing here? I don't know.
not_available I should be here in case we get a walk
not_available in.
not_available Uh, what's going on with you today? I have to work, and your mother's got the spirit.
not_available David, would you like to come to church with me? Yes, I'd like that very much.
not_available I'll be ready in a minute.
not_available Here, drink your water.
not_available Last chance.
not_available Pray for me.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Hello.
not_available Rico.
not_available You were such a lover last night.
not_available So good, mmm.
not_available No, it was it was you.
not_available Wait, what are you doing here? It's late.
not_available You gotta go home.
not_available Coño, man, it's almost 11:00.
not_available Just tell your wife you fell asleep in the car.
not_available She threw me out.
not_available Shut up.
not_available For real? Yeah, for real.
not_available Hmm.
not_available You know, I don't know who else she thinks is out there.
not_available Give up a man like you? She's fucked up.
not_available I don't want to talk about her.
not_available Hey, I could stay here for awhile, right? Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
not_available It's just that this apartment is so small and my cousins, they visit all the time.
not_available They have to sleep over.
not_available Oh.
not_available No problem.
not_available Love your enemy.
not_available Turn the other cheek.
not_available What could be more simple or more difficult? But these are the teachings at the living heart of Christ's message to the world.
not_available When Peter asked Jesus, "Lord, how oft shall I forgive my brother? Seven times?" Seems like a lot, doesn't it? Seven times.
not_available But Jesus said to Peter, "Not seven times, but 70 times seven." Whoa.
not_available Do the math.
not_available You stupid hypocrite! No! How does it feel? So it is our daily mission to find the Christ in ourselves and forgive our enemies.
not_available Heartburn.
not_available It is forgiveness that eases our suffering.
not_available Nice ride.
not_available God damn it.
not_available What? Let's go away for a little while.
not_available Where do you want to go? North? We could leave tomorrow and 
not_available Can't.
not_available I'm scoring the new Jet Li movie tomorrow.
not_available Next couple days, actually, so you're hardly gonna see me.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Afterwards, maybe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cambria, Carmel, Monterey.
not_available Well, that'd work.
not_available If you have no interest in the past and you don't read history, how can you possibly comprehend the present? George, history is not what really happened.
not_available History is some stupid warmongering patriarchal idea of what happened.
not_available Who gives a shit about that? I hope I'm not interrupting.
not_available Anita thinks the study of fossils is futile.
not_available In my humble opinion.
not_available Dave, we're getting a body.
not_available Who? How? What? I think you've forgotten part of your outfit, Anita.
not_available I was gonna wear a tshirt over it, then I was like, "Fuck it." He was sitting in the driveway in this mint '60s Lincoln with a pre
not_available need form from Dad sitting right on top of the dash.
not_available Where is he now? At the coroner's, but he's gonna be back soon.
not_available I thought your day was going to be filled with important activities.
not_available There's always time for healthy debate.
not_available What debate? I'm right, you're wrong, game over.
not_available Rico's gonna work on him.
not_available I'm gonna be there, so you don't have to 
not_available I want to.
not_available I need to do something.
not_available Hey, Mom, can you look after Maya for a little while? 
not_available Okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available But everything we are is built on what went before.
not_available Our foundation is the earth.
not_available California's made of dust.
not_available It's falling into the ocean.
not_available You call that a foundation? Oh, look who's here, Gertrude and Alice.
not_available Well, look at her.
not_available Were we supposed to dress '80s and nobody called? 
not_available Take a break, ladies.
not_available Claire, the coach house would be a better for your girlfriends to gather.
not_available Don't worry, we're leaving.
not_available Come on, Anita.
not_available Keep up, Edie.
not_available The '80s are back.
not_available Pretty funny.
not_available Hilarious.
not_available This is a $1,000 suit.
not_available You think you've seen it all.
not_available Somebody could have set him up in the car and run away.
not_available Or maybe he died in a compromising position.
not_available Like, you know 
not_available He's 80.
not_available It happens.
not_available Rico, I'm telling you this guy drove himself to his own funeral.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available Hey, you, what's up? Oh, nothing, missed you.
not_available We haven't talked since yesterday.
not_available We talked this morning.
not_available We did? Yeah, I called you before I left the hotel.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Right, I spaced.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't sound like yourself.
not_available No, I'm fine, it's just bodies are coming in left and right today.
not_available Nate, Rico, I'll be there in a second.
not_available David, tell me the truth.
not_available That's the only way these long
not_available distance things work.
not_available No, I gotta go.
not_available I'll call you later, or you call me.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Be careful, bye.
not_available He's not fine.
not_available You think? Russell's supposed to be here.
not_available Is he bailing on this? He's asleep.
not_available I fucked him into unconsciousness.
not_available It really costs a lot of money to rent chainsaws, and if we accidentally chop somebody up, they'll totally sue our ass.
not_available I'm not saying to do that exact thing.
not_available We're just trying to brainstorm a dark, edgy like confrontational concept.
not_available Where's yours? I'm sorry, attacking with chainsaws is a total cliché.
not_available Machetes.
not_available Okay, Claire, we stand at the entrance with masks and machetes, like an image of menace.
not_available Machetes have no resonance 
not_available For our culture.
not_available What are you, conjoined twins? Jesus.
not_available You sent the kids to the park with Cassidy? Vanessa, I have a right to see them.
not_available Well, they don't need to be exposed to you with your hoochie mama.
not_available Who knows where she's been? It was never like that.
not_available Why don't you just listen to me? I'll sleep on the couch.
not_available We can talk tonight.
not_available No.
not_available How could you? All that time, come home to us after screwing her.
not_available I never screwed her! Never until last night! Ugh! I mean Your marriage is on the rocks, and that's what you do?! You kicked me out into the street! Yes, I went to her.
not_available Yes, I had sex with her! It's all your fault! 
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Wait wait, I didn't mean You break your vows, you fuck that whore and you blame me? You coward, you bastard! You son of a bitch.
not_available You make me sick.
not_available Papa always said when the time came, he'd put on his best suit and take himself to the funeral home.
not_available That's what he did.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available Not if you knew him.
not_available He was a civil engineer.
not_available Meticulous.
not_available And he never wanted to burden us with anything.
not_available He always did what he said he would do.
not_available You could always trust his word.
not_available The whole community looked up to him.
not_available He was the best father.
not_available A wonderful husband.
not_available Sounds like he was a very fine man.
not_available He was.
not_available He was.
not_available I'm so so sorry.
not_available Thank you for your sympathy, Mr.
not_available Diaz.
not_available I'm really sorry, too.
not_available So we'll see you Tuesday for the service.
not_available He planned all that, as well.
not_available If there's anything else that we can do Keys to the car? Oh, yeah.
not_available You look busy.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm contemplating.
not_available Your busy is so different from my busy.
not_available So, what's next on your packed agenda? Papers to grade, yardwork.
not_available I should really finish that article.
not_available That was nice of you to talk with Claire's friend this morning.
not_available I guess that goes on in your classroom all the time.
not_available What? Intellectual discussions with young women in skimpy fashions.
not_available Well, they do love to challenge a father figure.
not_available But if you think that's skimpy, you should see them in summer quarter.
not_available My man.
not_available Dawg, we're still on the job.
not_available You've had enough.
not_available What are you, my wife? Kiss my ass.
not_available Whip it out.
not_available Hey, this boyfriend, you love him? That's right.
not_available Is he sexy? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You see this fat guy right here? Does he look crazy to you? That's the deejay.
not_available They always look crazy.
not_available Big dick? 
not_available Excuse me? Your boyfriend.
not_available Does he have a big dick? Is that what you like? 
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available Me, I got a big dick.
not_available Something don't happen tonight, it's gonna break right off.
not_available You know you could really help me out.
not_available You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I know what you're saying.
not_available I'm not helping you out.
not_available It's not cool.
not_available You're kidding, right? Javier, I don't treat my man the way you treat your woman.
not_available You're loaded.
not_available You should go back to your room.
not_available You don't think I'm sexy? 
not_available You should go.
not_available You should check out my dick before you say no, man.
not_available Go, please.
not_available Ham.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Phone.
not_available Yup.
not_available Phone.
not_available Nate Fisher.
not_available It's me.
not_available I thought last time was our last last time.
not_available Yeah, as far as sex goes.
not_available So, hey, I told Joe.
not_available About me? Well, I didn't name names, but yeah.
not_available I was really scared.
not_available It was really hard, but, yeah, we're okay.
not_available Well, congratulations, I'm really happy for you.
not_available So listen, come see our new house.
not_available Brenda, what 
not_available I know what you said, but I can't just surgically remove you from my life.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Come on.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, I've got other plans.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available No, it's true.
not_available We're going to Travel Town later.
not_available Aren't we, Miss Pumpkin? 
not_available With the trains? Oh, I love them! They're so little.
not_available Can I come with you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available No ulterior motives, I just wanna ride the rails.
not_available Brenda, we always have ulterior motives.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available We don't.
not_available Come on.
not_available Please? Liar liar liar.
not_available What kind of man spends this much money on some chick without getting laid? Hello? Hey, what are you doing? I'm trying not to eat the Krispy Kremes.
not_available Come over as soon as you can.
not_available Something's different, you sound better.
not_available Yeah, I'm done crying.
not_available You ready? What do you say, Maya, huh? Caboose? Want to get in the caboose? Aha! We got the caboose! Isn't this exciting? All aboard! Destination, Las Vegas! Where we going? Las Vegas! Whoo! Bye! # Shake off the dust # # And open your eyes # My goodness, what's all this? Nothing.
not_available It's just some flowers.
not_available # Just look at your life # # Everything # What's up? That girl, Anita, I think she should be contributing financially.
not_available Why? She's hardly ever here.
not_available She basically lives at Russell's.
not_available Your Russell? That's terrible.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Still, I think she should give us a check.
not_available What do you have against Anita? I simply think if she's going to prance around the house in her underwear, she should pay for the privilege.
not_available Mom, I guarantee you none of my friends prance.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Well, don't book a 5:00 A.M.
not_available radio thing and three stupid TV talk shows back to back.
not_available Remember, I sign your fucking checks! 
not_available I'll be in front.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, you think you have job security? I fired my own goddamn parents.
not_available Oh! Assholes! Greedy, bloodsucking assholes.
not_available Gimme that.
not_available I think there may be better ways to handle your anger.
not_available Yeah, well, when I care what you think, I'll let you know.
not_available Fine.
not_available God.
not_available Oh my God! Oh, that's your picture.
not_available I look like a fucking $2 hooker! I was supposed to sign off on these! Fucking stupid assholes! Why do they do it every fucking time?! Come on, now.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You're beautiful, all right? Come on now.
not_available Besides, aren't you supposed to look like a hooker? I'm starving.
not_available Oh, Keith.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Oh, thank you so much.
not_available Would you stop playing gang girl? We're only here to talk.
not_available You don't know what she's gonna do.
not_available She could scratch the shit out of your face, and then what do you say to the P.T.A.? Please, I want to see what she's like.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'm taking out my earrings, and I'm putting away my gold.
not_available That's her.
not_available Who are you? I'm Vanessa.
not_available I'm Rico's wife.
not_available Okay, this is not my problem.
not_available You have no right to be here.
not_available If you're sleeping with Rico, it is your problem.
not_available No, nuh
not_available uh.
not_available It's not my problem you don't know how to dress, 
not_available and you can't keep a man.
not_available What?! I'm not finished talking to you.
not_available Stupid bitch! Try to steal my husband! Fucking home wrecker, you dirty whore! Come on, I'll kick your fucking ass! And your fake fucking tits! You're just jealous of my tits! 
not_available Bitch, please! Your man paid for these, gordita! Oh, hell no, bitch.
not_available Who the fuck you calling gordita? Get her, Vanessa! Get off my sister! Get the hell off of my sister, you sleazy pig! Don't fuck with my husband! Do not fuck with my kids! I swear to God, I will fucking kill you! Fuck you! I didn't make him do nothing! I got a kid too! Get outta here! I've called the cops! He doesn't want you anymore.
not_available Oh shit.
not_available Whoo.
not_available We gotta go pick up the boys from school.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available You can help me pick up, if you want.
not_available What have you done? I cut back the crape
not_available myrtle.
not_available This is not a crape
not_available myrtle.
not_available It's the tree Nathaniel planted for Claire on her 10th birthday.
not_available Can't you tell a crape
not_available myrtle from a Bradford flowering pear? Well, whatever it is, it looked diseased.
not_available I've read about powdery mildew, and it's no joke.
not_available That tree is not, nor has it ever been, diseased.
not_available It never gets powdery mildew, because I always keep the soil dry and aerated.
not_available My God, you've killed it.
not_available I have not.
not_available Ask anyone, you have to trim vegetation in order to stimulate new growth.
not_available You're a geologist.
not_available You know rocks.
not_available This is a living thing.
not_available You chop off the branches and you make wounds.
not_available Ruth, please, don't anthropomorphize trees.
not_available Wounds, that's what they're called, and these wounds will not heal.
not_available They'll be invaded by rot and it will move into the core wood.
not_available You've butchered the most beautiful tree in my yard.
not_available I think it'll come back bigger and better than ever.
not_available And if it doesn't we can always get another one.
not_available You could have told me what you were going to do.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Who's this? You called me.
not_available Who's this? Sarge.
not_available Sarge.
not_available Dude, you gotta know me, or how can I call you? Sarge, from paintball? Oh my God, this is David Fisher.
not_available David and Keith, you made us breakfast.
not_available Hey.
not_available David, yeah.
not_available I remember.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Excellent.
not_available See, I found this number in my wallet and I was like, "Whoa, who the fuck is this?" It's you.
not_available Yeah, it's me.
not_available I came in from La Habra to play a tournament.
not_available Kinda hanging out now, drinking some beers.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Not much happening here.
not_available Come over.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're so damn cute.
not_available It's too much fragrance.
not_available Yeah, maybe a little.
not_available Fuck! I bought these votives.
not_available They were supposed to be unscented.
not_available Instead, they're like sandalwood, lavender, vanilla musk.
not_available Come here, stop it.
not_available # Reaching, she's out of sight # I don't know why I mean, we already kinda had sex, but I feel like I'm at a middle school cotillion.
not_available Well, you're not.
not_available You're all grown up and beautiful.
not_available Don't laugh at me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Not at all.
not_available I don't know what to do to make this go right tonight.
not_available It's already going right.
not_available Except you have to change this vagina music, like, immediately.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, I definitely remember you.
not_available And, uh, Keith's out of town? He's on the other side of the continent.
not_available So this time I get you all to myself.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available I dig it.
not_available So do I.
not_available Weed? Oh God, yes.
not_available Dude, what are you doing way the fuck over there? I don't know.
not_available Come here.
not_available What? Are you feeling anything resembling excitement right now? Of course.
not_available I love kissing you.
not_available Your face has these subtle curves and angles.
not_available Am I doing something wrong? No.
not_available There's just so much more we could be doing.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
not_available Let's make it like a dance.
not_available Where I touch you which is nice, right? Yeah.
not_available And then you touch me Okay, this is not happening.
not_available Sorry, it's not.
not_available I took one of David's Ativan.
not_available I thought it would help.
not_available Claire.
not_available You really want to get off, huh? Yeah, kinda.
not_available I mean, it'd be nice.
not_available Well, go ahead.
not_available Claire Fisher.
not_available I want to watch.
not_available All right, yeah.
not_available Watch me.
not_available I'll come for you.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Oh, I was waiting up for you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mmm, good music? Yeah, yeah, you know, oompah, oompah, love, danger.
not_available What did you do today? I went to Travel Town.
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available Nate took his daughter, and I tagged along.
not_available Oh.
not_available Did you ride the train? 
not_available Four times.
not_available Oh.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I know Griffith Gulch like the back of my hand.
not_available That's a long trip.
not_available You must be all tuckered out.
not_available You'd think so but not so tuckered.
not_available Dude, yeah! Yeah! Hello.
not_available You better lock up your goddamn Vanessa or I will! What are you talking about? She and some other puta tried to beat my ass and when they couldn't, they beat my fucking car! It's your fault! You better buy me a new one! It is not my fault! You started this! I've given you enough! My life is ruined because of you! Fuck your car, Infinity, I'm done! Fine, 'cause I don't need you anymore.
not_available I got two guys better than you, and they're not stupid enough to tell their bitch
not_available ass wives! Bitch! I don't even know where we are.
not_available Oh, Tampa.
not_available Yeah, because when I got on stage, I said, "How much do you love me, Tampa?" I'd better let you get some sleep.
not_available You know when you're really tired, but you can't stop your mind? It just goes around and around.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, how's your boyfriend? Not so good.
not_available Tell me.
not_available He got carjacked a while ago.
not_available It was bad.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm afraid of those things, too.
not_available Some freak out of nowhere with a gun, those autograph hounds.
not_available You just never know.
not_available You sing.
not_available It's my job to worry.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Just till I fall asleep.

not_available Publicity.
not_available Last March I turned 21.
not_available You ever been with a woman? Of course.
not_available I don't get fucked in the ass.
not_available That makes one of us.
not_available What are you doing? Gotta bunk with a guy from my team.
not_available More tourney this week and I don't wanna get my ass lit up at the top of the action.
not_available Gotta focus, stay tight, stay alive.
not_available Game on.
not_available Well, stay here.
not_available You can't go already, I want you to stay.
not_available Yeah, I get that, but like, no, sorry.
not_available I'll make you breakfast.
not_available I'll go to your tournament with you.
not_available Come back to bed.
not_available Or we could watch TV.
not_available Do you have a deafness problem? I gotta be someplace else.
not_available I'll leave you a joint.
not_available You could use it.
not_available What do I have to do?! What? To do to get somebody to stay with me! 
not_available Aw, fuck this shit, man.
not_available Don't you go! Whoa, whoa! David, do I call a hospital? No.

not_available We'll put these in the washer.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't cry.
not_available Your marriage has always been so strong.
not_available You'll be home soon.
not_available No, I cheated on Vanessa, 
not_available and she'll never forgive me.
not_available Federico! What's wrong with you men? Always turning your back on what you have, always sniffing around for something new.
not_available Me? You've had three boyfriends since Mr.
not_available F, and that's not including the affair with the hairdresser.
not_available You know about Hiram? I practically live here.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available I just want to take it all back.
not_available I know, dear, I know.
not_available Yo.
not_available Hey.
not_available Just the man I want to talk to.
not_available What's up, dawg? You have to come home.
not_available I am.
not_available The tour's on the West Coast in a couple of weeks.
not_available Listen, I got to check in with you about You're not listening to me.
not_available I need you now! David, the timing's not good.
not_available Fuck timing, fuck you! Whoa, what's going on with you? Do I have to explain to you that I'm losing my fucking mind? Can't you tell? God, where is everybody?! Okay, okay, I hear you.
not_available Don't stay alone, go to your family.
not_available I'll be there as soon as I can.
not_available # Jesus washed me # # He washed my sins away # # Oh, happy day # # It was a happy day # # Oh, happy day # # He taught me how # # To wash # # Fight and pray # # Oh, yes # # Fight and pray, oh # # And then rejoice # # Every day # # Every day, Lord # # Oh, yes, He does # # Every day # # Oh, yeah # # Yes! # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # 
not_available # Oh, happy day.
not_available # I think I've figured us out.
not_available Me too.
not_available You first.
not_available I think you are the coolest and most beautiful person I've ever seen in my life, and I admire you so fucking much.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available And you are totally hot.
not_available I mean, I feel that.
not_available I really do, and I'm like so pulled to you.
not_available But when I look at this whole thing objectively? The attraction is aesthetic.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available It's creative and artistic and intellectual and physical Yes! But not necessarily sexual.
not_available You're not into fucking women.
not_available I thought I was.
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit.
not_available But after seeing your orgasm, I really really want one.
not_available Fuck! It's a beautiful place, Bren.
not_available It's peaceful.
not_available You and Joe did good.
not_available Could've been us.
not_available Yeah, but it's not us.
not_available And it is time for Maya's nap.
not_available Right? Time for a nap.
not_available We gotta say goodbye.
not_available Let her sleep on the bed.
not_available Come on, we can talk about safe things.
not_available I'm going out for a couple of hours.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available All you do is come and go! Ruth? Marriage is not a gas station, George.
not_available You can't just pull in and fill up whenever you remember you have a wife! That is completely unfair and inaccurate.
not_available I have always treated you as a partner and a friend, and if that's not marriage, then I don't know what is.
not_available That's right, you don't! Well, what about your own life? Why do I have to be the center of everything for you?! And why do you have to hound me about every personal detail down to the fucking subatomic level?! Because when I don't there's shit on my doorstep, another child appears, another girlfriend or you murder my favorite tree! Sarah was wrong.
not_available You're not like Nathaniel, you're worse! You are smothering me.
not_available Oh, bullshit! You always do exactly what you want.
not_available You haven't changed or grown one iota since we met.
not_available Well, don't say I didn't warn you.
not_available Warn me? Are you threatening divorce? That is not what I meant.
not_available I'm your seventh spouse, George.
not_available How much warning do you think I need? You jumped on him? I couldn't stop myself.
not_available What did he do? Put me down and sat on me.
not_available I was like a mosquito to him.
not_available It was humiliating.
not_available I have to get control of myself.
not_available No, David, if you were any more controlled, you'd be a sculpture.
not_available You know what? Last night, I had a humiliating homosexual experience of my own.
not_available Seriously? What happened? Not much.
not_available I never even went down on her.
not_available You can stop there.
not_available I just couldn't go through with it.
not_available It pisses me off.
not_available It would be so much easier to be gay.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Yeah, I'd have a really defined subculture.
not_available Overrated.
not_available We're both women, I'd have some idea of what she was thinking and feeling.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available Well, I wouldn't have to deal with unfamiliar sex organs.
not_available Oh, they're all unfamiliar, unless they're yours.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? I gotta leave the tour, Duane.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available There'll still be work in L.A.? Definitely, yeah.
not_available We know it's not your fault.
not_available What are you gonna do? Yeah.
not_available I'll go tell Celeste.
not_available Whoa.
not_available She's the one that told me.
not_available What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Celeste fired your ass this morning.
not_available Joe.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Wait, wait, Maya's Nate's daughter's in the next room.
not_available Look, I deserve whatever you have to say to me, but I don't want her scared, so can you give me that? 
not_available Get out.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Oh.
not_available I got your bear.
not_available That's him.
not_available Your previous indiscretion, him? Yes.
not_available That depressing cripple.
not_available I mean, you're both cripples, obviously.
not_available I am so stupid.
not_available Yeah, I was actually considering having children with you.
not_available But that truly frightens me! It's not your fault.
not_available I know it's not my fault.
not_available I've obviously been in complete denial that I'm in recovery.
not_available Just shut the fuck up! You neurotic, tedious, self
not_available absorbed bitch.
not_available You don't give a shit about me.
not_available You never did.
not_available It's not true.
not_available I love you, Joe.
not_available I do! I was honest with you in the beginning.
not_available I have an issue.
not_available Oh, blah
not_available blah fucking psychobullshit! It's not sex, it's betrayal! That's your fucking addiction! Okay, I'll get help.
not_available No, no, here's a question for you.
not_available What do you call a person without character, without integrity, without loyalty, without respect? I call that person a fucking waste of my time.
not_available That's not who I am.
not_available You think you know me, but you don't.
not_available You'd think someone in this family would notice when the house is on fire.
not_available This is bullshit.
not_available You go to bed with a woman while your boyfriend's recovering? 
not_available I can't trust a man like that.
not_available Celeste.
not_available Look, if you stayed with the tour, you'd distract me.
not_available That can't happen.
not_available Plus, it's very unprofessional to fuck the boss.
not_available Not cool, dawg.
not_available Well, just so you know, I was leaving before you fired me.
not_available Hmm, synchronicity.
not_available Ciao, baby.
not_available "Dear neighbor" "You are my brother." "I love you." "And yet I feel a great sadness in my bosom." Where's Mom? I think it's terrible.
not_available A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
not_available "Going away.
not_available Don't contact the authorities.
not_available I'll be in touch when I'm ready.
not_available Dinner is in the oven." Apparently she's gone walkabout.
not_available Wait wait, there's more.
not_available Now just a minute! Bosom.
not_available I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
not_available Okay okay, all right.
not_available She's right.
not_available Let's do something together.
not_available What does everyone say to some miniature golf followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes? All right! I was going to wash my hair.
not_available # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # # When Jesus washed # # When Jesus washed # # He washed my sins away # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, it's a happy day # # Oh, happy day # # He taught me how # # He taught me how # # To wash # # Fight and pray # # Oh, yeah # # Fight and pray # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, Lord # # Oh, happy day # 
not_available # Oh, yeah # # Oh, happy day.
