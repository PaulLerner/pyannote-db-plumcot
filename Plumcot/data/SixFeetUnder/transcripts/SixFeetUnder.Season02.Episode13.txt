
not_available She really looks like Nate.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Claire, they're in order.
not_available Do vegans breastfeed? You got butter on it.
not_available Sorry, Mom, I know you only have But this one was the first time she ever smiled at me.
not_available You sure it wasn't gas? 
not_available No, I know gas.
not_available Nate 
not_available Was an extremely gassy baby.
not_available We know.
not_available But David never made a peep.
not_available And no one remembers anything about Claire.
not_available I'm starting to think I walked in off the street when I was nine.
not_available That's not true, dear.
not_available David, Claire's graduation is this Saturday at 3:00.
not_available Did you hear that, Nate? Saturday at 3:00.
not_available For what? My idiotic graduation.
not_available You don't have to come.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Just a few pictures of Maya.
not_available Wait, you haven't even seen her? It's weird that I can't have anything to do with this kid, and you go take pictures.
not_available Giving up custodial rights doesn't mean you can't visit.
not_available Lisa said that? 
not_available I'm not getting in the middle of this.
not_available Well, then, don't.
not_available Stay out of it.
not_available Whatever problems you and Lisa have, I don't care.
not_available But Maya is my granddaughter, and I intend to be part of her life! You okay? Go away.
not_available Let me get someone for you.
not_available They can't help me.
not_available I got it.
not_available All right.
not_available I don't want you to see this shit.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You can't wait for this to be over.
not_available I'm right here for you.
not_available So what? I don't even know you.
not_available Oh, fuck! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Nate, I'm not ready.
not_available Help me.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available Just try to let go.
not_available Go into the light? There's no fucking light.
not_available Please, just 
not_available just try to let go.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available Let it go.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Yes, I need to see Dr.
not_available DiPaolo as soon as possible.
not_available I can't wait two weeks.
not_available This is an emergency.
not_available I have to schedule an embolization.
not_available No, but I think I waited too long already, all right? I have to fucking do this.
not_available Nate, this is John Gerson.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tomorrow at 11:00.
not_available Yes, thank you.
not_available Bitch.
not_available From the DCA.
not_available I'd like to look around, if you don't mind.
not_available We don't have an inspection till February.
not_available We received a complaint.
not_available From who? I'm not at liberty to say.
not_available If I could use your little boys' room, then we'll start with your billing records.
not_available It's that door directly across.
not_available I thought Kroehner folded.
not_available This must be the final mindfuck of Mitzi Dalton Huntley.
not_available Claire Fisher.
not_available Can I start again? Fuck! Claire? Claire! So I had this 
idea We should put a pool in the backyard.
not_available Careful of the puddle.
not_available That's nasty.
not_available A little kidney
not_available shaped pool.
not_available We can dip in the summer.
not_available It's not even that expensive.
not_available We're paying back your sister.
not_available She doesn't need to be paid back.
not_available She doesn't even want it.
not_available You only don't want to be paid back when you want to have something over someone.
not_available Do you know much she's getting paid to play that slutty neighbor on the WB? Where's my hot sauce? 
not_available It's on there.
not_available I don't see why we can't get one thing nice for ourselves.
not_available Don't talk about the money in front of him.
not_available Get rid of the food! I hope I didn't interrupt your lunch.
not_available I'm sure they weren't eating.
not_available This is our embalmer's wife.
not_available She was just stopping by.
not_available Does she have a license to be down here? Shouldn't Mr.
not_available Buchbinder be in the refrigerator? I'm just about to take him to the crematorium.
not_available Really? It looks to me like you've got yourself a no
not_available vacancy situation at the fridge motel.
not_available He's not even staying here.
not_available I'd love to let this slide but since Mr.
not_available Buchbinder paid for two days' refrigeration in his pre
not_available need contract I'm going to have to write you up for a consumer disclosure citation.
not_available And we are knee
not_available deep in human waste.
not_available Why did your grades take such a plunge in the spring? I don't know.
not_available I guess I sort of stopped relating to high school.
not_available Did something happen last year? Well, bad boyfriend.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's it, unless you have any questions, or anything else you'd like us to know.
not_available Well, good luck, Claire, it was nice to meet you.
not_available Also, not that this is, whatever but my father died last year.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't think it had anything to do with getting bad grades, but maybe it did a little.
not_available It would if it were me.
not_available Thank you for letting me know.
not_available You know, I'm not like, "Oh, poor me" or anything.
not_available You know, I just thought of this.
not_available But before that happened I always liked to make stuff for people, like presents, or whatever and then, when my dad died, I couldn't I don't even know how to talk about it, I mean, even now, you know.
not_available But then I started to make stuff that was sort of about that at first you know, and then stuff that was about other things, too.
not_available And I'm sorry that I'm rambling, now but, I guess, I just wanted you to know that I feel like I have this way now of, like, dealing.
not_available And it's so much better.
not_available I'm sorry, excuse me.
not_available Excuse me, I'm sorry.
not_available This is so queer.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I constantly cry at inappropriate moments.
not_available Yeah, but I really don't.
not_available Here, sweetie.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We'll have your ashes on Saturday.
not_available He actually asked that I be here for it to start the machine.
not_available Can't do it today.
not_available A pacemaker exploded in the retort, so they're fixing the burners.
not_available Come back tomorrow afternoon.
not_available We'll torch him then.
not_available Is Taylor in her room? I got her an air purifier that's also a humidifier.
not_available Taylor! Where's all her stuff? My parents came today to take her down to San Diego.
not_available For how long? 
not_available For good.
not_available Why? There's no way we could've kept her.
not_available Not after what I did.
not_available We could have tried.
not_available You could have told me 
not_available I got suspended today.
not_available Oh, my God, until when? It doesn't matter.
not_available I'm not going back there.
not_available You don't know how you'll feel 
not_available Don't tell me what I know! You know, it's summer.
not_available Maybe it's 'cause, when I was growing up, there were seasons but it still gives me this charge.
not_available And it's not just the nipples.
not_available It's that the whole world's out there, feeling sexy in their skin.
not_available I can't sit with a beer in my hand and watch the ass parade anymore.
not_available Because it takes me out of my f
not_available ing reality.
not_available It's a drug.
not_available That little shine of sweat.
not_available Some chick in traffic.
not_available I just want to jump in that car and lick it right off of her.
not_available On my wife, it makes me sick.
not_available I can see the stains under her arms the red bumps where she shaves, all the f
not_available ing details.
not_available But thanks to my higher power, and this program I haven't crossed my bottom line in three years.
not_available And for me, that means no sex outside my marriage.
not_available No prostitutes, no strip clubs, no masturbation.
not_available And it also seems to mean no sex in my marriage.
not_available I stopped doing all the other stuff because I wanted to learn how to be more intimate with my wife.
not_available And I have.
not_available I love her.
not_available I love her more than anything.
not_available I just can't touch her.
not_available I couldn't even kiss her any more than I could kiss my own mother.
not_available The fact is, I have this f
not_available ing disease, and this is how it's showing up today.
not_available So, thanks.
not_available Three years, right? You really have to love someone to have their face burned into your flesh.
not_available Or just be really drunk.
not_available The lowest I could get was 38.
not_available Thousand? The lowest? They have to dig up the whole foundation of the house to replace those pipes.
not_available We can try another contractor.
not_available Fuck! 
not_available What is this? We're going to have to shut down the home for a while.
not_available What? 
not_available This inspection just totally fucked us.
not_available The maximum fine is $2,500 at a time We've two weeks to fix the drainage system.
not_available We don't have the money.
not_available And Kroehner can't even buy us out anymore.
not_available So what does this mean? We hope you'll consider taking something temporary so when we work things out, you can come back.
not_available You mean if you work things out.
not_available We know it's a lot to ask.
not_available Scott? Candace Bouvard.
not_available I am so sorry, Candace.
not_available I had sex with like 200 women last year and all the faces are a blur.
not_available Why are you only taking 
not_available That's what you prescribed.
not_available But you're still having seizures.
not_available You were supposed to tell me so I could adjust the dosage.
not_available Well, you didn't tell me that.
not_available I'm sure I did.
not_available Now there's a bleed.
not_available This was so unnecessary.
not_available What's a bleed? That's blood.
not_available The AVM ruptured, probably during your last seizure.
not_available Wouldn't I have felt that? 
not_available Apparently not.
not_available If I'd done the embolization last summer, we wouldn't be in this situation.
not_available AVM is very treatable, if you treat it.
not_available Wait a minute, you didn't 
not_available Okay, I want to do it now.
not_available So would I, if I were you.
not_available But, at this point, my only option is immediate cranial surgery.
not_available What does that mean? It means it looks like this sucker is bordering an eloquent area in the brain.
not_available Well, you said it wasn't last time.
not_available You must have misheard me.
not_available It's a lot of information.
not_available What does that mean? I'm not gonna lie to you.
not_available There's a high risk of paralysis Ioss of speech, vegetation, or death.
not_available But I have a very strong record with this kind of surgery.
not_available How many deaths? 
not_available Not many.
not_available I can't fit this in tomorrow.
not_available I'm gonna have to come in Saturday for this.
not_available But I need your blood work done today.
not_available Connie will tell you where to go for that when you check out.
not_available I really don't like the idea that I'm sick.
not_available Nobody does.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's a little self
not_available indulgent, don't you think? When there are people dying of leukemia, or whatever.
not_available These guys are 
like "It's not my fault I blew 25 guys last night.
not_available I have a disease." I mean, deal with it.
not_available When I tried to deal with it, I ended up with a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against me by half the female associates in my firm.
not_available Fuck.
not_available I'm really glad we didn't You and I.
not_available I was spreading gonorrhea all over LA last summer.
not_available So when did you admit you were powerless? 
not_available I haven't yet, by the way.
not_available I can tell.
not_available Five months, two weeks, and three days ago.
not_available And now your life is just one long hot fuck with God? 
not_available I'm an atheist, actually.
not_available Yeah? And who do you turn over your will and your life to? I just pray to nothing.
not_available I say, "Dear God, who I don't believe in, help me "with whatever it is." To stop thinking about undressing this incredibly sexy woman who I am trying to have a real moment with.
not_available Or something like that.
not_available Does it work? Unfortunately, yeah, it does.
not_available Well, I'm not gonna stop drinking or smoking pot.
not_available All you can do is just take it one day at a time.
not_available All those fucking slogans make me want to tear off my clothes and run screaming out of the room.
not_available You know, I'm curious.
not_available How does having compulsive sex with strangers no close relationship with friends, or family a job that you hate, and a broken engagement feel manageable to you? I didn't say that my life wasn't unmanageable.
not_available I just said that I hadn't admitted that I was powerless.
not_available I don't want to hate my parents any more than I already do.
not_available You'll probably end up forgiving them.
not_available Well, I don't want to do that either.
not_available I don't want to be one of those people that walks around in pain all the time.
not_available What about when you are in pain? I choose not to be.
not_available What's so bad about a little pain? I feel like it'll kill me.
not_available It won't.
not_available I can't believe that guy blew up in the retort.
not_available We usually check for the pacemaker, but this guy was, like, 20.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available And built.
not_available He looked like he worked out five hours a day.
not_available Vanity.
not_available These guys are out there taking pills, getting implants.
not_available Men are the new women.
not_available Yeah, no kidding.
not_available I hate gyms.
not_available All those people on machines staring at the TVs.
not_available They looks like pod people training to live among the humans.
not_available Shit! Hang on.
not_available I got to reposition him.
not_available I've got to make sure the chest is right under the main burner.
not_available That's where most of your mass and fluids are.
not_available All that stuff that really fuels the burn.
not_available We used to leave it chunky, so people would know it was real cremains not just wood chips, like that place in Georgia.
not_available But then we did this baby and the dad saw a little tooth, and he freaked, like, "This isn't my baby!" We had to get a doctor to explain to him that they have teeth embedded in their jaws.
not_available Man, he was upset.
not_available But, you know, when a baby goes, it's a lot of dead hope.
not_available You going to Lisa's? 
not_available I have every right to see my granddaughter.
not_available I'm coming with you.
not_available Did you talk to her? You've got a key? Sometimes I stay with the baby when Lisa has to work.
not_available They should be here soon.
not_available See? I told you Granny was gonna be here.
not_available Hi, Granny.
not_available Hello, sweet pea.
not_available Carole made me come with her to this intuitive nutritionist who told her she's allergic to everything.
not_available She squeezed Carole's fingers for 10 minutes and I had to spend two hours looking for burdock root.
not_available I think Erewhon has burdock.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sorry to show up like this.
not_available I won't stay long.
not_available I'm really happy you're here.
not_available You know who this is? This is your daddy.
not_available This is where you get your little mouth from.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, Maya.
not_available I know you're thinking "Maya" is "illusion" in Buddhism but it's also another name for Durga, the Mother, in Sanskrit.
not_available And, in Greek, it's "messenger of the Gods." And my mother was half
not_available Greek, so, you know My gosh, she's so small.
not_available Mom, come on.
not_available You'll thank me when you're old.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Hi, Barbara, how are you? I'm fine.
not_available Did you get the tape? She's just as precious as precious can be.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Lisa, it's Barb.
not_available Tell her I'll call her back.
not_available Who's Barb? My sister.
not_available Carole's movie? No, I just don't enjoy films about retarded people.
not_available But Lisa went to the premiere.
not_available She said it was great.
not_available Sorry about my mom.
not_available I guess she's been a little Ionely.
not_available She's a godsend.
not_available She's been such a help to me.
not_available She looked wonderful.
not_available We altered a purple chiffon caftan I had in the closet from the '70s.
not_available She's just so loving and fun.
not_available I just hope I can be half as good a mother as she is.
not_available I'm sure you can.
not_available Okay, bye, now.
not_available Ruth, is this the blanket? 
not_available That's the one I made for Nate.
not_available I love it.
not_available In certain ways, Lisa really reminds me of myself.
not_available Something about the way you two are together reminds me of your father and me.
not_available I was raised with a very small
not_available town mentality and getting married was really the only way you could have sex at all.
not_available So, I never tried to find the perfect someone, you know? But that doesn't matter when there are children.
not_available It becomes its own very real kind of love.
not_available Mom, I'm not marrying Lisa.
not_available Did I say you should? I think you should consider the profound effect a child can have on your life.
not_available Mom, you should find some place and pull over for a minute.
not_available Why, are you all right, dear? 
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available Saturday? I kind of need to do it as soon as possible.
not_available Have you told David? Yeah.
not_available Would you like me to tell Claire? She knows.
not_available She saw me have a seizure, so I had to tell her.
not_available I'm sorry, Mom.
not_available I'll go to the hospital with Nate David will take Robbie's video camera to Claire's graduation so we can all watch it later.
not_available Mom 
not_available It's fine.
not_available I already asked him.
not_available And he's bringing it over later to show you how it works.
not_available We're not going to my lame
not_available ass graduation when Nate is having major surgery.
not_available Claire, Nate is going to be just fine.
not_available There is no reason for this procedure to ruin your special day.
not_available It's not even special.
not_available I'm just going for you.
not_available It is special.
not_available It's a rite of passage.
not_available I'm not going to let you get overshadowed by your brothers, like you always do.
not_available If Claire doesn't care about this, I'd like to be with Nate, too.
not_available David, god damn it, I am the mother here! And I am a good one, no matter what you think from your limited point of view.
not_available This is what we are doing! Now, who wants milk? So? Now you can get them to make you a partner.
not_available It's Fisher &amp; Sons, remember? It's not Fisher &amp; Sons &amp; Diaz.
not_available That was before you had $100,000 they need.
not_available I want to put it in a mutual fund, or something.
not_available Some, okay, but nothing's worth as much as being your own boss.
not_available Julio, check the bath isn't running over.
not_available I don't know.
not_available The business isn't even going so great.
not_available So? You go in there, you make it go great.
not_available He didn't do it.
not_available Julio, turn off the bath! I'll do it.
not_available No, he needs to learn to do something when I tell him.
not_available You'll let the whole house get flooded so you can teach him something? Thank you.
not_available I want to be cremated.
not_available I don't want to be embalmed.
not_available No viewing.
not_available This is very difficult for me.
not_available Do you want me to fill it out by myself? Yes.
not_available I don't think we should do this now.
not_available We have to, all right? I don't want you to have to deal with the funeral.
not_available You're not going to die.
not_available I have to get ready for it.
not_available And I think you should, too.
not_available What about a service? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I want Ari the rabbi who did Jeffrey Shapiro.
not_available A rabbi? Why not Father Jack? Is Father Jack doing your service? No, but that's just because I don't want to give him the wrong idea.
not_available What kind of idea is he going to get when you're dead? I don't know, I just don't want him cruising me in the afterlife.
not_available Oh, God, I'm sorry.
not_available What do you think the afterlife is? Some sex club that never closes? Yeah, and no one ever tells you if it's heaven or hell.
not_available Fuck, I am really scared.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I wish you could come with me.
not_available Okay, I'm not going to Claire's graduation.
not_available Mom is insane.
not_available No, go to the graduation.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available Oh, God! You're home early.
not_available Where were you? Just getting something to eat.
not_available I was going to make dinner.
not_available You can still make dinner.
not_available You mean for myself? Whatever.
not_available I might be kind of hungry later.
not_available You sure you want to eat that? I was going to make a poached Chilean sea bass and polenta.
not_available With a wild mushroom cassoulet.
not_available You could've gotten me something.
not_available I didn't know you'd be home.
not_available Did you do anything today? What's that supposed to mean? Did you call that guy? I don't need to pay to learn I can get a job in security.
not_available I'm sure there're options you don't know about.
not_available I know a lot of ex
not_available cops.
not_available They all work in security.
not_available What's wrong with security? It's a national obsession.
not_available It's the new freedom.
not_available You know what? My career isn't your problem.
not_available I have new pictures of Maya.
not_available Yes, I have seen.
not_available The new ones? I don't think so.
not_available Is very cute.
not_available I have seen.
not_available You haven't seen these.
not_available The smiling ones? I just got these yesterday.
not_available Ruth, is not my grandbaby.
not_available I don't need every day to see.
not_available I quit.
not_available Consider this my two
not_available week notice.
not_available Because I don't looking at your photos? No, I'm not growing in this environment.
not_available And I want to be available to help watch my granddaughter.
not_available And since I don't have the money to help pay for a sitter, it's the least I can do.
not_available You take other job? Eventually, I suppose I'll have to, under the circumstances.
not_available Okay, then, Ruth.
not_available Is also better for me.
not_available This way only have to pay Robbie.
not_available Well, yes.
not_available And also, you should know, you may be losing Fisher &amp; Sons as a client.
not_available We may close the business because there's no money to replace the septic system! This is my fault? Is that what you're saying? No.
not_available I just thought you should know you might be losing the account.
not_available I will pay you back this money.
not_available I said it was a gift.
not_available Even though you said it was gift, I will pay back.
not_available Well, that's very sweet, but we both know that's not possible.
not_available Here, every week, I pay some part of it.
not_available Here, this is the first payment.
not_available $62.
not_available It was a very slow week.
not_available I did knock.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Was that too loud? I just thought I'd stop by, say hi.
not_available Okay.
not_available I thought you were going to that art school.
not_available I so blew the interview.
not_available There's no way.
not_available I totally started bawling.
not_available What do you mean, why? I started talking about Dad, for some, like, insane reason.
not_available And I just fucking lost it.
not_available So is this operation really serious? Nah, I just gotta, you know, get rid of this thing.
not_available It's so not a big deal.
not_available Well, good.
not_available Because Just good.
not_available Okay, that was before you talked to me, so Did you take these? These are amazing.
not_available Well, they're okay.
not_available This guy's a total fucking freak but the pictures are awesome.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I thought you were going to yell at me.
not_available I didn't yell.
not_available I was just looking out for you.
not_available Okay, don't take this the wrong way and I know I have a tendency to fall for kind of insane boys but you have a tendency to dole out the wisdom like you're the Dalai Lama, or whatever and it's not like you're incredibly together that I'm just dying for your advice.
not_available I never said I was incredibly together.
not_available I'm just a lot older.
not_available Yeah, and I don't think you're that much better than I am at the relationship thing, like, at all.
not_available Well, I disagree.
not_available No one I dated ever attacked anybody with a knife or a gun.
not_available Okay.
not_available And I don't know what goes on between you and Lisa, or Brenda or the other million missing girlfriends.
not_available There have not been a million.
not_available I just get the sense that you're not fully dealing.
not_available All right.
not_available Fine, I'll never give you advice again.
not_available No, give me advice just don't try and act like you really know anything.
not_available Wait, is he nude? 
not_available No.
not_available God! $50,000.
not_available Do you have any idea how much this business is worth? Not much when it's shut down.
not_available And I want to be equal partner.
not_available Rico, you 
not_available Wait! I'm sorry I have to say this now, but I think you might want another partner.
not_available Not equal, no way.
not_available $75,000 for 25%.
not_available Done! All right, okay.
not_available So I just wanted to tell you that I think a lot of what you had to say 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Just let me finish.
not_available A lot of what you said was true.
not_available I didn't have the right to say anything to you.
not_available I'm the one that's fucked up.
not_available I am so fucked up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But you were right when you said that being with you made it easier for me to feel so together.
not_available That I was ready for something real, and you weren't and that is just not really true.
not_available Nate, I have a serious problem.
not_available I think I'm God, I so don't want to say this.
not_available Here.
not_available I've been going to these meetings.
not_available I went to one of these meetings once up in Seattle.
not_available It freaked me out.
not_available Why? 
not_available Just the people.
not_available It seemed like a cult.
not_available No.
not_available What made you go? I thought it might apply.
not_available Well, it says in the book that once you realize what it is and you work really hard, you can People have this whole new experience of love.
not_available Some people, I mean.
not_available So what? I really love you.
not_available And I don't think I would have done what I did if I didn't really love you.
not_available That's a very strange thing to say.
not_available But I think it's true.
not_available It was the fear of feeling something real.
not_available Okay.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available I just wanted you to know that even though you really pissed me off.
not_available I still get so angry if I let myself think about it Of course you do.
not_available But I felt like this was something.
not_available Being with you made me feel more Just feel more, I guess.
not_available More than I used to feel.
not_available More than I felt with anyone.
not_available Everything I was running away from, I don't even know what it is.
not_available Fear, I guess.
not_available I felt all of that with you.
not_available I'm good at making people feel fear? But I can't.
not_available I'm not saying now 
not_available I can't even think about the future.
not_available I'm just saying maybe.
not_available I'm having surgery tomorrow.
not_available It's an embolization.
not_available Totally routine.
not_available Can I be with you? No.
not_available My mom's coming with me.
not_available And it's really nothing.
not_available I mean, I'm gonna be fine.
not_available Nate.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I got to go.
not_available Nate, please! You know, I've been thinking it really could be good for you guys to have a Latino point of view at the home.
not_available Too bad it comes in the form of a controlling homophobe.
not_available When we met, you were a controlling homophobe.
not_available And apparently that was very attractive to you.
not_available Will you come with me to Claire's graduation tomorrow? 
not_available I'd really rather not.
not_available Why not? It's not a good time for me to be dealing with your family.
not_available It's not my family.
not_available It's me and Claire.
not_available My mother's going to be with Nate.
not_available I really can't.
not_available You'd miss The Young and the Restless? God, Keith, I ask you for one thing.
not_available What do you think we are? Roommates? It's like I don't even exist.
not_available In case you haven't noticed, I have a lot to deal with right now.
not_available Not noticed? It defines my entire life.
not_available Everything is about taking care of you.
not_available For once.
not_available Which you can't deal with, because you're the one who always needs it.
not_available That is such bullshit! Who were you taking care of when you sent Taylor away without telling me? What am I, the dog? I made a decision, and it was mine to make! Why was it your decision? 
not_available It's my family.
not_available I thought I was your family.
not_available Well, you're not! Yet.
not_available David, you're not.
not_available You just moved in and now there's this pressure to be whatever family unit fantasy you had in your head when you got engaged to Jennifer.
not_available I care about Taylor.
not_available She feels as close to me as That's not the point! It's not always about what you want! You are such an asshole! I have been tiptoeing Tiptoeing? 
not_available Get off of me! Lying on the couch, crying about this, and pretending everything's fine? I was crying about my brother, you selfish fuck! My brother could die tomorrow.
not_available Do you even think about how I feel? 
not_available Not if you don't tell me.
not_available You could notice! You could give a fuck for once in your life about somebody besides yourself.
not_available I'm really gonna miss high school.
not_available So, why does Monty Pappas think getting into Williams has made him into someone anyone would ever fuck? As if the name of the college matters at all.
not_available I don't even know where Williams is.
not_available Virginia? Vermont.
not_available It has that summer theatre program where movie stars go to have sex and do Chekhov.
not_available Oh, my God, how did your interview go? 
not_available It severely sucked.
not_available Are you suicidal? 
not_available No.
not_available East Valley will be fine.
not_available They've got a darkroom.
not_available They've got paint.
not_available And everyone says you get out of college what you put into it, anyway, so Whatever.
not_available I'm glad you're so delirious about it, because it looks like I'm going there, too.
not_available What do you mean? Yale found out about my SATs.
not_available That little Indian bitch turned herself in.
not_available Hundreds of people are screwed just so she won't come back as a rodent.
not_available Okay, it isn't that funny.
not_available Cunt.
not_available Oh, God! You ready to go, Mom? Is it time already? 
not_available Yeah, just about.
not_available But you haven't even eaten.
not_available I'm not supposed to.
not_available Of course, I'm such an idiot.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Clearly, there's something wrong with me that made you keep this from me while your brother and sister knew.
not_available Mom, I'm sorry.
not_available But why? Why does this keep happening? I just didn't want to worry you.
not_available You're not supposed to protect me.
not_available I'm supposed to protect you.
not_available But you can't.
not_available You can't protect me from this.
not_available But I can try.
not_available That's what a mother does.
not_available She tries to protect you, and most of the time, she fails but it's the trying that makes you feel loved.
not_available How will you feel loved if you don't ever let me try? I do.
not_available I do feel loved.
not_available It was just so many months I could have loved you better.
not_available You loved me fine.
not_available You're everything.
not_available You don't even know.
not_available You're everything to me.
not_available God, I don't want to go.
not_available I won't go.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't do this, I can't.
not_available I don't want to go! 
not_available I won't let you go.
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available I'll never let you go.
not_available Almost ready? We caught up with LA's hottest high school graduate in a quiet moment at home.
not_available So, Claire, how does it feel to be leaving your childhood behind? All right, you can really stop that now.
not_available For many young people, graduation brings up feelings of anxiety and pissiness.
not_available No, really.
not_available Cut! Are you smoking pot? 
not_available You want some? Yeah! God! These dust balls are like tumbleweeds! When was the last time anyone swept under here? I don't know.
not_available When did Mom start working for Nikolai? Your mother is a very good woman.
not_available God have mercy.
not_available How psyched are we that we never have to call him "Daddy"? Thank God she snapped out of it.
not_available I think he's the one who pulled the plug, actually.
not_available Really? What a pig.
not_available He thinks he can do better than Mom? I'm guessing she was a little clingy.
not_available Did Nate ever tell you what happened with Brenda? No, he was strangely nonverbal about it.
not_available He's usually so eager to regale us with the details of his personal life.
not_available Not always.
not_available I guess not.
not_available So, when did they go? 
not_available Really early.
not_available I guess it's like a two
not_available part thing.
not_available Yeah, first they try to stop the bleeding with glue.
not_available They put a catheter in through his groin and thread it up It's okay.
not_available I don't need the details.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That part must have happened already.
not_available The cranial surgery is a few hours later.
not_available So, like, now.
not_available Soon, I guess.
not_available There's no way we're going to this stupid graduation.
not_available I know.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available Seriously.
not_available You're driving.
not_available Fine.
not_available You're just going to feel a slight sting, okay? Count back from 10, please.
not_available Ten, nine, eight seven, six
