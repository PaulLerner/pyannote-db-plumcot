
not_available Saison 5 Episode 1 "A Coat of White Primer" Have you ever told her how you really feel? Of course not.
not_available Why not? Because she'd start screaming at me.
not_available Or cry.
not_available When else have you chosen not express your feelings So that someone wouldn't start screaming at you, Or cry? You mean, like with my dad? And? My sister.
not_available And? Oh, and leonard.
not_available So pretty much everyone.
not_available Andrea, would it be so bad If someone screamed or cried? Yes.
not_available Horrible.
not_available Really? Worse than feeling "isolated and invisible, Like an empty gaping hole in the universe"? Sometimes you talk about your life In a way that makes me feel sort of bad.
not_available Okay, like, you make a lot of money, Your house is a palace.
not_available And you wear a size four When you're bloated.
not_available So, when you get upset because you gain a few pounds, Or you complain about how high your taxes are With no comment on how much worse those situations are for me.
not_available makes me feel like I'm not a real person to you.
not_available I am I am so sorry.
not_available I guess I get wrapped up in my own drama, Or something and I am so glad you finally said something.
not_available I'm just asking you to think about how what you say might feel to me sometimes.
not_available When you tell me that you only want to hear good news It makes me feel like you only, sort of Love me if I get engaged Or promoted at work.
not_available And that makes me really not want to call you when I don't have good news, Which is, you know, most of the time.
not_available Dad? God, that is so not true.
not_available I'm just telling you how I feel.
not_available That I never think about your feelings? I shower you with gifts.
not_available I mean God, Andrea! Look at this apartment! Look at all the beautiful things I've given you! That antique mirror? The Italian Gondola ashtrays.
not_available The Queen Anne Brass andirons! Honey, I don't smoke.
not_available I don't have a fireplace.
not_available And I don't like antiques.
not_available You like antiques.
not_available I like modern decor, which you know.
not_available Your modern stuff just isn't as nice.
not_available I like it.
not_available But it doesn't matter what I like.
not_available Fine.
not_available You know what? I'll take it all back then.
not_available Leonard! It's not about the things.
not_available It's not even about your reaction.
not_available It's about me being able to express Give me the chair! Give me the chair! Get up! 
not_available What are you doing? You hate it so much, give it back! I'm trying to tell you how I feel.
not_available Lenny! Andrea? Andrea? Oh, jesus! Andrea, don't do this to me! Oh, god.
not_available Oh Jesus, now what am I gonna do? So how do you feel? Alive, uh, glad about that.
not_available Can you get this to stay on? This pin is defective.
not_available It won't prick.
not_available Looks like Nate may have to get married without a prick.
not_available What do you think, Ma? You got any advice? Advice? Oh, Claire, I don't know.
not_available Don't give up.
not_available Even when things get hard.
not_available And they always do eventually.
not_available Never stop trying.
not_available Oh my god! I nearly got killed on the way out here.
not_available Some crazy old lapdog lady almost ran me off the road With her Lexus SUV! Claire, where's David? I need the rings.
not_available I think he's over there.
not_available David, we're starting! The twins need to get the rings on the pillows.
not_available I just don't want them to get lost.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh yes, you can't stand Being away from mommy for moment, can you? How do you feel? 
not_available Like Every moment of my life had led up to this one.
not_available Like all of it makes sense Like this is the destiny that's been waiting for me.
not_available I know it's stupid to think in terms of "happily ever after," But that's what it feels like right now.
not_available Okay, let's do this thing.
not_available "Let's do this thing"? 
not_available No analyzing.
not_available I'm not analyzing.
not_available I'm loving.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Coffee
not_available I can't even smell it.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We come together on this beautiful day, To witness and celebrate the union of Nate and lisa.
not_available I vow to love and nurture you 
not_available I'll skip the vows.
not_available No, you can watch the vows.
not_available I'll watch them later.
not_available Have you learned all kinds of interesting things? I just wanted to see it, you know? So that I didn't do the same thing in some weird way, Make everyone uncomfortable.
not_available I was the first one to shoot this location.
not_available We used it in "pack up your 
sorrows the mimi farina story." Isn't it gorgeous? 
not_available This is going to be different.
not_available I want it to be perfect.
not_available It's already perfect, even if it rains 
not_available And everybody gets soaked.
not_available That's why I got the tent.
not_available Even if the band sucks and the food is rancid.
not_available That's why we're only having hors d'oeuvres.
not_available I love how weddings erase the past.
not_available Like a coat of white primer.
not_available Slap a veil on her and the biggest slutbag on the planet Becomes a fresh
not_available faced ingenue.
not_available Oh, I'm gonna puke.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Is it the coffee? You okay, Bren? God damn it! Yeah well, that's not what she told me.
not_available Who wanted tuna fish? Hold the mercury! Well, you're an idiot! 
not_available George? If you want mercury, i'll give you mercury.
not_available Hell, our bloodstream's already full of it.
not_available It's in all the water.
not_available The rivers are poisoned.
not_available The ocean's poisoned! 
not_available George.
not_available No.
not_available No! No! No! No! No! I just don't know how this could have happened.
not_available I mean, they had such a good relationship, I thought.
not_available They never fought.
not_available I just don't understand.
not_available Some things in life We can never understand exactly why they happened.
not_available But it's so unfair.
not_available She was just starting to really be herself For the first time in her life.
not_available That's rough When people are just starting over.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Your husband is suffering from a condition Called "depressive psychosis." The hallucinations, paranoia and delusions Are all characteristic.
not_available We generally get good results from a combination of tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotic medications.
not_available But how did this happen? Any kind of stress can trigger this type of condition.
not_available A death in the family, pressures at work, Marital conflicts.
not_available But he was fine when we met.
not_available He was so lovely.
not_available It can come and go throughout one's lifetime.
not_available And, according to his daughter, Your husband has had a long history of mental illness.
not_available What I'd like to do is get him started on the meds right away.
not_available And we'll keep him here for observation for a couple of days And see how he takes to it.
not_available I liked that girl janine.
not_available What do you think? About what? 
not_available Her sister.
not_available She was nice, I thought.
not_available I guess she was nice.
not_available She was in shock, So it's a little hard to tell what she'd be like on a date, 
not_available If that's what you're asking.
not_available Jeez.
not_available What'd he do, stab her in the eye? That's what happens to couples who never learn how to fight.
not_available "Ricky, are you there?" Uh, ricky? 
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I gotta deal with this girl.
not_available What girl? 
not_available Just someone I dated a few times.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I signed up on match.com just to 
not_available You know, get out there a little.
not_available Good for you, dude.
not_available I got to break up with her now.
not_available On an instant message? I don't want to lead her on.
not_available What do you think? "I'm looking for someone with a more positive attitude about life." That's a little harsh, dude.
not_available She should know for her other dates.
not_available She was a downer, man.
not_available That's very thoughtful, "ricky." 
Doctor we're not getting the response to the medications I was hoping for.
not_available George and I have discussed it, And we agreed our best option is to move on to e.C.T.
not_available e.C.T.? 
not_available what's? Electroconvulsive therapy.
not_available Shock treatments? 
not_available It sounds much worse than it is.
not_available We administer a slight shock to the brain to reboot the circuits as it were.
not_available But isn't that? It's a very effective treatment for this type of depression.
not_available Nothing else is working.
not_available George? How's he doing? 
not_available Much better.
not_available They think he'll only need a few more sessions.
not_available Tonight? But he's still sleeping.
not_available He should wake up in about a half hour.
not_available He may have some nausea or mild confusion, But he'll be fine to go home tonight.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available It's fine.
not_available Worst case scenario, he'll have some short
not_available term memory loss but nothing too severe.
not_available I think he should be observed one more night.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available I am not bringing him home tonight! He's not ready.
not_available All right, one night more.
not_available But tomorrow, he has to go home.
not_available We need the bed.
not_available Fuck, I forgot to buy wine.
not_available Maybe it's rude to bring wine to a pregnant house.
not_available Maybe we should just pick up some ice cream? No, we should definitely buy wine, In case they forgot that other people still drink.
not_available Can I wear this, or will everyone think I'm a total indigent? What about that purple thing in the closet? That's here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I totally thought that was lost.
not_available Maybe you should just move in.
not_available Really? You mean, like, totally? Wouldn't it just be easier? You're in my darkroom all day long 
not_available And you sleep over every night.
not_available Is that annoying? Yeah, it's annoying, that's why I want you to move in, Because I'm a total masochist.
not_available Yeah, but how would we both work in here? It's been fine so far.
not_available Okay, 'cause I totally took over your space.
not_available I could use my studio at school If I ever get inspired to make anything again.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available It would be a relief to never have to see my mother again.
not_available You're going to have to see her tonight.
not_available Would you be terribly disappointed If I couldn't make it tonight, dear? No.
not_available Is everything all right? I'm just feeling a little tired.
not_available Is George okay? 
not_available He's coming home tomorrow.
not_available That's great.
not_available Is he going to be able to make it to the wedding? Make it to the wedding? Do you have any idea what kind of state he's in? I'm sorry.
not_available I thought he was better.
not_available He is better.
not_available He's just not himself yet.
not_available You sure you don't want to join us? Yes.
not_available I just need one last quiet night.
not_available I'll be in by 9:00 tomorrow if you need help with anything.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available You look great! Thank you.
not_available I feel like shit! Hey.
not_available Welcome.
not_available Non
not_available Alcoholic sparkling cider.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available So mom's not coming.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because she hates me.
not_available She doesn't hate you anymore.
not_available Now she hates Claire.
not_available Why does she hate Claire? Mom thinks she's flushing her life down the toilet.
not_available Because she's taking the semester off.
not_available Not because she's dating my brother.
not_available Uh, no! Just the school thing.
Brenda because she's taking off one semester? I think she's terrified that Claire won't go back, And mom's biggest regret in life is that she never went to college.
not_available So if Claire doesn't graduate, it's like she Failed twice or something.
not_available It's time for somebody to take a bath.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available You sure? Yeah! I got to pee anyway for the billionth time today.
not_available Where does it all come from? Bye! 
not_available Bye! We'll go have a bath.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available She knows we all think Billy's a bomb waiting to go off.
not_available What does she think? She thinks he's fine when he's on his medication And he's been taking it for a long time, so whatever.
not_available I could almost deal with the guy if he wasn't fucking my little sister.
not_available He's better than gabe.
not_available Come on, he was a drug
not_available crazed killer.
not_available He didn't kill the guy, he shot at him.
not_available She should have stayed with her nice gay boyfriend.
not_available That guy was an asshole.
not_available She knows how to pick them.
not_available They're here! Hey, Billy! Come on in! How you doing, Billy? 
not_available Good.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, guys! Where's mom? 
not_available She's not coming.
not_available Do your parents still live in ohio? 
not_available Columbus, yeah.
not_available Where did you grow up? 
not_available L.A.
not_available West adams area, near where I work.
not_available I don't know L.A.
not_available that well.
not_available How long have you been here? 
not_available Four years, But it's so big! My hours are crazy at the dentist, Because people schedule their appointments Before and after regular work hours, and on weekends too.
not_available So 
not_available Yeah, my business too.
not_available You're never off.
not_available You could always get a call.
not_available That must be convenient for dating.
not_available Uh, what? 
not_available Like, when you want to get out of a date, You can have a friend call you and pretend to be a dead person or whatever.
not_available Come on.
not_available I wouldn't do that! How's it going with the adoption thing? We have two interviews left for the home study.
not_available Then we just have to wait for a referral.
not_available What's a referral? 
not_available A kid.
not_available Wow.
not_available How long will you have to wait? 
not_available Anywhere from a week to many years.
not_available That's got to be hard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But they all say sometimes being gay helps you get chosen faster.
not_available In this backward country? The birth mothers have to look at thousands of pictures of 
not_available straight white people.
not_available So we kind of pop out.
not_available It's so weird to imagine going through all that
not_available Nine months and a delivery and you don't even want the kid.
not_available I mean, who would do that? 
not_available Christians.
not_available No, not only.
not_available Some women just can't deal with making a decision, And they leave it too long.
not_available But they don't even get money, right? We'll have to pay the hospital bills.
not_available That's where they can scam you.
not_available If they change their mind, you're left with the bill.
not_available That rarely happens.
not_available It really makes you see the appeal of a surrogate.
not_available It does? Yeah.
not_available That and wanting to have your own kid.
not_available Yeah, but there are so many kids who already exist who need homes, Why would we want to make another one? For the same reason straight people do.
not_available But given that it's not quite as easy for us, Why would we do something so extreme? Why should we be the ones who don't get to have our own kids, Just because we're gay? It's not because we're gay.
not_available I just don't think a child has to have my genes For me to feel like it's mine.
not_available I'm sure people love adopted kids as much as their own.
not_available I mean, obviously.
not_available Maybe.
not_available It's easy to say when you have your own.
not_available I love Maya.
not_available And you still wanted one of your own.
not_available You just think you don't deserve to have what everyone else has.
not_available Would anybody have more wine if I open another bottle? Yes.
not_available You think you're the only one with dreams that don't work out? We both got what we settled for.
not_available I think you just don't love me anymore.
not_available I do love you.
not_available Hello! You're home early.
not_available Yeah, well, first date, you know.
not_available How was it? It was okay.
not_available Well, good night.
not_available Would you like some Sambuca? Sure.
not_available Unless 
not_available I don't want to disturb you.
not_available Oh no.
not_available I want to hear about it.
not_available Was this the dental hygienist or the investment banker? The hygienist.
not_available Sharon.
not_available The banker was too shiny.
not_available You know It may have just been an unfortunate lotion.
not_available But let's hear about sharon.
not_available Well, uh, she was nice.
not_available I liked her, I guess.
not_available Did you get a sense of what kind of person she was? Does she seem solid? Yeah, definitely solid.
not_available It's so important.
not_available To feel you could rely on someone.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's interesting, this whole dating thing.
not_available I never really did it before vanessa.
not_available Enjoy it, dear.
not_available But try not to be blinded by lust, if you can.
not_available Hey, do you guys want to get high? I could get high.
not_available I've got some really good pot.
not_available I've got some.
not_available I actually have some in my jacket.
not_available You do? It's left over from when we went to the hollywood bowl.
not_available That's too old.
not_available I just got this.
not_available Mine cost $200 for an eighth.
not_available Let's smoke that.
not_available It's inside.
not_available Don't tell Keith we're smoking.
not_available He gets really annoying when he's high.
not_available I don't want to make a big deal about it in front of Brenda.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available Billy can't smoke because of all his medications.
not_available So how's mom? When was the last time you talked to her? You might want to call her tomorrow before the wedding 
not_available So it's not tense.
not_available She can call me.
not_available There you go.
not_available So, um, what do you guys think about Billy? He's in a pretty good place, you think? Yeah.
not_available Definitely.
not_available Good place, what does that mean? Just that he's doing really well.
not_available It doesn't mean I won't lay awake at night worrying About the fact you're in his bed.
not_available That's a nice thing to say about your wife's brother.
not_available She knows how I feel.
not_available It is so unfair to hold things that happened years ago against someone.
not_available That's saying that people can't change! I mean, you changed! Yeah, I've changed, But I'm not totally fucking insane.
not_available I didn't try and carve a tattoo off somebody's ass.
not_available Shut up! Here.
not_available What? I don't know.
not_available Did you have a bad dream? Maybe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? Oh my god, I'm bleeding.
not_available Oh, Nate! 
not_available Okay okay okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm going to try to schedule the d&amp;c; for tomorrow morning.
not_available We can't do it tomorrow.
not_available We're getting married.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bren, we can cancel.
not_available No, we have to do it today.
not_available I can't get an anesthesiologist today.
not_available We have to do it tomorrow, Bren.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Can it wait till monday? Sure, monday's fine.
not_available Then we'll do it monday.
not_available Hey, how's it going? Good.
not_available Is that me? No, it's Nate.
not_available No, these pieces? That's Brenda.
not_available Narcissist.
not_available Well, it looks like me.
not_available Well, they're not.
not_available This is a wedding present.
not_available Why would I have you in there? Because she can marry Nate, but she'll always love me.
not_available She is me! No! Are you upset with me? No, I was just concentrating.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll leave you alone.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available How do I get to my room? You mean our room? Our bedroom? If that's what it is.
not_available Come on upstairs now.
not_available We'll get you unpacked.
David you made it clear we're only considering a surrogate? Yeah.
not_available Now what about Tamara? She's got your forehead, an I.Q.
not_available of 120.
not_available She's 5'2" and she weighs 160 lbs.
not_available Maybe that's why she costs less than the other ones.
not_available It's not like I wouldn't love an obese child, But I'd rather not sign up for a lifetime of body issues, Especially if we get a girl.
not_available If we get a girl, you better hope she's obese.
not_available I'm not having some Running around sunset boulevard with her ass crack showing.
not_available Hey, Rog, what's up? Yeah.

not_available You should bring a real date.
not_available To a wedding? Isn't that weird? You should bring someone so it won't be boring.
not_available What happened with that makeup artist dana? She sounded nice.
not_available Yeah, she was too I don't know, cheerful or something.
not_available Nobody's perfect.
not_available You have to give people a chance to grow on you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't take this the wrong way, but No one's you.
not_available That's sweet, but I was never me either.
not_available Yes, you were 
not_available No, if you were this picky when we were going out, you never would have married me.
not_available You just have to find someone you like and be nice to them.
not_available Is that how it is with kenny? Oh.
not_available That didn't work out.
not_available Really? What happened? Ugh, he's a pig.
not_available I don't even want to talk about it.
not_available But I'm too busy for all that now.
not_available It's okay for me.
not_available I don't need someone as much as you do.
not_available Oh really? It's not a bad thing, Rico.

not_available Nate's.
not_available My son.
not_available I know who Nate is.
not_available Who is he marrying? Brenda his girlfriend? That's wonderful! Of course I'll be there.
not_available This is an important passage for Nate From being a widower to starting again as a householder.
not_available I want to support him.
not_available If you don't think it's too much for you.
not_available Too much? My only son is getting married! Well, why don't we see how you feel tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it for the world.
not_available The splendid young man who came to the throne in 1509, By 1547 had become a revolting swollen mass of putrefying flesh.
not_available You want the vicodin or some naproxen? 
not_available Vicodin please.
not_available All right.
not_available Here.
not_available Cramps are pretty bad, huh? I just want to get a whole lot number.
not_available God, this is so not the vision I had of the night before my wedding.
not_available Where is the stripper? It would be so easy to postpone this for a couple of weeks.
not_available It would not be easy.
not_available And it would cost a fortune.
not_available So what? It's just money.
not_available I'd rather not even have a wedding Than have to deal with rescheduling everything.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's just
not_available We can run off to vegas.
not_available Yeah right.
not_available Come on, you loved that idea.
not_available That was before I spent six months planning my stupid fucking dream wedding.
not_available That's why I think we should reschedule.
not_available It's only going to be depressing.
not_available For you? 
not_available Yeah, for me! And it's going to be depressing for you too, I think.
not_available It's not as depressing as calling 100 people And telling them that it's canceled because I lost my fucking baby, Which I just told the whole world I was having.
not_available Why did you let me tell so many fucking people? I just I don't think that you I don't think you realize how upset you are.
not_available Don't tell me how I feel! I think I know how upset I am! Then why are we going through with this? Because when I think about not doing it, I want to throw myself under a bus.
not_available I want to swallow razor blades.
not_available I'm gonna have to take every painkiller in the house Just so I could pick up the phone and cancel the caterer.
not_available Then fuck it! Let's get married.
not_available Okay? It will be a great day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can have one of my vicodin if you want.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Just make sure you leave enough for tomorrow.
not_available which meant that he constantly stank of rotting flesh.
not_available Oh god.
not_available Are these big granny
not_available panties your "something old"? Because they really kill the mood.
not_available You can't see them through the dress, can you? No, but they're hideous, sweetie.
not_available Would it kill you to wear a thong? These are fine.
not_available What's the matter? Nothing's the matter.
not_available I just don't want to wear a thong.

not_available You know it happens all the time So many of my friends Joanie, Celia, aunt Mary before she had Deb.
not_available Even Teresa Heinz Kerry had one.
not_available And God knows, she looks terrific.
not_available Aunt mary did? 
not_available I'm telling you, More women have miscarried Than they have masturbated with a dildo.

not_available And then they have a baby, And then they're fine, sweetie.
not_available I'd better change this fucking pad.
not_available If I get blood on this dress I'm gonna kill myself.

not_available No no no.
not_available I don't want to wait.
not_available No, I mean, to grieve.
not_available With all the fucked up shit that's happened in my life, I don't want to grieve anymore.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't! I don't have it in me.
not_available Well, maybe Brenda needs to
not_available What Brenda needs to do is get pregnant again.
not_available Soon.
not_available 'Cause it's not like she's 20.
not_available Yeah, but With all the stuff Keith and I have been reading, It seems psychological stress can affect a woman's chances
not_available It's the only thing that's gonna make her feel better! Why should I wait? Why put it off? Because bad shit happened and we need to feel bad? Bad shit happens every day.
not_available You of all people should know that.
not_available Move fucking on, you know? Anyway, I've already got Maya so it's not for me.
not_available But it'll be your child, your flesh and blood.
not_available How could it not be for you? 
not_available Because it's what Brenda wants More than anything, and i can make that happen for her.
not_available Listen, the justice of the peace is here.
not_available I take you, Nate, With all your strengths and faults As I offer myself to you With all my strengths and faults.
not_available From this day forward, I will be there when you need help And turn to you When I need help.
not_available I promise myself to you forever.
not_available I vow to trust, To honor and to cherish, To share and support your hopes, Your thoughts and your dreams As long as we both shall live.
not_available By the power vested in me from the state of california, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
not_available You may kiss the bride.
not_available So is it weird to see Brenda get married? "Weird"? No, it's great.
not_available I mean, because you guys used to be so close? I'm really happy.
not_available I'm happy we're both in healthy relationships.
not_available With siblings.
not_available It's funny how you both ended up with another set of siblings.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available It's funny that you and Nate did too.
not_available God, what do you think it means? 
not_available It was a nice ceremony.
not_available It was.
not_available You got a little choked up, didn't you? Yeah.
not_available I love weddings.
not_available Don't you? Sure.
not_available If it's right.
not_available The last one I went to, the people hated each other, 
not_available So it was depressing.
not_available God damn it! It's so frustrating to not be able to help her! But you did help her.
not_available You helped her as much as anyone could under the circumstances.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I really believe in marriage.
not_available A lot of guys today don't even know how to make a commitment, But I was married 11 years.
not_available I'm the kind of person who's better with someone.
not_available Someone special, I mean.
not_available That's sweet.
not_available They couldn't have picked a prettier location.
not_available It looks beautiful.
not_available All right, that's enough of that one.
not_available All right.
not_available Lovely! A family portrait with two new Fishers.
not_available Okay, what's next? 
not_available How about mom and George? Okay, I'm just gonna freshen up.
not_available Okay, mom.

not_available Let me take that glass.
not_available Mom, it's fine.
not_available Sorry.

not_available What? Have a little respect! Oh my god.
not_available It's not funny! Oh my.
not_available May I have some seltzer please, no ice? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Mom, are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What happened with Claire? 
not_available She's in such a terrible phase.
not_available She's so out of control in her life, She doesn't care about anyone else's feelings.
not_available What did she do? 
not_available She took a rude picture of George In an extremely compromised state.
not_available There's ice in this.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sure she didn't mean it that way.
not_available She's always trying to make some statement! Yes, this is her way of saying I'm the fool Who has to take care of a crazy person for the rest of my life! I don't think she was trying to say that.
not_available I don't need a photograph to see that.
not_available I don't need to have my face shoved in it.
not_available Mom, we'll get you some help, a nurse or something.
not_available God! No! I'm still the one who has to be there all day and every night.
not_available Why do you ? 
not_available Because there's no one else! Excuse me, dear.
not_available I have to clean the stain on his jacket before it sets.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Who's the third one for? 
not_available That's to put under our pillow.
not_available So who do you dream of if you're already married? You dream of a future love.
not_available You mean our second husbands? No.
not_available We could dream of our child.
not_available Or just get frosting in our ears.
not_available I think we should go forward with the surrogate.
not_available Really? Why? Because you want your own child.
not_available And I don't want to be the one who denies you that.
not_available Want to be the one who helps you to have what you want.
not_available What about the kids who need homes? We can do both.
not_available I think we should do both.
not_available One of each? Which one comes first? Whichever shows up first.
not_available What if they both show up at the same time? Then we'll be really busy.
not_available You're serious.
not_available All right then.
not_available You don't have to worry about it being like my wedding.
not_available I had a threeMonth
not_available Old baby when I got married, So it was a much happier event, obviously.
not_available Really joyful.
not_available It all came very naturally to me.
not_available But I was always maternal, unlike you.
not_available I'm fucking maternal.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Look at your past.
not_available What about my past? You're a slutbag! You were.
not_available That's got nothing to do with it.
not_available Of course it does.
not_available All the moments of your life have led to this one.
not_available You're being punished.
not_available I don't believe in that.
not_available Your insides must have gotten damaged from all that anonymous cock.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available That's why this happened to you.
not_available Look at that nice woman over there.
not_available She's got her baby.
not_available Everybody treated her like a princess for the whole nine months.
not_available There's a pregnant goddess, due in six weeks.
not_available She has two at home.
not_available She doesn't know it yet, but she's pregnant.
not_available She wasn't even trying! Boy, is she going to be thrilled.
not_available Twins! They'll be here in june.
not_available I'm gonna get my baby, you bitch.
not_available I got pregnant the fourth time I tried.
not_available I didn't have to try.
not_available But I never partied like you did.
not_available It's a miracle you even conceived! A lot of women have miscarriages! They don't talk about it so people don't realize.
not_available None of the women at this wedding have.
not_available Except you, of course.
not_available You're just bitter because you had to get pregnant to get Nate to marry you.
not_available I'm bitter? Who's drunk and yelling at a dead woman? And she might not even be his daughter! You were having an affair with your sister's husband! That was purely a spiritual thing.
not_available Nate is Maya's father.
not_available He's my husband, and he always will be.
not_available You will never feel his arms around you again.
not_available You'll never feel the air on your skin, Or wake up in a warm bed.
not_available You're done.
not_available You don't get the chance to try again for anything.
not_available So what? 
not_available So I can.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Every time you try to have a nice normal life, You fuck it up.
not_available You're never going to have your happilyEver
not_available After moment, No matter how many white veils you put on.
not_available You're just too fucked up for all that.
not_available Maybe you should just accept that, Instead of trying to be something you're not.
not_available Are you okay? Bren? 
not_available You were right.
not_available I should never have tried to have this stupid day, This idiotic tent, the dumb
not_available Ass wedding band.
not_available It's such a fucking cliche.
not_available Just to prove that I deserve my own special fucking day, Which I don't.
not_available Brenda, the only reasonThe only reason why i 
not_available No, come on! You knew.
not_available It was a pathetic attempt to become something I'm not, that we're not.
not_available I thought you might be too upset to enjoy the day.
not_available But it's so perfect this way! It's so perfect.
not_available The only way that I get to get married in a long white gown Is to have my dead baby leaking out of me all day.
not_available That's me.
not_available That's what i get for my wedding.
not_available You're really upset, maybe you shouldn't be drinking.
not_available Are you kidding me? This glass of champagne is the only thing in my universe right now.
not_available You have me.
not_available You don't really fucking want me.
not_available Not that I blame you.
not_available Who would? I do.
not_available Well then, you're a very disturbed person.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Don't be nice to me! What do you want me to do? You want me to hit you? Yes! That would feel fucking fantastic! Come here.
not_available I thought you were going to hit me.
not_available No.
not_available I'm disturbed, I'm not violent.
not_available You were when you threw your ring at me.
not_available Oh, memories.
not_available I'm glad today sucked
not_available 'Cause I wouldn't want the happiest day of our life To be over already, would you? No.
not_available It's coming, right? It's coming.
not_available It fucking better be.
not_available Brenda? Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available You can't come in for this.
not_available Can you hold this?
