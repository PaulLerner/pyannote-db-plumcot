not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available I need to sit down.
not_available Oh, God, I'm so fat! So what papers do you need me to sign? Don't tell me I forgot them.
not_available I'm forgetting everything.
not_available It's because of the hormones.
not_available Which, by the way, made me a complete freak the last time I saw you.
not_available I'm sorry again for being so hostile.
not_available How are you doing? It's so good to see you again.
not_available Hi, Lisa, I didn't know you were in town.
not_available What's new? Doing the whole single
not_available mom routine.
not_available Right, I can see that.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Are you taking pictures these days? No.
not_available I took some photos with a friend's camera and I wanted to keep doing it.
not_available So I went on eBay and I got my own.
not_available But it was really just because I was bored and it was kind of stupid.
not_available But I have to go to school.
not_available So I'll see you later.
not_available I'll be out in a second.
not_available Shit! Okay, let's go.
not_available Hey, you think your chair seems right for that space? You said you were kidding about me not bringing my ugly
not_available ass furniture.
not_available It's so big.
not_available It's a really good chair for watching television.
not_available I guess.
not_available Maybe it is too big.
not_available I think it is.
not_available It's too big.
not_available You know, I'll put it in storage with the rest of my stuff.
not_available Shit.
not_available I gotta return The Great Escape today.
not_available I'm gonna be fucking late.
not_available I'll return it.
not_available It's on my way.
not_available I never get tired of watching Steve McQueen.
not_available I think I've seen every one of his movies at least three times.
not_available Yeah, some of them four times.
not_available Wow, this is Since I want your name on the birth certificate my lawyer says you need to sign away all custodial rights.
not_available I thought 
not_available What? I thought we were gonna be more casual about this.
not_available It's a baby.
not_available It's hard to be that casual about it.
not_available Right.
not_available Maybe I should have my lawyer look at this.
not_available It's just a formality.
not_available Cut the bullshit and just sign it.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know what's weird about dead people? 
not_available Everything? How they look so perfect.
not_available I just want to mess this woman's hair up a little bit.
not_available Please don't.
not_available When I die, I want to be one big mess.
not_available That's what life 
is Messy.
not_available Nate, I'm not accusing you.
not_available It's better this way.
not_available We both know that.
not_available I mean, I can't lie.
not_available Of course, I would've loved to do this with someone who wanted to be a father.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know what else to 
not_available But then I think how perfect this baby is.
not_available And everything somehow seems right.
not_available You know, somehow it's just so funny.
not_available And you know, actually, I'm proud, in a weird way.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I mean, I'm having a child with the last person in the world who would ever want a child.
not_available Why aren't you wearing your casts? I take them off.
not_available It's time for me to go.
not_available But you're supposed to keep them on until next week.
not_available I'm calling the doctor.
not_available He say it's okay.
not_available Look.
not_available See? Your left foot looks purple.
not_available Is always like that.
not_available Is from bad circulation.
not_available You know that.
not_available I guess I forgot.
not_available Okay, it's time to get this show on the road, yeah? I guess I could call a taxi even though it's a total rip
not_available off.
not_available I can drive you! It was a heart attack.
not_available He died just like that.
not_available So you want a traditional Thai Buddhist service? If that's a problem, we can go somewhere else.
not_available There are very specific elements, and if you can't do it Please do not behave this way.
not_available You will have to excuse my son.
not_available He and my husband hadn't spoken in months, and Mom, please.
not_available Not in front of this person.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Fisher, if you know the procedure, let's hear it.
not_available Actually, I've only been here for a year or so, and Although I did read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance in high school That's probably my brother.
not_available David! Sorry I'm late.
not_available I had to stop at Video West.
not_available Some idiot ahead of me was writing a check.
not_available I didn't even want to watch a movie last night, but Keith got his way, as usual.
not_available This is 
not_available Bette and Phil Srisai.
not_available I'm David Fisher.
not_available I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.
not_available I'm so sorry for your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We were just discussing my father's service.
not_available I assume the deceased will remain at the temple for three days before we have the service here? Of course, Fisher &amp; Sons will provide all the requisite 
supplies The Buddha, the altar, the carpet
not_available kneelers.
not_available And you'll want some monks for chanting.
not_available We prefer to use the ones from Riverside but if those aren't to your liking, we have some good ones over in Eagle Rock.
not_available Nikolai, your apartment is so It's very It has a lot of charm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I still don't know what your big rush was.
not_available You could've stayed with me until It was time.
not_available But how do we know you're safe here? You could be hurt by these ruffians.
not_available I spoke to Yuri.
not_available I tell him that February is the biggest month for flowers.
not_available He say he give me 30 days to come up with the money.
not_available Are you gonna be able to do it? 
not_available Yeah, sure, of course.
not_available Well, that's nice.
not_available Thank you for all the taking care of me.
not_available You don't have to do that now.
not_available You are done.
not_available What about dinner? You probably don't have any food.
not_available I was gonna pack you lamb, but I forgot.
not_available I'll go get the lamb.
not_available No, I'll be fine.
not_available I get takeout from Eata
not_available Pita.
not_available Goodbye, Nikolai.
not_available Goodbye, Ruthie.
not_available I bet you Mr.
not_available Van Kirk has sex with students in here after hours.
not_available We should stake this place out later, okay? Claire? 
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available I think there was dust on the negative.
not_available No one's gonna notice.
not_available No, I want it to be perfect.
not_available Claire, these are so sick! 
not_available Thanks.
not_available I've taken shots of almost every single person that's come through in the past three weeks.
not_available They're amazing.
not_available It's like each one is someone who's lying in bed with you telling you a little story before you go to sleep.
not_available I'm putting them together for that thing for Foster's class.
not_available The fucking Spoon River Anthology paper? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just thought that since each poem is from the perspective of a dead person that it would be a really interesting way to I don't know.
not_available Show what the poems brought out in me.
not_available Okay, that sounded really geeky.
not_available No, that's genius.
not_available You could really do something with this.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Claire, I have to tell you something.
not_available I got into Yale.
not_available I heard yesterday.
not_available You don't feel jealous or hate me, right? No.
not_available You worked really hard for it.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I know you didn't play the game the way I did but I'm sure you'll get into UCLA, which is a really good school, too.
not_available Actually, no, I didn't make the cut.
not_available But they sent me a list of community colleges I could go to and said to try again next year.
not_available So I'm looking at East Valley.
not_available I'm gonna be a famous photographer and make a gazillion dollars taking pictures of anorexic models and fucked
not_available up actors.
not_available So maybe I don't even need to go to college, right? It's a joke.
not_available I'm joking.
not_available But you could.
not_available You should just become a photographer.
not_available Because, truthfully, East Valley is kind of a shitty school.
not_available So there was that one a month ago in the bookstore.
not_available Then I met this other guy at the Farmers Market.
not_available That place has gotten so touristy.
not_available And then there was this guy last week at the Rose Caf√©, who No, that doesn't count.
not_available That was an almost one.
not_available What exactly do you hope to get out of therapy? Melissa gave me your number because I guess I'm I don't know.
not_available It's not that I'm unhappy.
not_available I'm not unhappy.
not_available I'm really not.
not_available But I know that what I'm doing is a little strange.
not_available I mean, most people who are engaged to someone they really love don't have sex with strangers.
not_available Or maybe they do.
not_available Does that matter? I think I like the euphoria I get from these encounters.
not_available I'm just having a little trouble with anxiety.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's like I'm coexisting in these two separate realities.
not_available There's my Nate reality, and then there's this other reality.
not_available And I would like to not feel so anxious about it.
not_available It's not guilt.
not_available It's just edginess.
not_available So, that's it.
not_available I'd like to not feel edgy.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available Okay, so you would like to continue to have these encounters, as you call them 
not_available but you would like to not feel edgy.
not_available Ideally.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available You think that I'm afraid of intimacy so I'm trying to sabotage my relationship with my fianc√©.
not_available Is that what I'm thinking or is that what you're thinking? No.
not_available I just wanted to clarify that I don't necessarily think that what I'm doing is destructive.
not_available It might even be healthy.
not_available How so? Maybe it's not good for me to totally lose myself in one person and this is a way for me to have a completely separate, private area that's my own.
not_available Not his, not ours.
not_available Maybe that's healthy for me.
not_available Listen, I assume that Melissa told you one of my specialties is sexual addiction.
not_available No.
not_available I don't know how much you know of this issue, but obviously it involves the sublimation of emotions that are too painful to address.
not_available It's the root of all addiction, really.
not_available I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you because you don't need help.
not_available You've clearly evolved beyond the need for therapy.
not_available I'm actually in awe of you because I'd be fucking strangers like a truckstop whore on crack if I wasn't so inhibited by my Judeo
not_available Christian upbringing.
not_available It's not down here.
not_available We used to have a few Buddhas in here.
not_available I can't believe we can't find one.
not_available I've read all this stuff about Buddhism, but it never stays with me.
not_available Just know that everything is nothing.
not_available Is that it? I thought it was, "Nothing is everything." It's the same thing, isn't it? 
not_available I found one.
not_available It looks kind of girly, doesn't it? 
not_available Sort of.
not_available Think it's water damage.
not_available I'll get you some stuff to clean him off, okay? His little hat is cute, so pointy.
not_available I wonder if anyone poked their eyes out on one by accident.
not_available Look at all these unclaimed cremains.
not_available Can you imagine having a member of your family cremated and then not caring enough to pick up their ashes? I think sometimes it's too hard for people to acknowledge that someone they loved is now just chunks of soot.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Hey.
not_available Yes, I returned the videos.
not_available Didn't I say I would? Sure, swordfish is fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Bye.
not_available You hate swordfish.
not_available I know.
not_available It's funny.
not_available Now that Keith and I are living together I find myself trying to be so fucking agreeable all the time.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because, if you aren't, things come up and you've no idea how big the thing's gonna be.
not_available It's like this constant negotiation.
not_available You can never just relax.
not_available Is that just a phase or is it always going to be like that? Don't ask me.
not_available Look, I have no fucking idea.
not_available Maybe that's just what a relationship is.
not_available Constantly doing things you have absolutely no desire to do.
not_available Nate, Brenda, come on in! We have so many details to go over before the bridal shower on Sunday.
not_available Isn't it exciting? It's all too much for me.
not_available Please, it's all for you.
not_available I'd rather just cancel it.
not_available Are you mad? Lulu Smeigel cancelled her weekend at Canyon Ranch just to be here.
not_available Now, you must try one of these.
not_available It's made from this incredible liqueur that comes from the most poverty
not_available stricken village in Belize.
not_available It's delicious! 
not_available Right.
not_available Your trip.
not_available You look like you had a good time.
not_available It was fabulous! Your skin looks good.
not_available Did you have some work done? Not at all.
not_available It's just happiness.
not_available You should try it sometime.
not_available Is Billy here? No.
not_available When I got back, I found a note saying he's staying with friends in Portland.
not_available But he didn't leave a number.
not_available Brenda, did he give it to you? 
not_available No, he didn't.
not_available That's right.
not_available He still has all that raging resentment towards you.
not_available Who are you hiding in the bedroom? Let me guess.
not_available Another one of your young South American gigolos? Not at all, darling.
not_available He's an aging intellectual from the Bronx.
not_available Isn't this fabulous? Bern and I are back, and better than ever.
not_available So I realized I'd made a terrible mistake, got on the next plane to Belize and begged your mother to take me back.
not_available Come on, be honest, dear.
not_available The whore dumped you.
not_available Because I was subconsciously pushing her away because I really love you.
not_available The point is, the sex has been incredible.
not_available Just like when we first met.
not_available I'll never forget what you were wearing the first time you walked into my office.
not_available The tight Givenchy blue skirt with a slit that went right up to my wazoo.
not_available I knew immediately I was gonna have some wildly inappropriate feelings for you.
not_available And, boy, was I right! Mom was one of Dad's patients.
not_available It's actually kind of disgusting.
not_available I was not a patient.
not_available I was in grad school.
not_available I was an intern.
not_available And the second I lay down I knew I was never gonna get up off that couch.
not_available We terminated therapy after a few months and waited the correct amount of time before embarking on a relationship.
not_available At least, that's what we tell everyone.
not_available I'll give you a hand with that.
not_available Okay, what? I can't believe you just took him back.
not_available Are you that scared of being alone? God, you're so fucking depressing.
not_available I love your father.
not_available And I'm very happy.
not_available You noticed it yourself.
not_available Maybe that's what's upsetting you so much, that I'm so happy.
not_available I'm sorry for whatever tensions this engagement is bringing up in you and Nate.
not_available But my advice to you is get your shit together and don't blow it with this one.
not_available Because you are a major handful.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I noticed a coffee stain on the couch.
not_available I was trying to get it out.
not_available You still mad at me about the swordfish? You should've told me you didn't like it instead of waiting till I slaved over it.
not_available You're right.
not_available I should've told you.
not_available So why didn't you? Because you scare me.
not_available Shut the fuck up.
not_available You want everything to be perfect, all the time.
not_available When it's not, you get upset.
not_available I didn't get any sleep last night.
not_available I'm too tired for this conversation.
not_available Sometimes I feel like if I don't do or say exactly what you want you might decide you don't want to be with me.
not_available That's just stupid.
not_available Thanks.
not_available When we were together the first time it seemed like all our problems stemmed from my not coming out.
not_available They did.
not_available Now I think it was just easier for you to make us believe that.
not_available If everything could be blamed on my not coming out then nothing ever had to be your fault.
not_available What's under that arm right here? Hey, Nate! Hey! 
not_available Say hello to Nate.
not_available Hello.
not_available You didn't like that? All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Look, Vanessa's sister, she's got this publicist and the first thing she does is get her invited to some spa thing in Long Beach.
not_available So? So she took Vanessa and the baby.
not_available Now my sitter's sick, so here we are.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hirsch needs to be finished by 1:00.
not_available I have a kid, okay? These type of things happen.
not_available Anyhow, I gave Mrs.
not_available Hirsch the once
not_available over.
not_available She's a young breast cancer.
not_available Piece of cake.
not_available Hopefully I'll get a sitter in time to do her.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available My hands are tied here, okay? Unless you take care of Julio while I do Mrs.
not_available Hirsch.
not_available No 
not_available Come on, I don't see you doing anything.
not_available Look, I can't.
not_available I have to clean a Buddha.
not_available He looks like he's asleep.
not_available He's not.
not_available He's just blissed out because he has the secret to enlightenment.
not_available What's "enlightmintz"? 
not_available I guess it's knowing everything.
not_available My dad knows everything.
not_available Well, he knows a lot.
not_available He knows everything.
not_available How much do you know? Not much.
not_available Ruthie? Did we have plans? 
not_available No.
not_available Does that mean I have to go away? I do not need my house to smell like fake lemons.
not_available It smells good already.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available I like everything the way it is.
not_available But I don't.
not_available I thought I would Isn't this fun? It's a surprise sleepover.
not_available Okay, let's do it, sure.
not_available Then let's get started.
not_available Okay.
not_available First, we have to get this place into shape, so we can have a nice, cozy, clean evening.
not_available We're going to wallpaper? No, silly.
not_available It's contact paper for the drawers.
not_available Ruthie, why do I want little cherries in my drawers? It's hard to explain.
not_available You just do.
not_available You failed me? I'm sorry, Claire, but I asked for a literary analysis.
not_available So you didn't think they were any good? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available This is an English class.
not_available I wanted something in English.
not_available So you'd just prefer I download some stupid crap off the Internet than do something that's actually creative? I don't have time for this.
not_available Would you just do the make
not_available over? I was really happy with Mrs.
not_available Sibley.
not_available "The secret of woman, the soil.
not_available "My 
secret Under a mound that you shall never find." Just so you know, I put a lot of myself into this.
not_available I wasn't just slacking off.
not_available Look, I don't want to fail you.
not_available Just give me some kind of paper.
not_available I assume you need to graduate.
not_available You are going to college, right? 
not_available Yup, East Valley.
not_available Really? I went there.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm calling to tell you we're having lunch with Taylor and Karla on Saturday.
not_available You can't just schedule things without asking me first.
not_available That's not what couples do.
not_available How would you know what couples do? 
not_available I watch TV.
not_available Or at least I used to when I had a comfortable chair to sit in.
not_available Listen, I was in the middle of five things at work, okay? You know, not everyone can always act so perfect.
not_available Yeah, I know that.
not_available That's what I was trying to tell you last night.
not_available You should check with me before you say yes to things.
not_available Are you available? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then pretend I asked you first.
not_available So I went the one time, but I'm not going back to Dr.
not_available Michaelson.
not_available Are you annoyed? No, why would I be annoyed? 
not_available You can do whatever you want.
not_available I'm sure she's good.
not_available She's just not for me.
not_available You didn't tell me she was so serious.
not_available I didn't realize you were looking for laughs.
not_available I can ask around for more names.
not_available My friend Paula's been to 40 shrinks although I guess that's not the best endorsement for them.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I think I'm the only one that can solve any of my problems.
not_available Yeah, we are ultimately stuck with ourselves.
not_available It's so fucking puritanical how we're conditioned to buy into the whole trueIove
not_available monogamy crap.
not_available Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
not_available So I've been thinking, the next time that I feel adventurous what if I include Nate? Not a bad idea.
not_available You remember Terry from Orange County I was telling you about? 
not_available She has the lifestyle parties on weekends.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available She and her husband are committed.
not_available They have sex with strangers once a week.
not_available They're really happy.
not_available Monogamy just isn't for everyone.
not_available I know.
not_available Look at my parents.
not_available Actually, don't look at them.
not_available That's what they want.
not_available So maybe we could go to Terry's this weekend and check it out.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available I'll give you the address.
not_available I hope you and Nate like it.
not_available I don't want to bring Nate.
not_available I mean not yet.
not_available First you and I should go and see what it's like.
not_available Okay, what do you think? It feels like a whole new place.
not_available Yes, it really does.
not_available Who am I kidding? I can't stay here.
not_available I'll never be able to stay here.
not_available It's too dank.
not_available It will always be dank.
not_available I'm only human.
not_available I can only do so much.
not_available Nikolai, this is crazy.
not_available Why aren't you moving into my house? I don't know, it's Why are you acting like we talked about this? We haven't, have we? I guess it's just been on my mind.
not_available I like how things have been for the past few months.
not_available I like seeing you every night and morning.
not_available I don't want to go backward, do you? I love you.
not_available I wish you didn't sound so sad when you say that.
not_available I wish I wanted to move in with you and be with you all the time.
not_available I want to want that more than anything.
not_available But I don't.
not_available Maybe I am the one with the problem.
not_available Maybe I have been alone and cut off for so long that I no longer know how to do it.
not_available Maybe I am not capable of it.
not_available Can't we go on as we were before accident? I think I should go home.
not_available Didn't Mom leave any real food for dinner? No, there was just a note saying she was gone for the night.
not_available So why aren't you two with your loved ones? 
not_available Late shift.
not_available Shiatsu appointment.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Give me that.
not_available It's this thing for school.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available David, look at these.
not_available That's Mrs.
not_available Steiner.
not_available Mr.
not_available Thomas.
not_available The Harrisons.
not_available Mr.
not_available Benson.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Orozco.
not_available God, Rico did an amazing job on her.
not_available So do you think they're any good? I think they fucking suck! Do you know what kind of lawsuit this could cause? What kind of stupid, fucked
not_available up child are you? I was trying to do something I gave a shit about.
not_available What's going on here? Nate, I heard you yelling.
not_available Someone please tell me what's going on.
not_available Nothing.
not_available You were spending the night out.
not_available Why are you back? That's none of your business! Hey, got some change? Fuck you, too! You're not listening to me.
not_available I said this shirt feels funny.
not_available It scratches my neck.
not_available Too bad.
not_available It's the only clean one you had and I can't take your uncle's bitching if he sees one little apple juice stain.
not_available I want to go back and get my yellow one! 
not_available I said no.
not_available Turn around, now! 
not_available You don't tell me what to do.
not_available Mom! What are you doing? 
not_available We gotta get out of here.
not_available I had no idea East Valley was so close to the freeway.
not_available It's very convenient.
not_available That's the Student Center.
not_available That's where your mailbox will be.
not_available Great.
not_available I can go there and get letters from people begging me not to kill myself.
not_available I bet you some famous people went here.
not_available Someone like David Spade.
not_available Okay, there's way too many flyers with the word "Baptist" on them.
not_available Look, you can make extra money as a phone sex operator.
not_available Yeah, Baptist phone sex.
not_available It says here they have a really good arts center.
not_available No, it's under construction.
not_available It won't be open till 2004.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I need to start being more connected to the real world.
not_available I'm thinking about taking some business courses.
not_available Mommy, we have to 
not_available Just shut up.
not_available I need to think.
not_available Okay.
not_available Nothing there.
not_available I think nothing's there.
not_available Where have I missed? 
not_available I don't want anyone to find anything.
not_available We have to tell the cops.
not_available No, we don't! We just got to pray nobody saw us.
not_available It wasn't my fault.
not_available We can't help him now.
not_available We have to tell somebody.
not_available No, we don't! God! I am so tired! I am so fucking tired of this shit! Why can't I ever have some fucking peace? Baby, we can't tell the cops.
not_available Okay? They'll take me away from you.
not_available Do you want the cops to take me away from you? 
not_available No.
not_available Then we don't tell the cops.
not_available Okay? This is our little secret.
not_available Do you hear me? Our little secret.
not_available Say it.
not_available It's our little secret.
not_available Of course they're late.
not_available I've got a turkey breast drying up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Am I boring you? No, I didn't get any sleep last night because you were kicking me for hours.
not_available You know what? I have nightmares.
not_available Is that my fault, too, like everything else? 
not_available You're 40 minutes late.
not_available Sorry, something came up.
not_available Hey, little girl.
not_available Fuck, Bren, it's just that it's Saturday night.
not_available You know, I thought we planned to on Saturday night Yeah, I know you have the shitty shower tomorrow.
not_available All right.
not_available No.
not_available Just stay at home and take care of yourself, all right? All right, bye.
not_available Maybe you shouldn't jump so hard.
not_available What if he catches us? 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Taylor, that's enough.
not_available My mom ran over somebody on Washington.
not_available What? It was an accident.
not_available It was an old, bald white guy.
not_available But we're not gonna tell anybody.
not_available It's a secret.
not_available But secrets are so stupid.
not_available People always find out about secrets.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I was just kidding.
not_available I got you, I got you good.
not_available Taylor, that's not funny.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available This is even more of a shitbox than I remembered.
not_available Do you want to get out while there's time to run? Are you kidding? This is fantastic.
not_available Melissa, you made it! Oh, crap.
not_available Hey, Terry, look at you, girl! Sex is so stupid.
not_available This is like these parties my parents used to have when I was a kid.
not_available There was always this really weird energy in the air.
not_available Just like tonight.
not_available Oh, yes, the heady haze of expectancy.
not_available Everyone got really drunk, got all handsy.
not_available Although I don't think they were official sex parties, like this one.
not_available We should mingle.
not_available This shit's amazing.
not_available I found it in my kid's room and beat the crap out of him.
not_available Don't get me started on my kids.
not_available They leave the house at all hours.
not_available I've no idea what they're up to.
not_available If I think about it too hard, I could cry.
not_available You like that? Why are you getting so upset? I'm saying, isn't it weird that Taylor made up this story? Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Because you were going on and on about the coffee stain on your couch.
not_available It was me, okay? I did it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It was me.
not_available Now shut up already about the coffee stain! Don't call her.
not_available Let's just forget it.
not_available It's just this weird thing Taylor said.
not_available I'm not calling her, idiot.
not_available Hello? Can I help you? 
not_available Hi.
not_available You killed me.
not_available It was about seven years ago, remember? You drove Lisa to have me killed.
not_available Don't get me wrong.
not_available I don't harbor any bad feelings or anything.
not_available I'm pro
not_available choice.
not_available At least I would be, if I were alive.
not_available You killed me, too.
not_available Actually, I was miscarried by the girl who worked at that Starbucks on Fremont.
not_available I don't think she was ever planning to tell you about me.
not_available Yeah, Mom was your first real girlfriend.
not_available Then I came along.
not_available You guys offed me and then broke up.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi, Daddy.
not_available Hi.
not_available Who wants cookies and milk? I know the secret to everything.
not_available But you'll never know it, because you killed us.
not_available Hitand
not_available run at Washington and Third.
not_available The vehicle's description matches Karla's car.
not_available The old, bald white guy was dead before he got to Cedars.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What do we do? 
not_available What the hell do you think we do? Marly and I were fighting night and day.
not_available And then we came to one of these parties.
not_available It was like we rediscovered each other.
not_available And things have been hot between us ever since.
not_available Isn't that such a heartwarming story? Some people just need a little extra help to stay together, you know? 
not_available There's nothing wrong with that.
not_available I'm for getting all the help I can get.
not_available Marly, show the gals that thing I got you for your birthday.
not_available This has given us another five years.
not_available This sounds good.
not_available Should we guess what it is? 
not_available No, I'll tell you.
not_available It's this little gizmo that he got online at a sex website.
not_available You've just got to see it to believe it.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available I can.
not_available I'm gonna get another drink.
not_available I can't find it.
not_available I'll just kill myself if I've lost that.
not_available Why do I lose everything? 
not_available You probably left it in your coat.
not_available I think we left them in that room over there.
not_available I'll just go help Marly for a second.
not_available Or you could come with us, if you want.
not_available Sure, I'll help you.
not_available I just saw Mr.
not_available Srisai's brotherin
not_available law put $20 in the casket.
not_available It's traveling money for his journey.
not_available Apparently, unlike the rest of us, Buddhists can take it with them.
not_available Why am I giving Brenda napkin rings? 
not_available Because that's all I had in the gift closet.
not_available Hey, they're allowed to take pictures of the dead guy, but I'm not? 
not_available That's right.
not_available They're family.
not_available Claire, we're going to be late.
not_available I can't believe I have to go to this thing.
not_available All right, look, I'm sorry.
not_available On the plus side I bet it'll take you two sips of punch before you're completely wasted.
not_available Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
not_available More punch, anyone? 
not_available Yeah, sure, I'll take another hit.
not_available That brat's over an hour late.
not_available For the life of me, I don't know how she got so damn passive
not_available aggressive.
not_available Isn't that just being aggressive? Are you sick, dear? Or are you always this deathly pale? I'm not late, am I? You most certainly are.
not_available Ice
not_available cold mini asparagus quiche, darling? What are they doing with those cups of water? It's a cleansing ritual.
not_available You rid yourself of any wrongs you've done to the deceased.
not_available You really think that changes anything? Pouring a little water into a bowl? I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Can you make sure that the monks get home all right? And you'll pour the water out from Mr.
not_available Srisai's bowl? You're supposed to do it over the oldest tree you can find.
not_available I use the one out front.
not_available I don't know why they bring so many oranges.
not_available But if there are any extra, grab some for the prep room.
not_available This punch is delicious.
not_available Your mother made it with a liqueur from Belize.
not_available It's some word with a tilde over the "n." So what's new? Actually, I spent all night doing it with this couple from Orange County.
not_available And I have absolutely no idea why.
not_available It's one of those sex things, you know.
not_available Lifestyle parties.
not_available I don't know anything about that.
not_available They had this little hightech Japanese vibrator that stimulates the clitoris through very low
not_available voltage electrical shocks.
not_available Anyway, they invited me, you know, to go with them and I thought, "Now this would be crossing a line." Which I seem to be doing more and more these days.
not_available Because you know what? The lines are only in our heads.
not_available In actuality, there are no lines at all which is really fucking terrifying, if you think about it.
not_available What's so funny? Nothing.
not_available Everything.
not_available This.
not_available I want you to know something, Brenda.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you, because you are so independent and spirited and you make no apologies to yourself.
not_available And you know you can't smother someone or you'll lose them.
not_available You accept Nate as he is, and that is beautiful.
not_available I don't know how to do that.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Maybe that's why I resented you so much.
not_available But now I don't.
not_available Now I admire you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I have to go to the bathroom.
not_available Claire, are you feeling all right? Yeah, I'm just tired.
not_available Let me feel your forehead.
not_available It feels okay.
not_available I don't know why you should be tired.
not_available You slept almost 11 hours last night.
not_available I'm not really like wanttogoto
not_available sleep tired.
not_available I'm just sort of like sick and tired of everything.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Just all the lies we're fed.
not_available The bullshit we're supposed to care about, how everybody is so scared of anything that's different from everything else.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm gonna get some coffee.
not_available Do you want some? I have to use the bathroom.
not_available You must be Ruth.
not_available Bernard Chenowith.
not_available Oh, hello.
not_available I'm so sorry to startle you.
not_available I was supposed to confine myself to the master suite but Margaret doesn't like me to use her bathroom.
not_available She gets insanely territorial about that damn bidet.
not_available It's nice to finally meet you.
not_available I know.
not_available I don't know why Nate and Brenda haven't arranged a dinner or something.
not_available I could give you half a dozen reasons just off the top of my head! But I'd like to ask you something.
not_available What steps have you taken to treat your daughter's depression? I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Surely you must be aware of it.
not_available Now, if you're adverse to talk therapy, there are scads of pharmaceutical solutions.
not_available Either way, I'd be happy to recommend the name of somebody she can see.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to use the bathroom.
not_available You're breaking up with me? I don't think we have a healthy friendship.
not_available We shouldn't see each other anymore.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't know how else to explain it.
not_available Don't bother, really.
not_available I'm going through something.
not_available I don't understand what it is but I need to be around people who aren't like you.
not_available People who have clear values, or something.
not_available Okay, got it.
not_available If I hadn't met you, I probably wouldn't be doing all the shit I've been doing.
not_available Not that I blame you, exactly.
not_available Oh, brother! Just can it, sweetheart.
not_available You can't stand to see the truth about yourself, so I've got to take the fall.
not_available Just do me a favor.
not_available When you feel bad about this later you can skip the big apology and trying to be friends again.
not_available It was fun, but we should both move on.
not_available So now you know what was really going on with me that night in Seattle.
not_available So is the Western medicine controlling the seizures? Not entirely.
not_available And I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this earlier.
not_available I think I was just trying to not face it myself.
not_available Lisa, I've changed.
not_available I used to be this person who ran away from responsibility, but I'm not him anymore.
not_available I want to be a part of our child's life.
not_available I really want to.
not_available I need to.
not_available Is this about you being a father for someone or is this about you being scared of death? Does it really matter? Maybe it doesn't.
not_available This is going to take some adjusting.
not_available Okay, maybe we can work out something.
not_available This is what you want, right? 
not_available Absolutely what I want.
not_available It's not like Brenda told you this was the right thing to do, or something.
not_available No.
not_available She doesn't even know about it.
not_available What? Nate, you are so This is no good.
not_available I just want to get away from you.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available What's going on? I was so stupid to think that anything could ever change you.
not_available You don't want a child, so you agree not to be a part of that child's life.
not_available Then you decide you do want a child, and you say you'll be part of the child's life with a total disregard for the person you're supposedly sharing a life with.
not_available All I said 
not_available Jesus, Nate if you can't put anyone but yourself first, how can you be a father? You can't.
not_available So do us both a favor and stay out of our lives.
not_available Please.
