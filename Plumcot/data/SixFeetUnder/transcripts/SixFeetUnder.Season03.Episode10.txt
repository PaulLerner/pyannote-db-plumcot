
not_available Come on, I'm open.
not_available Over here.
not_available Pass the ball.
not_available Come on.
not_available My grandma can kick harder than that.
not_available Shoo! Go, now.
not_available Roderick, can I offer you a slice of my buttermilk pie? Is that the same pie you made last year? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Then no, thank you.
not_available Roderick, can't you be nice? She's your aunt.
not_available You eat her sour pie.
not_available Well, maybe I'll have one more small piece.
not_available I'll have a piece of pie.
not_available Dammit.
not_available Aunt Jeanie, did you get stung? Why, yes.
not_available I got stung by a bee.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available She's allergic.
not_available I'm calling 911.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm calling from Bellvale Park.
not_available My wife's aunt got stung by a bee.
not_available She's having an allergic reaction.
not_available Aunt Jeanie? 
not_available Do something.
not_available Talk to them.
not_available Jeanie? By the east entrance.
not_available Where you walk down that little hill.
not_available What's wrong with her? Is she gonna be OK? She's gonna be OK, sweetheart.
not_available Help's on the way.
not_available That feels so good.
not_available My God.
not_available Wow! 
not_available That was nice, baby.
not_available Nice? That was amazing.
not_available It's great that, you know, you wanted to.
not_available Of course I wanted to.
not_available I mean, it's been a long time since you I mean, it's great that you wanted to.
not_available I have a surprise for you.
not_available Whoa.
not_available OK, but you're gonna have to give me five minutes.
not_available Ten minutes, tops.
not_available It's a different kind of surprise.
not_available I signed us up for a dance class tonight.
not_available A dance class? Really? Salsa, tango, merengue.
not_available Merengue.
not_available Wow.
not_available My mom used to do that.
not_available She won trophies.
not_available Maybe I'll win one.
not_available I'm gonna go make some coffee.
not_available No, no.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Julio! Augusto! Time to get up! By dipping the sponge applicator into cold water and applying it to Barbie's lips, cheeks and eyelids, you get a flourish of glamorous colour.
not_available I'm telling Taylor you took it out of the box.
not_available When I was a kid, I used to have Gl Joes.
not_available They were always getting court
not_available martialled, which in my version meant that they had to stand naked in front of the other dolls.
not_available Is that something you wanna act out? I think we've had enough excitement for a while.
not_available The threeways? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What about them? 
not_available Maybe they're not the best thing for us.
not_available Really? That wasn't you the other night begging us to arrest and interrogate you? I'm not saying they're not fun.
not_available So what are you saying? 
not_available I'm just starting to feel weird about it.
not_available OK, fine.
not_available Fine? 
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available That is so not fair.
not_available You ask me to tell you how I feel and when I do you just shut down.
not_available I don't feel like talking about it right now.
not_available You're tense because we're going to see your father.
not_available We're going to my great
not_available aunt's funeral.
not_available Where your father will be and whose house we'll be staying at.
not_available So? I don't have a problem with him.
not_available Really? I've been working on that stuff in my individual therapy.
not_available Really? 
not_available That's all I talk about.
not_available How come you've never told me about any of this? Some things are between me and the therapist.
not_available I tell you everything.
not_available Because you want my approval.
not_available No, it's because I love you.
not_available The other gentleman, he's your brother? 
not_available Yes.
not_available David.
not_available That's who helped me.
not_available He left this morning for a friend's funeral.
not_available He sold me a casket.
not_available Yes, the Cameo Rose.
not_available It's not good enough.
not_available Mr Fester, the Cameo Rose is an excellent casket.
not_available No, I want something nicer for Martha.
not_available It doesn't matter how much it costs.
not_available I know when we lose someone we wanna show how much we loved her, and we're at a loss as to how to do that and we spend a lot of money on something that isn't really necessary.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Don't you understand? This is the last thing I'll ever be able to do for my wife.
not_available I was a bad husband.
not_available Affairs and all that shit.
not_available I got cancer, thought I was gonna die, but I got better.
not_available I got a second chance.
not_available And I realised how much I loved her.
not_available And it's been really good the last few years.
not_available I just want to love her some more.
not_available I owe her God, I loved her, I really did.
not_available Of course you did, and she knew that.
not_available She was everything to me.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Nate, do you remember when I used to make that casserole with the I used to do this for your father.
not_available His shoulders would get so full of knots.
not_available It's such a stressful job.
not_available It's OK, baby.
not_available It's OK.
not_available You want the front page? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't deal with depressing news.
not_available I don't remember this book being so dark.
not_available These kids in the orphanage are being tortured.
not_available That's the best part, where they have to take a bath in iced water.
not_available Isn't that kind of inappropriate for kids? We're human beings.
not_available We all have a sick craving for that kind of dark fantasy.
not_available Even kids.
not_available I've got enough dark reality.
not_available I don't need the fantasy.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Nurse Caterwaul's making Nathaniel and Isabel cane each other.
not_available Read that part out loud.
not_available You're sick.
not_available If you mean suffering from bipolar disorder with psychotic episodes, then yes, I am.
not_available This is good, Claire.
not_available It's lovely.
not_available The blurriness, the way the light seems too much.
not_available As if there's a secret fire in her spilling out for a moment and you were there to capture it.
not_available Excellent work.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It only turned out this way because I accidentally dragged the shutter.
not_available I was totally gonna reshoot it.
not_available But he's right, it works.
not_available It's really good.
not_available I wonder how much of art is accidental.
not_available Maybe Magritte, when he was painting his Listening Room, was like, "Damn, I made the apple too big again.
not_available " Hello, I'm being clever over here.
not_available Shit.
not_available What? The blade's dull.
not_available It's fucking up everything.
not_available Use another one.
not_available I got ten mats to cut.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available Why don't you just change the blade? 
not_available I don't want to change the blade.
not_available It's shit! I hate it! I hate everything! I hate it! It's shit! It's all fucking shit! 
not_available Good.
not_available A tantrum.
not_available This is an opportunity to learn, people.
not_available Russell, you hate your work because you secretly hate yourself, which means you're still only thinking about yourself.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available But I understand the impulse.
not_available I once filled the trunk of my car with all my latest work and then lit the car on fire and let it roll down the streets of Montmartre.
not_available That's interesting, because everything you do is just so fucking fascinating.
not_available Such vitriol and such rage.
not_available And why aren't you putting this into your work? Olivier, if you know so much about art and life, how come you ended up being such a pathetic poser who needs people half his age to prop him up and make him feel good about himself? He could have at least made the effort to slam the door.
not_available Young people have absolutely no commitment today.
not_available Go back to work.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available You OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Just a little meltdown.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can stay.
not_available Go another time.
not_available No.
not_available You're going.
not_available You need a break.
not_available You deserve a break.
not_available You wanna get rid of me.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available You wanna get to your sister's before dark.
not_available I feel like a terrible mother for thinking this, and I know I'm gonna miss her, but I'm kind of looking forward to a couple of days without Maya.
not_available That's because you're a handful, aren't you? Did you make a list for me? 
not_available A list? For what? I don't know.
not_available Usually you make lists.
not_available What time I'm supposed to feed Maya, what I can and can't feed her.
not_available You already know all that stuff.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Don't let your mother bathe her.
not_available She scrubs her like a potato.
not_available I'll bathe her.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm gonna miss you.
not_available We'll walk you to the car.
not_available I don't want Maya to see me go.
not_available I just don't.
not_available Well, goodbye, then.
not_available I love you.
not_available Be good to Daddy, right? I love you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Arthur, are you busy? 
not_available I'm putting away my socks.
not_available But I've become confused as to which is paired with which.
not_available They all look exactly the same.
not_available That's the dilemma.
not_available Arthur, I really need to talk.
not_available OK.
not_available Quite frankly, I'd like to know how you feel about the course our relationship is taking.
not_available We've been on quite a serendipitous journey, haven't we? And where do you think it's headed? Surely someplace divine.
not_available Does that mean you know intimacy? I love intimacy.
not_available Intimacy is my best friend.
not_available Arthur, I'm so confused.
not_available Do you find me at all attractive? If you feel I'm too old Heavens, no.
not_available You're the perfect age for me, Ruth Fisher.
not_available I am? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available So how do you feel about us having, you know, sex? It's just that we've been seeing each other for a while, and not even a kiss.
not_available Well, not since 
not_available Yes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Well I believe that sex can be when two become one.
not_available It needn't always be painful, but it is indeed a very slippery slope.
not_available Arthur, have you ever had sex? I think I have, in a sense.
not_available Are there any other topics you'd like to discuss? No No.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's this way.
not_available Yeah, I know the way.
not_available So what's the problem? We're a couple, and it would be nice if we could walk together like every other couple, especially considering I'm about to walk into a place filled with your every living relative.
not_available So walk faster, then.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Now what? That's just tacky.
not_available No one wants to see that.
not_available This ground is wet.
not_available They should have put down more greens here.
not_available David, it's fine.
not_available Not everyone is such a perfectionist.
not_available I'm not a perfectionist, just professional.
not_available No one's gonna even see these here.
not_available Let's hope these guys remember to put your great
not_available aunt in her casket face up.
not_available Look, David, here come my folks.
not_available Try not to nag at me.
not_available I wasn't Uncle Keith! 
not_available Hey.
not_available Look at you! You gotta stop growing so fast.
not_available David.
not_available You look so pretty.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's my funeral dress.
not_available Nice.
not_available So you made it down? 
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available It's good to see you, baby.
not_available You too, David.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Wanna come sit with us? Yeah, I'd like that.
not_available Excuse me, are you the funeral director? I'm the organist.
not_available I was wondering if I should begin.
not_available Actually, now would be a perfect time.
not_available Something soft, perhaps Ave Maria.
not_available Prayer card? Hey.
not_available Just in time for lunch.
not_available I know.
not_available I could smell curry all the way from La Cienega.
not_available I cut up some papaya.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You seem happy.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, I like it.
not_available I like to see you happy.
not_available I'm glad you're here.
not_available I told you I was coming home for lunch.
not_available No, here in general, staying with me.
not_available You just want me to pay half the rent.
not_available Can I get that in cash? Fat chance.
not_available How was work? 
not_available Two cancellations this morning.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, it was great.
not_available I got Raul to give me a massage.
not_available Really? I would have given you a massage.
not_available Yeah, but you didn't train for three years in Thailand.
not_available This guy is amazing.
not_available You should see him.
not_available Schedule me.
not_available This looks good.
not_available Look what I got.
not_available Wow.
not_available I didn't know there was a video.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's new, I think.
not_available "Join Nathaniel and Isabel on their fantastic adventures.
not_available " I'm not sure I would call being repeatedly traumatised an adventure.
not_available We gotta watch it tonight.
not_available All right.
not_available Thought I might find you here.
not_available You certainly do keep to a schedule.
not_available Hello, Arthur.
not_available Have you done the whites yet? 
not_available I'm doing them right now.
not_available I have some kerchiefs and undershirts to do.
not_available Some people call them wife
not_available beaters, which I think is funny.
not_available There's nothing funny about beating your wife.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I didn't mean to suggest otherwise.
not_available Perhaps 
not_available Perhaps what? Perhaps you'd prefer it if our laundry didn't mix any more.
not_available Honestly, Arthur, I don't care what our laundry does.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you still doing here? I'm waiting for you.
not_available I figured you had to come back and get your stuff.
not_available I was walking round campus cursing to myself, bumming cigarettes off people.
not_available You don't smoke.
not_available I know.
not_available And I'm feeling kind of nauseous.
not_available What's going on? What was all that with Olivier about? I don't know.
not_available I think I'm just going crazy.
not_available Why? Claire, I need to tell you something.
not_available The words every woman longs to hear.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I fooled around with Olivier.
not_available What? When? 
not_available The day you went to Azusa.
not_available You said nothing happened.
not_available You lied to me? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available What do you mean, fooled around? What exactly did you do? 
not_available Claire, I don't think you wanna know.
not_available Yeah, I do wanna know.
not_available Claire, we had sex.
not_available Russell, I trusted you.
not_available You told me I didn't have to be careful.
not_available You said I could feel safe with you.
not_available I know, and I feel awful.
not_available So you really are gay? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I think I might be bi, but I'm not sure.
not_available I'm just really I'm fucking confused.
not_available I'm sorry you're fucking confused.
not_available But you sure didn't seem confused every time we fucked or every time you said you loved me, which I was stupid enough to believe.
not_available I do love you.
not_available You show it by sucking your professor's dick.
not_available I already feel like an asshole.
not_available You are an asshole! Thanks.
not_available So what goes on between us is not enough for you? I don't know.
not_available Have you ever had sex with a man before? 
not_available No.
not_available Never.
not_available But you've obviously thought about it.
not_available I was high, I'm fucking confused 
not_available I had to tell you.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available You forgive me? 
not_available No.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Claire 
not_available I don't ever want to see you again.
not_available Claire 
not_available Don't even call me.
not_available Claire 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Cute little girl.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So's your boy.
not_available How old is he? 
not_available 16 months.
not_available Haven't seen you here before.
not_available I'm usually stuck at work.
not_available My wife takes her.
not_available How about you? 
not_available Divorced.
not_available No, it's actually really good.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I get Nick two days a week.
not_available Get to take him to the park.
not_available That's great.
not_available Hey, Sarah.
not_available Hey, Sarah, hang on.
not_available I can't imagine seeing you only two days a week.
not_available You wanna talk to your mommy? Hello? 
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm at the park with Maya and I wish you were with us.
not_available Wow, that sounds nice.
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available She's a little preoccupied watching a squirrel.
not_available I'm looking at the ocean.
not_available Yeah? Nice? It's gorgeous.
not_available Lise? 
not_available Nate? Nate? I miss you.
not_available Nate? Nate? Lise, I'm losing you.
not_available You know what your mom's doing right now? She's looking out at the ocean.
not_available You know what's more beautiful than the ocean? You.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available My grandfather, my great
not_available grandmother.
not_available I didn't know they were buried here.
not_available My grandfather was in the navy.
not_available He brought the whole family from Chicago after World War ll.
not_available We own all these plots.
not_available Are you going to be buried here? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I feel so disconnected from my family.
not_available It'd be nice if you and I could be buried next to each other.
not_available Grandma wants to know if you're ready to go.
not_available Yeah, we'll follow you back to the house.
not_available Taylor, how are you doing here? Are you happy? Grandma and Grandpa treat you good? Yeah.
not_available Grandma thinks Grandpa spoils me, but I like it.
not_available He made me a bunk bed because I asked him to.
not_available Even though I'm just one person.
not_available I get to sleep on the top and the bottom whenever I want.
not_available Grandpa isn't mean to you? How come you always ask me that? Don't you like Grandpa? 
not_available Of course I do.
not_available He's my dad.
not_available He was so happy you were coming.
not_available He bought steaks.
not_available Said it was your favourite.
not_available I think I should talk to my dad.
not_available Yeah, talk to him.
not_available I think that's great.
not_available And one, two, three and five, six, seven.
not_available And one, two, three and five, six, seven.
not_available Cross by me, five, six, seven.
not_available Rico, you're so good.
not_available Very suave.
not_available You look so handsome.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dancing makes me feel sexy.
not_available Do I look sexy? You look amazing.
not_available Now we're gonna do an outside turn.
not_available Open break.
not_available Back to basic.
not_available I like that.
not_available Spin me again.
not_available No, we have to wait until he says.
not_available OK, whatever.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available All right, everybody, give yourselves a little applause.
not_available Very good.
not_available Short break.
not_available When you come back I'll teach you how to do the cuddle position.
not_available Very good.
not_available Why do I like that? 
not_available I need some water.
not_available I'm thirsty.
not_available Are you? 
not_available Yeah, a little.
not_available I spilled it.
not_available This is fun, huh? 
not_available God, this is great.
not_available I love dancing.
not_available You're so good at it.
not_available We should go dancing every night.
not_available The kids might miss us after a while.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available The kids.
not_available You think they're OK? Shall we call them? 
not_available They're fine.
not_available They can come dancing too.
not_available We'll all go dancing.
not_available Shit, these shoes are so tight.
not_available I shouldn't have bought them.
not_available But they look sexy, right? 
not_available Very sexy.
not_available OK, everybody.
not_available Back to your positions.
not_available Come on, line up.
not_available Good.
not_available Back to basic.
not_available This storm is exceedingly fierce, Nathaniel.
not_available Hang on.
not_available This really sucks.
not_available I know.
not_available It looks like drawings in the mall by a third
not_available grade class.
not_available I was really looking forward to this.
not_available Maybe it'll get better.
not_available Isabel, you've saved me so many times.
not_available Please, Isabel.
not_available Please don't die.
not_available He saves Isabel's life with a fucking tear? How did it happen in the book? Persimmons and pineapples, Isabell Mouthto
not_available mouth resuscitation, which makes sense.
not_available Not some fucking magic tear.
not_available Thanks to you.
not_available Curses.
not_available What? What is it? Nurse Caterwaul.
not_available Children I can't even watch this any more.
not_available Billy, chill.
not_available It's just a video.
not_available But they ruined it.
not_available They're so fucking sanitised.
not_available There's not any real danger.
not_available And you can't have people say "persimmons and pineapples" with an American accent.
not_available What a piece of shit! Hey.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available It was Dad, you know.
not_available Dad what? 
not_available Dad who gave us the book.
not_available Remember? 
not_available Kind of.
not_available He gave it to us for Christmas.
not_available And now Dad's dead.
not_available And our whole childhood sucked.
not_available And Nathaniel and Isabel was the only good thing we had, and they ruined it.
not_available They didn't ruin it.
not_available We still have it.
not_available We'll always have it.
not_available We're so damaged, Bren.
not_available We can go about our lives and pretend everything's gonna be OK, but it never will be, ever.
not_available That's not true.
not_available We're getting better, both of us.
not_available You are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Come on, you know you are.
not_available I really don't feel like I am.
not_available Those are just feelings.
not_available This is just right now.
not_available And the movie and Dad dying and me moving in has brought up a lot of stuff for you.
not_available You'll work through it.
not_available It'll get better.
not_available You promise? 
not_available Yeah, I promise.
not_available You gonna help me? Of course I'll help you.
not_available Stupid.
not_available I'm so glad you're here.
not_available I love you so much, Bren.
not_available I love you too.
not_available Billy! What? What? 
not_available Don't ever do that to me.
not_available It was just a kiss.
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available I was just being affectionate.
not_available I love you.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available What? Brenda, wait.
not_available What? No.
not_available OK, let's watch another video.
not_available Come on.
not_available We'll watch a good one this time.
not_available Brenda! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available You OK? Are you tired? Maybe.
not_available You wanna rest? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes and no.
not_available Are you OK? My heart's beating so fast.
not_available I'm so dizzy.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Baby, what's wrong? 
not_available I need some air.
not_available I'm gonna take you to the hospital.
not_available No.
not_available In my purse.
not_available My pill thing.
not_available Jesus.
not_available The Zanex.
not_available Which one's the Zanex? 
not_available The blue one.
not_available Which blue one? Just hold my hand, OK? Just hold on to me.
not_available OK.
not_available My mother says you won't leave.
not_available I had to see you.
not_available It's driving me crazy thinking you're mad at me.
not_available I'm supposed to make you feel better? I don't want this to end.
not_available I need this.
not_available I need you.
not_available I'm sorry, I just can't be with somebody who's this confused.
not_available I know I'm confused, but the one thing I'm completely sure of is that I love you.
not_available And I believe you.
not_available But I have been through this before.
not_available I'm not some nurse who's here to take care of the misfits.
not_available I'm sorry, but whatever it is you're going through, you'll have to figure it out alone.
not_available We should be together.
not_available We're both crazy, we're both fucked
not_available up artists.
not_available I mean, we have to be together.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I'm gonna change your mind, I swear.
not_available Please just leave me alone.
not_available I would cut out my heart and give it to you in a box if it would change anything.
not_available Well, it would, cos you'd be dead, OK? Goodbye.
not_available Claire? Did you get Taylor off to bed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can't believe how grown
not_available up she is.
not_available She politely informed us that she's too old to play with Barbies.
not_available And insisted she read us a bedtime story.
not_available She's smart.
not_available Doing well in school.
not_available Good.
not_available She misses her momma, but we deal with that the best we can.
not_available She seems happy.
not_available I'm glad this is working out.
not_available Of course it's working out.
not_available Lucille, can I help you in the kitchen? 
not_available Sure, David.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dad, I need to talk to you about something.
not_available Look, I I know things haven't always been so smooth between you and me.
not_available I've been working on some things in therapy.
not_available I've come to realise that I was traumatised by the way you punished me and Carla.
not_available That was abusive.
not_available That was abuse.
not_available Abuse? 
not_available I know you did the best you could.
not_available You were probably repeating what happened to you, but it did a number on me and Carla.
not_available I'm to blame for your sister's drug problems? No, I wanna acknowledge the truth about what happened so I can forgive you.
not_available You wanna forgive me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available So we can have a real relationship while we still have time.
not_available What are you talking about? I disciplined my children when they deserved it.
not_available I gave you a home.
not_available I gave you food to eat.
not_available I taught you how to be a man.
not_available You wanna forgive me? Get on your knees and thank me and maybe I'll forgive you for being a goddamn faggot.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought 
not_available I said I wanna hear you thank me.
not_available Who do you think you pushing, boy? 
not_available Your son was only trying to reach out to you.
not_available Who the fuck are you again? 
not_available I'm the man your son is in love with.
not_available It makes me sick to my stomach.
not_available How the fuck can you act so goddamn superior when everyone knows you beat your kids, cheated on your wife? 
not_available I did not.
not_available How dare you? 
not_available Keith, you need to tell him.
not_available This isn't the place for you to say that.
not_available It's not my place? 
not_available No, this is my family.
not_available Stay out of it.
not_available Then I can't be here.
not_available David Should have knocked his teeth out for what he said to me.
not_available You're pathetic.
not_available It's a bit different than the music Mommy plays, isn't it? I couldn't stand hearing that one more time.
not_available I'd tear my head off.
not_available It's open.
not_available Come on up.
not_available The pizza man.
not_available Ready for your first taste of pepperoni? Brenda, hey.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't know where else to go and didn't have your number.
not_available No, that's fine.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Sure I'm not interrupting anything? No.
not_available Lisa's gone.
not_available I'm just introducing Maya to some music that doesn't suck.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available Billy.
not_available Let me put Maya down in her playpen.
not_available Ever since your father died, I've just flitted from man to man.
not_available I am so embarrassed.
not_available I mean, look, you got married when you were 19.
not_available That's how old I am.
not_available You never even got to have your sexual 20s, so why shouldn't you do it now? You don't have to worry about us any more.
not_available No.
not_available Did you know I got pregnant the first time I ever had sex? My God.
not_available With Dad? 
not_available Of course.
not_available I thought you were gonna tell me I had some love child half
not_available brother somewhere, which I don't think I could handle right now.
not_available No, it was Nate.
not_available Nathaniel and I had to get married right away.
not_available Both our families were mortified.
not_available It changed my life for ever.
not_available Do you ever wonder how your life would be different if that hadn't happened? I used to.
not_available Not any more.
not_available Were you and Dad in love with each other? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Very much so at first.
not_available Despite how we grew apart, your father was the great love of my life.
not_available At least you had that.
not_available I'm beginning to think I never will.
not_available You will.
not_available Everyone does.
not_available But chances are it won't be anything like you expect.
not_available I miss Dad, you know.
not_available I feel like I hate how I just took him for granted my whole life and now he's gone and it's too late for me to ever really know him, you know, like as an adult.
not_available I miss him too.
not_available There will never be another man who will love me when I'm young and pretty and always have that picture of me somewhere in his heart.
not_available Mom, you're still pretty.
not_available God, you're beautiful.
not_available Why do you think all these men are always hitting on you? You're so sweet.
not_available But look at the men! I'm sitting here crying over Arthur.
not_available What should I do about him? 
not_available Run.
not_available I feel sorry for him, though.
not_available He's so naive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I feel sorry for Russell too.
not_available I mean, I hate him, but I feel sorry for him.
not_available Mom, why is it I attract every screwed
not_available up guy in the state? Because they can see what a kind soul you have.
not_available That you're caring and sensitive.
not_available It's the truth, Claire.
not_available You're an angel.
not_available But the real question is, why do you like them? It's like I'll fall for any guy who shows any interest in me.
not_available I guess we all wanna be loved.
not_available It's hard to say no to that, no matter who it's coming from.
not_available Right from the beginning there was this voice saying, "Don't move in with Billy.
not_available " What do I do? I move in with Billy.
not_available So self
not_available destructive.
not_available Maybe you wanted to believe the world is a better place than it really is.
not_available So I'm an idiot? 
not_available No.
not_available Just a very positive person.
not_available That doesn't sound like me.
not_available It's scary to hope things will turn out good because you risk being disappointed.
not_available Wow.
not_available You've really thought about this.
not_available No, I'm talking out of my ass.
not_available I have no clue whatsoever.
not_available Look, all I know is you're a good person who deserves to be happy.
not_available So are you, you know.
not_available Well, I should go.
not_available Sure you're gonna be OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You've got my number? Thank you.
not_available What are friends for? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available This isn't right.
not_available I'm gonna go.
not_available I can't believe I just did that.
not_available You're married.
not_available Yes, I'm married.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm worse than Billy.
not_available No, I was right there too.
not_available I'm so fucking predictable.
not_available I'm gonna leave now.
not_available You have a place to go? 
not_available Yeah, I'll be fine.
not_available Hey, sailor.
not_available Patrick, I can't believe you're here.
not_available I got your message.
not_available You sounded miserable.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll drive you home.
not_available You can tell me all about it.
not_available I still can't believe you're here.
not_available I can't sleep at night anyway.
not_available Hey, Barb, it's Nate.
not_available Is Lisa there? I don't know.
not_available She could be in traffic.
not_available I'll try her on her cell.
not_available Listen, if you talk to her first, make sure she calls me.
not_available Right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hey, Lise.
not_available You taking the scenic route up? Anyway, Maya's sleeping.
not_available I just wanted to hear your voice, know you're OK.
not_available I love you.
not_available Call me when you get this.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available Let's get you ready for bed.
not_available Come on.
not_available Up you go.
not_available No, leave me here.
not_available I'm too tired to move.
not_available Hello? Hey, Lise.
not_available I was hoping to reach you.
not_available It's late and I'm starting to worry.
not_available I love you.
not_available Just call me.
not_available Call me.
not_available I love you.
