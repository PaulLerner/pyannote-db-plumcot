
not_available Dr.
not_available Earl, OR 3.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available I'm scared.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available I'm almost done.
not_available Okay.
not_available At first I just thought they'd go away, but they never did.
not_available They just kept growing and growing.
not_available I see you've had symptoms.
not_available Mainly just indigestion which I've always had.
not_available Even as a child, I had a nervous stomach.
not_available But there's also been vomiting and blood in your stool? Why didn't you call me? I knew we should.
not_available Somehow I just kept putting it off.
not_available We were supposed to go to Florida next week to visit our son.
not_available We haven't seen him in over a year.
not_available We were gonna call you as soon as we got back, but the pain got too bad.
not_available I wish you had called me as soon as you well we'll just start doing some tests and hope for the best.
not_available What would be the worst? That these are two tumors which may have metastasized and spread.
not_available Oh Jeez.
not_available What are the chances, if that's the case? Let's just do the tests and hope for the best.
not_available Claire? 
not_available Oh, morning.
not_available It's not very good.
not_available I think mom's machine's a little more low
not_available tech.
not_available Sometimes I miss the days when coffee was just coffee.
not_available Oh, I have a huge darkroom day today, but hopefully I'll be back in time for dinner.
not_available You know what? I don't want you to stay here anymore.
not_available It's too much.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available It is.
not_available I was bad before, but now I'm starting to sleep a little.
not_available I haven't had a panic attack in two days and I've even cut down on all the Ativan, so you are officially evicted as of today.
not_available David, are you sure? You seem Jeez, this coffee really is gross.
not_available I don't know, I think maybe I should stay.
not_available I don't need my baby sister babysitting me anymore, okay? Did you hear those two cats having sex in the alley last night? 
not_available They were worse than Mom and George.
not_available I don't know why they do it.
not_available It sounds like it's so painful.
not_available I mean, they live in an alley.
not_available They deserve some kind of diversion, don't you think? Did you hear what I said? Yes, you can't see me anymore.
not_available It's over.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Goodbye, Rico.
not_available Then get outta here.
not_available I am so stupid! I hid that pack of cigarettes from myself so good I can't find them! Did you look on top of the refrigerator? I just want to say that I'm sorry, but I just feel like this isn't right in some way to my wife and to my kids 
not_available Oh, yeah? And why is that? This is not about fucking.
not_available You made that plain and clear.
not_available This is about just being friends.
not_available I think I need more guy friends.
not_available Of course you tell me today when my lupus is acting up.
not_available You know, I gave you all that money and I never heard a word about you going to a doctor.
not_available Did you even go to one 
not_available I got the damn lupus! You never even liked me.
not_available This was about you needing to feel like a big man, and now that you got what you need, you're done.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just leave the gift that you promised Nicole 
not_available and get out of here.
not_available Oh shit.
not_available You didn't even bring the dumb "Jack the Pig" book you been going on and on about? 
not_available I left it at work.
not_available I could bring it by tomorrow.
not_available Forget it.
not_available She needs to learn people promise you things but then leave when they get tired of you.
not_available She's George's new wife, the one who came after you.
not_available Jesus, lady.
not_available What the hell are you doing? George is gonna kill you if he finds you messing with his things.
not_available You're snooping.
not_available You're too snoopy.
not_available I was too snoopy and he got rid of me but quick.
not_available Boy, you are some dumb cluck.
not_available Do you want to know why George doesn't like to be asked anything about his past? Yes, I do.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Please, tell me.
not_available What doesn't he want me to know?! Why can't I know anything?! All of these caskets are available with customized inserts.
not_available You can have your wife's name, her favorite Bible verse, a family photo.
not_available Is there one that appeals to you? I
not_available I don't know, son.
not_available You seemed to like the blue one.
not_available There's just a lot of different options.
not_available I think that maybe you need to take a little time to look.
not_available I'll give you two a moment to decide.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You were supposed to be here 40 minutes ago.
not_available Maya's still not used to day care yet.
not_available I had to stay with her for a while.
not_available No one was here to meet the Morrisons.
not_available Well, where were you? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available You said you were gonna talk about the arrangements with Mom.
not_available She must have told you what she wanted.
not_available I tried to bring it up with her.
not_available It always seemed like a bad time.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then what do you want? You pick the casket, then we'll talk about who's gonna speak at this thing.
not_available Dad, I need to know what you want here.
not_available I want her back.
not_available I want things back the way they used to be.
not_available Yeah, well, it's too late now.
not_available If you guys hadn't been so scared about facing the truth, maybe Mom would be alive and we wouldn't have to fucking decide about what casket she's gonna be buried in.
not_available So apparently the father never said a word to anyone as the tumors just kept getting bigger and bigger.
not_available Man, I don't understand people.
not_available I get it.
not_available Having to admit fucked up shit about yourself fucking sucks.
not_available Oh, come on! David's been cleaning again.
not_available Yeah, well, so what? It relaxes him.
not_available Honestly, it's a little annoying.
not_available I could have used him upstairs with the Morrisons.
not_available I'm doing intakes.
not_available David's staying down here.
not_available I know that David doesn't want to be around people right now, but if you've decided you wanted to come back to the business, then be back.
not_available The two of you are acting like you can come and go and do whatever you want.
not_available Why are we buying the fake Windex when the real kind is the only one that works? I'll get some real Windex later.
not_available Since there's nothing going on here now, would you mind swinging by the hospital to pick up Mrs.
not_available Morrison? Um I'm cleaning.
not_available That's fine, we'll figure something out.
not_available Didn't I just have a rag? I must have left it out there.
not_available I don't know where my mind is.
not_available David can't take the van out anymore.
not_available The van is where it happened.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Then you go.
not_available Actually, Maya and I have to go to the 
not_available Maya's in day care.
not_available That's right, and there's this get
not_available together once a month where we get together with the other parents.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Great.
not_available So long as you're out, can you get the real Windex? Anita? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Anita went over to Russell's, so I just decided to hang out and wait for you.
not_available What are you hiding? Oh.
not_available Nothing, it's just one of my photos.
not_available Oh.
not_available It's one of the ones I took of you.
not_available Okay, so it's bad.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's really good.
not_available Then why can't I see it? 
not_available It's too good.
not_available It's like I can't believe this actually came out of me.
not_available It's so good, I don't even want anyone to see it.
not_available I'm not even gonna show it at my crit tomorrow because I don't know it's just for me.
not_available Is that crazy? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available It's so beautiful.
not_available I know.
not_available I love this shadow that goes across your face.
not_available It's so cool.
not_available You've got to show this at your crit.
not_available What are you so scared of? Uh Look at my expression.
not_available It's nice to know that finally my hours of watching "America's Next Top Model" have paid off.
not_available I definitely owe you one for this.
not_available I'll think about how I can collect on that.
not_available So, are you available next Tuesday? Nate, I told you this is the last time.
not_available That's what you said last week and the week before that.
not_available No, this is the last last time.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available We'll never talk again.
not_available Until you call me tomorrow.
not_available Oh.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I don't know why I'm doing this.
not_available It's all Joe's fault.
not_available If only he enjoyed nice, normal, perfectly average sex.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Wasn't I a little above average back there, at least for a few seconds? No, as opposed to what I told you about me and Joe.
not_available What the hurtmemommy stuff? 
not_available Oh, stop.
not_available Give me a break, Bren.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available This isn't about Joe.
not_available It's about you.
not_available I of all people should know.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? You and Joe move in together.
not_available You get scared by the intimacy.
not_available You freak out and you have sex outside the relationship.
not_available You can't fool me, I used to be Joe.
not_available Well, this is all very illuminating.
not_available What about you? Why are you doing this? Why not? Right now, I'm at a place in my life 
not_available where I just want to have some fun.
not_available Of course.
not_available This couldn't be just another way for you to avoid having a permanent, real relationship.
not_available What are you looking for? 
not_available The condom.
not_available I dropped it on the floor when I took it off and now I can't oh here it is.
not_available Sperm is I don't know.
not_available It seems so tiny to be able to do so much.
not_available I know.
not_available It's odd.
not_available I'm going to be gone all day tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm going to hunt for fossils in Cold Canyon like I do every year.
not_available Oh, that's nice.
not_available I know how much your annual fossil hunt means to you.
not_available You could come with me, if you wouldn't find it too boring.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I have to return some books to the library.
not_available You don't have to invite me.
not_available I'm happy for you to do whatever you want whenever you want with whomever you want.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I want to go fossil hunting so I will go fossil hunting, darn it.
not_available Okay, now I'm starting to freak out! 
not_available I'm sure we'll find it.
not_available It's my favorite earring.
not_available I know, you keep saying that.
not_available Hey, when Javier gets here, 
not_available I'm sure we'll figure something out.
not_available Nothing yet, but I've got five of Detroit's finest looking for it.
not_available If it's in this auditorium, they'll find it.
not_available It was given to me by the only person who ever really really loved me.
not_available Now it's lost.
not_available Oh God, when will someone ever love me again? The real me? Everyone else has someone.
not_available Here is the entire universe and here is me.
not_available You're just exhausted.
not_available You need to go back to your room and get some sleep.
not_available Please don't minimize my severe depression.
not_available I would never do that to you.
not_available There's only one thing that'll make me feel better.
not_available Just give me a few moments then we'll blow out of here.
not_available Well, we're fucked.
not_available What do you mean? Halfway through the tour, she always gets really depressed.
not_available So then we go to whatever stupid gay club we can find that's still open so she can get worshipped by the fags.
not_available We're going to a gay club? 
not_available Yeah, dude.
not_available Try to act a little cooler about it.
not_available # Good lovin' can set me free # # Ooh, baby # # Don't you leave me this way # Gimme gimme some pleasure! Midwestern queers really creep me out.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available # Please don't leave me this way # # Ooh, baby # 
not_available Keith Charles.
not_available Are you still working? Yeah, late night.
not_available I'm sorry, I just couldn't sleep and l It sounds like you're in a bar.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm with Celeste.
not_available She's fighting a severe depression.
not_available Oh, baby! Uh that's a gay bar.
not_available Dude, Celeste is looking over here.
not_available I think she's annoyed you ain't looking at her.
not_available Listen, I gotta go.
not_available I'll call you in the morning.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available If anybody gets mad, just tell them your wife's on her woman's time.
not_available They'll feel bad for you that I'm such a bitch when I'm on the rag.
not_available Night.
not_available # Only your good lovin' can set me free # # Set me free # 
not_available Your old lady pissed off? You could've just told her you was at some fag bar, and there was no chance you were taking home some pussy tonight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Javier, I'm gay.
not_available I have a boyfriend.
not_available I sleep with men, okay? I have a lot of sex and it's really really gay.
not_available That's cool, man.
not_available # Believe me.
not_available # Well, that site back there was completely picked over, and I'll bet I know who did it, too.
not_available Last year I caught this guy from USC trying to follow me 
not_available George, I think I'm dehydrating.
not_available Nonsense.
not_available I am.
not_available I'm about to dehydrate.
not_available Why did you drink all your water so quickly? I was thirsty.
not_available Here, just have some of my mine.
not_available I asked you if you had water earlier and you said you didn't.
not_available Because I thought if you knew, you wouldn't make your water last as long.
not_available Let's talk about lunch.
not_available I always go to the Inn of the Seventh Ray.
not_available I'm going to visit my only sister.
not_available What? I didn't realize we were gonna be in Topanga.
not_available She lives a few miles from here and I haven't seen her in ages and it's only right.
not_available Family is very important to me even if it isn't to you.
not_available Jesus.
not_available God.
not_available Mom was hunting for fossils? Why would a person hunt for fossils? Apparently, because their husband does.
not_available This is great.
not_available I was gonna ask her to babysit for me tonight.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available So you're out a lot lately.
not_available Is this something serious? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Maile's just this girl that I worked with at doggie day care.
not_available I've seen her a few times, but she's just just fun.
not_available I think it's really weird you worked at a dog place for like six seconds.
not_available Well, it wasn't exactly my decision to leave, now was it? Ugh, people who write Op
not_available Ed pieces should be shot.
not_available Hey, what time is the movie tonight? Um, actually, I'm gonna be seeing Russell tonight, and I plan on staying over at his apartment.
not_available It's purely a physical thing, but it's something very intense I need to explore.
not_available Hey, Claire, if you're having any emotions about it, now is as good a time as any to express them.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available Oh.
not_available Look, do whatever you want.
not_available So it'll just be me and Edie tonight.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I've just been working on Mrs.
not_available Morrison for 110 years.
not_available It's the tumor lady.
not_available Oh.
not_available Her body's totally shot from the chemo and the radiation.
not_available She's all crumbly.
not_available Edie and I are going to the movies tonight, if you want to join.
not_available Girls night out? I'm there, totally.
not_available # I'm a lonely little petunia in an onion patch # # An onion patch, an onion patch # # I'm a lonely little petunia in an onion patch # # And all I do is cry all day # # Boohoo # # Boohoo
not_available hoo.
not_available # What the hell is that? My mother used to sing that to us.
not_available Well, that explains a lot.
not_available Why is it that when you move, you can never find the things that you actually want? You just find the things that you regret bringing and not throwing away.
not_available I never hold onto anything.
not_available Smart.
not_available You should be proud of that.
not_available I'm thinking about building some shelves in the other bedroom.
not_available That's not one of those things you really need to know how to do in order to be able to do it, right? Let's finish all this settling in later and watch bad TV.
not_available Okay, but we're gonna have to make a decision at some point.
not_available Office isn't always gonna be an office.
not_available It's gonna be a nursery as soon as I mean, you might already be pregnant.
not_available Oh, I'm not.
not_available I got it yesterday.
not_available Oh.
not_available So that's why you looked so sad when you came home late after class.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? I don't know.
not_available Well, look.
not_available It was only our first time up at bat.
not_available I'm sure this month it'll happen.
not_available Maybe it's for the best.
not_available Yeah, exactly.
not_available We get another month where it's just the two of us.
not_available We have to learn to appreciate those while we still have them.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it's definitely an improvement, yet there's still something unsatisfying about these.
not_available Does anyone know what it is? Hmm? 
not_available They're technically good.
not_available It's just that they're finite.
not_available Elise, that is a beautiful way to put it.
not_available They show us something, but they don't leave us with anything to ponder.
not_available All except this one.
not_available Claire, what do you think this photograph is saying? Um it's about being half
not_available hidden, what it means to come out of the shadows.
not_available The woman in the photograph looks at us like she wants us to come closer.
not_available But we don't.
not_available She teases us, almost like she's daring us.
not_available But what is the dare? Is it to touch her? She looks like she knows we're scared.
not_available But what's so scary about this beautiful woman? What's so scary about getting close to someone? Because we don't quite know the answer to any of these questions, the photo haunts us.
not_available Nice work, Claire.
not_available Does anyone else have any comments? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm really pissed off.
not_available Why is that, Elise? Claire takes an erotic picture of her beautiful girlfriend and she gets an A just because you're a lesbian.
not_available This sucks.
not_available She's not my girlfriend.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available Okay, that's enough.
not_available Anita, tell her she's just my friend.
not_available She's not Claire's girlfriend that I know of.
not_available Why isn't she answering? I don't think there's anyone here.
not_available I suppose you're right.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Sarah! Honey? Ruth? Oh, for God's sake, Fisher.
not_available I tell the children to make the ugliest monster that lives inside them, and then we put their pictures on them.
not_available They are sort of ugly.
not_available This one is really hideous.
not_available Oh, that's mine! I think it's wonderful that you've become a teacher.
not_available Please, I'm just the crazy art lady who comes in a few afternoons a week.
not_available I don't have any actual certification, so the pay is pretty terrible.
not_available Yes, but the last time I saw you well, I'm glad you've put your life together.
not_available Wow, I had no idea.
not_available George has just told me the entire history of papier
not_available mâché.
not_available It was fascinating.
not_available May I use your bathroom? Of course, let me show you where it is.
not_available So I left five fucking messages for you after I came back into town.
not_available Why haven't you called me? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You look funny.
not_available I was dehydrated earlier.
not_available Well, now that I have you back, I'm not gonna let you go.
not_available You have to stay for dinner.
not_available I have a million questions for you.
not_available You must have a million for me.
not_available It's just I've been having this funny feeling lately.
not_available So this morning I decided to follow him.
not_available That fucking bastard! I told you he was gonna do this to you one day.
not_available Come on, maybe there's a logical explanation.
not_available Maybe he Oh my God.
not_available What? What is it? What's going on? Rico's charity has a double D.
not_available I will cut his balls off! I need you take the boys tonight.
not_available I need the house to be empty when I talk to him.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I'm gonna be here for hours.
not_available This shit show has been on forever and none of the regulars give a fuck anymore.
not_available I could come by tomorrow and get them.
not_available Fine.
not_available Are you gonna be okay tonight? Don't worry about me.
not_available What if there really is a handsome prince? 
not_available She's really pretty.
not_available and he's a really good kisser? She's gorgeous but in a really subtle way.
not_available Am I supposed to be able to breathe? 
not_available No.
not_available What do you think of her? 
not_available I don't know what makes a girl pretty.
not_available I don't look at girls that way.
not_available From the producer who brought you "The Vanishing" When you were little you used to go on and on about how beautiful you thought Jennifer Aniston was.
not_available That's because I was parroting what the culture was telling me to think.
not_available What did you expect? I was 11.
not_available Do you love me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then I have everything I need.
not_available If you make a noise, I'll shoot.
not_available I'll shoot I'll shoot If you even breathe, I will shoot you in the spine You were told, "Don't look behind." I have to get out of here.
not_available What's going on? I forgot.
not_available There's something I have to do at work with the, uh tumor lady.
not_available Edie, you give Claire a ride home, okay? Do you have any idea what's it's like to see your life fall apart? 
not_available I understand.
not_available I'm just nervous.
not_available It's Maya's first night with the new sitter.
not_available She seems like a nice girl.
not_available I used to babysit when I was a kid.
not_available I hope you hid all your private papers.
not_available You mean you used to snoop around people's private things? All the time.
not_available You wouldn't believe the stuff I found.
not_available Why do the ugliest people always have the dirtiest photos? I don't know.
not_available One time this widow brought in the grossest photo of her husband to help with the embalming.
not_available He was wait, you want me to describe him? Please, don't.
not_available So, how's it being back at work? It's the same old same old.
not_available I'm just trying not to let it get me down.
not_available Now, in my off hours I'm concentrating on relaxing and having fun.
not_available Really? What kind of things do you like to do? I woke up one morning, the bastard was gone.
not_available Stole $5,000 from me, and some Tiffany lamps.
not_available But I'd always hated those anyway.
not_available Oh dear, you must have been so depressed.
not_available This one? Are you kidding? We went to Taos that night and stayed a week.
not_available Had a blast.
not_available Julia Roberts and her husband live there.
not_available We chased them around town like they were wild boars.
not_available How were you able to do that? Oh, I figure the only way you can show everybody is to have the time of your life.
not_available George, let's hear all about you.
not_available You seem interesting.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ruth tells me you had a son sending you boxes of shit.
not_available Bettina! 
not_available What? Like my daughter hasn't done worse to me? Come on, you want to compare war stories? Actually, no, I don't.
not_available Do you have a television? There's a documentary on PBS I wouldn't mind watching a few minutes of.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available There's one in the other room under that mess in the corner.
not_available Having a hard night? Uh no, I just saw some bad coming attractions.
not_available That's a new one.
not_available So what can I get for you? 
not_available Vodka gimlet.
not_available Really? Yeah, my father used to drink them when he wanted something strong.
not_available Vodka gimlet coming up.
not_available Look at that wimp over there.
not_available Let's kick the shit out of him.
not_available No, let's kill him.
not_available We could just hide in his car.
not_available It would be so easy.
not_available You want this? The kitchen made an extra order by mistake.
not_available I see you don't eat that many fried foods.
not_available No, not so many.
not_available And spend a little too much on clothes, I noticed too.
not_available Maybe a bit.
not_available And you shave well.
not_available None of the other guys shave as well as you.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available I'm gonna fucking kill Javier.
not_available Why didn't you tell me you were gay, bitch? Oh, calm down, they're the ones who told me.
not_available Javier's got one big blabbermouth.
not_available I think it's because he's got a real serious crush on you.
not_available Come on, he's married.
not_available Javier's straight, isn't he? Neil, I met on match.
not_available com.
not_available The teacher I met on Salon.
not_available Ah.
not_available Are these internet sites safe? Do they screen these men? Of course not, thank God.
not_available If there was any kind of screening, none of us would make it through, right? I remember I really liked "Looking for Mr.
not_available Goodbar" when it came out.
not_available So, is he never coming in to dinner? George gets very caught up sometimes.
not_available He's a very focused person.
not_available It's a show about the Elgin Marbles.
not_available I mean, how caught up can he be? So, tell me about the one you're seeing now.
not_available His name is Bernie, he's a freelance editor and he has a cat.
not_available He's nice.
not_available He's a loser.
not_available Stop that! He's someone to do things with.
not_available Listen, if all you can say about a guy is that he's someone to do things with, then that's worse than being alone.
not_available Well, I like him, so shut up.
not_available I suppose we should be getting home.
not_available George drives really slowly at night and he doesn't like me to talk so he can concentrate.
not_available If you want, you can stay here.
not_available The bed's pretty bad and the guest room has a strange smell 
not_available We'll take it.
not_available Well, you can have some more wine then.
not_available And then bam, the lady was dead because she let the tumor get so big.
not_available Are you listening to me? 
not_available Of course I'm listening.
not_available "And then bam, the lady was dead because she let the tumor get so big." Can you imagine? Something horrible just growing inside of you? Something terrible just eating away at your insides? Yes, actually, I can.
not_available Oh my God, this is so dirty! But what with your roommates and Maya, I just figured it's not that dirty.
not_available I'm sure they clean it once in a while.
not_available No, I meant this.
not_available This is so dirty.
not_available Uh, I'll take one more for the road.
not_available Sorry, buddy, we're closing.
not_available Oh.
not_available Shit.
not_available I can't do this! What happened? You were like in heat before I'm sorry, I can't! I can't! God, why do I always pick the crazies? She's in a better mood.
not_available Yeah, no gay clubs tonight.
not_available Oh, hey, someone called for you on the stage phone when you was in the can.
not_available "Higwood Jablome"? I don't know a Higwood Jablome.
not_available That doesn't sound right.
not_available Look at it again.
not_available Higwood Jablome.
not_available Don't know him.
not_available No, that's not a G, that's a Y.
not_available And that's an E, not an I.
not_available Oh, Heywood.
not_available I don't know a Heywood Jablome either.
not_available That's not how he said let me see.
not_available JABLOM
not_available E.
not_available Jablow
not_available me.
not_available I don't know this person.
not_available Well, say his name right, maybe you do.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Heywood Jablome.
not_available Heywood Jablome.
not_available What's so fucking funny? 
not_available Say it again.
not_available Heywood Jablome! 
not_available Sure, I'll blow you, K.
not_available # Oh, I'm a lonely little petunia in an onion patch # # And all I do is cry all day.
not_available # She seems sweet.
not_available You two would make a lovely couple.
not_available Well, she's just somebody to have fun with.
not_available We don't really have that much of a connection.
not_available That's 'cause you won't let there be one.
not_available Nate, make a connection with her.
not_available Nah, she's not ready to settle down.
not_available Now you, you were ready to settle down.
not_available I'll say, but I think you two could get together and have a beautiful life.
not_available You can have the life with her you didn't give me.
not_available I gave you everything I had, Lis.
not_available Right.
not_available Here's my advice to 
you stop with the cheap motels, stop sleeping with the crazy ex and try to have a real relationship with this one.
not_available What's stopping you? The pain.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? I can't ever again go through the pain of starting a life with someone only to have it taken away from me.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Whoa! Ouch, that hurt! Life is pain.
not_available Get used to it.
not_available All right.
not_available So, I guess that's it.
not_available Here we are.
not_available Claire, what's going on here? I don't know.
not_available I mean, I feel like maybe you're into me, but you're just confused, right? Because I could be into you if I knew you were into me, you know? So, I'll need you to say it.
not_available I can't say it.
not_available Okay, look, this is what I know.
not_available It's like you really inspire me.
not_available I want to be with you all the time.
not_available I feel like you're this really special person who makes me feel like I am more special.
not_available Okay, that sounded really stupid.
not_available No, it didn't.
not_available This I'm sorry.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, soldier.
not_available Just checking in.
not_available Bren, can we have an honest conversation? Oh, fuck.
not_available I'm sorry, it's just one of us has to wake up here.
not_available This isn't good for you.
not_available It's not good for me.
not_available This is keeping us from really having anything good.
not_available And you know what? We deserve to be happy.
not_available From everything you say, Joe seems like a good guy a little weird, but then again, so are you.
not_available Give him a chance.
not_available Go be with him, really be with him.
not_available Give yourself a chance to be happy.
not_available What if it's too late? 
not_available It doesn't have to be.
not_available Maybe you can just try telling him the truth, what we've been doing.
not_available See where that goes.
not_available That didn't work so well when I told you the truth.
not_available Well, maybe he's more mature than I was then.
not_available Hold on a sec.
not_available What? Why aren't you watching the funeral? These things run themselves.
not_available Where's David? Now he doesn't even show up to clean? He wasn't feeling well this morning.
not_available I told him to stay at home.
not_available I'm working.
not_available I should go.
not_available Uh good luck.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available George seems nice, Ruth.
not_available He reminds me of someone.
not_available Nathaniel.
not_available You must be joking.
not_available They're so different.
not_available George is so academic and Nathaniel was so Nathaniel.
not_available That jovial nature masking something else.
not_available Oh, that.
not_available Their intense privateness, that need to withdraw.
not_available Maybe it's true what they say.
not_available We all pick the same person over and over again.
not_available There's something nice about that.
not_available Hey, let's move it.
not_available We better get a move on or we're gonna be late.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available We feed breakfast burritos to the homeless twice a week.
not_available Breakfast burritos on top of everything else? Oh my goodness.
not_available The teaching, the dating, chasing Julia Roberts like a wild boar how do you do it? Ruth maybe you want to be getting out a little more.
not_available It's so much harder to do things when you're married.
not_available I hear you.
not_available It's not like I've been able to have a long
not_available term relationship and not subsume myself.
not_available I wonder why.
not_available Mom.
not_available Maybe that's our legacy.
not_available But maybe it doesn't have to be.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Oh, it's just this really sad story about this man whose wife left him because he couldn't control his eating.
not_available And nothing the therapist or anybody did could get him to stop eating.
not_available So, she left him and he had a heart attack and died.
not_available Is this your way of telling me that I need to cut down on my snacks? I've done something bad.
not_available I think I've been really, really scared about my feelings for you and it's caused me to act out in old and familiar patterns.
not_available Just say it.
not_available I slept with someone a few times.
not_available This is my problem that I am obviously continuing to struggle with.
not_available It's not you.
not_available What are you thinking? I need to know what you're thinking.
not_available I'm thinking I am so fucked.
not_available I never liked anyone as much as you and I'm never going to like anyone as much again.
not_available So that's it.
not_available It's over and this sucks.
not_available It doesn't have to be over.
not_available It could be like a new beginning.
not_available Do I know this person? 
not_available No.
not_available So, what do you think of it being like a beginning? Not much.
not_available So what do you think it all means? Okay.
not_available Heywood Jablome.
not_available Heywood Jablome.
not_available This is a tough one.
not_available Now, the obvious answer is that he wanted to blow me.
not_available Sure.
not_available I mean, Freud would say that on some level he wanted to blow me whether he knows it or not.
not_available I don't recall Freud's position on the Heywood Jablome phony phone message.
not_available But how would I know if he's conscious of wanting to blow me or not? That is the question.
not_available It is and it is an important one.
not_available I don't know, I guess I could make some sort of pass at him.
not_available What do you think I should do? Are you still there? 
not_available I don't want to do this anymore.
not_available What? Us.
not_available This having sex with other people.
not_available You know, we said if one of us was ever uncomfortable, we could stop doing it.
not_available I want us to stop doing it.
not_available Uh, I don't remember that rule.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Oh, Keith.
not_available Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve to have this happen to me? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Oh God.
not_available Let it out.
not_available I'm here.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Where are the kids? Rico, I know everything about this woman.
not_available About how often you call her, about what you bought her! I've done nothing wrong.
not_available I know you're sleeping with this person.
not_available I'm not sleeping with her! I told you, I'm just helping Sophia.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Oh my oh my God.
not_available I don't want this to be happening.
not_available But nothing is happening! Nothing is 
not_available Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit! I saw her! I sat outside that house! I saw her face when she opened whatever the fuck it is you left for her! She loves you! No, she doesn't.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available You
not_available you gotta get the fuck out of here.
not_available No, no! 
not_available Yes, you gotta go.
not_available You gotta get the fuck out of this house.
not_available Please, Vanessa, just try to understand this.
not_available I do understand this.
not_available I understand it a whole lot better than you do.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Shit! Hey.
not_available Edie, what are you doing here? Claire, I just I couldn't be away from you.
not_available I have to be with you.
not_available I really need you.
not_available You left your wallet in my car.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I thought I lost it this morning.
not_available You know maybe on some unconscious level, you left it because 
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine, I give up.
not_available Let's just sleep together.
not_available Now? In a sec, I need to brush my teeth.
not_available Last night, it seemed like this isn't what you want.
not_available It isn't.
not_available But come on, get undressed.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I don't understand what's changed.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Nothing has changed.
not_available Part of me thinks this is what I want and part of me thinks it isn't.
not_available But what if the part of me who thinks it isn't feels that way because I'm scared? And after all, I do owe you one.
not_available All right, you're on.
not_available Go away, Rico.
not_available Just let me talk to you for a few minutes.
not_available Please just let me in.
not_available Why? 
not_available Please.
not_available Oh, I fell down! Hey, you know what? Maybe you and me and Maile will do something fun this Saturday.
not_available What do you think of that? Oh, I fell down! Huh? She has two dogs.
not_available You love doggies, right? Hello! Oh, man, I can't wait till you start talking.
not_available What the hell are you doing? I'm calling Maile.
not_available I'm doing what you said.
not_available Trying to start a relationship.
not_available With that girl, are you crazy? That'll never turn into anything serious.
not_available But last night you told me that I was desperate.
not_available I am so fucking scared that you're gonna go back to Brenda that I'll do or say anything to stop it.
not_available If you have a relationship with Brenda, then I'll really be dead.
not_available Brenda's just sleeping with me because she really loves Joe.
not_available That's what she does.
not_available No, it's different this time.
not_available You love her and she loves you.
not_available And you should be with her before it's too late.
not_available This is giving me a really bad feeling.
not_available Uh
not_available oh.
not_available If I were you, I'd check that out.
not_available It might be a tumor.
not_available Ha ha.
not_available Yeah, without the silent E, we couldn't have found Kate.
not_available # I'm a lonely little petunia in an onion patch # # An onion patch # # An onion patch # 
not_available # Mmm #
