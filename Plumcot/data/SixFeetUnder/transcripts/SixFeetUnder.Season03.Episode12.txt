
not_available Mr Williman's last statement may be offensive, it may contain expletives or matter of a dark nature.
not_available When Mr Williman expires, you may hear what is known as a death rattle or a snort or a cough of some sort.
not_available Some fellas bleed from the nose.
not_available It's not common but it happens.
not_available Or he may just appear to fall off to sleep, with his eyes either open or closed, it can go either way.
not_available I'm sorry if this is troublesome to you folks but if, when this is all over, you tell me, "Officer Paddick, it happened just like you said it would," then I figure I did my job.
not_available We don't want any surprises.
not_available Any questions? There's no explanation.
not_available There's no excuse.
not_available I can't lay here and tell you there is one.
not_available But if anybody thinks the state of Texas is teaching anybody anything by putting this poison into me, they're even dumber and crueller than I am.
not_available And you're all gonna cry in the same wet hell that I'm going to for doing this.
not_available You're gonna eat shit, you're gonna vomit blood forever.
not_available Because this isn't right.
not_available You're all pigs.
not_available You're all fucking pigs slipping out of God's ass and I would cut all your throats if I could.
not_available I hate this motherfucking Nate, it's Brenda again.
not_available If you're there, pick up.
not_available You must be at work.
not_available OK, well, if you want me to stop calling, could you just tell me, otherwise I'll keep trying.
not_available I'm really worried ..
not_available at 89.9.
not_available The Greater Palm Springs area at 89.3.
not_available Oxnard, Ventura, Carpinteria at 89.
not_available 1.
not_available Lemon Grove at 89.9 But we don't want to get the paper every day.
not_available No, it's not about the money.
not_available It's Look, we don't care how free you make the paper, we don't want all that paper in the apartment.
not_available Yes, that sounds a great saving We're not interested.
not_available Is there coffee for me, too? What was that? I can't stand listening to you deal with those telemarketers.
not_available You have to be so damn nice about everything.
not_available She was just trying to do her job.
not_available And you're trying to do yours.
not_available This coffee tastes like shit.
not_available Keith.
not_available What? Can you hear the tone in your voice? 
not_available Don't start again.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available There is no tone in my voice.
not_available Yes, there is.
not_available It's same tone you used in San Diego.
not_available I'm sick of talking about that.
not_available The same tone When are you gonna get it that you're the one who fucked up in San Diego? It was my family business.
not_available I stuck up for you.
not_available I don't need anybody sticking up for me.
not_available You always turn shit around and make it about me.
not_available You can't face it that you were out of line.
not_available Being on your side is out of line? 
not_available If I don't want you on it.
not_available This is the difference between you and me.
not_available I want you on my side, I need you on my side and it's the one thing that I never have.
not_available That is not true.
not_available Everything I do is too weak or too nice.
not_available You don't really like me.
not_available You're not for me.
not_available I look at you and all I think about is how I can help you be whatever it is you wanna be between now and the day you die.
not_available You look at me and all you see are problems.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I'm so fucking sick of it.
not_available God! Why should I stand for this? Why should this constant abuse be what I call love? Don't touch me.
not_available Remember, nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight.
not_available Have you arranged for a ride? I was just gonna take a cab, I thought.
not_available You know? I'd prefer it if a family member takes you home.
not_available Nobody in my family would wanna do that, I don't think.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You have a friend who could help you? No.
not_available Well, we really don't want you to drive yourself.
not_available This has been the longest month of my whole life.
not_available I can imagine.
not_available Yeah? Get this.
not_available I lost my job to go to my father's execution.
not_available Isn't that the most pathetic thing you've ever heard? My stupid boss told me I shouldn't go and I did.
not_available Where did you work? A used
not_available car dealership.
not_available It's OK, I'll get another job.
not_available It's just so dumb.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Now I'm out of a fucking job.
not_available Thank you, right thing.
not_available Work can be difficult with regards to something like this.
not_available You don't know.
not_available And on top of that, I'm out like $700 because I had to pay to ship his body back from Texas.
not_available Miss Williman, will you be wanting a service for your father? Or we could just 
not_available No.
not_available I want a service for my dad.
not_available I thought Father Jack talked to you.
not_available No, he didn't.
not_available He told me he did.
not_available He did, Rico.
not_available He talked to David.
not_available I forgot to tell you.
not_available He called yesterday from St Bart's.
not_available That's my church.
not_available I'm sorry, I didn't know.
not_available I don't want the fact that he killed a bunch of women to be the only story anybody ever tells about him.
not_available I mean, he was a kid once.
not_available He had a life.
not_available I've seen the pictures.
not_available And he wasn't such a bad dad.
not_available My brother got the shit beat out of him a lot but he never beat me.
not_available Well, excuse me one moment, Miss Williman.
not_available I'll find the other Mr Fisher and we'll figure this thing out.
not_available Thank you.
not_available OK.
not_available I bet if my dad wasn't a murderer, you'd be saying all kinds of sweet things to me.
not_available Like how hard this must be for me and shit like that.
not_available No, I know how hard it is for you.
not_available I'm sorry, I've been having a hard time myself lately.
not_available Show me what the choices are for the box while we wait.
not_available OK.
not_available They're little people.
not_available They fall into the pipe here and they go down through the pipe and then they break apart into a bunch of little pieces over here and then they disappear.
not_available And then slowly, very slowly, they get put back together and come out the other side.
not_available So, show me the boxes.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There are a lot of affordable choices so you don't have to worry, you don't have to spend a lot.
not_available That's good cos I don't have a lot.
not_available Like almost nothing.
not_available I talked to David.
not_available Everything's been taken care of.
not_available I've made stuffed cabbage rolls.
not_available If anybody wants some for dinner, they're in the sky
not_available blue Tupperware.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's such a beautiful day today.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available What? 
not_available It's one of Lisa's Dr Peppers.
not_available She doesn't drink Dr Pepper.
not_available Maybe not in front of you.
not_available Put it back in the fridge 
not_available I can't leave Maya.
not_available We'll get her after things have cooled down.
not_available Why did I ever get myself into this? You wanted love and he made you believe he could give it to you.
not_available That's what Nate does.
not_available You've always known that.
not_available He's toxic.
not_available I should have brought Maya with me.
not_available Maya's on her own journey, Lisa.
not_available This is about you.
not_available It'd be wonderful if someone could take her to the park.
not_available Well, I think that's it.
not_available If any of you need me, I've left the number by the phone.
not_available So, what are you guys doing tomorrow? Same old shit.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Why? Nothing.
not_available Where's Mom going? 
not_available George's.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available The original title of this famous poem was He Do The Police In Different Voices.
not_available The Waste Land.
not_available That is a much better title.
not_available Well, we're still a genius, even with one wrong.
not_available I'm dead already.
not_available Ruth? 
not_available No more questions.
not_available Do you move this fast with everybody? No.
not_available But then I've never met anybody like you before.
not_available I don't want you to get away.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available I guess I do feel like the stars are moving a little faster lately.
not_available Like in those movies where they speed things up.
not_available And the stars stream across the sky in stripes, they're moving so fast.
not_available But But what? My daughterin
not_available law's been missing for over two weeks, my granddaughter may be without a mother for the rest of her life.
not_available I'm just very aware of how important it is to enjoy what life gives you when it gives it to you.
not_available Who knows, George, you may be my last chance at finding love.
not_available And you may be my last chance to be happy.
not_available You've been happy before.
not_available Not like this.
not_available Russell, stop calling or I'm gonna change my number.
not_available You actually hit him? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available I just swotted him away.
not_available See, I don't see why you two stay together if it's always that bad.
not_available It's not always that bad.
not_available But even if it's that bad for a little while You know, me and Vanessa, we've got the kids to think about.
not_available Gay couples have no reason to stay together? No.
not_available I'm saying I don't see how anybody stays together without kids.
not_available It was a compliment.
not_available It doesn't sound like a compliment.
not_available We got something chunky here.
not_available A clot, I don't know.
not_available All gone.
not_available Hello, comrades.
not_available Hi, Arthur.
not_available So, this is the gentleman who murdered all those women.
not_available Yep.
not_available Only to be murdered himself by the state of Texas.
not_available You're against capital punishment? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available It fails to deter other criminals and mistakes are often made.
not_available Innocent people die.
not_available Innocent people die cos of guys like him.
not_available What did he do anyway? He made one woman eat broken glass 
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available It's bad enough things like that happen.
not_available I agree.
not_available But, Rico If he did something like that to Vanessa, 
not_available I'd happily flip the switch.
not_available What about the value of human life? He cashed in the value of his human life a long time ago.
not_available He's a dorito, crunch them, don't make more.
not_available You get worse.
not_available Nate.
not_available Maya's having a nap, I'm gonna go for a quick run.
not_available Who's watching her? 
not_available Claire.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available It's Mr Williman.
not_available Remember? With the daughter.
not_available So what the fuck are you doing? He came in here already embalmed.
not_available He looked like a tangerine.
not_available I thought this was a better colour.
not_available I agree.
not_available Oh, God, now what? Hi.
not_available Your father's service is tomorrow, right? 
not_available I know.
not_available I wanted to talk to you about flowers.
not_available Well, we'll take care of that.
not_available It's part of the package.
not_available But, I mean, what kind of flowers do you like or do you think we should have? I only asked cos, you know, you're a man.
not_available Well, we have a florist who does all the arrangements.
not_available It'll be a nice selection and variety.
not_available Nothing pink, don't worry.
not_available OK.
not_available Do you wanna go get some coffee or something? I haven't eaten anything yet today.
not_available Thank you, but I'm kinda busy.
not_available Is your wife around? No, she's not.
not_available I think you should go, I was just about to go out for a run.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't have to be sorry.
not_available I don't know where else to go.
not_available I don't have a job, I just sit around all day and stare at the walls.
not_available It's OK.
not_available Look, I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available It'll look great, don't worry.
not_available Nothing pink.
not_available Right, nothing pink.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Get the cordless.
not_available I know.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available Then one day it isn't charged up and you need it.
not_available This one has more torque.
not_available How much torque does a guy like me really need? This one feels good in your hand.
not_available Try it.
not_available See what I mean? I do.
not_available George, I wonder if we shouldn't just get married.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available I am.
not_available Because I've been thinking the same thing.
not_available You have? I don't mind telling you I'm lonely and I've been lonely for a long time and I Ruth, I think I think it's a wonderful idea.
not_available You really do? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I don't want to come to places like this alone.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available That's what life is, coming to places like this.
not_available Yes.
not_available It's awful.
not_available I know! So let's get married.
not_available What the hey? I want to, that's what I'm saying.
not_available Me too.
not_available I've been married before, you should know that.
not_available Of course, you have two grown children.
not_available More than once.
not_available How many times? Six.
not_available I should have told you before.
not_available No, I'm glad you didn't.
not_available Get the cordless, I'll help you make sure it stays charged.
not_available It's a deal.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You didn't happen to see a dog on the beach? No, I'm sorry.
not_available Gosh darn it.
not_available You lost your dog? 
not_available Not me, my wife.
not_available What does he look like? 
not_available He's a chocolate lab.
not_available Wanna see his picture? No, I didn't see him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Good luck.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I've been calling and calling.
not_available I wanted to know that you're OK.
not_available Well, I'm not.
not_available But there's not a lot we can do about it so Thanks anyway.
not_available I'm trying to be your friend.
not_available Sorry, were you there the night that you kissed me? Do you know how that makes me feel? 
not_available My wife's gone.
not_available I know.
not_available I can't imagine what you must be going through You have no concept of what I've been going through.
not_available I haven't slept in days, I've been to Gaviota State Beach five times.
not_available I been driving up that fucking PCH putting up flyers on telephone poles.
not_available Then let me help you.
not_available Why the fuck would you wanna help me? 
not_available I care about you.
not_available I can't just turn that off.
not_available Sure you can, you've done it before.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Just give her to me.
not_available I couldn't get her to sleep.
not_available Just Thanks.
not_available Do you think you could give me a ride? I have to go get an abortion.
not_available Sure.
not_available It's so good you've kept up with your chorus.
not_available It must be a wonderful outlet.
not_available It is.
not_available It's What? Well, there are times when you're in the midst of all these voices, being carried along, and all you have to do is get to the end of the song.
not_available For a few minutes, it's that simple.
not_available Just get to the end of the song.
not_available That's kind of a relief.
not_available From the rest of life? Yes.
not_available I think Lisa's dead.
not_available I do, too.
not_available I hate to say it but I do.
not_available I just feel like she's gone.
not_available For a while, I imagined all kinds of things.
not_available Her showing up I know.
not_available She was a part of our family.
not_available Maya's my niece.
not_available She was such a sweet person, why should something like that happen to her? Why is life like that? Thanks for the tea.
not_available David Yeah? I've been seeing someone.
not_available George, yeah.
not_available We've noticed.
not_available It's going pretty well.
not_available Good.
not_available He seems a nice enough guy.
not_available He is.
not_available I've I've been thinking maybe I could think about even settling down with him.
not_available It would be time, maybe, to try that again.
not_available That depends on what you mean by settling down.
not_available Well, getting married.
not_available Don't you think I deserve to be happy? 
not_available Of course.
not_available But you've only known him for a few weeks.
not_available Why do you have to rush into it? Because.
not_available When I'm with him, life is full of possibilities and I haven't felt that way in so long, I've forgotten what it feels like.
not_available I don't want to forget that again.
not_available It's your decision, I just don't wanna see you get hurt, that's all.
not_available Sushi.
not_available Like what? Like spicy tuna or yellowtail, I don't like it when it gets too baroque.
not_available Like frozen spider roll of the 10,000 secrets? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't need that.
not_available Me neither.
not_available What else do you like? I don't know.
not_available It has different orchestrations Hey, David.

not_available God, thank you, yes.

not_available See you later.
not_available I'll be here.
not_available Ms Fisher? Good afternoon.
not_available Dr Simpson.
not_available Before we begin the procedure, I'm going to do an ultrasound.
not_available You'll feel a little pressure, it won't be too uncomfortable.
not_available I see you chose Twilight.
not_available I don't know.
not_available The sedation.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's Twilight.
not_available You're not really gone but you're not really here.
not_available That sounds good.
not_available You're going to be OK.
not_available Am I? 
not_available Yes.

not_available A bath, no tampons, just Motrin, pads and get some rest.
not_available You'll feel better by tomorrow.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mary, Hayley, Bethany, Rosa.
not_available What do you think? I think it's a wonderful book.
not_available You should be proud.
not_available "University of Maryland Press.
not_available " 
not_available My alma mater.
not_available It really is a different way of seeing things.
not_available Isn't it? To me, California has always been here, but to you, it's just stopping by.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm thinking we should slow down on the marriage plans.
not_available I don't want anything else to change, would that be OK with you? I know I must seem confused.
not_available It's only because I am.
not_available Ruth, I'm here if you want me.
not_available I don't have any other prospects and I don't want any.
not_available So there's no rush.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Why isn't there a picture of you? 
not_available I didn't want one.
not_available It's about rocks, not me.
not_available It just feels like it ought to be the end.
not_available I'm so tired of having the same fight over and over again.
not_available I hear what you're saying.
not_available I'm so bored of this kind of unhappiness.
not_available I think I'm ready for some new unhappiness.
not_available There are all kinds of things I could say but Go ahead, say them.
not_available No, I What? Say it.
not_available I want you to know, more than anything, David, that I take you and your situation with Keith really seriously and if you can be happy with Keith, I want you to be, you know what I'm saying? I do.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, how you feeling? 
not_available A little bit better.
not_available It just feels like really bad cramps.
not_available You need another pad? 
not_available No.
not_available Another Motrin? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available So, what do you think of my new house? It's kinda gross, isn't it? 
not_available No, it's cool.
not_available And it's kinda gross.
not_available I know.
not_available See? I know.
not_available I used to wonder when I'd get there, to the grown
not_available up place.
not_available Almost got there with Nate.
not_available And then here I am.
not_available You're still in love with my brother, aren't you? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Only in the way that I always will be but not in the way of thinking about him like, "God, when am I gonna see Nate again?" you know what I mean? Yeah, I do.
not_available I am worried about him, though.
not_available I know.
not_available He's so fucked up with Lisa being wherever she is.
not_available You know what's weird about Lisa? What? Well, I think she really liked me 
not_available I'm sure she did.
not_available She was fucked up, too, don't get me wrong.
not_available Just a different kind of fucked up from our family.
not_available Like a mostly friendly kind of fucked up.
not_available You miss her? 
not_available I guess, yeah.
not_available Sorry if that's 
not_available No.
not_available It's totally right.
not_available Well, I'm going to make some pasta.
not_available I was just gonna do it with olive oil, nothing too aggressive.
not_available You want some? No, I don't think I can ever eat again.
not_available Hey, it's Nate.
not_available Tell me when you want me to stop.
not_available I don't want you to stop.
not_available I want you inside me.
not_available No, no, wait.
not_available I like it like this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available You'll wake the baby.
not_available I don't care, you're fucking me so good.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available Fuck me till I can't remember my name.
not_available Just fuck me.
not_available Fuck me.
not_available Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship or distress or persecution or famine or peril of the sword? No.
not_available In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loves us.
not_available For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God.
not_available Carl Williman was a part of God's good creation.
not_available Susceptible to sin, yes, but worthy of grace.
not_available May his soul and the souls of those whose lives he took find peace in the infinitely complicated and eternal life of God.
not_available I knew her at St Bart's.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was pretty fucked up.
not_available Seems like it.
not_available So I came out of the closet.
not_available And that was good? Yeah.
not_available And I'm in a committed relationship.
not_available With Keith? Yeah.
not_available That's supposed to be a good thing, too, right? That's what I've heard.
not_available So, shouldn't my life be better? Truth and relationships don't make life better, they make life possible.
not_available So you think I should stay with Keith? I think you should do whatever brings you deeper into the reality of your life.
not_available The reality of my life.
not_available Yes, but not the life you think you can have, the life you've got.
not_available Hi.
not_available What you doing? I am just checking things out, you know, keeping track.
not_available I had a really good time last night.
not_available And I think we should I think we should do that again.
not_available I don't think that's such a good idea.
not_available How come? 
not_available I just don't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Are you serious? You're gonna cry? I can't help it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Have you seen what kind of fucking world this is? You see what people do, what your fucking father did, now you're gonna cry? "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
not_available " You don't get to cry.
not_available Where were you last night? I was looking for you.
not_available To watch Maya? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was busy.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Can I have these? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I don't care.
not_available That's weird.
not_available What? Russell used to say the whole house smelled like the colour wheel.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available He liked it here.
not_available Well, somebody should get something out of it.
not_available Nate, maybe you could give Brenda a break.
not_available She's only trying to help.
not_available Things between me and Brenda are a lot more complicated than you might think.
not_available Yeah, I'm sure I could never imagine.
not_available So what went wrong? Well, the first one was Susie and we just got married too young, that's all.
not_available Wasn't anybody's fault.
not_available Number two.
not_available Gloria, yeah, that one was my fault.
not_available I screwed around.
not_available I know better now.
not_available You better know better.
not_available Number three.
not_available She was the one I was screwing around with.
not_available Tanya.
not_available We were at Rutgers, my first job.
not_available Assistant professor.
not_available She cheated on me all the time.
not_available How do you not see that coming? Andrea died.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Cheryl, that one was only for nine months.
not_available And Doris, the last one, died.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Well, if you marry six people, a few of them are gonna die, that's the odds.
not_available And you're ready to try again? With you? Of course.
not_available Why? You don't want to? No, of course I do, George.
not_available I think.
not_available But you had all these women.
not_available Let me tell you something.
not_available One time, one time I bought a house, this was back in Massachusetts when I was teaching at Amherst, and the house was built over a stream.
not_available Literally over it.
not_available It had been a mill at one time and someone had taken the wheels and grinding stones out but it was still over the stream.
not_available And after we moved in I wanted to put a new floor in the kitchen.
not_available So? So I tore up the old floor, ripped up the linoleum, pulled up the plywood.
not_available Then I pulled up one of the original boards.
not_available This 200year
not_available old pine board.
not_available And there was the stream, not two feet underneath me.
not_available I'd always known it was there but there it was.
not_available You know 
not_available really.
not_available There it really was.
not_available This live, sparkling water, flowing right underneath my house.
