not_available Well, what do you wanna do today? We could fill some things up, dump them out.
not_available Maybe then we can poop.
not_available What do you say? Huh? Arthur, you wrote this music? You actually wrote it yourself? 
not_available Not exactly.
not_available You are so multifaceted.
not_available Not really.
not_available It's just a theme by Debussy.
not_available But I've developed it somewhat, put a drumbeat underneath it.
not_available Just for fun.
not_available It's nothing much.
not_available Arthur, that's amazing.
not_available It's nothing, really.
not_available Anybody could do it.
not_available No, it really is.
not_available You're a very talented young man.
not_available Where's the button to make it play again? I love that little tune.
not_available It's so haunting.

not_available I thought I might take a run this morning.
not_available I didn't know you ran, Arthur.
not_available Well, I haven't ever before, actually.
not_available But I thought I might give it a try.
not_available I seem to have gained some weight lately.
not_available But you look fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available People and their weight nowadays, it's such a strange fascination.
not_available I see you all the time round the house and you look fine, just fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, I Where are you going to run? Pardon me? Where are you going to run? 
not_available Oh.

not_available Brenda's dad died.
not_available ' What? 
not_available Brenda's father died.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available 'Yeah.
not_available ' Would it be OK with you if I went to the Can you make any more noise? I can still hear myself think.
not_available Funny.
not_available What? Would it be OK with you if I went to his funeral? Of course.

not_available It feels like I should check in with her.
not_available Then go, you totally should.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available 'Yeah.
not_available ' 
not_available OK.
not_available 'You'll leave Maya with your mom?' I'll figure it out.
not_available Tell her not to give her any more cheese.
not_available She's already constipated.
not_available Tell her to go easy on the Nuk.
not_available I don't want her to get buck teeth.
not_available I love you.
not_available 'Love you too.
not_available ' You having fun?

not_available The funeral's up in Malibu in a few hours.
not_available Where's Mom? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She just left.
not_available Said she needed a new gardening hat.
not_available She seemed kind of weird.
not_available How can you tell when Mom's weird? 
not_available Good point.
not_available Can you watch Maya for me today? 
not_available I can't.
not_available Why not? Russell and I are going to the art store.
not_available Claire.
not_available Nate.
not_available This isn't The Matrix.
not_available The rest of us who don't have babies, we're real.
not_available "Watch my baby, watch my baby.
not_available " Jesus Christ.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Fuck.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I thought I could drop Maya off with Todd and Dana's nanny, but I guess not.
not_available You should give Vanessa a call.
not_available Vanessa? Yeah, she's at home with the boys today.
not_available She'd be OK with it? 
not_available Of course, she loves babies.
not_available I'd be a couple of hours.
not_available I'd drop her off, pick her up.
not_available Do it.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available You'll have to pay her.
not_available Well, sure.
not_available Great.
not_available Keith, tell me you're not really planning on wearing that.
not_available What's the matter with it? 
not_available It covers up all your good big parts.
not_available My good big parts? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take that thing off and go put on something better.
not_available Maybe your silver DKNY T
not_available shirt.
not_available Is this a brunch or a fashion show? I want everybody to be jealous of my beautiful boyfriend.
not_available OK? I have two things going for me in this world and you're one of them.
not_available What's the other one? 
not_available All right, one.
not_available You knew that sweatshirt was a bad idea when you put it on.
not_available I guess.
not_available You're so wilful sometimes.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We could just skip the brunch, stay here.
not_available I could be wilful all afternoon.
not_available You make a very strong case.
not_available But I really want a mimosa.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your loss.
not_available Up we go.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's so cool you're leaving the baby for a while.
not_available You sure it's all right? 
not_available It's perfect.
not_available It breaks up the day.
not_available What's that smell? 
not_available That's pudding.
not_available I tried to make rice pudding but the milk was weird.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Thanks.
not_available The place is a total mess.
not_available I was just starting to clean when you called.
not_available It's so hard to pick up with two kids.
not_available Yeah, I can imagine.
not_available I don't think you can.
not_available I know it seems having two kids would just be twice as hard, but it's like three times or four times as much to do.
not_available I don't know how that is, the math, but somehow it all adds up.
not_available Of course.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're lucky, you just have one.
not_available Lisa's such a good mom.
not_available I bet she does everything right.
not_available She's good, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I get so tired sometimes, I could almost cry.
not_available Whatever happened to Barney? When it was just Barney, things were simpler then.
not_available Let me just go put this stuff down and then I'll take her off your hands, OK? Man, I could so go totally broke in this place.
not_available Every time I come here I feel like Augustus Gloop in the chocolate room.
not_available You know who I'm talking about? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When I was a kid those Oompa Loompas used to freak me out.
not_available My mom always made us watch it and we cried every time.
not_available It was like she didn't even care.
not_available Parents are freaks.
not_available Word.
not_available I felt so bad for Charlie.
not_available He's so poor.
not_available It's a fucking nightmare.
not_available Wow.
not_available What? It's cobalt blue.
not_available Just think, this is the natural part of the earth that's this colour blue.
not_available Like Olivier said.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's an element.
not_available You add oil to it and make pictures with it.
not_available Like cave people.
not_available I love it.
not_available You should buy it.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available I'm not even really a painter.
not_available I'm not gonna spend What, 50 bucks? It's a little tube of paint.
not_available If I'm gonna paint I'll buy the cheap five
not_available dollar shit.
not_available You should get it.
not_available No way.
not_available Get it.
not_available No.
not_available I'll get it for you.
not_available No, I don't need it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get it.
not_available No.
not_available OK.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What are you doing back here? To tell you the truth, I don't really know.
not_available What's up with Vanessa? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You're sure? Uh, yeah.
not_available She's been down in the dumps since her mom died, but other than that, why? I don't know, Rico.
not_available I got there and I don't know how to put this.
not_available She had this really intense energy going on and there's no way I could have left Maya.
not_available You didn't feel safe leaving Maya at my house? 
not_available That's not what I'm saying.
not_available What are you trying to say? 
not_available Hello, gentlemen.
not_available Look who decided to come back to work.
not_available Do you need someone to watch Maya today? Um Cos I love infants.
not_available They smell so sweet.
not_available No, Arthur, I'm OK.
not_available I'm gonna take her with me, but thanks.
not_available Never hesitate to ask.
not_available I used to watch my cousins all the time and they were Mormons.
not_available Mormons? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK, I'm gonna wash up and get to work.
not_available Rico, I'm sorry 
not_available No need to apologise, Nate.
not_available I was just trying to do you a favour.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available So let it be said of me when I am gone, "He lived by the light of the ten thousand things.
not_available "His heart with starry sparks was thus sustained "And love and meaning passed through him and fled.
not_available "To carry joy from dark to dark was joy enough for him.
not_available "The man is dead.
not_available " I just have some pictures.
not_available This first one is of Dad and me in the back yard standing next to my hole to China.
not_available I was five years old, trying to dig a hole to China.
not_available He never, ever told me I couldn't actually get to China.
not_available He just kept digging with me until I got bored.
not_available It was a good day.
not_available The second one is of the whole family with Dad at the APA conference in 1984.
not_available They gave him an award and he got up there and made all these jokes about Jimmy Carter needing Adlerian therapy.
not_available I didn't get the jokes.
not_available I was proud of him that night.
not_available Proud that he was my dad.
not_available This last one Come on, Billy.
not_available It's just a really good picture.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Hey.
not_available Welcome to my humble abodea
not_available lair.
not_available Oh, neat.
not_available Sorry we're late.
not_available Fuck that.
not_available Your timing is perfect.

not_available Thanks for having us over.
not_available You kidding? The pleasure's all mine.
not_available Rrrrr! 
not_available Hey, everybody, it's David and Keith.
not_available Hi! So come on in, come on in.
not_available Grab a mimosa, have some quiche.
not_available The quiche is in quotes.
not_available I'm not a total idiot.
not_available Whatever you do, don't look Trixie in the eye.
not_available Who's Trixie? 
not_available My little pooper dog.
not_available You are my little pooper, aren't you? Don't look her in the eye.
not_available She'll freak out and poop.
not_available We're talking spraying poop.
not_available Seriously, don't even look at her.
not_available You got it.
not_available By the way, we're playing Leading Ladies.
not_available Best of luck.
not_available He just put something on my back.
not_available No, it's a game.
not_available Leading Ladies.
not_available Everybody is a leading lady.
not_available You have to figure out who you are by asking questions.
not_available "Am I this? Am I that?" Come on.
not_available You can decide to have a rotten time or decide to have fun.
not_available You sound like a camp counsellor.
not_available All right, I'll have fun.
not_available Let me see who you are.
not_available Oh, that's good.
not_available I hope that poem was satisfactory, Margaret.
not_available I seem to remember Bern liking it.
not_available And I seem to remember Bern thinking you were an absolute asshole.
not_available Mom, chill.
not_available Billy, your Uncle Marv is here for his own complicated reasons.
not_available He deserves to have his own complicated experience.
not_available Thank you, Marv.
not_available It was a perfect poem.
not_available You did your duty.
not_available You can now get the fuck out of here.
not_available Shhh, please.
not_available Brenda.
not_available See you.
not_available Billy.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hey.
not_available He never forgave your father for being a success.
not_available Or giving up Hanukkah.
not_available It's better..
not_available Nate? 
not_available Hey, Margaret.
not_available So sorry to hear about Bern.
not_available Nate, please, don't give me that funeral home shit.
not_available Come on, now.
not_available Did Brenda call you? 
not_available No, I read it in the paper.
not_available You just came here under your own steam? 
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available That's so strange.
not_available Hey, Billy.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available We're going to be at the condo later.
not_available Just the family.
not_available Just a little dinner.

not_available Oh, Arthur, hi.
not_available Hi, Ruth.
not_available Did you have a good time stalking me? What are you talking about? 
not_available Oh, please.
not_available If you like following people so much, why don't you join the CIA? Or the Moonies? Or why don't you go to the actual fucking moon and mind your own moon business? You freak! Hi, Ruth.
not_available Did you have a good morning? Oh, yes, Arthur, thank you.
not_available It was wonderful.
not_available Thank you so much for asking.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I have to go upstairs.
not_available My hair feels funny.
not_available OK.
not_available Bye.
not_available Keith seems like a lot of laughs.
not_available Oh, stop.
not_available He's just a little out of his element.
not_available Completely.
not_available I love that he even came.
not_available It's so not his type of thing.
not_available What's his type of thing? I don't know.
not_available He likes to cook and work out.
not_available He loves old movies.
not_available He's probably doing very well.
not_available Tell me, am I a black widow? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Am I known for my figure or my face?

not_available For 30 seconds, anyway.
not_available OK.
not_available What do you wanna talk about? Tell me something about Maya.
not_available Oh.
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available Aren't you? She discovered the telephone the other day.
not_available It's become her favourite new toy.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available She accidentally speed
not_available dialled my neurologist's office yesterday.
not_available They thought there was a stroke victim on the end of the line.
not_available I can't believe you came.
not_available Of course I came.
not_available Hey, Vanessa? 
not_available 'Yeah?' Hey, I just talked to Nate and he told me he came by.
not_available Yeah, he did.
not_available 'What happened?' I don't know.
not_available Don't tell him I said this, baby, but he seemed kind of out of it.
not_available You sure nothing else was wrong? Rico, remember how paranoid we were the first year with Julio? We wouldn't leave him with anybody.
not_available Maybe that's how new parents are.
not_available So So you feeling OK? 
not_available Yeah, I feel fine.
not_available 'You sure?' Yeah, Rico, just come home.
not_available The kids are just bouncing off the walls.

not_available I never knew I had a medulla oblongata.
not_available Now I could draw it for you.
not_available Along with everything else in my head.

not_available Jeanne Tripplehorn.
not_available Who wants a margarita? It's a stupid game anyway.
not_available Watching him die 
not_available Yeah? It was like watching somebody get washed out to sea, only they're sitting right there in bed.
not_available A wave comes, takes them a little away.
not_available Another wave comes, takes them a little away.
not_available Every wave is a day.
not_available Little by little, off they Off they go.

not_available I've lived my whole life in a weird position.
not_available I've missed you.
not_available Through this.
not_available I've missed you too.
not_available It's not like I don't know how much being with you changed me.
not_available How much you woke me up as a person.
not_available I wouldn't be who I am today if I'd never met you.
not_available I certainly wouldn't floss every day.
not_available Are you keeping up with that? 
not_available After every meal.
not_available It changed me too.
not_available Yeah, how so? You're the first person I've lost where it really cost me something.
not_available That's why I haven't been with anyone since.
not_available Nobody? 
not_available It's too scary.
not_available The thought of screwing it all up again.

not_available That is so not the answer.
not_available You know what I think? About what? 
not_available I don't know.

not_available Magic.
not_available What am I even gonna do with this, you dumbass? It cost 50 bucks.
not_available I don't care what you do with it.
not_available I just wanted you to have it.
not_available I have a theory that every now and then a person should get what they want, when they want it.
not_available Keeps you optimistic.
not_available It's a good theory.
not_available But I've never been optimistic.
not_available Maybe it's time to start.
not_available It's a lot of money, though, Russell.
not_available So what? Money only fucks up art anyway, right? I'd rather be poor and see you happy.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available I have to be careful now, right? No.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I have to be careful I don't get too used to this.

not_available Brenda was there, but I took Maya because I couldn't find anyone.
not_available Nate, I would have come home and taken care of her myself if I knew you were gonna do that.
not_available Why? 
not_available Oh Did Brenda hold Maya? No, she was sleeping practically the whole time.
not_available Did she look at her? 
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available Did she touch her? 
not_available I guess, yeah.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available You swear she didn't hold her? 
not_available Yes, I swear.
not_available Would it have mattered if she did? Do you care about me at all? You and Maya are the most important things in my life.
not_available Don't let your old girlfriends hold our baby.
not_available I didn't, so what's the problem? 
not_available It's not that complicated, Nate.
not_available Anyone who knows other people exist would have figured it out.
not_available You think I'm still in love with Brenda? I'm not.
not_available You went to her father's funeral.
not_available After checking with you.
not_available You said it was OK.
not_available Why do you spend time with her? Why can't you let her go? 
not_available Whatever Brenda and I had, it's over.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available It doesn't take anything away from what we have.
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available After you spend time with her, you're different.
not_available How am I different? 
not_available You're more like you used to be.
not_available I wish you were more fucking like you used to be.
not_available I haven't changed at all.
not_available You used to have a life.
not_available You had friends, a job.
not_available You didn't focus on what's wrong with me and how I'm constantly disappointing you.
not_available I'm gonna take a walk.
not_available I brought this for you.
not_available What is it? 
not_available A truffle.
not_available Lise, come on.
not_available Give me some goddamn space.
not_available OK.
not_available 'It's weird.
not_available ' That's the man who gave us life, who influenced us more than any other man ever did or probably ever will, and now he's just dirt in a jar.
not_available I hated him for so long.
not_available He did the best he could.
not_available We all did.
not_available Hey, Daddy.
not_available Bren.
not_available Wow.
not_available This is what Nate faces every day.
not_available I suppose now we have to do something with your father's goddamn ashes.
not_available Well, it is kind of traditional.
not_available I can't face that.
not_available Not yet.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available He's in no hurry.
not_available You know, you've never felt so much like my children before.
not_available Having your father around always took the edge off that sensation, I think.
not_available But I look at you both now and you're both so mine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available When you were little children, Bren, you used to start everything you said to us with an "and" or a "but".
not_available You'd say, "And, Mom, can we go to the store?" Or, "But, Dad, when we were talking before, you said " I mean, you always started with a conjunction like that.
not_available And then, Billy, when you started talking, you did the same thing.
not_available He learned that from you, Bren.
not_available Your father used to say living with you two was like listening to the longest sentence in the history of the universe.
not_available And now there's no one to hear it but me.
not_available Dear Carl and Cameron, greetings from Cousin Arthur.
not_available A baby
not_available sitting opportunity passed me by today and left me thinking of you two fellows.
not_available I hope you're enjoying spreading the gospel in Kansas City.
not_available My internship is coming along swimmingly.
not_available There's a dear, charming woman here at the funeral home who is very kind and attentive.
not_available Well, I suppose that's all there is.
not_available PS.
not_available Keeping in touch would be a lot easier if you got an email account.
not_available Vanessa? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was just thinking, maybe, uh maybe it's time for you to see a doctor or something.
not_available You know, get some medicine.
not_available For what? For I don't know.
not_available Your mood? My mood is exactly how it ought to be, Rico.
not_available When your mother dies, you're allowed to be upset about it.
not_available For how long? 
not_available For however long it takes.
not_available Listen.
not_available Julio's parent
not_available teacher conference is Monday at four.
not_available Can you make it? 
not_available I'm just worried about you.
not_available You know that, right? I'm just trying to let you know that I'm here for you.
not_available Will you be able to make it? If you can't, I can cancel it or change it or something.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You don't have to worry about Bren.
not_available I'm not worried about her.
not_available You don't have to worry about Bren.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available You've found your happiness, Nate.
not_available She'll find hers.
not_available It's just a matter of time.
not_available What if I haven't found mine?
