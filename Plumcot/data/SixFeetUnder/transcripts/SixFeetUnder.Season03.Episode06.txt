
not_available OK, ten o'clock audience, listen up.
not_available Please have your questions ready for Dr Dave on your yellow question card.
not_available You must have your question card filled out before you enter the studio.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's yours say, Karen? How can I stop feeling competitive with my motherin
not_available law? I've heard that one before.
not_available Try to make it more specific.
not_available How can I stop feeling competitive with my chainsmoking bitch of a motherin
not_available law? I do not have any pens.
not_available If you need a pen, please ask someone near you.
not_available Read yours.
not_available Oh, OK.
not_available I feel I should be happy because I have everything, but I'm not happy and that makes me feel guilty and then I hate myself.
not_available Aw.
not_available I wanna write, "I love you, Dr Dave.
not_available " Is that crazy? Do you think he'll get mad at me? Is he married? 
not_available Karen asked if he was married.
not_available You live in a hole? Of course he's married.
not_available And he's sensitive and loving with the kids and he wants to make love only when you do and he never ever passes gas.
not_available You're mad! We will be opening the studio in approximately one minute.
not_available Jesus, it's time.
not_available Please have your bags ready to be inspected.
not_available Do you have a Kleenex? 
not_available I think I do.
not_available I might need another Kleenex.
not_available Don't get it on your suit.
not_available Go through the metal detector.
not_available We're going.
not_available The studio is now open.
not_available The studio's opening.
not_available It's just been so dry, you know.
not_available And the wind's just Oh, dear.
not_available Here, keep the pack.
not_available Should I call someone? 
not_available Keep moving, people.
not_available You go on.
not_available This will stop.
not_available Save me a seat up close.
not_available OK.
not_available Do you want my cellphone? You'll miss the best seats.
not_available Wow.
not_available Ma'am? Are you We got a situation here.
not_available What you got? The coroner said she died from a nose bleed.
not_available That's whacked, losing that much blood through your nose.
not_available Not as uncommon as you might think.
not_available Your dad and I had a couple of these back in the day.
not_available She was probably born with a deviated septum and at some point they fixed it.
not_available Yeah, and they gave her a cute little nose while they were at it.
not_available That could be a nose job.
not_available Sometimes plastic surgery creates this scar tissue which can end up choking a major artery until it just explodes one day.
not_available Jesus, we're all just walking time bombs.
not_available You can pop her in the reefer for now.
not_available My large friend's gonna need both tables till we can casket him.
not_available Hey, that Triple X come in from Appleby yet? 
not_available Er no.
not_available Shit.
not_available Let me know where you'll be in a couple of hours.
not_available It'll take a few of us to move him.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm going away for a couple of days.
not_available Oh, yeah? Where to? Camping.
not_available Finally.
not_available In Seattle I used to go every other weekend.
not_available There's nothing I love more than getting away with my tent where there's nobody.
not_available Sounds nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, Lisa decided she wanted to come and bring Maya, so we're all going.
not_available Plus some friends of ours and their kid.
not_available You and Vanessa ought to get away.
not_available Yeah, well, every weekend since Vanessa's mom died we're at her house cleaning out her stuff.
not_available How's Vanessa holding up? 
not_available Misses her mom, I guess.
not_available Doesn't talk about it a whole lot.
not_available What's to say, really? Oh, dammit.
not_available Where the hell did my new mousse go? We're gonna have so much fun, baby girl.
not_available The skies aren't smoggy there, so you get to see real stars.
not_available Not the fuzzy invisible LA stars.
not_available And you get to play with Spencer, smell your first campfire.
not_available Shall we bring your baby Deadhead onesie, or is that too obvious? 
not_available Hey, honey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? Right.
not_available Listen to this.
not_available Hikes near Hungry Valley.
not_available Difficult.
not_available Do we need more than one spatula? Catch the intense scenery from atop Suicide Rock, which received its name when a Native American princess threw herself off it.
not_available We gotta see this.
not_available Bring the book just in case.
not_available Did you check my tent bag for the stakes? 
not_available We rented a tent cabin.
not_available I know.
not_available Just in case we wanna sleep out one night.
not_available With Maya? You can't sleep on the hard ground with a baby.
not_available You can.
not_available This is how everyone used to live.
not_available We're in the land of the Chumash.
not_available You think Native Americans had tent cabins? They didn't have clip bars and we're bringing those.
not_available Let's see what Todd and Dana wanna do.
not_available We're sharing a cabin, not doing everything with them.
not_available If we could afford our own 
not_available How does that apply? Never mind.
not_available I'm just glad we finally have couple friends.
not_available You're shitting me.
not_available What? Deer Springs Trail starts where we're staying and heads straight to Suicide Rock.
not_available Let me pack your books.
not_available Do you mind if I look at them? 
not_available Bless you, Arthur.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Isn't that wonderful? What's that? 
not_available The handkerchief.
not_available Such a lovely custom.
not_available Shame it's fallen by the wayside.
not_available Oh, darn it all.
not_available What's wrong? Silent Running was playing over the weekend.
not_available I missed it.
not_available I don't believe I know Silent Running.
not_available Phenomenal film.
not_available Science fiction, but overlooked in the genre.
not_available Ah.
not_available It's about a botanist who's marooned on a space freighter.
not_available His only companions are three little robots that look like TV sets.
not_available He names them Huey, Dewey and Louie.
not_available They play poker with him.
not_available They sound adorable.
not_available Oh, they are.
not_available Quite lovable indeed.
not_available And yet benign.
not_available Obedient.
not_available Much like television itself.
not_available Perhaps the writer's comment on how technology can be controlled and used effectively for humankind.
not_available Perhaps not.
not_available Starring Bruce Dern.
not_available With music by Joan Baez.
not_available I used to love listening to her.
not_available Ah, well, I'll see it another time.
not_available You need more coffee? 
not_available No, I just filled it.
not_available Of course you did.
not_available This is gonna look hot, hot, hot, baby.
not_available I did blue hair in eighth grade.
not_available That was sincere blue hair.
not_available This is a comment on blue hair.
not_available Maybe it was more magenta.
not_available Maybe this is my first blue hair.
not_available Tinfoil thingy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're taking it from the same place as the other side so it's even? If it's too even it looks like you're trying too hard.
not_available If it's haphazard, it's more like "fuck you".
not_available Just not too uneven.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available The "enter without knocking" sign is clearly legible.
not_available I'm only here because Rico said you took some of my brushes without asking.
not_available Russell, this is my brother David.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm sorry, I'm blue.
not_available I understand.
not_available I work with dangerous chemicals myself.
not_available Claire, we use this brush to spread Velvetone on people's faces.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I should have told you you were using something with dead people on it.
not_available I ain't scared of no dead people.
not_available Anyway, it's your hair.
not_available My hair was raised with dead people.
not_available All right, well, we're done.
not_available We got 15 minutes.
not_available Oh.
not_available This is great.
not_available Liar.
not_available It sucks.
not_available It doesn't suck at all.
not_available First, you're crazy.
not_available It's totally perfect.
not_available Second, all Olivier says is, "Look at Russell's work, people.
not_available "Russell's work is pulsating.
not_available It's making me hard.
not_available " Your teacher says that? Yeah, but it's not like harassment.
not_available It's more like a comment on harassment.
not_available Well, I'm going downstairs.
not_available Nice to meet you, Russell.
not_available When do we rinse? Oh, ass.
not_available I forgot what time we started.
not_available Oh, ass.
not_available Doesn't smell too bad in here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe we can push a couple of beds together.
not_available But Maya might fall through the middle.
not_available Maybe we can push a bed against the wall.
not_available Just one sixpack? 
not_available We won't be drinking the whole time.
not_available Of course not, but Todd likes his beer and I like to have a few.
not_available Sure, but he doesn't drink
not_available drink.
not_available I know, but between him and me we'll go through a six
not_available pack tonight, minimum.
not_available Isn't that the point of sitting round a campfire? 
not_available You told me to bring my weed.
not_available If you have weed, why do you need beer? Maybe because I like to unwind and kick back and forget that I spend my days surrounded by death.
not_available All I really care about is that you don't smoke cigarettes.
not_available Not out here where the air's so pretty.
not_available I already pretend I don't know you smoke at home.
not_available I appreciate your pretending.
not_available Not here.
not_available I hate the smell on your clothes.
not_available Heel.
not_available Hey! Hey! How you doing, Spencer? 
not_available Hey.
not_available All right! 
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you doing? How are you? 
not_available Good.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available How are you? Help me with the cooler.
not_available We brought a ton of beer.
not_available Sure.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available So which bed do you want? What's your preference? 
not_available One that doesn't have scorpions in it.
not_available I was thinking we could check out Suicide Rock.
not_available What a great fucking hike.
not_available I was up there last winter by myself.
not_available I don't see it happening this trip.
not_available Why not? Not with the kids.
not_available Just you and I can go up.
not_available Dana wouldn't be into me taking off.
not_available We should go up there another time.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're here now, dude.
not_available I'm sure we can get a couple of hours.
not_available How long you two been married, brother? Come in.
not_available Please please enter.
not_available Oh, I don't need to come in.
not_available I wanted to tell you that I was running errands at the mall.
not_available You know, the new mall that's just opened.
not_available A mini
not_available mall but with underground parking.
not_available What do they call those? I pulled in to see what they had done with it and lo and behold they had a video store and I got Silent Running.
not_available 'Now, Huey, you're gonna plant a tree.
not_available 'Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.
not_available 'We're gonna do it right here.
not_available 'Side of the hill.
not_available ' He has to teach them everything.
not_available UU.
not_available It stands for Unitarian Universalist.
not_available But it's about as not religious as a religion can be.
not_available That would be nice.
not_available Not a place that preaches but one where we can be with people like us.
not_available No big God.
not_available No crosses or dripping blood or shit.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Just people getting together.
not_available Anyone wanna catch a buzz? Shall I go get my bullet? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah, go ahead.
not_available All right.
not_available How often does Jesus come up? Pretty rarely, but when he does they remind us that he was black.
not_available Right.
not_available As opposed to the Brad Pitt Jesus America tries to sell us.
not_available Jesus wasn't black.
not_available Yes, he was.
not_available Everyone was black.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Uh, well, I'm not gonna have any if you're not going to.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you're not gonna have any, I guess I'll pass too.
not_available Great.
not_available Now I'm the only one who's stoned.
not_available '! Doomed '! In his innocence '! In the sun '! Gather your children!' 'Come on, fuck me hard.
not_available Do it.
not_available ' I've got to get the dishwasher running.
not_available Do you have anything? 
not_available My glass.
not_available It's so great to be out of the city.
not_available I know.
not_available Wouldn't it be cool to have to live off the land? To be a part of nature instead of just looking at it? Not that cool.
not_available I'm getting my "I need my Starbucks" headache.
not_available I guess in the past I dated a lot of crazy girls.
not_available Needy attention
not_available suckers.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Artists/writers/psychos.
not_available Always this whole drama thing.
not_available If I say something she might take it the wrong way.
not_available It's like I'm walking through this minefield of her childhood.
not_available There should be a sign.
not_available "Caution, unexploded daddy issues.
not_available " 
not_available I've been there.
not_available But Lisa's different, you know.
not_available All that bullshit fairy
not_available tale stuff isn't real anyway.
not_available Working through it, wanting to.
not_available It's probably the first adult relationship of my life.
not_available Ours is more like we can't keep our hands off each other.
not_available She just loves to bang.
not_available Sometimes I feel, when we're having sex, he secretly hates me.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available Not conscious, not like he knows it on any level.
not_available I know it's stupid but I really feel like that sometimes.
not_available It is stupid, because you're a beautiful woman and the mother of his child, so why would he hate you? I know it's crazy, but sometimes it's like there's this unspoken thing between us.
not_available Unspoken what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Yeah, I'm the mother of his child so he has to Madonna
not_available fy me.
not_available Maybe I'm just mad at the whole world because my orgasm thing is screwed up.
not_available Since you had Maya.
not_available You've heard of this? Something is different.
not_available It freaks me out.
not_available It took me a couple of months to be able to come after Spencer was born.
not_available I can come, but only half the time and half as intense.
not_available Could childbirth have reorganised me? 
not_available I've heard that.
not_available But I'm sure it'll get better.
not_available Do you just say, "It's not happening tonight so you're on break, hon"? No.
not_available Please don't tell me that you fake it.
not_available Of course not.
not_available OK, maybe I do exaggerate here and there.
not_available Realising everything has happened in my life so I could be ready for this.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available It's like your heart is outside your body.
not_available You see it for the first time.
not_available And knowing that all of it it's always been about her.
not_available Yes.
not_available God, yes.
not_available I feel the exact same way about Maya.
not_available No, I was talking about Dana.
not_available Right.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Our thing, it's incredibly hot still.
not_available He's got the dirtiest mouth.
not_available I love it.
not_available Like what? The dirty talk, what does he say? 
not_available Children in the vicinity.
not_available So whisper.
not_available Just tell me one.
not_available They sound so stupid out of context.
not_available OK, like, "Oh, baby, I wanna come on your tits.
not_available " See, it sounds so stupid.
not_available Oh, my God! There's a snake.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't make any noise.
not_available And don't move..
not_available It's OK.
not_available Nate.
not_available What did you do that for? Is it dead? 
not_available It's way past dead.
not_available Poor little guy.
not_available That's not cool, man.
not_available It's not poison.
not_available It's a gopher snake.
not_available I don't care what fucking snake it is.
not_available Oh, fuck! Goddamn! Don't any of you fuckers wanna go for a fucking hike? Come on! Agh! Mediocre.
not_available Redundant.
not_available Terrible.
not_available Blah, blah, blah.
not_available Hm.
not_available Elephant art.
not_available Does anyone know what elephant art is? A term the Fluxists invented.
not_available My dad was a Fluxist.
not_available Does anyone know what a Fluxist is? Fuck that.
not_available Why doesn't anyone know what elephant art is? Who are you people? Don't you guys read? This is elephant art.
not_available My head is on backwards.
not_available I feel like my head is on backwards.
not_available Yes, we get it.
not_available Termite art.
not_available Look at me, Claire.
not_available Tiny, beautiful termite art.
not_available Termites work secretly at night, but they can tear down a house as fast as an elephant can.
not_available But they don't stop.
not_available They infest.
not_available Good job.
not_available Like that? 
not_available Exactly.
not_available Light touch.
not_available You don't wanna go all Joan Crawford on him.
not_available No, I certainly don't.
not_available Hello! Arthur! Is it OK if I return this? 
not_available Don't keep it for me.
not_available Good.
not_available Well, I'll take it back, then.
not_available Nothing else you'd like me to pick up while I'm there? 
not_available Not that I can think of.
not_available OK, then.
not_available There's leftover blintzes in the fridge if you get hungry.
not_available Either of you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't think just because you're living here you have to do things with the Munsters.
not_available I don't think that.
not_available I mean, take a load off, Arthur.
not_available OK, Biggie Smalls' viewing is tomorrow morning.
not_available Ever worked with the Triple X casket? 
not_available Not quite this size.
not_available This is what we call Advanced Casketing Techniques 101.
not_available The viewing is tomorrow but we're gonna lay him out upstairs tonight because you don't wanna worry about it the morning of.
not_available I thought it was great.
not_available It's not the point.
not_available Everybody makes crap sometimes, but what's with the big need to humiliate me? I don't know.
not_available I don't do well at this kind of thing.
not_available I don't need somebody telling me that I suck.
not_available Particularly in front of people who suck way worse than I do.
not_available Did you see that whatshername Levine's stupid fucking mermaid? How can you grow as an artist if you don't have the freedom to fail now and then? 
not_available I've failed.
not_available He likes yours.
not_available Really? It wasn't that clear to me.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available What difference does it make? The world's gonna be blown to smithereens any day now.
not_available We just kissed.
not_available We just kissed again.
not_available Nate, go hike.
not_available Don't you wanna come with? 
not_available I have my magazines.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Go.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll only be an hour or two
not_available ish.
not_available OK, I just wanna make sure you're not saying go ahead and hike and what you mean is stay here and help me with the baby.
not_available Now's the perfect time.
not_available I have my magazines, Maya's mellow.
not_available Go.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks, honey.
not_available See you later, OK? Oh, my God! No fucking way! What in the world are you doing up here? We're on a camping trip.
not_available We're at the end of the trail.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm at a B&amp;B; in Hungry Valley with some friends.
not_available They're right behind me.
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available It's like fate.
not_available How are you doing? At this moment, not great, to be perfectly honest.
not_available I think it's really weird that you're up here.
not_available I am hiking with my friends.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Friends? What are their names? 
not_available Frank and Douglas.
not_available You think I can't tell when you're lying? 
not_available Whoa.
not_available What's with the paranoia? What, are you high? Are you stalking me now? 
not_available Don't flatter yourself.
not_available You're stalking me! You followed me and my family up here.
not_available What the fuck do you want, you crazy fucking bitch? Oh, yeah, I'm crazy.
not_available Whoo! Crazy, scary, crazy, psycho, right? Tell me the fucking truth! 
not_available I needed to talk to you.
not_available We already talked.
not_available Claire said you were up in Kern County, so I came up here Were you watching me when we were camping? 
not_available No, nothing like that.
not_available Dammit, stop bullshitting me! Nate, I miss you.
not_available So much.
not_available Don't you miss me? 
not_available No, I do not.
not_available Yes, you do, you do.
not_available You think about me.
not_available No, this is not gonna happen.
not_available All right? Just kiss me.
not_available Just kiss me once.
not_available Just once, baby, and then we're done.
not_available Oh, I remember that feeling.
not_available Flowing into each other like water.
not_available Look, I can't.
not_available I can't live without you.
not_available I won't.
not_available You're gonna have to.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm sorry for everything.
not_available Brenda! I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this to you.
not_available That was my first time.
not_available Shut up! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I did that to you? Well, the first time.
not_available So technically that was your first and second time? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available That's impressive.
not_available Yeah? I would have thought it was your fifth or sixth time.
not_available I feel really safe with you, Claire.
not_available You are really safe with me.
not_available What the fuck was that? Goodness! 
not_available Rico's gonna have my behind.
not_available Claire? Claire? Claire? What? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I can see you're entertaining.
not_available I wouldn't ask if this weren't a genuine crisis.
not_available David's not here, Nate's camping.
not_available I'm gonna need your help.
not_available Would you mind asking your friend, please? Stay here.
not_available Claire, please.
not_available Go get your friend right now.
not_available Ruth, wait right here.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available You have a friend in the house? The boy with the tattoo? Another one.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm not bringing him down here.
not_available Russell, you really don't need to be here.
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available It's OK.
not_available I'm cool.
not_available Hello, Mrs Fisher.
not_available How nice to see you again, Russell.
not_available Dead weight is the hardest weight to move.
not_available I'll need everyone's strength.
not_available Tell me what to do.
not_available We don't have much time.
not_available His facial cartilage is collapsing.
not_available Our first concern is rolling our friend onto the board.
not_available On the count of three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Well done.
not_available He doesn't look too bad.
not_available Now, I want you to position yourself at a corner.
not_available Is this corner OK? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lift the board onto the gurney so I can get it downstairs.
not_available On the count of three, give it everything.
not_available Everything.
not_available Lift with your legs.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Lift.
not_available I guess that didn't work 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available OK.
not_available I'm starting to get a little freaked out now.
not_available Just a little.
not_available Claire, I'm sorry I raised you around so much death and that your friend had to see this.
not_available The cranial
not_available facial work is tricky, but I'll do what I can before you arrive.
not_available Of course I'll wait for your assistance before I hoist.
not_available I think that's a good idea.
not_available And again, Federico, I am so sorry about what happened.
not_available No, it couldn't have happened to anyone.
not_available I shouldn't have let it happen on my watch.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available OK.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Well, I think I'm going up to make some hot cocoa.
not_available Would you like to join me for a cup? Thank you, but this requires my immediate attention.
not_available I suspect I'll be pulling an all
not_available nighter.
not_available I can bring it down to you.
not_available Chocolate makes me queasy.
not_available OK.
not_available Tea? 
not_available No, really.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Spencer will sleep for an hour.
not_available If she wakes, give her Thomas the Tank Engine.
not_available If you guys wanna take a private nature hike later, we'll watch Maya.
not_available It's only fair.
not_available Fair's fair.
not_available Have fun.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I hate couples like that.
not_available Letting you know how great their sex life is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think they doth protest a little too much.
not_available Like sex is everything.
not_available Sex is everything.
not_available She's always talking about it like it's the glue.
not_available But what if someone gets throat cancer or diarrhoea and you see the real person? Then you have to be able to help them into their electronic car or make their vitamin drink and still love them even though no one feels sexy.
not_available Yeah, it's so much more than just 
not_available "Todd and I have the greatest sex.
not_available "I just love it when he comes on my tits.
not_available " She said that? OK, I'm ready.
not_available Knotted up back here.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Yes.
not_available Oh, so now you're both going through your blue period? Don't get mad at me, Fisher.
not_available If Russell has something to say to me, he can say it.
not_available How's my pressure? 
not_available Go deeper.
not_available Why has he turned into such an asshole? 
not_available Just ignore him.
not_available You ignore him too.
not_available It's just hair.
not_available I don't understand what the big deal is.
not_available Fuck elephant, termite, whatever.
not_available I already forgot who was which.
not_available What's the point of humiliating people? 
not_available I was the elephant.
not_available Why do you even give a shit? 
not_available You're my teacher and I respect you.
not_available Don't you fucking respect me.
not_available I'm an idiot.
not_available I'm not God.
not_available Don't ever respect anyone except your fucking self.
not_available Fucking babies.

not_available When I was in high school, I dated girls.
not_available We're in college.
not_available And when I was in college.
not_available And after college.
not_available I didn't know what I was, and while I was trying to figure it out I went back and forth You don't get it.
not_available There's no back and forth with Russell.
not_available He's never been gay.
not_available I was just assuming.
not_available He's never been gay.
not_available He's never had sex with anyone before me.
not_available OK.
not_available My mistake.
not_available I can't even make a phone call in this house because I don't get cell reception anywhere, my mother's in my fucking room At what age did you completely stop sleeping with women? I know when you first slept with that boy, but did you overlap after that? Yeah.
not_available There were ten years when I wasn't sure.
not_available Or I was sure but didn't want to be.
not_available I was with some women pretty seriously.
not_available What, Jennifer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was with a ton of women.
not_available I liked fucking women.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available You've told me.
not_available What I mean was I did this whole emotional deal with girls women.
not_available Like "Honey, I could really think about spending the rest of my life with you.
not_available "I don't know, buy some land in Northern California and build a house, "design it ourselves.
not_available "What about Willem for a boy and Coco for a girl? "Willem and Max if we have twin boys, "or if we have twin girls, Coco and Clementine.
not_available " Are you sure they didn't know you were gay? They didn't suspect.
not_available They thought I was their man.
not_available They'd look right back into my eyes.
not_available All the while I was just trying that guy on to see if I could make it fit.
not_available 'Oh, yeah! Right there, right there.
not_available ' 
not_available She's down.
not_available Great.
not_available You guys wanna take your turn?

not_available Pretty.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you want to Not really.
not_available I'd be afraid to take my clothes off.
not_available Something could crawl on me.
not_available We're not really Todd and Dana, are we? What's that supposed to mean? I was just acknowledging that the reasons we're together aren't the same as Say it.
not_available What? There's nothing to say.
not_available Say it, Nate.
not_available Why are you even with me? What are you even here for? On this trip? What? 
not_available Why did you marry me? You think Maya and I need you? You don't want this.
not_available You want your daughter but you don't want me.
not_available I can't say anything! Not hurtful things, and it's hurtful to suggest we're together because of Maya.
not_available I am not trying to hurt you.
not_available That was me thinking something.
not_available You know how friends do? But that would mean you'd have to like me.
not_available That's stupid.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Think about it.
not_available When I say something that doesn't fit into your fairy tale This is no fairy tale.
not_available That I know.
not_available You made up a story, cast me in this role.
not_available You cast yourself.
not_available Making the mother of my child happy is a role? I don't think so.
not_available But you have this narrow path I can walk on where I'm on your fucking leash.
not_available No smoking, two beers a night, no pot without prior written approval.
not_available Smoke your lungs out.
not_available I don't give a shit about smoking.
not_available I give a shit about being myself.
not_available About saying what I need to say and not having you fucking freak out on me.
not_available I'm sorry, then.
not_available Fuck.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Kiss me.

not_available That rock is hard and cold.
not_available Lay down on that.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available I wanna fuck you on this rock.
not_available But first I'm gonna make you scream so that everybody back at camp can hear you.
not_available And then when you're exhausted and you're laying here coming down, I'm gonna fuck you right here on this rock.
not_available There were a couple of times back in Seattle when we had sex like that.
not_available When you came home from a party at that costume designer's house who worked for Seattle Rep.
not_available What was her name? 
not_available Tessa.
not_available Right.
not_available She'd just broken it off with you and you were so drunk and pissed and you came home and we ended up having the most amazing sex I'd ever had in my life.
not_available The other time was the night after you ran the marathon the first time.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And that girl you met from Portland was supposed to come over and celebrate.
not_available But she never showed up.
