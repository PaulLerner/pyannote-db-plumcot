
not_available Dillon.
not_available Hey, there, buddy.
not_available What are you doing awake so late? Does he look okay to you? 
not_available He's just fussing a little, is all.
not_available He doesn't look a little funny? Of course he looks a little funny.
not_available That's his daddy's nose.
not_available He's just a little sleepy.
not_available There's my baby's smile.
not_available Why don't you go back to bed? I'll be in as soon as he falls asleep.
not_available You sure? It's all right.
not_available Go back to sleep.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're still here.
not_available What, no breakfast? 
not_available I've got to go to work.
not_available You were a lot nicer online.
not_available Yeah, well, people aren't always who they seem to be.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available You need to leave.
not_available Now.
not_available Whatever.
not_available See you in the chat rooms "Jim." Again.
not_available Again.
not_available Again! Fucking bitch.
not_available Morning, Mom.
not_available Bren, Bren, if you're there, pick up, It's Billy, Pick up the phone, Brenda, 
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Pick up the fucking phone, Please? Fuck you.
not_available Look, I need you, Bren, Things are not good, I need you, Brenda! Goddamn it! Fuck! Bitch, Lovely way to wake up, huh? Brenda, you're gonna have to face him sometime.
not_available Sometime, just not now.
not_available Let's get major espressos, take a walk on the beach.
not_available Can't.
not_available I gotta get ready for my trip.
not_available What trip? Vegas, baby.
not_available Vegas.
not_available The annual Western States Funeral Directors Conference.
not_available Was that today? I thought that was months away.
not_available No, just me and David and 300 funeral directors cutting loose in the city of sin.
not_available Why would you do that to yourself? 
One We get to attend helpful seminars where we learn new tricks of the trade.
Two We get to commiserate with all the other sad fucks who are being edged out by Kroehner.
Three We have the perfect opportunity to get in Matt Gilardi's face, tell him we know Kroehner burned down the house across the street.
not_available The ongoing pissing contest.
not_available That'll be good for you and David.
not_available You'll have fun.
not_available I don't know how much fun he's gonna have.
not_available He's giving this big speech about the future of the independent funeral home.
not_available David doesn't strike me as the type of guy who gives speeches.
not_available My dad was scheduled to do it.
not_available Dave volunteered to fill in.
not_available It's kind of a big deal for him.
not_available He's pretty nervous about it.
not_available Call me from Vegas.
not_available I will.
not_available Unless I'm flailing about in a pool having sex with some showgirl.
not_available I'll miss you.
not_available Oh, fuck you! I know this is an exceptionally difficult time for you but can you tell us what you had in mind for your son's I'm sorry.
not_available We're only here because the hospital suggested we call you guys.
not_available We're not even sure what we're doing here.
not_available He is a perfectly healthy baby.
not_available Can I ask, what was the cause of? SIDS.
not_available Yes, well, if you need to take some time before we start making arrangements that's completely understandable.
not_available The arrangements? What arrangements? For his funeral.
not_available Funeral? 
not_available He was only 3 weeks old.
not_available It might help if you think of it less as a funeral and more as a way of saying goodbye to him.
not_available I don't want to say goodbye.
not_available He just barely got here.
not_available Of course it's difficult for anyone to come to terms with something as unexpected as this, but 
not_available It's not just difficult.
not_available It's not even remotely possible.
not_available Some babies are just too good for this world.
not_available We'll fix things so you can spend as much time with him as you need.
not_available How old is he? 
not_available Barely 3 weeks.
not_available SIDS? Yeah.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available You should've been here for the intake.
not_available The parents are practically children themselves.
not_available They didn't even know they were supposed to have a funeral.
not_available Welcome back, Rico.
not_available Thanks, Nate.
not_available You're sure you're up to this? 
not_available Yeah, yeah, it's no problem.
not_available We'll only be gone till Sunday.
not_available If you need anything, I can hop on a plane and be back in an hour and a half.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available I have some of your T
not_available shirts here.
not_available They're still warm.
not_available Mom.
not_available Oh, don't let me stop you.
not_available You know, I probably should take a couple of those T
not_available shirts with me to Las Vegas.
not_available David, I want to ask you something.
not_available I'm really kind of in a hurry here.
not_available I just wanted to know Are you? 
not_available Mom.
not_available Can we talk about this when I get back from Las Vegas? Yes, of course.
not_available That's a lovely idea.
not_available We'll talk about it when you get back from Las Vegas.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Dimas? It's Claire Fisher.
not_available I'm sorry to keep calling, I was just wondering if you've heard anything from Gabe yet.
not_available What? When? Oh, my God.
not_available Is he okay? What hospital? Okay, thank you, Mrs.
not_available Dimas.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You are late.
not_available 10 minutes.
not_available I know, I'm sorry.
not_available Is okay.
not_available I just want you to know that I notice these kinds of things.
not_available It won't happen again, Nikolai.
not_available We have to talk.
not_available It's about your work.
not_available I said I was sorry for being late.
not_available No, no, no, has nothing to do with being late.
not_available Is about how you arrange the flowers.
not_available What? 
not_available There have been complaints from some of the customers.
not_available There have not.
not_available Afraid so.
not_available Ruth.
not_available You are not so good at arranging.
not_available I am too.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available From now on, Robbie will handle arrangement and you will work the register and help with the books.
not_available I don't want to help with the books! I helped my husband with the books for 30 years.
not_available I want to do flower arrangements.
not_available Tell me what's wrong with my arrangements.
not_available Not all arrangements are for funerals, cupcake.
not_available You think my arrangements look funereal? It's like Robbie said.
not_available There have been a few complaints from some customers.
not_available No.
not_available We done talking now.
not_available Robbie will do the arrangement, you will work on the register.
not_available You gonna nail Gilardi for the arson job in your speech? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Let's think.
not_available Possible libel charges, maybe.
not_available Mind if I say something to him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Don't.
not_available Pussy.
not_available Nate, do we have any evidence against him? No.
not_available Apparently the police don't either.
not_available Look, I don't want you picking a fight with Gilardi.
not_available Why not? You basically threatened to kill him that one time.
not_available I'm coming with you.
not_available Great.
not_available It's okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to get out of here.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, my God, is that a penis? 
not_available Rico.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It is, isn't it? 
not_available Your wife doesn't want me to say.
not_available The baby's okay, right? 
not_available Baby's fine.
not_available But you have mild to moderate preeclampsia.
not_available What is preeclampsia? 
not_available A $ 10 word for prenatal hypertension.
not_available Your blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like.
not_available Could cause some problems if it gets out of hand but we're not gonna let that happen.
not_available What kind of problems? Let's not even go there.
not_available This baby's fine.
not_available Worse comes to worst, we go in a little early, we do a C
not_available section.
not_available We'll take a look at your labs, check your blood pressure in a day or two and see how we're doing then.
not_available Until then, I want you on strict bed rest.
not_available I really wouldn't worry about this.
not_available The baby is fine.
not_available If you came looking to collect more money for Anthony's funeral I'm all tapped out at the moment.
not_available This one shoots up too much speed and heroin.
not_available Now I'm stuck paying for this fancy
not_available ass hotel room to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while they keep him under observation.
not_available I'm going out for coffee and smokes.
not_available Speed and heroin? Yeah, well, I thought I'd try something different.
not_available Different like with a needle in your arm? 
not_available Hey, what is this?! Twenty fucking questions? I've been through this already, all right? With the doctors, with the police, with my mom.
not_available Now I gotta put your mind at ease too? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I would've been fine if you had just minded your own fucking business.
not_available Well, excuse me for giving a shit! This wasn't an accident, was it? I wish you would just fucking leave already.
not_available Fine.
not_available Here.
not_available "The emerging role of funeral directors in mass aviation disasters." That sounds like fun.
not_available Do you realize how many of these seminars are sponsored by Kroehner? Who's "Jasmine Brecker"? She's either a federal judge or a sex surrogate.
not_available I haven't decided yet.
not_available You got any matches? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay, boys.
not_available Let's mingle.
not_available When in Rome.
not_available I think maybe my expectations of this trip were a little high.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Happy hour.
not_available Well, well.
not_available The Fisher brothers.
not_available You know, I wondered if you'd even bother to show.
not_available I understand you'll be speaking tomorrow in place of your father.
not_available What was your topic again? The future of independent funeral homes.
not_available Well, I'm certainly looking forward to that.
not_available I'd invite you boys to the Kroehner party at the Luxor, but it's only for affiliates.
not_available Damn.
not_available Because we'd really like to be there.
not_available I'm sure you corporate lackeys really know how to party.
not_available Have fun with the other dinosaurs, boys.
not_available Oh, Matt, I have something for you.
not_available This is a pack of matches.
not_available This is for a can of lighter fluid.
not_available Next time you need to unload some cumbersome real estate, you'll be all set.
not_available Nate, that was not smart.
not_available I should've set his fucking hair on fire.
not_available Bottoms up.
not_available I love Las Vegas.
not_available It has to be the most artificial place on earth.
not_available You think so? More than Disneyland? 
not_available Oh, come on, more than Japan.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What are all these little cartoon explosions all over their butts? 
not_available They look like they're farting.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, coupons.
not_available Hey, Dave, you wanna get some of that famous Las Vegas $4.99 prime rib? I have it on good authority it's just as good as the $6.99 prime rib over there.
not_available No, I think I'll just head up to my room order some room service, make an early night of it.
not_available You sure? Yeah, I should work on my speech anyway.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, we'll see you in the morning.
not_available Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
not_available Yeah, not likely.
not_available I have two words for 
you 
not_available Lap.
not_available Dance.
not_available Yeah, who says I want a lap dance? Who says it's for you, baby? 
not_available Kinky.
not_available I thought I told you to leave.
not_available I drove all the way out here to Barstow.
not_available If you think I'm gonna turn around and drive back, you're seriously whacked.
not_available This is like Bumfuck, Egypt out here.
not_available You spent the night? Yeah, I slept in my car.
not_available My mom still here? 
not_available No, she went out for more cigarettes.
not_available Did you say anything to her about? No.
not_available Are you gonna? I haven't decided.
not_available You hungry? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't eat this hospital shit.
not_available It all tastes the same.
not_available Here.
not_available I got you an Egg McMuffin because I know they're your favorite.
not_available How is it? Fucking cold.
not_available But good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available In this class, we're gonna be working on freeform summer arrangements.
not_available And if we have any time at the end of class, I'm not promising because I want us to get to our breathing exercises but if we have time, we might try a spiky arrangement or two.
not_available But first we're gonna start by doing a little work treating our stems.
not_available And we're gonna start by working with our woody stems because they can be a little on the tricky side and require the most TLC.
not_available Tough loving care.
not_available Okay, let's start with an azalea, one of my favorites.
not_available Starting an inch or two from the bottom of the stem and if it's a thick stem, we really have to smash them we split the stem vertically.
not_available Does anyone know why we do this? Anyone? Yes.
not_available So it will draw more water? 
not_available Very good.
not_available Did everyone hear that? So it will draw more water.
not_available Okay.
not_available Does everyone have their hammers? Let's begin.
not_available You're supposed to be in bed.
not_available I needed to get some turkey franks and milk for Julio.
not_available Why didn't you call me? I could've stopped home on my way from work.
not_available He has a snack at 3:30.
not_available Why didn't you call your sister? She just got two days on a new Nicolas Cage movie.
not_available She plays this hooker who witnesses a murder, then gets raped and killed.
not_available She's got lines and everything! She wants me to come visit her on the set.
not_available Well, you're supposed to be in bed.
not_available I got bored and went to the market.
not_available What's the big deal? What are you doing home anyway? 
not_available I came home for lunch.
not_available I was worried.
not_available Rico, please.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm not just worried about you.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is about the baby at work.
not_available I just I can't do it.
not_available Of course you can.
not_available He looks like Like he's sleeping.
not_available Like a baby who's fallen asleep.
not_available He was 3 weeks old.
not_available There was nothing wrong with him.
not_available And then, just like that he dies.
not_available For no reason.
not_available How can that be? How can the beginning and end be so damn close together? And now I've got this real bad feeling.
not_available I haven't done a baby since Julio was born.
not_available David always does them.
not_available So make David do this one.
not_available David's in Vegas until tomorrow.
not_available The viewing is this afternoon.
not_available Some babies just aren't meant for this world, Rico.
not_available But this one is.
not_available Turn to page seven in your notebooks we'll go step by step through the most challenging cranial facial reconstruction I ever faced.
not_available If we could go to the next slide, please.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available That shit is fucked up.
not_available Nate, this is Chloe Yorkin.
not_available The job Federico left us to do for Kroehner? Oh, God.
not_available That is like fucking science fiction.
not_available The first question my team and I asked ourselves was not as it might have been at a facility with less resources can we do this? 
not_available They don't even credit Rico by name.
not_available Oh, man, he's gonna be furious.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Well, that is a very generous offer, Roger but unfortunately I am in a relationship at the moment.
not_available If I was Deal me in.
not_available Jesus, Billy.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hey! So where's your boyfriend? What are you doing here? I love Vegas.
not_available You know I love Vegas.
not_available And sometimes when my sister isn't there when I need her, I hop in my car start driving, wind up here.
not_available Billy, you're lying.
not_available I'm really not.
not_available I just saw you at the blackjack table.
not_available It was a total coincidence.
not_available You're a fucking liar.
not_available You're a selfish, manipulative, narcissistic liar.
not_available What did Mom and Dad tell you? 
not_available They told me that you made a bomb.
not_available That's fucking hilarious.
not_available So now I'm like, what, a terrorist? "Billy Mc Veigh"? They're fucking liars, Brenda! They hate each other and they're miserable and they're jealous of us and they want us to hate each other too.
not_available So they lie to us! No, they lied to me, you lied to me.
not_available You let me believe you tried to kill yourself.
not_available Do you know how fucked that is? You know what? I was so fucking drugged up I don't even really remember what happened.
not_available Dad showed me what you wrote.
not_available I was kidding, okay? It wasn't serious.
not_available Do you have any idea what I gave up for you? Because I thought that if you tried to kill yourself again and succeeded I could tell myself that I did everything I could to save you.
not_available And you did.
not_available You've saved me every day since then.
not_available Well, fuck you! Brenda, don't fucking walk away 
not_available I'm having a life.
not_available Just back off! Hey, you heard her! Now, fuck off! Nice.
not_available Are you okay? He followed us here.
not_available I hate to say it, but I'm not entirely surprised.
not_available Very nice.
not_available Luscious.
not_available This is a little tight.
not_available Tight? 
not_available You're not breathing right.
not_available I'm not? 
not_available You're breathing from here when you should be breathing from here.
not_available But my lungs are here.
not_available Of course they are.
not_available I'm speaking metaphorically.
not_available If you breathe from up here, your arrangements will come from up here.
not_available If you breathe from down here, your arrangements will come from down here.
not_available And that's good? 
not_available That's very good.
not_available Do you do yoga? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Would everybody grab a yoga mat in the next room? We're gonna do some breathing exercises before we break for dinner.
not_available You're a bit of a control freak, aren't you? No, I'm not.
not_available I don't think I am.
not_available Am I? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And control freaks do not make good arrangers.
not_available Believe me, I know.
not_available I used to be a control freak too.
not_available But you know what? You can get over it.
not_available All you have to do is learn to breathe.
not_available Are you on antidepressants? 
not_available No! Well, Lord knows I'd be lost without my Saint John's Wort.
not_available There are countless challenges facing independent funeral homes 
today Changing social attitudes toward death and dying economic hardship in communities both large and small Oh, what the hell.
not_available We all know what the real challenge is.
not_available How are you doing today, Mr.
not_available Gilardi? 
not_available Fine, thank you.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available We all know of a certain organization that controls the flow of prep
not_available room supplies caskets, cemetery property and flowers to everyone in this room.
not_available And believe me, that organization will stoop to almost any means to make sure that the independent funeral home has no future.
not_available But hear me out.
not_available My father was in this business for over 35 years.
not_available He He thought it was okay to tell people about a cheaper casket.
not_available He didn't always try to talk people out of cremation.
not_available There were even times where I actually heard him 
say "To hell with our profit margin on this." These words are heresy to a certain organization because profit is all it cares about no matter how many PR
not_available motivated seminars it sponsors.
not_available That organization wants us independents to believe that we cannot afford to be like my father anymore.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.
not_available Don't get me wrong, my father worried about the bottom line too but he worried more about other things.
not_available Like comforting people and helping them face profound loss.
not_available Maybe now more than ever, we should all try to be a little more like him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Very motivational.
not_available Good job.
not_available How'd I do? Are you kidding? You kicked some serious ass, you big freak.
not_available You didn't come home last night.
not_available Well, it's not like it was a school night.
not_available Would you like me to make you something to eat? Yeah, that'd be great.
not_available Do you think I'm a control freak? Yeah.
not_available Where do you think David gets it from? 
not_available Your father was very controlling.
not_available Not like you.
not_available That's not nice.
not_available You asked.
not_available You're not as bad as you used to be.
not_available May I ask where you were all night? In Barstow.
not_available What in God's name were you doing there? I was visiting a friend of mine who's in the hospital.
not_available Who? Gabriel Dimas.
not_available The young man whose brother 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What was he doing in the hospital? He OD'd.
not_available Good Lord.
not_available Claire he's obviously a deeply disturbed boy.
not_available You need to steer clear of him.
not_available Let his family deal with this.
not_available Well, let's take stock for a second, shall we? His little brother's dead.
not_available His father's dead.
not_available His stepfather beat him up his white
not_available trash mother who smokes like a fish could give a shit.
not_available That leaves no one.
not_available Was his overdose an accident? 
not_available Of course it was an accident.
not_available Because sometimes these things aren't.
not_available And if it wasn't, it could happen again.
not_available There's an 80%/% chance that someone It wasn't a suicide attempt.
not_available I hope, for his sake, you're right.
not_available But if you're wrong, Claire I don't want you getting too close to him.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No problem.
not_available Look at him.
not_available He's a star.
not_available Hi.
not_available Really great.
not_available I just want you guys to meet someone.
not_available This is my brother and partner Nathaniel Jr.
not_available And his 
not_available Jasmine.
not_available Hey, there, I'm Neil Schaeger.
not_available Schaeger and Sons, from Flagstaff.
not_available Raymond Dooley.
not_available Dooley and Moss Funeral Home, Reno, Nevada.
not_available Moss couldn't be here.
not_available Bladder cancer.
not_available That was a hell of a speech David made.
not_available Almost made me cry when those Kroehner bastards got up and left.
not_available Those fuckers have been trying to buy us out for five goddamn years.
not_available Your father was a good man.
not_available Yes, he was.
not_available Y'all don't mind if we drag your little brother out with us, do you? 
not_available I really shouldn't.
not_available Gotta let us buy you a drink at least.
not_available You're our hero.
not_available Well, maybe just a quick one.
not_available Quick one, my Aunt Fanny.
not_available We're gonna make a night of it.
not_available Hey, you want to go with? The more the merrier.
not_available Oh, I don't think so.
not_available We're just gonna lay low tonight.
not_available Yeah, but you guys have fun.
not_available Okay, your loss.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We'd just like to thank you very much.
not_available He looks so beautiful.
not_available I'm glad you're pleased.
not_available Mike's mom and dad drove down from Salinas.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They never got a chance to meet him.
not_available Now it's almost like they did.
not_available Do you have children? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available I have a 4year
not_available old boy and my Yes.
not_available We'd like to be alone with him for a little while, if that's okay.
not_available Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
not_available Please take as much time as you need.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Say fromage! 
not_available Fromage.
not_available Hey, you were really great today, Nate.
not_available Standing up to Billy.
not_available I felt like some white
not_available trash girl whose boyfriend was the biggest badass in town.
not_available Your brother's seriously ill, Brenda.
not_available Yeah, whatever.
not_available But you know what? We're in faux Paris, so let's party.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Amber.
not_available David.
not_available You're a lucky guy, David.
not_available I am? 
not_available Very.
not_available Your friend just bought you a lap dance with me.
not_available Excuse me? So where you from, David? 
not_available Boston.
not_available That is the coldest place I ever lived.
not_available What part of town you live in? Downtown.
not_available Are you even enjoying this at all? Yeah, I'm loving it, why? 
not_available Because your dick isn't responding one bit.
not_available Look, I'm gay.
not_available It's not you.
not_available It never is me.
not_available Well, if you're gay, you won't mind if we cut this one short, will you? What happened, buddy? Popped your cork too soon? He's gay, you idiots.
not_available I wish you would've told us that.
not_available Yeah, believe me, so do I.
not_available Thanks for a lovely evening, fellas.
not_available Great.
not_available Great, I'll meet you out front.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello, Brad.
not_available Very nice.
not_available Jim.
not_available Brad? Yeah.
not_available You look different from the ad.
not_available Well, that's from '91.
not_available I've been meaning to update it.
not_available I've just been 
not_available You know, busy.
not_available You're 
not_available Almost 20 minutes late.
not_available Previous appointment ran a little over.
not_available What can I say, Brad's a busy boy.
not_available How much? You're not a cop, right? 
not_available No, I'm not a cop.
not_available Because if you are, that's entrapment.
not_available I'm not a cop.
not_available You are kind of cute.
not_available Thank you.
not_available $200 gets you a pony ride all the way to the moon and back.
not_available Up front.
not_available Now would be a good time.
not_available All I've got is 80.
not_available Fine, fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available Where do you want to go, Jimbo? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Where are you staying? 
not_available I'm not taking you back to my room.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't wanna wake the wife, I get it.
not_available Then Where do you want to do this? Oh, yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available Oh, yeah, Jimbo, give it to me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You like that, don't you, faggot? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Oh, no.
