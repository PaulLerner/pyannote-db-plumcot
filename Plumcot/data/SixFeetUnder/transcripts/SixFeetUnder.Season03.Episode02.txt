not_available Some of the guys in this chorus are so good.
not_available One of them recorded with Chanticleer.
not_available You sound great.
not_available I even dreamed about singing last night.
not_available You weren't just dreaming.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Punch me next time.
not_available I did.
not_available What happened to your uniform? 
not_available I tore it getting a Frisbee out of a tree.
not_available Why were you 
not_available That's what security guards do.
not_available We help people.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available Would you like beef blast pizza rolls? 
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Me neither.
not_available But with a double coupon it's practically free.
not_available Maybe the boys will like them.
not_available I may not be home tonight.
not_available Take a sweater.
not_available You've reached the Fisher family.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Ruth, are you there? It's Sarah.
not_available I'm just checking up on you.
not_available I know what a drag it is to be out of work.
not_available I thought you might wanna come up to Topanga for the day.
not_available I could make some of Aunt May's German potato salad.
not_available I know you liked that.
not_available Call me.
not_available Bye.
not_available You liked her potato salad.
not_available I hated it.
not_available Just It just never occurs to you that a madman will walk into your husband's office and suddenly, he's gone.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available And then there's telling the children.
not_available We have two girls.
not_available What shall I say to them, to make them feel better? What? Well, you could 
not_available Hello.
not_available Glad you could make it.
not_available Nate, this is Dorothy Milne.
not_available Nate Fisher.
not_available That's my partner.
not_available I'm very sorry about your husband.
not_available I know those are just words.
not_available But we'll work together with you to give him a fitting tribute.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Everything's already been taken care of.
not_available We're done.
not_available OK.
not_available Let me walk you to your car.
not_available I didn't even go to my prom.
not_available If somebody asked me, I'd have freaked out.
not_available I took Nancy Pollard.
not_available She smelled like fried chicken.
not_available Why? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available She just did.
not_available I got a bottle of champagne with my friend Parker and we climbed the fence to school and just sat in the quad and got drunk and said goodfucking
not_available bye to high school.
not_available Nice.
not_available Then we both started crying.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available I guess we were saying goodbye to our childhood or whatever.
not_available It just seemed sad.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hated fucking high school.
not_available But still, it was my life and it was all I knew.
not_available It was just over.
not_available God, could I be any more pathetic? 
not_available You're not pathetic.
not_available You're just sensitive.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm too sensitive.
not_available No.
not_available You're perfect.
not_available What time do you have to get up? I'm gonna have to get up in three hours.
not_available I haven't done the assignment yet.
not_available You keep distracting me.
not_available I do? Yeah, my hands are magnetically drawn to your dick.
not_available What is the assignment? I have to read and critique some theoretical conceptual bullshit.
not_available They make you take all the boring classes before they let you do anything cool with clay.
not_available I know exactly how you feel.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available That's why I dropped out of music school.
not_available All I wanted to do was write great music.
not_available But they had me studying all this shit that had nothing to do with anything.
not_available They try to programme your mind so you're exactly like everyone else.
not_available Don't let them do that to you.
not_available You're too talented.
not_available You think so? 
not_available What? You think I like you just cos you have the softest skin I've ever felt? I don't know.
not_available You're amazing, Claire.
not_available Hello, beautiful ladies.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Thank you for letting me sleep in.
not_available Does your brother like eggplant? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I guess.
not_available I figured we could grill some salmon tonight.
not_available I just don't know what else.
not_available Is that tonight? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Can we cancel? 
not_available It was your idea.
not_available I know.
not_available Sounded good at the time, but I see David at work every day.
not_available It's not like I'm dying to spend quality time with Keith.
not_available You wanted David to see Maya.
not_available OK, you're right.
not_available We'll do it.
not_available Your Uncle David's coming over.
not_available Won't that be fun? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Try it once more.
not_available Please.
not_available Try it once more.
not_available Great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lisa, you're being careful? 
not_available I'm being very delicate.
not_available Hey, Maya.
not_available I think you're going too deep.
not_available Nate, you worry too much.
not_available Just because you deal with people dying.
not_available Sometimes after you clean her ears she doesn't respond as quickly.
not_available You think I've injured her? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe there's some ringing in her ears after you've cleaned them.
not_available Nate, I know whether my child can hear or not, and she can hear.
not_available She's been tested and she can hear.
not_available Right.
not_available Your child? 
not_available I didn't mean I'm just the father, but I'm every bit as committed.
not_available Nate.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available I need to work.
not_available You've reached the Fisher family.
not_available Please leave a message.
not_available Ruth, it's Sarah.
not_available I am disappointed you didn't call back.
not_available I'll be honest.
not_available I was trying to trick you into coming out here.
not_available I need you.
not_available I hurt my back and I'm all alone What did you do? 
not_available I fell off a ladder.
not_available Have you seen a doctor? 
not_available He told me to stay in bed.
not_available He gave me a prescription for Vicodin.
not_available What do you need me to do? Pick it up for me.
not_available Give me the address of the pharmacy.
not_available Oh, Ruth.
not_available I knew I could count on you.
not_available Are you doing this with me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I can do it myself, David.
not_available I'm sure that's true, but Nate and I find it's helpful to have two people.
not_available Why? So one of you can sleep late? And of course we'll place an obituary notice in the paper.
not_available No.
not_available We'd like to keep this private and as simple as possible.
not_available You see this kind of thing on TV and you think, "Oh, my God, those poor people.
not_available " But now it's happening to us and we have to see it every time we turn on.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We knew that Daniel was a troubled boy but we really thought he was getting better.
not_available Your son isn't the one who did the shooting? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We can't possibly 
not_available Imagine what you must be going through.
not_available But you can rest assured we will do everything we can to help you through this dark time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Fisher and Sons has never turned down a funeral and neither will Fisher and Diaz.
not_available That's great.
not_available When Dorothy Milne is crying over her husband's casket, I'll tell her you're next door arranging flowers round the man who killed him.
not_available The services will be on different days.
not_available There will be no conflict.
not_available Come on.
not_available I know you like to make a buck but isn't this going a little far? That's got nothing to do with it.
not_available The funeral is for the living, not the deceased.
not_available Really? Yeah, I read the same book as you.
not_available Do you think Mr and Mrs Showalter are in any less pain than Dorothy Milne? Maybe I don't give a shit.
not_available If they'd raised their kid better he may not have killed those people.
not_available Rico, you can't blame them.
not_available Yes, I can blame them, and I do.
not_available Whether you like it or not, this is your job.
not_available You have to put your feelings aside.
not_available I need you to pick up his body.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available You pick it up.
not_available I got nothing to do with this.
not_available Hello, I'm Ruth, Sarah's sister.
not_available If you got here five minutes ago you could have cleaned up her puke.
not_available I'm Bettina.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Sarah, your sister's here.
not_available Ruth.
not_available My goodness, you look awful.
not_available Bettina, can we have a moment alone? Why? 
not_available She's my sister and we need to talk.
not_available What's in the bag? It's just 
not_available Some things I asked her to bring for me.
not_available Lip balm, hair clips, strawberries.
not_available No 
not_available Fork it over.
not_available Help me, I'm being held hostage Shut your mouth or I'll goddamn tape it shut! Goodness, what's going on? 
not_available Ruth, please! Do I have to carry you back to bed or are you gonna walk by yourself? Bitch.
not_available Give me the bag.
not_available It's her Vicodin.
not_available She has a prescription.
not_available Of course.
not_available She has Vicodin prescriptions in half the pharmacies in LA.
not_available Your sister's into her second day of withdrawal.
not_available She begged me to make sure she got through it.
not_available No matter what.
not_available Fuck that.
not_available I was high.
not_available I'm sorry, Keith, I'm having problems at the morgue.
not_available Why didn't you call before? 
not_available I didn't know it'd take so long.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'll see you tonight.
not_available He can't make it.
not_available I'm sorry for wasting your time.
not_available You don't need to leave.
not_available You and I can talk.
not_available We can do that? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Why not? Tell me about that phone call.
not_available How did it make you feel? Pissed off.
not_available But I'm working on my anger management technique.
not_available I'm taking a lot of deep breaths.
not_available That's good.
not_available Have you been feeling a lot of anger toward David? I've been giving myself so many damn time
not_available outs, I haven't been feeling anything.
not_available Maybe this is a good time to let some of that anger out.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Pretend David's sitting there next to you.
not_available What do you wanna say to him? Anything that comes to mind.
not_available Relax.
not_available Stop trying so hard.
not_available You're making me nervous.
not_available What other things would you like to tell him that you don't like about him? I hate your stupid little buckwheat pillow.
not_available And I hate your nose spray.
not_available I hate the way you eat.
not_available You put your fork down after every bite like you're some prince.
not_available I hate the way you want to sleep with your head on my shoulder.
not_available Your head is heavy.
not_available I hate the way you make me feel like my father by letting me walk all over you.
not_available What? I always thought by being gay I'd avoid fucking my mother but I guess that's not the case.
not_available Have you thought about seeing a therapist on your own? 
not_available This is great.
not_available It's my polenta.
not_available You like it? 
not_available It's delicious.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available It's Carol.
not_available Hello.
not_available Lisa.
not_available I'm at Mark and Pam's place in the mountains.
not_available Their cook knows nothing.
not_available Walk them through your basil vinaigrette.
not_available Right now? Yes.
not_available The salad's waiting.
not_available What? 
not_available I gotta deal with this.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'll start the grill.
not_available I still have laundry to do.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Go.
not_available Lisa? 
not_available Hey, Lise.
not_available Lisal 
not_available I'm sorry about this morning.
not_available Me too.
not_available Are you still there? I worry about Maya.
not_available I get scared something will go wrong.
not_available Nothing's gonna go wrong.
not_available Salad dressing.
not_available I know.
not_available Maya has the best mom in the world.
not_available Hello? I need dressing.
not_available I mean, Gabe was definitely exciting.
not_available In kind of a sick way.
not_available But I think Phil's the only guy who's ever really understood me.
not_available That's cool.
not_available Not even my imaginary friends understand me.
not_available Maybe they do, they just don't like me.
not_available You need better imaginary friends.
not_available They're the best I can do.
not_available So what do you really like about this guy? I don't know.
not_available He's sweet.
not_available He's hot.
not_available Nice.
not_available He's got his own band.
not_available It's Keanu Reeves.
not_available Exactly.
not_available You know what Come on, Claire, those are superficial things.
not_available And you seem anything but superficial.
not_available What do you really like about him? Well, I like the way he treats me.
not_available You know, he makes me feel good.
not_available Like I'm kind of OK.
not_available Like I'm smart and talented and pretty.
not_available Uh
not_available oh.
not_available I'm totally embarrassed now.
not_available No.
not_available Women tell me this kind of thing all the time.
not_available I'm the guy who listens.
not_available Yeah, you do listen.
not_available That's really nice about you.
not_available I really like talking to you.
not_available I like listening to you.
not_available I hope it could go both ways.
not_available If you're dating anyone, you can totally talk to me.
not_available Thanks, but no, I'm not dating.
not_available No dating.
not_available I think I'm kind of allergic.
not_available I start itching and I swell up and bleed profusely.
not_available No, it sounds really nice having somebody in your life that makes you hate yourself less.
not_available I could use that.
not_available Come on.
not_available I mean, you're great.
not_available I wasn't fishing.
not_available I'm serious, Russell.
not_available I think you're great.
not_available Tell me that when it's two in the morning and I'm laying in bed and I'm eating my fourth bowl of cereal and I'm beating myself up for some stupid thing I said in eighth grade.
not_available What kind of cereal? 
not_available Captain Crunch.
not_available My God.
not_available I think we're twins.
not_available This whole "Oops, I'm pregnant" thing still sounds kind of suspicious to me.
not_available I'm just surprised he married her.
not_available If Nate's happy, that's all I care about.
not_available You're still mad at me? I'm really sorry I missed therapy.
not_available No.
not_available I was happy you weren't there.
not_available Frank was too.
not_available Frank loves me.
not_available Yeah, but he thinks you got a lot of work to do on yourself.
not_available That's so not true.
not_available Maybe it's true but he'd never say that.
not_available Did you talk about me the whole time? After we decided you were a hopeless passive
not_available aggressive guilt sponge and we decided to move on to more important things.
not_available God, I'm never gonna miss therapy again.
not_available I bet you won't, bitch.
not_available Well, hello.
not_available Hey, Nate.
not_available Hey, Dave.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Keith, good to see you.
not_available I used to burn the fuck out of everything until I discovered the miracle of low, even heat.
not_available The secret is mesquite wood chips.
not_available Do you use mesquite? That's just a gimmick.
not_available It's the marinade that makes all the difference.
not_available I just like wearing the apron.
not_available Nate.
not_available Where did you put her blue blankie? She can't sleep without it.
not_available I didn't put it anywhere.
not_available I couldn't find it.
not_available Did you give her Mr Fat Fanny? 
not_available He's in her sweet little hands.
not_available All right.
not_available I think we're ready.
not_available Good.
not_available Let me go wash up.
not_available Where's your little boys' room? The bathroom is in the back behind the kitchen.
not_available Don't flush the toilet.
not_available We don't wanna wake Maya.
not_available So how's the choir going? Well, it's not a choir, it's a chorus, but it's going well.
not_available Great.
not_available Can't wait to hear you.
not_available No eggplant for me.
not_available I'll take his.
not_available Want mozzarella? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll go.
not_available What did I miss? 
not_available You woke the baby.
not_available It wasn't asleep.
not_available Yes, it was.
not_available It wasn't.
not_available It looked at me when I went in.
not_available I told him not to flush.
not_available David said he had that irritable bowel thing.
not_available Why did you tell him that? 
not_available It just came up.
not_available Please, don't discuss my private stuff.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We'll never get her back to sleep.
not_available By the way, I only peed.
not_available You shouldn't have flushed.
not_available It wasn't asleep.
not_available Maya, row the boat ashore Hallelujah Maya, row the boat ashore Hallelujah My brothers and sisters are all aboard That song has never sounded so creepy before.
not_available My brothers and sisters are all aboard 
not_available I know.
not_available Hallelujah 
not_available My goodness.
not_available You gotta be kidding me.
not_available What's he doing here? 
not_available Wasn't my idea.
not_available Look at you in your fancy fucking suit.
not_available I knew I never should have hired you.
not_available You shouldn't have fired me.
not_available You were a fuck
not_available up.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Could you have made the hole a little bigger? Why can't you guys shoot yourselves in the heart? Maybe I was trying to make a statement.
not_available Besides, it's really not my problem.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Nothing's your problem.
not_available Blow me, dead man.
not_available He had a wife and kids, asshole.
not_available Lucky him.
not_available I didn't have shit.
not_available Whose fault is that? You couldn't show up to work on time.
not_available Maybe if you hadn't been such a prick.
not_available It's because of people like you that I had to do this.
not_available What are you saying? This is my fault? I'm just saying a guy can only take so much before he snaps.
not_available Hey.
not_available We all have to deal with a lot of shit, all right? But when I snap I throw something or punch a wall.
not_available I don't pick up a shotgun and start killing people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So far.
not_available God, it feels so good to sit here and do absolutely nothing.
not_available We relax all the time.
not_available We have to.
not_available How do you like your new job, Keith? Well, it pretty much sucks.
not_available It's temporary.
not_available We're both going through a lot of changes right now.
not_available All good, though.
not_available How's the therapy going? Good.
not_available We're not fighting so much.
not_available We never really fought that much but we're getting along much better.
not_available Nate and I never fight.
not_available Never? 
not_available No.
not_available You two have never had a fight? 
not_available Not really.
not_available I don't know how you do it.
not_available We've known each other for so long, I guess we just understand each other.
not_available Even so, I would think having a baby adds so much stress.
not_available No, having a baby helps put everything in perspective.
not_available You'll see when you have kids.
not_available If we have kids.
not_available Knock, knock.
not_available Look, a party.
not_available Hello, I'm Carol, Lisa's boss.
not_available Keith.
not_available I'm David Fisher.
not_available This is my house.
not_available You're back early.
not_available There's nothing to do in the mountains.
not_available I mean, fresh air's such a big deal.
not_available At least no one parks in my driveway there.
not_available Should we move? Lisa, I would love some cinnamon toast and a cup of tea.
not_available Could you wait just a little bit? 
not_available You would not believe the day I've had.
not_available Who is my most bitter enemy in the world? Should we go? We're having a little get
not_available together.
not_available Melissa Gilbert.
not_available And who opens the door at Mark and Pam's house? That's right.
not_available Melissa Gilbert.
not_available It was like staring at evil itself.
not_available Carol, you're not listening to me.
not_available I heard you.
not_available You're having a party.
not_available They've had you all day.
not_available I need you right now.
not_available Bring my toast up to my bath and I'll tell you how I made Melissa cry.
not_available Go ahead, we're fine.
not_available Can you believe Lisa? Her self
not_available perception is so far removed from reality.
not_available Keith, what were you talking about in there? If we have kids? 
not_available Just what I said.
not_available If we have kids.
not_available We decided a long time ago that we'd have kids.
not_available When did this change? Who are you kidding? We're in therapy to see if we can exist as a couple.
not_available Everything about us is if.
not_available That shouldn't change our goals.
not_available I'm just being realistic.
not_available I don't wanna put myself in a situation where I end up turning into my father.
not_available I guess I'm a little more optimistic about our future than you are.
not_available Get real.
not_available You and I are living day to day and you know it.
not_available God, I'm freezing.
not_available God, this sucks.
not_available I'm dying.
not_available It'll pass.
not_available Give me a Klonopin.
not_available You wanted to do this natural.
not_available I already gave you the valerian root.
not_available They're not doing shit to me.
not_available She's impossible.
not_available Now get me an Ambien.
not_available Sarah, really.
not_available It'll put her to sleep.
not_available Anything to shut her up.
not_available I'm burning up.
not_available A moment ago you were freezing.
not_available Now I'm burning up.
not_available Now what? 
not_available Diarrhoea.
not_available This is what playing with drugs will get you.
not_available It's not pretty, is it? Is Carol all tucked in? 
not_available After eight slices of toast and a Popsicle.
not_available It was nice seeing David and Keith tonight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I feel so sorry for them.
not_available How come? They've been together such a short time and already they need counselling.
not_available They're just Why do they stay together? 
not_available It's not like they have a kid.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe they love each other.
not_available What? What detergent did you use? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Whatever was there.
not_available It smells like Tide.
not_available So I guess I used the Tide.
not_available You have to use the Dreft.
not_available Maya gets a rash from anything else.
not_available But these aren't Maya's clothes.
not_available But I hold Maya all day long.
not_available Why do we have Tide? Sorry I wasn't following you around taking notes.
not_available Don't get mad.
not_available I thought you knew to use Dreft.
not_available Obviously I didn't.
not_available Now I do.
not_available Are we OK here? Yeah, we're OK.
not_available I just have to wash it again.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Here.
not_available Put those down.
not_available Here.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good afternoon.
not_available Is he 
not_available He's right in there.
not_available Mr and Mrs Showalter, I will be here the entire time.
not_available Please let me know if there's anything at all I can do for you.
not_available Is that another son? 
not_available I hope you frisked him.
not_available Please try to show a little sensitivity.
not_available Hey, I did my job.
not_available I cleaned him up all nice.
not_available Sure, I was tempted to maybe leave a hand or a foot unembalmed, so he could stink like he should, but no.
not_available I'm a professional.
not_available Then act like one.
not_available These people loved this man.
not_available They didn't know him as a murderer, they knew him as their son, their brother.
not_available These people were responsible for him.
not_available They should have known Jesus Christ, Federico.
not_available I'm getting sick of all this moral superiority.
not_available Everything is so black and white for you.
not_available You know what? I just You can't ever really know a person.
