
not_available Come on! 
not_available OK, OK.
not_available Everything out of the tray too, bitch.
not_available That's all of it.
not_available This it? 
not_available That's all I have.
not_available Now you take it.
not_available Fuck! 
not_available Get the fuck out before I call the police! Barb, it's Nate again.
not_available Did I wake you up? Are you kidding? Have you heard anything? Is she there? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you call the police? Yeah.
not_available They filed a missing persons report.
not_available Good.
not_available I didn't know they could do that if it was under 24 hours.
not_available I did the same thing up here.
not_available They said not to bother calling the highway patrol cos everyone has it statewide.
not_available But I say fuck it, let's just keep calling.
not_available Has she ever just taken off before? No.
not_available She'd go off for a day or two where nobody knew where she was, just to clear out the cobwebs, but not since she had the baby.
not_available Yeah, her vision quests.
not_available I know.
not_available Right.
not_available She used to do that in Seattle, but she'd always tell somebody about it.
not_available If you're wondering whether I think she might have left you, I truly, seriously doubt it.
not_available Not without Maya.
not_available You think she might have left me? No, I don't.
not_available We'll just keep checking with the police and the highway patrol.
not_available She'll turn up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, she'll turn up.
not_available Hello.
not_available David? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you feel that? Feel what? 
not_available Earthquake.
not_available No, I guess I missed it.
not_available Sorry, I forgot.
not_available You're in San Diego.
not_available Actually, I'm not.
not_available I came back early.
not_available What's going on? Lisa still hasn't shown up at her sister's.
not_available No one's heard from her? 
not_available No.
not_available She hasn't called you? Have you tried her cellphone? Yeah, like 30 fucking times.
not_available I'm really starting to freak out here.
not_available I'll be right over.
not_available Give me half an hour.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available I'm sure she's fine.
not_available Yeah? Then why hasn't she answered any one of the 40 messages I've left for her? Maybe the battery on her cellphone ran out of whatever they run out of.
not_available It's been almost 18 hours since I spoke to her last.
not_available You said yourself she does this kind of thing from time to time.
not_available She would have told me about it.
not_available Lisa strikes me as very capable of taking care of herself.
not_available Morning.
not_available Anyone else feel that earthquake? 
not_available I did.
not_available Why all the doom and gloom? 
not_available Lisa is missing.
not_available She's not missing.
not_available We just don't quite know where she is.
not_available Holy shit.
not_available Hello? Yes, this is the Fisher and Diaz funeral home.
not_available Of course.
not_available We could take care of all your arrangements for you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right, we'll see you then.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Got a family coming in at 10:30.
not_available We already have two intakes today.
not_available Great.
not_available If this is too much for you, I can get Rico to come in early and Arthur can help.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I just think trying to work will be better than waiting for the phone to ring.
not_available You do whatever it is you need to do.
not_available I'll take Maya for the day.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd better get dressed.
not_available Hello.
not_available Where are you? In a doctor's office waiting for Vanessa.
not_available We have three intakes this morning.
not_available I need you here.
not_available I've got both kids.
not_available I'll be there as soon as Vanessa's done.
not_available All right, fine.
not_available Don't be giving me attitude.
not_available Vanessa is sick.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Just get here as soon as you can.
not_available You don't have to be here, I mean, if your job is more important.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available She's my wife.
not_available And she's my sister.
not_available I can take care of her too.
not_available Maybe she needs a little time away from you.
not_available Did you ever think of that? Is Mommy sick? 
not_available No, Mommy's not sick.
not_available Mommy's just fine.
not_available off the 40 mils of Celexa.
not_available And sometimes I take a little Ambien too.
not_available 5 mils.
not_available Buspar, 10 mils a day.
not_available with all the compulsive eating.
not_available I have been putting on a shitload of weight.
not_available Who prescribed all this medication? My doctor.
not_available Well, not all of it.
not_available The trazodone, the Ativan and the Ambien, I got on my own.
not_available But it's my friend.
not_available She's an RN and she knows about this stuff.
not_available Your doctor is your psychiatrist? He's an internist.
not_available I see.
not_available Well, first of all, we need to get you off a lot of this medication.
not_available Some of what you're taking could be counteracting or even aggravating your symptoms.
not_available Shit.
not_available I feel like I'm in a hole and I just feel like the hole keeps getting deeper and deeper.
not_available I'm not surprised, but we're going to try to fix that.
not_available Antidepressants aren't magic bullets.
not_available Nate.
not_available David told me about Lisa.
not_available Please make yourself comfortable.
not_available I'll be right with you.
not_available Yes, and? According to statistics compiled by the US Census Bureau, women are three times less likely to die from misadventure as men.
not_available I find statistics to be comforting in times of stress and uncertainty.
not_available I've got an intake right now.
not_available I was wondering, may I join you? You know me, I'm always hungry for new learning experiences.
not_available Sure, why not? We have been robbed before.
not_available Three times in ten years.
not_available Dorothy wanted for us to retire, but I just kept putting it off.
not_available Maybe next year, maybe the year after that.
not_available And now she's taken away from me.
not_available How can she not be here? One minute she's there, the next she's gone, like she was never there.
not_available At least she's no longer suffering.
not_available She had cancer, right? No! She was shot in a hold
not_available up! I am so sorry.
not_available What kind of interment were you interested in? We have a plot at Forest Lawn.
not_available I see.
not_available Would you like to look at our line of caskets? I don't have much money.
not_available I'm sure we can find something to accommodate your budget.
not_available Right? Nate? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available He was electrocuted.
not_available I don't want my children to see him like that.
not_available We have an excellent restorative artist.
not_available No.
not_available I don't want my children to see him dead.
not_available If you'll excuse me for just a moment.
not_available Sure.
not_available What do you mean, missing? 
not_available She was on her way to her sister's.
not_available She never got there.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available I still have a couple of contacts with the sheriffs department.
not_available Do you want me to make some calls? Nate's already talked to them.
not_available They filed a missing persons report.
not_available If you think you can find anything else out, sure, why not? We need to talk.
not_available About us.
not_available I know and we will, but not right now.
not_available I have a woman waiting for me in the pastoral room.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll make some calls.
not_available I'll get back to you if I hear anything.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is so Day Of The Locust.
not_available No locusts here.
not_available Cockroaches maybe, but no locusts.
not_available Here we are.
not_available Now, that there is a sleeper sofa.
not_available They come in very handy when you have overnight guests.
not_available Like family, that sort of thing.
not_available You do have family, don't you? No, actually.
not_available They were all killed in a flood.
not_available Honey, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I'll be honest with you.
not_available We do have the occasional break
not_available in every once in a while.
not_available If I were you, I would sleep with a can of pepper spray under my pillow.
not_available Just in case.
not_available Smells like cats.
not_available We don't allow pets.
not_available We used to, but not any more.
not_available How much? and two weeks' security deposit.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I made this for you.
not_available Russell Claire, I just want you to know that what happened between Olivier and me was totally fucked up.
not_available What happened between you and me wasn't fucked up at all.
not_available It was the opposite of fucked up.
not_available What did happen between you and Olivier? 
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available It matters to me.
not_available Did you fuck him? 
not_available What we did or didn't do isn't important.
not_available What's important is that I love you.
not_available Did he fuck you? 
not_available I was drunk and stoned.
not_available And he was playing this head trip on me.
not_available You know what he's like.
not_available Did you give each other blow jobs? 
not_available Claire, I love you.
not_available Jesus, you gave each other blow jobs? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Jerk each other off? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available What are you saying? That I love you, OK? Why can't you hear that? When are you gonna get over your wounded pride for one second and realise what we have is too good for you to throw away? For me to throw away? That's funny.
not_available You're funny.
not_available And that's hideous.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Maybe you can sell it to your fucking boyfriend for another $500.
not_available I'm sure you were worth it.
not_available I don't wanna live without you.
not_available You're gonna have to.
not_available I'm not gonna give up.
not_available That's your fucking problem.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hello, Brenda.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available I heard you freaked out on Billy.
not_available You really shouldn't do that.
not_available He's on medication.
not_available You know how sensitive he is.
not_available Is there any other reason you called? If this is it, I'm hanging up.
not_available Well, we're disposing of your father's ashes tomorrow.
not_available I thought you might wanna be there.
not_available I really don't wanna be round Billy right now.
not_available Darling, we owe it to your father.
not_available Dad's dead.
not_available He doesn't care.
not_available Well, I care, OK? I'd like to at least pretend that we all love each other and that your father and I created something worthwhile.
not_available For a fucking hour, however long it takes to dump his ashes.
not_available Is that too much to ask? Have you decided where? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available We're all meeting here around 11.30.
not_available The whole ordeal'll be done by two.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available OK, bye.
not_available Give yourself the grade you think you deserve.
not_available Is that paying me to keep my mouth shut? I'm letting every student give their own grade.
not_available Who am I to judge anyone's work? 
not_available Oh, God, you're ridiculous.
not_available You contradict yourself so nothing ever means anything.
not_available Is meaning what you're really after? Your work this semester would suggest otherwise.
not_available Your technique is excellent, but that's all it is 
not_available technique.
not_available Your work is safe, limited.
not_available Cos you hold yourself back from life.
not_available Well, call me crazy, but I think an artist has a responsibility to do more than just give in to every emotional impulse.
not_available Because some impulses are wrong.
not_available And some impulses violate the regulations of this school.
not_available I checked.
not_available Exactly how many schools have you taught at? You sit in such judgement of the world.
not_available How do you expect to ever be a part of it? I don't wanna be part of your world, a manipulative loser who fucks his students.
not_available What do you wanna be? An uptight puritan who's not even in her own body? Or a brilliant artist with blood and a heart and a cunt? God, you're such a fucking phoney.
not_available At first you actually inspired me.
not_available It took me half a semester to realise you were using us to work through your own shit.
not_available When are you gonna get over the fact that you never became Picasso and now it's too late? When are you going to get over the fact that if you take a chance, you might fall on your face? But that's the best thing that can ever happen to you, as an artist and as a human being.
not_available Are we done? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Get out of my office.
not_available Who do you think you are, the Pope, just because I fucked your boyfriend? What a baby! You need some real pain.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Fuck yourself.
not_available Russell will always be a better artist than you.
not_available He's braver, more willing to take chances.
not_available He's certainly more ambitious.
not_available That seems obvious.
not_available If it hadn't been me, it would have been somebody else.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I'll take an A.
not_available Undeserved.
not_available Unimportant.
not_available I know I've already called! I've been call My wife is still missing and I can't seem to get anyone to take me seriously.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have called the sheriffs department and the highway patrol.
not_available I spoke with Officer Polk.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No, I will call back in a few hours.
not_available Any news? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm gonna take Maya to the park.
not_available Great.
not_available Nate, dear, everything is going to be fine, you'll see.
not_available I made some apple crumble.
not_available Why don't you have a piece? Here's the gentleman who passed away at the health club.
not_available What shall I do with him? Put him in the reefer.
not_available I believe that the refrigerator is already full.
not_available Then you'll have to leave him out, won't you? 
not_available But that would be a code violation.
not_available We'll just have to take the risk.
not_available As long as you both understand that I 
not_available You're not responsible.
not_available We are.
not_available Perhaps I could just try and make a little more Just stop fucking whining and get the hell out of here already, OK? OK.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Not especially.
not_available Is there anything you'd like to talk about? You really wanna know or are you just being polite? I asked, didn't I? My wife is clinically depressed.
not_available On top of that, my sisterin
not_available law, who I have problems with on a good day, is at my house taking care of her right now.
not_available I don't even wanna think about that.
not_available On top of that, these electrocution burns are a serious bitch.
not_available Has anybody heard from Lisa yet? 
not_available Not yet, no.
not_available I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
not_available A matter of time before what? Before she calls and tells us she's had a little car trouble or I don't know, that she's OK.
not_available No one in this family ever talks about what's really going on.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? We have to deal with the possibility that something bad has probably happened.
not_available We do not! You may not believe this, but I have a lot more life experience than you.
not_available At times like this, it's important that we keep a positive attitude.
not_available Why must you always be so negative? Why must you always be in such deep denial? I am not in denial! I'm just trying to prepare for the worst, so that when it happens, it's not so awful.
not_available Well, don't.
not_available Lisa is going to turn up and she's going to be fine and there'll be a logical explanation for all of this.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available And they're gonna put an end to world hunger and people'll stop killing each other and the oil companies are gonna stop running everything and apologise for global warming.
not_available I'm sure it's just a matter of time.
not_available When you talked to her, she said she was at the ocean.
not_available Did she say where? No.
not_available She just said it looked nice.
not_available How long had she been gone? 
not_available Two, maybe three hours.
not_available Long enough to switch to highway one at San Luis Obispo? Yeah, maybe.
not_available But probably not.
not_available She's not the world's fastest driver.
not_available Why wouldn't she stay on the 101? 
not_available She wanted to drive through Big Sur.
not_available She loves Big Sur.
not_available Did you contact the credit card company? She may have stopped to get gas, right? 
not_available Or lunch or a motel room.
not_available Any purchases that might indicate the car's been stolen.
not_available I should do that right now.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, Nate.
not_available It's me, Brenda.
not_available I just wanted to call and apologise for last night.
not_available It was really unlike me and Look, Brenda, I can't talk to you right now.
not_available I've got a lot more important shit to deal with.
not_available Fuck! Fucking come on.
not_available I'm already on hold.
not_available I'm gonna get going.
not_available I'm gonna stay here.
not_available OK.
not_available Call you tomorrow? 
not_available Or sooner, if you hear anything.
not_available When I'm feeling a little bit shaky OK, so we know that she stopped for gas in Santa Barbara.
not_available But that was yesterday.
not_available You'd think she'd use the card again between then and now.
not_available Unless she had a lot of cash on her.
not_available She didn't have a lot of cash on her.
not_available At least, I don't think she did.
not_available I can't talk about this any more.
not_available What's going on with you and Keith? Nothing much.
not_available You guys seemed a little tense tonight.
not_available You think we were tense? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I guess we are.
not_available We had this big fight down in San Diego in front of his mom and dad.
not_available I butted in.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't have.
not_available Now I don't know where we are.
not_available We love each other.
not_available At least, I think we do.
not_available Lately, though, I just feel numb when we're together, and better when we're not.
not_available It's not like we don't want the same things.
not_available We do.
not_available I think.
not_available Maybe we don't want the same things.
not_available Maybe we're just pretending that we do.
not_available Maybe we're just not meant to be together.
not_available ..
not_available artefacts from the near and distant past were emerging from the ice.
not_available Steven Hiller reports on the discovery of archaeological treasure.
not_available Steven.
not_available During the short Siberian summer, our anthropologists discovered Hey, sweetie.
not_available Hi, my love.
not_available Where the fuck have you been? Do you know how worried I've been, how worried we've all been? I filed a fucking missing persons report on you.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Why the fuck didn't you at least call me? I left 100 fucking messages for you on your cellphone.
not_available I must have turned it off after you called me.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available Jesus Christ.
not_available Don't ever fucking do that again.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Come here.
not_available Did she call? 
not_available No.
not_available Can you watch Maya for me, just for a little while? 
not_available I'm just gonna get some air.
not_available OK.
not_available There you go.
not_available Nate.
not_available Hello? Speaking.
not_available What? Where? Yes.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available They found her car.
not_available It's totally cool.
not_available The streets are old
not_available timey and there's an anthropology and a Nike goddess.
not_available Everything is as clean as Disneyland, even the bathrooms.
not_available What are you guys talking about? 
not_available The new shopping mall.
not_available The Grove.
not_available I don't know why we haven't been.
not_available There's a dance lesson tonight.
not_available You feel up to it? I don't know.
not_available But maybe.
not_available If we're gonna cancel, we should let them know, otherwise they'll charge us.
not_available Can we decide later? 
not_available Call me at work after lunch.
not_available OK, I will.
not_available OK.
not_available I need the credit card.
not_available What for? I'm taking her shopping.
not_available A little shopping is good for depression.
not_available You're gonna go shopping? 
not_available It'll be fun.
not_available We're just gonna get her a new pair of shoes.
not_available Maybe lunch at Farmers Market.
not_available Please.
not_available Of course.
not_available Here.
not_available Thank you, baby.
not_available Where did he want his ashes spread? He told me to surprise him.
not_available Maybe we should take him out to Catalina.
not_available I'm pretty sure you need a permit for that.
not_available Why don't I put him in my backpack and no one's the wiser? Are you two not speaking to one another? It's really starting to annoy me.
not_available Can we do this? Then I can go.
not_available I'm speaking.
not_available OK, whatever, but I am not going out to Catalina in some goddamn boat just because you were there once when you were 12.
not_available What about the beach in Malibu? 
not_available That's where everyone throws their ashes.
not_available So? I don't want him co
not_available mingling with strangers.
not_available We drive him up into Angeles National Forest and plant a tree.
not_available Plant a tree? You must be kidding.
not_available Then I say we drive him to Malibu.
not_available I'm not going all the way out to Malibu.
not_available Besides, the traffic'll kill us on the way home.
not_available This is giving me such a goddamn headache.
not_available Fuck it.
not_available There.
not_available Now he'll be in Westwood for all eternity.
not_available What? 
not_available We need your help, Claire.
not_available I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.
not_available Hurry it up.
not_available What am I supposed to do? Give these to people and make sure they're here to see Mrs Su.
not_available You need help for that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And smile.
not_available Not too much.
not_available Compassionate but not happy.
not_available That should be no problem.
not_available Mrs Su? 
not_available Mr Tully.
not_available He's in there.
not_available What's up with you? Nothing's up with me.
not_available Am I not allowed to be in a bad mood? If that's what you want.
not_available My boyfriend had sex with another guy and we broke up.
not_available Are you happy? 
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available What is it with you people? You can't figure out what you are, so you've gotta string along girls to ease the transition? Mrs Su or Mr Tully? Mrs Su, please.
not_available Right through here.
not_available It's probably best you found out about Russell now before it went any further.
not_available The timing of all this is just so fucking perfect, it's not even funny.
not_available What do you mean? With what's going on with Lisa, and how terrible things always happen at the same time, like when those celebrities die in sets of three.
not_available Mrs Su? Right this way.
not_available You don't think Lisa might have 
not_available What? Offed herself? No way.
not_available Things seemed pretty tense between her and Nate for a while there.
not_available She had that weird look in her eye, like it wouldn't take much to send her over the edge.
not_available There's no way Lisa would do anything like that, not with the baby.
not_available How are we doing? 
not_available So far, so good.
not_available We've only got about half an hour, an hour tops, to get the Sus out of the pastoral room so we can get Mr Monroe in there.
not_available Goodness.
not_available We're not gonna make it.
not_available Of course we will.
not_available We don't have a choice.
not_available You must be here for Edward Tully.
not_available No.
not_available I'm here for Dorothy Su.
not_available Am I in the wrong place? 
not_available Over there.
not_available I parked on the street right in front.
not_available I'm not going to get a ticket there, am I? 
not_available You should be fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He could get a ticket.
not_available It'll take too long to move it.
not_available When we're in the weeds the way we are today, you gotta move 'em in and 'out.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available This is my wife's car.
not_available She didn't just leave it here and disappear.
not_available There's her cellphone, her wallet and her overnight bag, but her backpack's missing.
not_available You checked the trunk? 
not_available It's not in there.
not_available And also Lisa doesn't drink Dr Pepper.
not_available She doesn't drink soda at all.
not_available She thinks it's toxic.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr? 
not_available Fisher.
not_available We've got a missing persons report on file.
not_available A missing backpack and a can of Dr Pepper is not evidence of foul play.
not_available Without evidence of foul play, we can't treat this as anything more than it appears to be 
not_available a missing person's case.
not_available I'm not gonna pretend there's nothing to worry about.
not_available Possibly there is.
not_available My wife is fucking missing! 
not_available I can see that you are genuinely distressed.
not_available But at this point, there isn't a whole lot I can do.
not_available If it were me, I'd stick around the area, in case she finds her way back to pick up her car.
not_available There's a motel just up the way.
not_available I would make sure to move it by this time tomorrow, unless you want it towed to the impound lot.
not_available God, how long is she gonna go on like this? With any luck, she'll throw herself over the railing.
not_available Tell Roberta Flack I couldn't take it any more.
not_available We have to talk.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available What is there to say? 
not_available I'm in love with you.
not_available Jesus, don't.
not_available I need to say it.
not_available I need to say it.
not_available I know I can't have you.
not_available I know it's wrong to want you like this, but that doesn't make it any less true.
not_available And what am I supposed to do with that? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I have to let it go.
not_available And maybe saying the words will help.
not_available I want to let it go.
not_available You have to believe that.
not_available I just have a feeling about this and everything is going to be all right.
not_available I've always been right about my feelings.
not_available Mom, they found her car.
not_available There are a hundred explanations for that.
not_available She could have run out of gas.
not_available She has a triple A card, a cellphone.
not_available She would have called.
not_available Maybe the battery went dead.
not_available I just want you to be prepared.
not_available I am sick of hearing that! I will not be prepared and neither should anyone else.
not_available I refuse to believe that anything is wrong.
not_available I have to trust my feelings.
not_available Right now they're all I have.
not_available Just where do you think you are going? To relax in my study with a nice cup of tea, my succulent compote.
not_available You may have some tea later after you find those rats.
not_available What the hell is all of this? 
not_available What? The TV.
not_available A refrigerator? The delivery guys couldn't get the refrigerator through the door.
not_available You have to take out those old cabinets first.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available OK.
not_available Julio.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get your brother.
not_available Let's go in the other room.
not_available Where's Vanessa? 
not_available She's asleep.
not_available We have a dance lesson tonight.
not_available Wake her up if you want to.
not_available But if I were you, I would let her sleep.
not_available You told me you were taking her shopping for a new pair of shoes.
not_available Don't start with me.
not_available We cannot afford this shit.
not_available Bullshit! You are a partner.
not_available You have the money and she wanted them.
not_available She never gets anything for herself.
not_available We have a rule, Angelica.
not_available If we're gonna spend more than $100, we check in with each other.
not_available She knew you'd be pissed.
not_available I am pissed! She takes care of your kids every single day and works a full
not_available time job on top of that.
not_available Look at this place.
not_available No wonder she's depressed.
not_available So she bought a new TV and a new refrigerator.
not_available They were both on sale.
not_available Give her a fucking break.
not_available She deserves it.
not_available May I help you? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was here earlier today for Dorothy Su's funeral.
not_available I think I may have left my reading glasses.
not_available I think I was sitting here.
not_available Maybe it was over here.
not_available Here they are.
not_available I misplace them all the time.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available I feel terrible, although to be perfectly honest, I really didn't know Mrs Su.
not_available I used to see her every morning, though.
not_available It's where I get my newspaper.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Did I say something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available My daughterin
not_available law's missing and I thought I had a feeling things would turn out all right, but now they've found her car and I still have a feeling, only now it's a feeling that something terrible has happened.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I just cried all over your jacket and you're a complete stranger.
not_available Not any more, I'm not.
not_available I'd have been more than happy to bring some stuff over.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available This way is easier.
not_available So how's everybody holding up? About as well as can be expected.
not_available My buddy at the sheriffs department put it on the state
not_available wide Teletype system.
not_available Thank you for doing that.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I just made a phone call.
not_available Well Thank you for being there.
not_available Here.
not_available Whatever.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Me? Fine.
not_available Liar.
not_available You wanna stay for a little while? No.
not_available I just don't think that would be such a good idea right now.
not_available OK, then.
not_available Call me if you hear anything.
not_available Or need anything.
not_available I will.
not_available We thought maybe you could use some company.
