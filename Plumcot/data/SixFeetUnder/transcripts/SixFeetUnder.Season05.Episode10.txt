not_available Whatever it was we will pay you for it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Did you sleep at all ? The bo aren't up yet, are they ? I'll take care of breakfast.
not_available Why don't you go back to bed and try and get a little sleep ? I can't.
not_available I have to pick up nate's body.
not_available Can't rico do it ? I should do it, keith.
not_available He's my brother.
not_available Well, maybe it's too much.
not_available It's not.
not_available So right after breakfast you have to take the boys to get suits for the funeral.
not_available You know, I can be with you today.
not_available I mean, it doesn't matter what the boys wear.
not_available It does matter to me.
not_available I'd start at nordstrom's.
not_available They're having a sale.
not_available It's okay if the sleeves are a little long, But if you really need alterations Take them to lester's on vine.
not_available Tell them that you need it first thing tomorrow.
not_available Say david fisher sent you.
not_available I wrote down the address.
not_available I didn't know he wanted his organs harvested.
not_available His wife approved it.
not_available Is there a problem ? No, of course not.
not_available It'll save a lot of people's lives.
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, fuck ! You want one ? I got them from your brother, but they suck.
not_available Stupid cunt ! You want me to make you something else ? Yogurt ? Oatmeal ? How about a scotch and soda ? Is it too soon for another pill ? When did you take your last one ? 
not_available Three hours ago.
not_available Sure, go ahead.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available If you get addicted I have a lot of experience getting people through withdrawal.
not_available Mm.
not_available You can have it all.
not_available Mm.
not_available I wish you were a food medicator.
not_available When my second husband died I couldn't stop eating for an entire year.
not_available It really helped.
not_available Hey there ! 
not_available Hi.
not_available There's coffee ! Oh, no thanks.
not_available I think I've already had too much coffee today.
not_available I made you some eggs.
not_available You see how much your mom enjoyed hers.
not_available Oh, thank you, but I'm fine.
not_available Why didn't you call dr.
not_available Paolo ? Mom, I told you he was out of town.
not_available But this was an emergency.
not_available I don't understand why no one even spoke to him.
not_available They thought he was going to be fine.
not_available He was talking to us, mom.
not_available He really seemed okay.
not_available But none of it makes any sense ! Sometimes things just don't.
not_available David, is there anything i can do to, like, help you ? What do you mean ? Why would I need any help ? I just mean, like, dealing.
not_available I can deal, thank you.
not_available You can help me call people.
not_available The list is in the office.
not_available Okay.
not_available When's the service ? 
not_available Tomorrow at noon.
not_available I think we should wait a few days so people have time to get here.
not_available Nate didn't want to embalmed.
not_available How do you know ? 
not_available He told me.
not_available Twice.
not_available But we're going to
not_available What ? Nothing.
not_available Never mind.
not_available This was the pre
not_available Need he filled out before the first surgery.
not_available But that was three years ago.
not_available He said he wanted a cremation And rabbi ari hoffman to do the service.
not_available She was supposed to marry us the first time.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available But just last week He said he wanted a "green funeral." What's that ? It's an environmentally, uh Friendly process.
not_available It's natural.
not_available The body is placed in the ground, wrapped in a shroud.
not_available No embalming or casket.
not_available And people often purchase a resting place In a designated park kind of area As a way to conserve the land.
not_available Well, that sounds nice.
not_available Officially, we're supposed to honor the signed document, But I think he Intended to change the preNeed and just never
not_available Didn't have time to.
not_available So it's up to you as his spouse To decide what you think he would have wanted.
not_available I have no idea.
not_available No fucking idea.
not_available I mean, rabbi ari ? And now, apparently, he is some kind of quaker.
not_available Was, I mean.
not_available You know, maybe we should just ask maggie what he would have wanted.
not_available What does maggie have to do with it ? Are you making decisions about nate's funeral ? We're just discussing what he might have wanted.
not_available Doesn't my opinion mean something ? He's my son.
not_available I 
not_available I didn't think you'd want to talk about it.
not_available I want him buried in the family plot next to his father.
not_available Well, he wanted to be buried in a nature preserve.
not_available But I want him next to me.
not_available Well, then you can go there too then.
not_available Hey, david.
not_available You okay ? I know.
not_available I still can't believe it.
not_available It's like now we just go on with everything ? That's what people do.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available I guess so.
not_available Uh, so, um Look, I'll, um 
not_available I'll take care of the felix pickup.
not_available What ? The guy at the nursing home.
not_available I'll take care of the whole funeral.
not_available You don't have to worry about anything.
not_available We can't take that funeral.
not_available What do you mean ? 
not_available I don't want anyone else here during nate's service.
not_available David, they have a pre
not_available Need.
not_available They paid for the funeral 10 years ago.
not_available Rico, please, just work it out.
not_available Maya, eat your apple sauce.
not_available No.
not_available Well, you have to eat something ! I'm sorry, honey.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I, um I knocked over your plant.
not_available I'll replace it.
not_available What are you doing here ? I though you might need
not_available Um I made you guys a quiche.
not_available I didn't want to bother you.
not_available I was just gonna leave it.
not_available But, uh, then Oh, brenda, I'm so sorry.
not_available What is this, some kind of quaker thing ? You fuck someone's husband to death And then you bring them a quiche ? Would you please just admit it ? It would be such relief to know When my marriage turned into a total fucking lie.
not_available Oh, it's not like that.
not_available Like what ? God ! It's not like anything you're imagining.
not_available Nate loved you.
not_available I don't need you to tell me how my husband felt about me ! Even if he was pissed off at me, He certainly wasn't in love with you even if he said he was.
not_available Nate could be very convincing that way.
not_available But all he ever wanted was someone who could make him feel Like he was a better man than he actually was.
not_available Could've been anyone.
not_available Why didn't I er get a stupid cell phone ? 'Cause you hate 'em.
not_available Well, if I had one like every other person in the world It wouldn't have saved him.
not_available Why did claire have to make me go get my hair cut ? I've been cutting my own hair for years.
not_available Why did she have to tease me about it now ? When did you have your last pill, hon ? I 
not_available I don't want another pill.
not_available I want my son.
not_available I want my beautiful son.
not_available I know.
not_available I know you do.
not_available This wasn't supposed to happen.
not_available I know.
not_available Nate ? Nate's the one who matters.
not_available You know, I love you, son, But nate 
not_available Nate's my little m.
not_available I'm a man, dad.
not_available Oh, don't get your ass in a knot.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You were the one we thought we could lose.
not_available What, with aids and picking up strange men on the side of the road, And screwing a whore with no condom.
not_available You know, all that sort of thing.
not_available You've been begging for some kind of annihilation your entire life.
not_available That's not true.
not_available It's like a cosmic joke.
not_available Oh, god.
not_available Your poor mother.
not_available She
not_available She must be going insane.
not_available He was her favorite.
not_available Who was yours ? 
not_available Claire has always been my little gal.
not_available You know how that is.
not_available You barely even knew Claire.
not_available Pretty little heartbreaker.
not_available Just like her mom Before she cracked.
not_available You make me sick.
not_available The feeling's mutual, cupcake.
not_available Come on, Durrell, where are you ? All right, I'm coming.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available No.
not_available No, no, you have to wear your new shoes.
not_available The pants drag on the floor with those.
not_available Just put them on.
not_available We've go to drop off something at my boss's Before we go to the fisher's.
not_available Look, I'm telling you the pants are too long.
not_available All right, maybe we can get them hemmed on the way.
not_available But then we have to leave now.
not_available David ? Excuse me.
not_available I'm sure Brenda brought some clothes, but I I happened to see his 
not_available His best suit, Fresh from the cleaner.
not_available We're not having a viewing.
not_available Why not ? Mom, I told you he didn't want to be embalmed or made up.
not_available But people need a viewing.
not_available You can look at him now.
not_available When he came out of the surgery What exactly did the doctor say ? Mom, I've told you this 100 times.
not_available Well, you haven't been clear about it.
not_available If he said everything was fine And nate was awake and talking, then Clearly something went terribly wrong ! What, do you think I killed him ? Is that what you're trying to get me to say ? How dare you speak to me that way ! 
not_available How dare you ! I lost him too, mom ! All you've been doing is accusing me of doing the wrong thing ! At least I was there ! Fuck ! What ? I, um I picked up the programs.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ted Fairwell.
not_available Hi, it's Claire.
not_available Hey, how are you ? I'm bad.

not_available It's not my fault they fired you after the table read ! I was "marky," man ! Why didn't you tell them I have the chops ? I'm cool ! 
not_available I said you were a comic genius.
not_available You think I wasn't embarrassed when they told me you stunk up the place ? You didn't fight for me.
not_available Everyone sells me out My fucking life ! 
not_available What ? You need to calm down now ! Now what am I gonna do ? I told my mom.
not_available I did a mailing ! Keith, I need you to take him to the Van Nuys airport.
not_available I've got a friend at Warner's letting me use the jet.
not_available I can't go to Van Nuys.
not_available That's a reoccurring on "two and a half men" I'm perfect for ! I just want to send him to Cabo till he settles down.
not_available I've got my kids.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Take them with you.
not_available I just wanna show you how good I can be.

not_available That's awful.
not_available Is there anything I can do ? 
not_available You can take care of this yourself.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, but I've been overpaying you for a year.
not_available This is the first time I've really needed you to do something.
not_available Uh, Keith, we've got to get my pants fixed.
not_available You can't go to a funeral without those hemmed.
not_available Leave the boys with me and i'll have my girl do them.
not_available She's a genius.
not_available I'm t leaving my boys with you ! We'll hem the pants and drop them off with david.
not_available Please, let me help you help me.

not_available They swore to me it would fit.
not_available And I picked up one for maya.
not_available And I brought some lox and vodka.
not_available Great.
not_available I can't drink.
not_available Lox has mercury.
not_available Oh, please, a couple shots of stoli won't kill the baby.
not_available You know, in my day we used to sit on our ass Smoking parl iaments for nine months.
not_available Today, you have one piece of brie and everybody goes berserk.
not_available Come on, sweetheart.
not_available Here, have some of this.
not_available It'll take the edge off.
not_available I don't wanna take the edgoff.
not_available I guess I'm just blathering on like an idiot.
not_available I don't know what to say, honey.
not_available I'm just so sorry.
not_available Hello, you.
not_available How are you, maya ? I think she's a little confused.
not_available Where's my daddy ? Oh, god ! I don't
not_available Your daddy Has gone away for a very long time.
not_available Mom, you can't say that ! Honey, daddy's dead.
not_available That means that he's not coming back ever.
not_available Brenda ! Jesus ! You know, soften it up a little.
not_available That's what #s the book said to do.
not_available I even went online.
not_available They all say you have to be clear or she gets confused.
not_available When is daddy coming back ? Daddy's dead.
not_available Remember, like, nemo's mom ? Remember how we talked about that ? You know what, Brenda ? I think you should save this discussion For a time when you're less insane with grief.
not_available I'm not insane with grief, mom ! Sweetie, you go on.
not_available Go ahead, play with your toys, sweetheart.
not_available Have you talked to billy ? He's not returning my calls.
not_available Oh, I suppose he's still in dubal.
not_available Jesus, I hope they haven't taken him hostage.
not_available He's not very docile.
not_available I'm sure he hasn't been taken hostage, mom.
not_available You're right.
not_available It's just that I'm a wreck.
not_available I can't believe we're both widows.
not_available It's just so horrifying.
not_available At least you've got olivier.
not_available Well, he walked out on me last week.
not_available You know, I didn't want to make today about me, but The truth is, I want to fucking kill myself.
not_available I mean, god, the pain is just searing.
not_available I know it's not the same.
not_available But we're both alone now.
not_available No, it's not the same.
not_available Not at all.
not_available So are we going anywhere in particular ? No.
not_available Do you mind just driving ? I don't mind.
not_available What is this, a mix ? Yeah.
not_available I love "top 40." I'm sorry, but it just sounds so good sometimes.
not_available I don't know why I keep thinking about These stupid fights I had with my brother, Not like any of the good times, or whatever.
not_available Isn't that horrible ? 
not_available No.
not_available I can't think of anything nice about my sister.
not_available But I like Nate.
not_available I mean, you know I did.
not_available What are you thinking of ? 
not_available Just weird things.
not_available Like this time, um It was right after my dad died.
not_available I had to write this idiotic english paper Where you're supposed to interview The person in your family that you knew the least.
not_available My dad was dead.
not_available And it was pretty much a toss
not_available up between those two anyway.
not_available Until I asked nate if I could, uh Interview him, and he said no.
not_available It was not like it was some big traumatic thing.
not_available It was just I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This is so gross.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I don't know why I keep thinking about that time ! Thank you for being so flexible.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye
not_available Bye.
not_available Can you zip me ? Where's angie ? She called.
not_available She's gonna be 10 minutes late.
not_available That's 20 minutes.
not_available Fuck ! 
not_available Hey.
not_available The kids can hear you.
not_available What's gonna happen with the business Now that there's no one to stop david from spending 300 grand on a crematorium ? What's wrong with you ? This is what you're thinking about ? Do you know how little savings we have ? What if something were to happen to me ? What would you do ? You and the kids, what would you have ? 
not_available Nothing is gonna happen to you.
not_available How do you know ? Something could happen to you ! 
not_available We still don't have any life insurance.
not_available Okay, we'll get it tomorrow.
not_available Where is she ? Did she need to get her outfit right for babysitting ? You want to go ahead of me ? Is that okay ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh, then I'll see you there.
not_available Okay.
not_available He's not there.
not_available Yes, he is too.
not_available Wow, you guys look great.
not_available How do you like the length ? It's perfect.
not_available David, I am so sorry about your brother.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's Keith ? We had a situation.
not_available I'm so sorry, But he just threw this guy at me.
not_available I just got to get him on a plane and then I can go.
not_available Well, couldn't you just say no today ? I know.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But I swear I'll be there soon, okay ? David ! This is total bullshit, man.
not_available I've got to get out of here.
not_available Hey, I know where I know you from.
not_available You're that guy in the blowjob video.
not_available Sorry, wrong guy.
not_available You are too, man.
not_available The one where Roger's giving you head.
not_available A video ? Dude, I've seen it like 20 times.
not_available Roger played it every time we had sex.
not_available He can't come without it.
not_available Does he pay you extra for that or is that part of the job ? Hey, where are you going ? Hey, hey ! Where are you going ? So why don't you like your sister ? Just the older one, Caroline.
not_available She's just kind of mean.
not_available Which is kind of weird, because she does this noble work Helping refugees.
not_available So to the world at large she's a saint.
not_available But if you're actually a person in her life, She's just a bitch.
not_available Like when my little sister was going through chemo Caroline came by to help her like twice In three years.
not_available That is pretty bad.
not_available Is your other sister okay ? Yeah.
not_available Betsy.
not_available She was lucky.
not_available That's good.
not_available I have to go back.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available There you are.
not_available How are you ? Thanks for making it.
not_available Are the boys okay ? They're upstairs in a state of bliss.
not_available Roger bought them iPods.
not_available God wh take someone's son At the one moment they were ever in their whole lives not able to be with him ? What kind of a message is that ? I don't think it's helpful to see it as a message to you.
not_available Then why would it happen that way ? Unless there really is no god.
not_available It's natural to be angry.
not_available But maybe it's best to view god as a light Through this dark time, as opposed to seeing him as the cause of it.
not_available God is an asshole ! 
not_available Yes, god is a huge asshole ! And I fucking hate him for this.
not_available We're gonna get you through this, honey, all right ? You're not alone.
not_available You're not alone.
not_available You could've dressed.
not_available I couldn't.
not_available The rest of us managed.
not_available Well, the rest of you win.
not_available I think we're all in shock.
not_available Three years ago We prayed for Nate's life.
not_available And we thought our prayers were answered.
not_available Now, we have to pray For help making sense of this loss.
not_available Because We've lost a lot
not_available A son A father A brother A husband A colleague To me an inspiration.
not_available He had a natural sense He had a natural sense of what to say to people when they were grieving.
not_available And, uh, I just think he'd know what to say to help us If only he where here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm david fisher and nate was my big brother.
not_available When we were kids I used to get picked on at school.
not_available I had come home with my face Or my pride bruise And nate would make me tell him who did it.
not_available And he would go talk to whoever was tormenting me.
not_available And I'd be fine
not_available Until it happened again.
not_available So Nate came up with another strategy.
not_available He said "When they start in on you just laugh, laugh at them.
not_available Even if they hit you, laugh." Well, I could never pull that off.
not_available But that was Nate.
not_available He could laugh at anything and people were always drawn to him, Because he could make the best of the worst situation.
not_available Even when life hit him, It couldn't kiKi
not_available My name is George Sibley.
not_available I was Nate's stepfather.
not_available This is a hard day.
not_available And we're all very upset.
not_available The loss of a young person is always a terrible blow.
not_available But in this case It
not_available It's even more cruel, Because nate was an idealist.
not_available And He struggled All through his life To be a good man.
not_available He wasn't perfect, But then who among us is ? And he never gave up on himself The people he loved Or even love itself, In all its vexing, beautiful forms.
not_available Oh, claire.
not_available There's too much cold cuts out there already.
not_available Here, take this scary fruit cake instead.
not_available How're you feeling ? Okay.
not_available I should go back downstairs.
not_available It's all right if you need to rest.
not_available You can go down if you want.
not_available I want to stay with you.
not_available I'm sorry for what I said.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You lost him too.
not_available You and I are really the most alike, you know ? And sometimes maybe It makes it hard.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's it going ? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Many questions.
not_available Hey, honey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you go ? No.
not_available Maya, why didn't you tell somebody you needed to go potty ? Do I have to get you a diaper ? God, she's been doing this for months.
not_available Sometimes they regress when they're upset.
not_available Oh God ! We're going to the cemetery in like two minutes.
not_available You know what ? I'll clean her up.
not_available You just go.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yup.
not_available Just trying to keep things tidy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We're leaving for the cemetery soon.
not_available It's just going to be family.
not_available I understand.
not_available Would you care to join us ? Yes.
not_available Very much.
not_available I wouldn't want joy to come If she happens to be here somewhere.
not_available She's not here.
not_available I have no idea where she is Ever Anymore.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Hey, claire.
not_available You can ride with david and keith.
not_available George is driving ruth, maggie and sarah.
not_available Riding with your mom ? Uh, no, she's not going.
not_available Well, you can ride with me and nate.
not_available No, I'll drive myself, thanks.
not_available I don't think you should do that.
not_available There's room with david.
not_available I'm fine, really.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, listen, here are the directions and my cell phone In case you get lost or something.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't forget this.
not_available God damn it ! David, are you okay ? David ? I can't go out there right now.
not_available What do you mean ? 
not_available You go.
not_available Look, I'll be out there in a minute.
not_available I can stay with you.
not_available No, just give me a minute ! Okay.
not_available There's no coffin ? He didn't want one.
not_available It's more natural this way.
not_available Where's david ? I think the three of us can handle this.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Where do we put him ? Uh, on the ground, I guess.
not_available Won't he get dirty ? Dust to dust.
not_available Wasn't there a poem he wanted read ? 
not_available Where's david ? I think he's just a little too upset, ruth.
not_available We're all upset.
not_available That's right, sweetie.
not_available We're all fucking upset.
not_available Sometimes we can't be everywhere we want to be.
not_available Yes, well, sometimes we can.
not_available Oh, god ! David ? We're starting the ceremony now.
not_available I can't.
not_available If you don't get out of this car, you will hate yourself forever.
not_available I know, but I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available You have legs.
not_available I am not doing this without you.
not_available Mom, please, I'm so dizzy I can't breathe.
not_available Well, we'll wait until you can.
not_available Could someone ? From the "mystic odes" of rumi.
not_available "Our death is our wedding with eternity.
not_available What is the secret ? 'God is one.' The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.
not_available This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes; It is not in the juice made from the grapes.
not_available For he who is living in the light of god, The death of the carnal soul is a blessing.
not_available Regarding him say neither bad nor good For he has gone beyond the good and the bad.
not_available Fix your eyes on god and do not talk about what is invisible, So that he may place another look in your eyes.'" * what else should I be ? * * all apologies.
not_available * Nate ? Hey.
not_available Kurt cobain died today.
not_available Oh.
not_available He killed himself.
not_available He was just too pure for this world.
not_available Well, his music will live on.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it will.
not_available You wanna try some ? 
not_available Yeah.
