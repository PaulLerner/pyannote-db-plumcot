
not_available Pike Place Market was born in 1907 from citizen outrage at the high cost of produce when Seattle City Councilman Thomas Revelle proposed a public street market.
not_available On opening day, August 7, 1907 eight farmers brought their wagons to the corner of 1st and Pike and were overwhelmed by an estimated 10,000 eager shoppers.
not_available By 11.00 a.m.
not_available They were completely sold out.
not_available That concludes the morning half of our tour.
not_available Once again, my name's Karen.
not_available You've been a superduper group this morning.
not_available We'll see you back here on the bus at 1.30.
not_available Thank you, Karen.
not_available I don't know about you, but I could sure use a fucking cigarette.
not_available Come on, dear.
not_available Bye.
not_available Excuse me, sir? Sir, it's lunchtime.
not_available You can get off the bus now.
not_available We're at Pike Place Market.
not_available Shit! We've got another dead one back here, Larry.
not_available You missed your last three sessions.
not_available Sometimes coming in here talking about my life gets in the way of me having one.
not_available So why did you bother coming in today? Because they sent a letter to my mother and threatened to suspend me if I didn't.
not_available I thought you had something you wanted to talk about.
not_available With you? Yeah, right.
not_available Are you angry with me? How can you tell? I was obligated to cooperate with the police, Claire.
not_available It's my job.
not_available Just so you know, I was here for you, not for them.
not_available They wanted to interrogate you alone.
not_available And they haven't found him yet, in case you're curious.
not_available I'm not.
not_available You haven't heard from him? Fuck, no.
not_available Not that I'd tell you if I had.
not_available You did the right thing when you called the police that night.
not_available I know I did the right thing.
not_available This isn't about whether or not I did the right thing.
not_available Given the circumstances, it's fully understandable that you're feeling this angry, Claire.
not_available If you don't stop saying my name at the end of every sentence, I am gonna What? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Just don't, okay? You feel like throwing something? Excuse me? You could, you know.
not_available Just pick something up off my desk and chuck it.
not_available I'm so sure you'd let me trash something off your desk.
not_available If you thought it might help, I would.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available You're angry with Gabe and you're scared because you don't know what's gonna happen to him.
not_available At this point, I don't give a flying fuck about him.
not_available You don't really feel that way, do you? No.
not_available I do feel better.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He was on one of those package bus tours.
not_available He'd been going on a lot.
not_available Three or four times a year, ever since Mom died.
not_available Sometimes he went with his friend Pete.
not_available This time he went alone.
not_available They think his heart just gave out.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available Where is your father now? 
not_available He's still up there in Seattle.
not_available The Columbia Funeral Home's holding him for us.
not_available They're on Rainier Avenue.
not_available Not a problem.
not_available We can make arrangements to have him flown back to LA.
not_available Flown back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dad won't fly.
not_available It was always a sore spot with Mom.
not_available She wanted to travel, but Dad flat out refused.
not_available Then, after she died, he started taking all these package bus tours.
not_available He has 
not_available He had a thing about flying.
not_available He never flew.
not_available I'm sure, given the circumstances 
not_available No, it isn't what he would have wanted.
not_available Isn't there some other way? We can make arrangements to have him shipped via rail or freight.
not_available Like FedEx? You can do that? 
not_available It's done all the time.
not_available They brought Abraham Lincoln home to Illinois by train all the way from Washington, packed in ice.
not_available It shouldn't be a problem.
not_available Keith, I'll be back up here just as soon as your father's back on his feet.
not_available What if Grandpa dies? My friend Neisha's brother had an operation, and he died.
not_available I told you, Taylor, it's just a hernia.
not_available It's nothing for you to worry about.
not_available I'd sure like to know where the hell Karla is.
not_available Is she still up in Oakland with Derek? Did she even offer to come back down here and take care of her kid when you told her you were leaving? We haven't heard from her.
not_available Jesus.
not_available I thought you had a number for her.
not_available It's been disconnected.
not_available Shit.
not_available I told you, Keith, hush that kind of mouth around your niece.
not_available Maybe I should just take the child with me.
not_available She'll be fine, all right? My new place has an extra room, and between Eddie and me we'll make sure she's 
not_available I don't wanna come stay with you.
not_available How come you can't stay here? 
not_available Because my things are at my place.
not_available What about my stuff? 
not_available You can bring it with you.
not_available You'd probably steal it.
not_available There's my cab.
not_available Taylor, come on, honey.
not_available Give your grandma a hug.
not_available I love you, Grandma.
not_available Now, you be good, and you mind your Uncle Keith.
not_available I'll try to come back as fast as I can.
not_available I know a lot worser words than "shit," you know.
not_available So do I.
not_available So, how'd the Mossback intake go? We need to find a way to get a body shipped back from your old stomping ground.
not_available Why can't you just fly it back? That's what your father always did.
not_available Apparently the deceased was afraid of flying.
not_available I don't think he's gonna give a shit now.
not_available The family doesn't want him to fly, all right? The freight companies are backed up until next week.
not_available And Amtrak can't bring him back until next Tuesday.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll fly up, rent a refrigerated van, and drive him back.
not_available You don't need a refrigerated van, just a one
not_available way rental.
not_available He's already been embalmed.
not_available Even easier.
not_available You'd do that? You'd fly up there and turn around and drive all the way back? I haven't been back since Christmas.
not_available I can see a few friends.
not_available I still have stuff up there.
not_available I'd love to.
not_available I suppose we could mark up the cost of shipping to cover your travel.
not_available When do you want me to leave? 
not_available Tomorrow? Done.
not_available Have you met any nice men recently, David? No one to speak of.
not_available I wish you'd put yourself out more.
not_available The door to your house only opens from the inside, you know.
not_available We haven't seen your friend Gabriel around much lately, Claire.
not_available So? Have you not been seeing as much of him? 
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available Did you two have a falling
not_available out? Yeah, Gabe joined the Hare Krishna, okay? Those people with the orange robes and tambourines? That try to sell you books in the airport.
not_available Yeah, that's them.
not_available Oh, my goodness! 
not_available He never struck me as a religious person.
not_available He is now, big
not_available time.
not_available Did he shave his head? 
not_available Yeah, he shaved his head.
not_available Can we talk about something else, please? Claire, do you want to come to Seattle with me? You're asking me to come to Seattle with you? Yeah, why not? I'm not sure we can stick the Mossbacks with two plane tickets.
not_available I'll pay for it.
not_available You will? Yeah.
not_available I could use the company.
not_available You could help me drive on the way back.
not_available She'll miss school.
not_available We're not doing anything I can't miss, and I can bring my homework.
not_available It's just for a couple of days.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'm tired of trying to be the architect for this family.
not_available It's high time you drew your own blueprints.
not_available Does anyone know what the fuck she's talking about anymore? 
not_available Nate.
not_available What? By the way, I'm flying up to Seattle tomorrow.
not_available You are? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm picking up a body and driving it back for David.
not_available I'm gonna take Claire with me.
not_available Sounds like fun.
not_available You don't mind that I didn't ask you? Ask me what? 
not_available To go with me.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available Good.
not_available You sure? Nate, I'm trying to read and you know I hate it when you floss in front of me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Is it weird I didn't ask you to come to Seattle with me? No, why would it be? I don't know.
not_available It just feels a little weird.
not_available Okay, now it is a little weird.
not_available But only because you're making it a little weird.
not_available But you're not mad about it? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available I think it's really good for you, spending some time with your sister.
not_available That's what I think.
not_available You sure it's not too weird? 
not_available God, Nate, give it a rest.
not_available Good night, Bren.
not_available Good night.
not_available Cool! Sleater
not_available Kinney's playing at this place called Showbox tonight.
not_available I hate to break it to you, but Showbox is 18 and over.
not_available What makes you think I don't have a fake I.D.? You have a fake I.D.? You're not gonna pull some pseudo
not_available parental bullshit on me, are you? No.
not_available I had a fake I.D.
not_available Once, too.
not_available Maybe I'll go with you.
not_available I don't need a babysitter, Nate.
not_available I love Sleater
not_available Kinney.
not_available You love Sleater
not_available Kinney? Will you try to get over yourself for a second and let me be your friend and your brother? Did you bring me on this trip because you thought I needed a little distraction? I invited you because I thought it'd be fun to bring you along.
not_available Now I'm having second thoughts.
not_available I believe you.
not_available So where are we staying, anyway? 
not_available My friend Lisa's.
not_available Is she an old girlfriend? 
not_available No.
not_available No way, not even close.
not_available We were strictly roommates, nothing more.
not_available Worked at the co
not_available op together.
not_available Is she all crunchygranola backpacky, and way into grunge? Crunchy
granola Maybe a little.
Backpacky Definitely.
not_available Into 
grunge No way.
not_available Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did.
not_available Besides, Lisa is It's not too easy to categorize.
not_available You guys did it a few times, though, right? 
not_available We're not having this discussion.
not_available Fine.
not_available This is it.
not_available Sweet.
not_available It's so good to have you back home.
not_available It's good to be back.
not_available Lisa, this is my sister, Claire.
not_available Come in.
not_available Hello, Hiram? It's me, Ruth.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How are you? Listen, the reason why I'm calling is I just wanted to let you know that I've been drafting a new blueprint for myself.
not_available No, not for the house.
not_available Yes, it is for the house.
not_available My house.
not_available I mean, not the actual physical structure I live in with my family.
not_available I'm speaking more of the emotional structure in which I've chosen to live my life.
not_available I most certainly have not been drinking.
not_available I'm just trying to let you know, Hiram that I harbor no hard feelings against you.
not_available No, I do not want to get back together.
not_available How presumptuous! You know something, Hiram? Fuck off! Amelia? It's Ruth.
not_available I know we haven't seen each other in a while and I feel a little funny leaving this on your machine but I just wanted to let you know I've been drafting a new blueprint for myself.
not_available And if you're ever looking for an opportunity to renew our friendship my front door is open to you.
not_available That's all I wanted to say.
not_available You can call me back if you want to, okay? Bye! Sarah, are you there? If you're there, pick up.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available I know we don't talk to each other very much anymore but I left you three messages in two weeks and you haven't returned any of my calls.
not_available I think you don't ever want to talk to me again, and if that's the case we really need to talk! There are things I'd like to say to you about the cracks in my foundation and your part in helping me repair them.
not_available This is your sister, Ruth.
not_available What do you mean, you can't? Eddie, I need you to pick up Taylor from school.
not_available Look, I realize you're in the middle of a shift.
not_available Can't you get somebody to cover for you? I'm caught between a rock and a fucking hard place here.
not_available I need you to do this for me.
not_available All right, never mind.
not_available Fuck it, then.
not_available This is a bullshit detail.
not_available I wish the guy would just shoot her and get it over with.
not_available I've got tickets for the Dodgers tonight.
not_available What did I say? Listen, I've got a huge favor to ask.
not_available What is it? I'm stuck in Koreatown.
not_available Some guy's holding his motherin
not_available law hostage.
not_available He claims she put his TV remote down a garbage disposal.
not_available I don't know when I'll be out of here.
not_available Eddie's pulling a double shift.
not_available I hate to ask but is there any way that you can pick up Taylor from Bridgebrook Elementary at 3:00? Yes.
not_available I mean, sure.
not_available I'd be glad to.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available I'll call ahead to the school so they'll be expecting you.
not_available I'll pick Taylor up from your place later.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks, man.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available No problem.
not_available What is this? 
not_available Tofu meatloaf.
not_available It's completely vegan.
not_available No dairy, no eggs.
not_available No animal products of any kind.
not_available No meat? 
not_available None whatsoever.
not_available Why do you call it "meatloaf"? You're a pisser just like your brother, aren't you? 
not_available Anyway, it used to be his favorite.
not_available It's delicious, Lisa.
not_available I didn't put in too much garlic? 
not_available Not for me.
not_available No way.
not_available Garlic is a miracle herb.
not_available It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.
not_available It stimulates the immune system and inhibits the growth of parasites in the intestines.
not_available So, how's life at the co
not_available op? Our membership is up 15% since you left in spite of the corporate outfits breathing down our necks.
not_available Wow, sounds like things are going great.
not_available We miss you.
not_available You should stop in and say hello while you're here.
not_available So, how's life back in LA? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available What can I say? I may have finally found something I'm good at.
not_available I always knew you had a spiritual calling.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available What? Being a funeral director is proof of a spiritual calling? It's not exactly what I imagined for Nate, but it doesn't surprise me.
not_available Nothing ever surprises you, Lisa.
not_available That's true.
not_available So, last time I spoke to you, back in January I suppose, you had met somebody? 
not_available Brenda.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Anything ever happen with that? We're still together.
not_available Wow! Eight months.
not_available That's gotta be an all
not_available time record for you, Nate.
not_available It might be.
not_available Sounds like a real relationship to me.
not_available What can I say? It is what it is.
not_available I mean, for me, for where I am at right now, it's a good thing.
not_available It's all good.
not_available It is.
not_available It's all well, mostly, you know, good.
not_available I'm really happy for you, Nate.
not_available You know, I got offered a job in LA.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Some big
not_available time producer came through town shooting a movie.
not_available She's looking for a vegan chef, and she offered me a job.
not_available Really, what movie? I'm not good with titles.
not_available I don't go to the movies.
not_available Film is processed with gelatin.
not_available Gelatin comes from horses' hooves.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available Most people don't.
not_available Hence the global slavery of animals.
not_available Were you thinking about taking the job? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I mean, LA is such a godless place.
not_available Besides, my life is really full here.
not_available May I use your bathroom? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's down the hall, first door on the left.
not_available She's a lot like you.
not_available You think? God, I've missed you, Nate.
not_available I've missed you, too.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available I think you totally cleared out my sinuses.
not_available Not too hard? Some of my clients find me a little intense.
not_available Not at all.
not_available I love it.
not_available It feels great.
not_available I have to say you're pretty loose.
not_available Not a lot of tension in the usual places.
not_available I'm curious.
not_available Melissa, what do you do? I'm just asking because I'm thinking about changing professions and I'm curious.
not_available I'm a prostitute.
not_available No shit? No shit.
not_available Cool.
not_available I'm making a cup of tea.
not_available Want one? I'd love to, but I've gotta get to work.
not_available Same time next week? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available See you.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Bren.
not_available Hi, honey.
not_available It's Mom.
not_available I'm at Tranquility Spa.
not_available I need you to meet me over here.
not_available Why? 
not_available Sweetheart, it's an emergency.
not_available I need you over here, please.
not_available What's happened? I'm at Tranquility Spa, Brenda, in La Cañada.
not_available I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.
not_available Brenda! Don't go in there.
not_available Mother, let go of my fucking arm.
not_available You're hurting me! This is your father's car.
not_available So Dad's here.
not_available Who cares? He's not here.
not_available He's at work.
not_available I checked.
not_available Look on the dash.
not_available Your father doesn't smoke Virginia Slims.
not_available Look on the gear shift.
not_available A scrunchie.
not_available Big fucking deal! Your father hasn't had enough hair to need a scrunchie since 1975! 
not_available So you think Dad's fucking somebody.
not_available Bingo! Oh, my God, is that all this is? I thought you'd heard from the hospital that something happened to Billy.
not_available Don't be so dramatic, Brenda.
not_available I have to go downstairs and work for a little while.
not_available Do you have everything you need? Can I have some chocolate milk? I'm sorry.
not_available We don't have any chocolate milk.
not_available I want some goddamn chocolate milk.
not_available I'm sorry, but we only have white milk.
not_available Ain't you got any other cookies besides these? Those are all we have.
not_available I don't like these kind.
not_available These kind taste like shit.
not_available Then just color in your coloring books, and I'll check in on you in a bit.
not_available I don't like coloring books.
not_available You picked them out at the drugstore.
not_available You told me I had to.
not_available I thought you liked coloring books.
not_available I don't.
not_available I told you I like to draw.
not_available Then draw.
not_available These are coloring books.
not_available You can't draw in coloring books because they already have the drawings in them.
not_available You can only color in coloring books.
not_available That's why they're called coloring books.
not_available You wanna watch TV? 
not_available Okay.
not_available You know how to use that? What do you think, I'm stupid? 
not_available I didn't say you're stupid.
not_available I know how to use a remote.
not_available Fine, knock yourself out.
not_available Dumb
not_available ass cracker.
not_available Man, I am starving for a cheeseburger.
not_available I want something that walked the earth, with the works.
not_available Man, I'm having a double.
not_available I thought you liked the meatless meatloaf.
not_available I lied.
not_available No shit.
not_available And what's with the "it is what it is" purposely vague bullshit about you and Brenda? I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings, okay? You definitely slept with her.
not_available Okay, yes.
not_available We had occasional sex together, but it was strictly on a friendship basis.
not_available You were fuck
not_available buddies? Yeah.
not_available And nothing more.
not_available Does Lisa know that? You know what? Every time we did have sex, and I'm talking about five, six times, tops I was very honest with her about what it meant and what it didn't mean.
not_available She's got it bad for you.
not_available I was always honest with Lisa.
not_available Lf you say so.
not_available What do you want? I want a Chubby Cheese with everything, medium skinny fries, and a Coke.
not_available My God, do you smell that? What, burgers and fries? No, it's like rotten eggs! Jesus! Oh, man, déjà fucking vu.
not_available Welcome to Chubby's.
not_available May I take your order? Yeah, I'll have a double Chubby I'll have a double Chubby cheeseburger.
not_available Fuck me! Was that one or two cheeseburgers? 
not_available Jesus, my head! Fuck! Nate, are you okay? Sir, I didn't get that.
not_available Can I take your order, please? Hello, sir? You drive.
not_available I'm gonna get some air and make a phone call.
not_available Okay.
not_available I didn't get that.
not_available Please repeat your order.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Yeah, is Dr.
not_available DiPaolo in? Yeah, it's definitely an emergency.
not_available Can I take your order, please? 
not_available Shut the fuck up! I'm going to have to contact the manager.
not_available I can't believe I'm doing this.
not_available Can't we at least go inside? I could get a seaweed wrap while I pretend to listen to you.
not_available That couldn't be her.
not_available I'm eating your protein bar.
not_available Maybe it is.
not_available This is like eating upholstery.
not_available I knew it.
not_available Bern couldn't get anyone that good
not_available Iooking to jump his saggy ass.
not_available I thought you and Dad had an agreement about this sort of thing.
not_available We did.
not_available We do.
not_available Only this time he broke one of the rules.
not_available He didn't tell me first.
not_available So you're not upset Dad's fucking somebody else.
not_available You're upset he didn't tell you he was fucking somebody else.
not_available That's right.
not_available The rule is, if you step outside the holy bonds you have to tell your wife first.
not_available So she can line up some young hottie of her own.
not_available I guess that sounds fair.
not_available You have other rules? 
not_available Yeah, a whole slew of them.
not_available Go on, tell me.
not_available I'm curious.
not_available You can't fuck my friends, I can't fuck yours.
not_available No fucking of mutual friends.
not_available Never in Hawaii.
not_available Never in a hotel that costs more than $300 a night.
not_available And never in a hotel that's under $75 a night.
not_available Not on holidays.
not_available There are others.
not_available I just can't remember all of them at the moment.
not_available Is one of 
them "Never fuck anybody else in front of your kids"? I guess not.
not_available Since there was that time I saw you in the hot tub with some old guy with a hairy back.
not_available Darling, your father was there.
not_available And there was absolutely no penetration, I can assure you of that.
not_available I'll bet that wasn't your choice.
not_available And you were supposed to be in bed.
not_available I was only gone a couple of hours, Rico.
not_available Every hour you're gone is an hour I have to stay late.
not_available I'm sorry about your buddy's kid, but I have kids of my own.
not_available Is this about us not giving you the loan for the house? Because you never used to complain about having to work a little overtime.
not_available This is about me not wanting to be taken advantage of by my employers.
not_available We're more than just your employers 
not_available That's bullshit, David, and you know it.
not_available When it's convenient, we're like family.
not_available But in a pinch, I'm just an employee and you and Nate are just my bosses.
not_available Hey, little lady.
not_available Taylor, I told you to wait upstairs.
not_available My tummy hurts.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Is that man dead? That man was totally dead.
not_available Yes, that man was totally dead.
not_available Did you kill him? 
not_available No.
not_available Did that other man in there kill him? 
not_available No.
not_available He died of natural causes.
not_available My friend Renee said sooner or later we'll all be dead.
not_available That's true.
not_available So someday I'll be dead, laying on a table like that? Not for a very, very long time.
not_available My mom says my dad's good as dead as far as she's concerned.
not_available That's just her way of expressing anger at him for not being around.
not_available Sometimes my mom says she wishes she was dead.
not_available That's just something that people say when they're upset about something.
not_available Did that dead man in there have any kids? Yeah, he had a wife and three children and five grandchildren.
not_available I don't ever want to die.
not_available Me, neither.
not_available It's called arteriovenous malformation.
not_available AVM, for short.
not_available Lots of people have it their whole lives and never even know.
not_available And the pills? They're an anti
not_available seizure medication.
not_available So what happened to you, that was a seizure? Sort of.
not_available Sort of? 
not_available It was a mild seizure.
not_available Does David know about this? 
not_available Yes, he does.
not_available I don't want Mom to know 'cause she'll just freak out.
not_available All right? It's no big deal, I promise.
not_available People don't just spaz out and hork all over their shoes for no good reason.
not_available Two 
words Tofu meatloaf.
not_available Besides, now I have these pills it'll be totally under control.
not_available You swear? 
not_available I swear.
not_available I just have to take them for the rest of my life is all.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available Just do me a favor and don't tell David about this.
not_available This client of mine's a prostitute.
not_available Is that supposed to shock me? 
not_available What? God, not everything is about you.
not_available You're such a classic narcissist.
not_available Just because your parents are shrinks doesn't mean you know about psychology.
not_available Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean that you're not out of your fucking mind.
not_available I've treated several prostitutes over the years and they're not as uncommon as you'd think That's her.
not_available She's your age.
not_available I have to talk to her.
not_available Mom, don't.
not_available Please don't.
not_available No, wait.
not_available I'm not angry.
not_available I'm not going to make a scene.
not_available I just need to personalize the experience and humanize the situation.
not_available It's for all of us.
not_available You'll just regret it.
not_available Miss! Hello, I'm Margaret, Bern's wife.
not_available You know, Bern and I have a really open relationship and I just want you to know it's okay with me.
not_available I'd love to chat, but I've gotta go meet Bern for lunch.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Get off, you bitch! I can't believe you! Get off of me! 
not_available Fine.
not_available You slut! Psycho! I'll see you in hell.
not_available I hope you like herpes.
not_available You know, I thought she'd be more evolved.
not_available Evolved? Mother, you just attacked that woman repeatedly.
not_available She could have you thrown in jail.
not_available I seriously doubt that.
not_available Are you hungry? Why am I here? Why was it necessary for me to be here with you for this? Because you needed a fucking audience.
not_available Not everything's about you, Brenda.
not_available Look at Mommy.
not_available Isn't Mommy pretty? Isn't Mommy fabulous and free
not_available spirited and uninhibited? Validate Mommy, kids, because she's incapable of doing it herself.
not_available No wonder Billy ended up in a psych ward.
not_available Not that you care.
not_available For your information, Miss High and Mighty, this is life.
not_available People have crises.
not_available They push each other's buttons.
not_available They inflict pain on one another.
not_available And once in a fucking blue moon, they bring out the best in each other.
not_available But mostly, they bring out the worst.
not_available You're pathetic.
not_available Don't you dare judge me.
not_available You think you're the paragon of mental health just because you've been dating the same man for the past few months? That's real, compared to what your father and I have? 
not_available You're just jealous.
not_available Of what? The fact that I haven't allowed you to totally destroy my life like you have everybody else's.
not_available What life? You've spent 32 years being your little brother's nursemaid Fuck you! to avoid having any emotional life of your own.
not_available And now that he's been put away you're gonna have to face your own demons.
not_available And, sweetheart, they're legion.
not_available Get out of my car.
not_available I would be happy to.
not_available I hope you like pork roast and mashed potatoes.
not_available They're okay.
not_available Where are you going, dear? 
not_available To watch TV.
not_available In this house we eat dinner at the table.
not_available You don't watch TV while you eat? 
not_available No, we don't.
not_available Maybe we can watch some TV when we're done eating.
not_available So, what grade are you in, Taylor? 
not_available Fourth.
not_available David was in the fourth grade once.
not_available It's true.
not_available Did you know David used to be my Uncle Keith's boyfriend? Yes, I did.
not_available Sometimes my momma calls my Uncle Keith a punk
not_available ass fudgepacker 'cause he likes men instead of women.
not_available I guess that makes you a punk
not_available ass fudgepacker, too, don't it? We don't use those kinds of words at this table.
not_available We don't use those kinds of words at all.
not_available How come? Because those words are 
not_available Hateful.
not_available Those are hateful words.
not_available What words do you use? Homosexual.
not_available My Uncle Keith has a new boyfriend.
not_available His name's Eddie.
not_available He drives an ambulance.
not_available But I don't like him too much.
not_available Why not? He looks at himself in the mirror a lot, and he talks to me like I'm stupid.
not_available I'm sure that's not true.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available It is true.
not_available Some people just don't know how to talk to children.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available I think I'll start the dishes.
not_available It's time for you to leave now.
not_available Go! Is everything okay? 
not_available Claire, I thought you were taking a nap.
not_available I was reading.
not_available Where's Nate? 
not_available He's outside making a phone call.
not_available Who were you talking to? Ants.
not_available I'm being overrun by them.
not_available At first I tried setting a little food aside for them next to the back door.
not_available Then I tried coaxing them out with some citrus oil.
not_available Now I'm trying to reason with them.
not_available At home, my dad used to squirt them with lighter fluid and torch them.
not_available I'm not still in love with your brother, if that's what you're thinking.
not_available Actually, I wasn't thinking that.
not_available I used to be.
not_available I used to think one day he would realize I was the one for him.
not_available He never has.
not_available Do you think he ever will? I'm probably not the person to be asking that question.
not_available He's my brother, but to tell you the truth, I'm just getting to know the guy.
not_available He's a heartbreaker, that's for sure.
not_available There are a dozen women all over Seattle who would freak if they knew he was back here.
not_available You must think I'm so stupid.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Do you have a boyfriend? 
not_available No.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available We broke up.
not_available You're better off, trust me.
not_available Fucking ants.
not_available I just wanted to hear how your day went.
not_available My mother practically beat the shit out of a woman in a parking lot but apart from that, I'm fine.
not_available How's Seattle? 
not_available Seattle's good.
not_available Your mother tried to beat the shit out of somebody? I really don't feel like reliving that right now.
not_available How's it going with Claire? Great.
not_available We're getting along great.
not_available Is everything okay? I just have a headache.
not_available We're gonna hit the road first thing in the morning.
not_available Okay, I'll see you, then.
not_available I just ran a bath and it's getting cold, so I miss you.
not_available I miss you, too.
not_available You never called.
not_available How did you know where I live? That's not really important.
not_available I think maybe it is.
not_available You wanna know what's really important? Show me.
not_available Did she give you a hard time? Not really.
not_available Let me grab her, and we'll get out of your way.
not_available Thanks again.
not_available It's no problem whatsoever.
not_available She's a great kid, Keith.
not_available She really is.
not_available Considering everything she's been put through, it's kind of a miracle.
not_available We should go.
not_available Good night, David.
not_available Good night.
not_available I thought you might need an extra quilt.
not_available It gets cold in this room.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Are you sure? Yeah.
not_available I'm good.
not_available You can't fool me, Nate.
not_available I know you too well.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Poor baby.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Are you sure you don't want any breakfast? 
not_available I'm good.
not_available I never eat breakfast.
not_available Lisa, have you seen my old brown flannel shirt? I'm pretty sure it got donated to the co
not_available op garage sale.
not_available Here it is.
not_available I love that shirt.
not_available It's so Nate.
not_available Why don't you hang on to it? 
not_available No, I couldn't.
not_available I want you to have it.
not_available What would I want with your shirt? 
not_available Would you just keep it? We should probably hit the road and pick up Mr.
not_available Mossback.
not_available Right.
not_available As always, it's been great seeing you.
not_available Take care of yourself, Nate.
not_available You, too.
not_available It was nice to meet you.
not_available Nice meeting you, Claire.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Morning, Mom.
not_available It's awfully quiet around here with Nate and Claire being gone.
not_available I suppose it is.
not_available What time did your friend come by to pick up his niece? That's awfully late for a child her age to be up.
not_available She was asleep on the sun porch.
not_available Is there something you'd like to say to me? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes, there is.
not_available I'm all ears.
not_available Your father used to say that to me all the time.
not_available "I'm all ears." Sometimes you remind me of him.
not_available What's on your mind? You have to be careful with children because their blueprints are being drafted by the adults in their lives.
not_available And this little girl It seems to me that her foundation is probably unstable enough without you bringing your My what? Your relationship with her uncle, you have to admit might be a little confusing to someone her age.
not_available I'm happy for you if this whole plan thing of yours has enabled you to draft your own blueprint or patch up some of the cracks in your foundation.
not_available But just between you and me, you're starting to sound like a crazy person.
not_available I think it's time you kept that shit to yourself and minded your own fucking business.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's a little weird driving a dead guy all the way back to LA.
not_available It's only weird if you make it weird.
not_available It's a little weird.
not_available It's not.
not_available You know, Nate, I don't know why but it's comforting to know you're just as fucked up as the rest of us.
not_available I'm not anywhere near as fucked up as the rest of you.
not_available You are.
not_available I'm not.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Shut up and drive.
