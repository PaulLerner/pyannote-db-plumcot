
not_available I don't understand why they want these filled with fuckin' helium.
not_available It's for the AVN Awards, man.
not_available It's like the fucking Oscars of porn, and they want 'em floating from the rafters.
not_available Check this out.
not_available Fuck me! I have several fuckable orifices! Wait wait wait.
not_available No, fuck me! I'm a chick with a dick! Then you can fuck yourself! No, fuck you! Oh shit, my dick fell off! Holy shit.
not_available I think this chick's my cousin.
not_available Watch out! 
not_available Dude, you almost hit that guy.
not_available I did not.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available Well, he like came from nowhere.
not_available But it's not just the wives who need to give themselves freely to their husbands within the blessed confines of the marriage bed.
not_available Husbands need to surrender as well 
not_available Praise the Lord.
not_available Because women have desires too.
not_available And those wifely desires Uh
not_available huh.
not_available to be satisfied by their husbands.
not_available Even when we may not feel like it.
not_available Right, Lonnie, like that ever happens! So, this is how, through marriage, we create the Garden of Eden again, without shame, without sin Oh! Oh my Lord! Oh my Lord! Sweet Jesus! Sweet Jesus! Oh, sweet Jesus! Lord lift me u Oh, those are good.
not_available You're up early.
not_available I'm always up early.
not_available Every day's a new adventure.
not_available Today we're having eggs.
not_available What do you think of our new table? I don't know.
not_available What is it, Indian? Persian, I think.
not_available What's the difference? Persia is Iran, and India is, well, India.
not_available It's George's? Well, we've been married for almost three months, and we decided it might be time to move some of his things out of storage.
not_available Most of it's in the garage for now, but we put the table in last night before we went to bed.
not_available You see this? 
not_available This is called a horse.
not_available That's funny.
not_available Where Daddy comes from, it's called a rock.
not_available It's a piece of greywacke I found wedged between the walls of the San Andreas Fault, up near Pescadero.
not_available That's what a "horse" is a piece of displaced rock between the walls of the fault
not_available line.
not_available That's very helpful, George, thank you.
not_available How's our little girl today? Good.
not_available Eating some eggs, wearing some.
not_available Is this a new table? It's Persian.
not_available Persia? Does that exist anymore? Persia is Iran.
not_available And this is a horse.
not_available A piece of rock found between the walls of a fault? Very good, Claire.
not_available George has been telling me all about his rocks.
not_available Who would've thought they could be so fascinating? Aren't they? It's like going to school in your own home.
not_available You know, Claire, maybe you could take photos of some of George's keepsakes.
not_available Every one of them has such an interesting story behind it.
not_available Well, not all of them.
not_available I mean, it's been a while since you did any of your, you know, art.
not_available I just thought it might inspire you.
not_available Do I look like I need to be inspired? Actually, you do.
not_available Oh.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be silly, Arthur.
not_available I'll just grab my cottage cheese and take it up to my room.
not_available Is this Persian? Yes, it is.
not_available I'm not sure if it works in this kitchen, but it's very beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I think it works in this kitchen.
not_available I love it because it's yours.
not_available Apparently, according to witnesses, she just got out of her car 
not_available and ran into traffic.
not_available Do they know why? No.
not_available I suppose we'll never know.
not_available Well, my heart goes out to you.
not_available It's horrible, not knowing exactly what happened to someone you loved.
not_available It was her time, that's all.
not_available The Lord works in mysterious ways.
not_available Yes.
not_available He certainly does.
not_available So, Mr.
not_available Sheedy, would you prefer an afternoon or an evening viewing 
not_available I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
not_available I just think in the interest of healthy grieving, Mr.
not_available Sheedy, you need to give yourself permission to at least be curious as to why your wife would jump out of her car and run into traffic for no apparent reason.
not_available Why? It's not going to bring her back.
not_available Nate? I believe Rico could use your assistance downstairs.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm very sorry for your loss.
not_available Some of the most striking tapestry art of the medieval age is to be found in Central France in the Chateau of Angers.
not_available During the 14th century, a more gothic style would take root in England, however, introducing intricately carved wooden sculpture Hey, you're Claire Fisher, right? I loved that graveyard light
not_available box piece you had in the alumni show.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available I'm Anita Miller.
not_available I started winter semester last year.
not_available Cool, hi.
not_available gothic architecture, middle
not_available period England.
not_available This is with the flying buttresses.
not_available Oh God, how much of this gothic stuff can there be? Some of it's really beautiful, but it's all starting to kind of run together in my head.
not_available I hear that.
not_available I see one more bleeding Jesus, I think I'll hurl.
not_available Maybe if you hurl on a bleeding Jesus, you could get independent study credit or a grant.
not_available Yeah, I'm sure the NEA is just dying to hand out money to Christ
not_available defacers.
not_available The NEA is dying, that's for sure.
not_available So, are you working on anything? No.
not_available I haven't even picked up my camera since like last spring.
not_available You? Please, all I did was work at Starbucks and see lameass movies like "The Hulk." Oh God, when I saw that I was just like, "Excuse me, can somebody please explain those gigunda, purple fucking pants?" 
not_available Shh.
not_available I know! Just show us his big, green package already! Shh! Can I help you? Hey, you wanna go out tomorrow night? It's open mic night at The Nuts and Jolts and my friend Edie is doing her thing.
not_available What's her thing? Mmm, it's kind of a punkfolkpoetry
not_available performance art kind of thing.
not_available Sure, why not? I can't believe you can't see this.
not_available He's just using that happyshe'sonherwayto
not_available Jesus horseshit to distance himself from the truth.
not_available The man lost his wife! He's facing one of the worst things that can possibly happen to a person, and I just think that he needs to feel.
not_available He needs to really, really feel the loss and the rage.
not_available Nate, everyone handles their grief in a different way.
not_available He was nowhere even near actual grief.
not_available Maybe he's just trying to keep it together in front of his son.
not_available Yeah, wouldn't want the kid to bump up against reality.
not_available Prepare him for actual life.
not_available Maybe the man has faith.
not_available In what, God? 
not_available Yes, in God.
not_available And maybe his faith in God is what sustains him.
not_available Well, he's not "sustained." He totally fucking checked out.
not_available You gotta go through all the necessary stages of grief! That's how you honor what the person actually meant to you.
not_available How long were you with the LAPD? Almost six years.
not_available And why did you leave? I, uh I went off on a guy during a domestic abuse call.
not_available Did you kill the guy? No.
not_available I busted him up pretty bad, though.
not_available Did ever kill anybody in the line of duty? Once.
not_available A guy pulled a gun and I did what I had to do.
not_available It was a clean shooting.
not_available I killed a guy during a domestic abuse call once.
not_available Mike.
not_available Now's not the time.
not_available Look, putting some asshole in the hospital for beating up on his wife is not a problem.
not_available We handle strictly highend clientele, mostly high
not_available profile people in the music and entertainment industry.
not_available We've handled MJ both MJs actually Whitney, P
not_available Diddy.
not_available Both MJs? Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson? Mick Jagger's an MJ.
not_available We've handled all three MJs then.
not_available Wow.
not_available When you come to work for Safeguard Protection Agency, your job is not to put your hands on anyone during any given situation.
not_available Your job is to low
not_available tone it and defuse the situation before it becomes a situation.
not_available Got it.
not_available I don't think I have anymore questions for now, Mr.
not_available Charles.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Do you have any questions for us? No, I don't think so.
not_available I really would like this job, though.
not_available I mean, this is exactly the line of work that I'd like to get into.
not_available I'm a hard worker and, um, you won't be sorry.
not_available We'll call you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available Do you have any paper towels? We'll take care of it.
not_available Mike? 
not_available I'm on it.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Oh, thank you so much, Rico! Come in.
not_available Hi, Nicole.
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available I am so glad that I met you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I never had someone be so nice to me without expecting something in return, you know? Yeah.
not_available Except for that one time 
not_available which I didn't mind at all.
not_available Look, Sophia.
not_available I'm married.
not_available We both know it.
not_available I'm just trying to help out a little here and there, that's all.
not_available Could you do me a huge favor? You know the DVD player that you bought me last week? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available I don't know how to hook it up.
not_available Sure.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available Now you'll be able to watch all your favorite movies, huh? Yoo
not_available hoo.
not_available So, you going to work? Yeah.
not_available I wish you didn't have to you know, do that for a living.
not_available Yeah, well we all got to eat, right? Yeah.
not_available Who watches Nicole? The lady upstairs.
not_available Where's her father? Fuck if I know.
not_available Look, Rico, he's a speed freak and a deadbeat.
not_available We're better off without him, believe me.
not_available And if you come to the club tonight, don't call me Sophia.
not_available My club name is 
not_available Infinity.
not_available Infinity, I know.
not_available All right, let's get this thing hooked up.
not_available Want to help me? I just figured nobody knows more about crazy people than I do.
not_available I was raised by them, I am one of them, and, really, I'm way too old to be rubbing up strangers.
not_available I think you're gonna make an excellent therapist.
not_available It's a pretty intensive, fast
not_available track program, and I'm gonna have to work my lazy ass off, but I'll have my MSW summer of 2005.
not_available You can analyze me.
not_available My mother is going to freak when she finds out.
not_available I'll just never tell her.
not_available So, what day is this? Day 78, right? More like 67, actually.
not_available get 67? The two weeks you were in San Jose don't count.
not_available No, they don't.
not_available We didn't even talk during those two weeks.
not_available Yeah, but we fantasized about each other.
not_available Speak for yourself.
not_available You didn't even think about me? While touching myself? Oh, I like the sound of that.
not_available Yeah, I bet you do.
not_available I think it's only fair that we count the days in San Jose.
not_available Think of it as time off for good behavior.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Here, eat this.
not_available Some people think I'm in heaven.
not_available But guess what? There is no heaven.
not_available Except right here with you.
not_available "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
not_available Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me." Oh yeah! Oh yes! Oh yes! Hey.
not_available Is this too much? No, sir, you are all that and a box of cookies.
not_available You have to say that.
not_available Yeah, I kinda do.
not_available Oh shit, I gotta pick up that package in 20 minutes.
not_available I cannot believe you're going to be a security guard to the stars.
not_available Security specialist.
not_available Oh, that is so hot.
not_available Who are you protecting today? I have no idea.
not_available All I know is I have to be at The Meridien Hotel at 11:00.
not_available I hope it's Russell Crowe.
not_available Or Denzel Washington.
not_available Or Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.
not_available Mmm, imagine the possibilities.
not_available I need a new suit.
not_available Well, you can buy three new suits with the money you're going to make, Mr.
not_available Theystartmeoutat
not_available Some of these guys make Holy shit.
not_available We can finally get one of those gigantic flatscreen, high
not_available definition TVs you've been wanting.
not_available And you know what else? A house.
not_available Oh my God, with a swimming pool.
not_available And a Jacuzzi.
not_available And an O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stoveand
not_available oven for the kitchen.
not_available Oh, put your hands on me.
not_available My job is to not put my hands on anybody.
not_available Oh.
not_available My job is to low
not_available tone it, and defuse the situation before it becomes a situation.
not_available Oh, yeah? Well, defuse this.
not_available Ah.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Keith, this is Derek and Jeffrey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up? You take a peek inside? Excuse me? 
not_available Inside the case.
not_available No.
not_available You didn't give me the combination.
not_available Not that I would have if you had.
not_available Don't you want to know what you were transporting? Not if you don't need me to.
not_available CD's bling.
not_available CD? Cameron Diaz.
not_available Wow, I'm going to meet Cameron Diaz? No.
not_available I'm putting you on lobby duty with Derek and Jeffrey tonight.
not_available Oh, got it.
not_available So what do we do now? We're doing it.
not_available You got some shades? I left them in the car.
not_available I really like this table of yours, George.
not_available Although I must admit I kind of miss the old Formica one.
not_available I'm sure being a geologist you know Formica was originally developed as an electrical insulator, created as a replacement for mica, a silicate mineral.
not_available Hence the word for
not_available mica.
not_available Actually, that's not true.
not_available Mica, whether biotite or muscovite, is a silicate mineral, that's true.
not_available But Formica is a plastic laminate, developed for kitchen furnishings in the 1920s.
not_available The one has nothing whatsoever to do with the other.
not_available I stand corrected then.
not_available They're both such interesting explanations, though, aren't they? By the way, that's my yoghurt you're eating.
not_available My name is clearly marked on the side of the container.
not_available I hope you're planning on replacing however much of it you consume.
not_available Oh.
not_available Man, I'd fuck her.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'd tap that ass.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available No fucking doubt.
not_available Check out that.
not_available You can't have that.
not_available I could if I wanted to.
not_available In your dreams, you could.
not_available I've had finer than that.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available I'd definitely tap that ass.
not_available Okay, I think you should go home.
not_available It's still early, though.
not_available I know.
not_available I just want some alone time.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, when do we stop doing this "going back to our respective places"? 
not_available At the end of 90 days.
not_available 90 days, right.
not_available It's a good, healthy period of rehabilitation, that's all.
not_available You know there's some people who go to rehab for 30 days.
not_available Those people usually relapse.
not_available What about the 60day people? 
not_available Still pretty iffy.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Okay, I see.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available So is it the morning of the 90th day or is it the evening of the 90th day? It would be the 91st, actually.
not_available That is so not fair.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You're not 17, you can wait.
not_available It'll be worth it, trust me.
not_available But I just want to see that weird tattoo.
not_available You've seen it already! Without all that annoying clothing to distract me.
not_available Just once I just want to get to know someone before I sleep with them.
not_available People used to get engaged before they'd even met, and they'd stay engaged for years while they got to know each other.
not_available People also used to think that cats could suck their souls out of their bodies.
not_available They do.
not_available You know, technically, I could stay over before the 90 days.
not_available We would just have to sort of keep a lid on it.
not_available I don't think I could do that.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna go across the courtyard, and I'm gonna count to 91 and I'm gonna masturbate.
not_available You want more pizza, babe? You barely ate a thing.
not_available Oh no, I had two pieces, I'm full.
not_available Usually you eat the whole pizza yourself.
not_available Are you feeling okay? Yeah, I feel fine.
not_available Can I get some more tokens? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you keeping an eye on your brother over there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yeah? Here.
not_available One for you, one for him.
not_available How was work? Same shit, different day.
not_available You don't want to talk to me about anything? Why don't you tell me about your day? I already did, but obviously you weren't listening.
not_available I was listening.
not_available What did I say? Look, Vanessa.
not_available I'm just I'm just a little distracted right now, that's all.
not_available This is Shakey's Pizza night, babe, it's supposed to be fun.
not_available The kids are having a blast.
not_available What are you talking about? No, it's supposed to be fun for all of us.
not_available I'm having fun.
not_available You are a lying sack of shit.
not_available Hey, you didn't have anything to talk to me about for six fucking months.
not_available Can I be distracted for one night? "Your clitoris.
not_available Hot, burning, wet pinkness.
not_available I wasn't the first and I won't be the last.
not_available The crack of the world for all to explore, except for me.
not_available Been there, done that." That's the end.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I feel violated.
not_available I don't think he's ever been laid.
not_available Oh, that's Edie! Okay.
not_available Can we make a rule for open mic night? No more angry poems or songs with clitoral or vaginal references in them unless you have one.
not_available Here's my poem dedicated to every guy I've ever been with.
not_available "Your penis is kinda nice.
not_available Too bad you're attached to it." This next piece is a collaboration between me and my mom, who lives in Chicago.
not_available My mom has cancer and she's really angry, even though she's been smoking three packs a day for 40 years.
not_available Edie.
not_available Feel sorry for her yet? I just came back from lunch with your Aunt Betty.
not_available Aunt Betty who once told me black people couldn't go to heaven.
not_available I feel so lost, I don't know what to do with myself.
not_available Okay, I lied about the cancer part.
not_available There is nothing wrong with this woman.
not_available Nothing! What happened to me, Edie? What happened to my life? She's just a fucking victim who's never taken a chance in her life and has nobody to blame but herself! I wish I was dead.
not_available Actually, my mom is the Vice President of the Midwestern Direct Marketing Association.
not_available I can get you any targeted list you want over 65, under 21, married, single, gay, lesbian, smokers, racists, cancer survivors.
not_available She is plunging headlong into the abyss with all her guns firing! You just tell me what you want and I will deliver! And it will take you 32 hours of sheer physical agony, and you will never let me forget about it! Edie.
not_available You made her look so beautiful.
not_available Well, you and God.
not_available That's our job.
not_available Me and my associates, I mean.
not_available Not me and God.
not_available So, how are you holding up? Quite well.
not_available Thank you for asking.
not_available It's okay for you to be angry.
not_available I'm not angry.
not_available Maybe you just don't realize it.
not_available You should know anger is a very natural and necessary stage in the grieving process.
not_available Nate 
not_available You can't just skip over it.
not_available Believe me, I've been there.
not_available You have to live with it and allow yourself to dwell on it.
not_available You have to own it.
not_available Only then are you gonna have any chance of moving through it and getting on with the rest of your life.
not_available I know there's a reason God chose this for Dorothy, and I know that his wisdom is infinite.
not_available What if you're wrong? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available What if there is no God, no heaven? Nate What if she's just gone forever, like she didn't even exist, and now you have a child who will never know his mother? That doesn't make you angry? 
not_available Nate! It's all right.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available If you'll excuse us for a moment Please.
not_available That's enough.
not_available I am just trying to help the guy face the truth! What? I'm uniquely qualified, don't you think? I'm a funeral director and my wife is freshly dead.
not_available Who's more qualified than me? This isn't about you, okay?! Leave these people alone.
not_available Look, you want to leave them alone? Fine, you leave them alone, but don't expect me to feed them lame shit like it's going to get better, because it won't! And people need to know that! Well, maybe some people aren't ready for that.
not_available "
Formica A durable plastic laminate used in kitchen furnishings, developed as an electrical insulator as a replacement for the silicate mineral mica." That was so great.
not_available No, it was self
not_available indulgent, and I still don't know exactly what it's about, you know? But I figured, do the work, stay out of the results.
not_available I liked the cock poem at the very beginning.
not_available Which was totally improvised, right? Was I too hard on him? Oh no, not at all.
not_available I mean, he was weeping Yeah, but two cute girls followed him out back.
not_available Well, maybe he'll get a blowjob out of it.
not_available So, you're at LAC Arts, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What year? Sophomore.
not_available You? Junior, I think.
not_available I haven't been keeping track of my credits or anything.
not_available Claire grew up in a funeral home.
not_available Why did you have to tell her that? So, what's your medium? Photography, mostly.
not_available Yeah, but I haven't picked up my camera in like months.
not_available Why not? I don't know.
not_available I went through a tough time for a while.
not_available That's the best time to work.
not_available I mean, that's when your guts are all raw and you don't have to waste too much time thinking about it.
not_available Yeah, I just feel like anything I do is going to be shit.
not_available So? What's the worst that can happen? I mean, some asshole will make fun of you? Like you made fun of poet guy? 
not_available Yeah, exactly.
not_available I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of people here right now, making fun of me.
not_available Yeah, I guess I'm just waiting for the right time.
not_available Well, none of us may be here tomorrow.
not_available I mean, you of all people should know that, right? Are you okay? Ever since Lisa died, every death that comes through here feels like her dying all over again.
not_available It's only been a few months, Nate.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I keep thinking it's going to get easier.
not_available No one ever said it gets easy.
not_available Not easy, easier.
not_available Just for five fucking minutes.
not_available I can't get it out of my head even for that long.
not_available Even when I'm with Maya.
not_available Most of all, I just don't think 
not_available I believe any of this anymore.
not_available Any of what? That anything we say or do actually helps anybody.
not_available All right, look.
not_available I can't do this anymore, David.
not_available What are you saying? I'm saying that I quit.
not_available You're quitting? 
not_available I'm not cut out for this.
not_available You're cut out for this, like Dad was.
not_available Rico is cut out for this.
not_available Probably Arthur's cut out for this, I'm not.
not_available I am not.
not_available I am not cut out for this.
not_available And I have got to find some other kind of life for myself.
not_available And not just for myself, but for Maya too.
not_available I have to.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Ahem.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Is that you making all that noise? What noise? Sounds kind of like a moose that got hit by a Mack truck.
not_available I beg your pardon, I'm orgasming.
not_available You might want to dial it back a bit before the landlady calls animal control.
not_available I can't help it.
not_available Fantasizing about making love to you is even better than actual sex with most people.
not_available What are you wearing? At the moment? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Come over in that.
not_available You're joking, right? Maybe not, but come now before I change my mind.
not_available Did anyone see you come over? 
not_available I hope so.
not_available Get in here.
not_available Well.
not_available The ball's in your court, so to speak.
not_available Is everything all right, David? As a matter of fact, no, everything is not all right.
not_available Nate quit.
not_available What do you mean he quit? 
not_available His job.
not_available When? 
not_available Last night.
not_available It's now "Fisher &amp; Diaz" as in one Fisher and one Diaz.
not_available Well, you've been complaining about Nate's work.
not_available I would think you'd be happy if he took a break.
not_available Mom, he's not taking a break, he quit.
not_available Now there are just two of us.
not_available I already had to drop out of chorus since he's almost never here when he's supposed to be.
not_available Perhaps this is for the best then.
not_available I suppose we can get Arthur to pick up some of the slack.
not_available He can embalm as long as one of us is in the room with him.
not_available Did you know that the average American changes career seven times during his or her lifetime? Is that information supposed to be useful in some way, George? It's just a fact.
not_available Ah.
not_available Hey, I'm gonna take Maya to the park.
not_available Okay, I know.
not_available Have fun at the park.
not_available I'll be here at work, keeping us all afloat.
not_available Dorothy loved all of you.
not_available And I know that she'll watch down on us as we sleep.
not_available But know that she is not gone and anyone who knows Dorothy knows it.
not_available She was everywhere Hey, why are you, uh Hey, dum
not_available dum.
not_available I just got home and I was thinking about how sweet you are.
not_available And I miss you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, hey look, I'm at work right now.
not_available I shouldn't even be 
not_available I was thinking maybe you could come over later, okay? Please? Okay.
not_available Maybe I can stop by for like a little while.
not_available Oh, can you pick us up something to eat, too? Some 
not_available Nicole loves pizza with pepperoni.
not_available We can eat it together and watch TV.
not_available It'll be fun, okay? 
not_available I can do that.
not_available I'll be there in a little bit.
not_available Okay, hurry.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available Uh, Vanessa just called, Augusto has an ear infection and she needs me to take him to the doctor.
not_available Okay, fine, go.
not_available Shit! It just started, and then it wouldn't stop.
not_available Jesus fucking Christ.
not_available All the blood we drain must have backed up 
not_available into the rest of the house's plumbing.
not_available After we spent $38,000 for a whole new system less than two years ago?! Should I call the plumber? Yes, tell him it's an emergency! And don't let anybody use the bathroom! 
not_available Oh, this is so gross.
not_available What do you think you're doing? Taking pictures.
not_available This is like right out of "The Shining." This is not cool or legal! Stop it! What bug crawled up your ass? This is our family business, Claire, even if I'm the only one in the family who gives a shit anymore.
not_available Well, what if you need photos for the insurance company or something? All right, take some more, but this is not an art project.
not_available Okay, here we go.
not_available Whoo! Oh! Good job.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available Good job.
not_available Well, whoever did your last job cut some corners by using PVC instead of copper, and that's not good.
not_available Then you had your drainage line bursting and backing up into your septic.
not_available Once that happened, everything kind of went to hell from there.
not_available But I replaced all your busted PVC with copper, and you should be okay.
not_available I just need you to initial here, here, and sign here.
not_available Thanks for coming so quickly.
not_available Hey, that's that's what I'm here for.
not_available Is something wrong? No.
not_available I'm doing something wrong? No, not at all.
not_available Am I? Not at all.
not_available It's a little weird, isn't it? It's always weird in the beginning.
not_available Is this more weird or less weird? You want me to compare? No.
not_available I mean, yes.
not_available I do, I do, only if it's a favorable comparison.
not_available This is fine.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Is it good for you? 
not_available Yes, definitely.
not_available Good, I'm glad.
not_available I think we're talking too much.
not_available Yes.
not_available I really like you, Brenda.
not_available We're definitely talking too much.
not_available You certainly do have a lot of hair in your ears.
not_available I still have no idea why from an evolutionary perspective, homo sapiens get hairier the older they get.
not_available You have such an interesting way of looking at the world.
not_available Ruth, I have the feeling that your children don't care all that much for me.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Perhaps you try a bit too hard with them.
not_available I'm just trying to have a relationship with them, that's all.
not_available I hate to say this, but I'm finding your family a little difficult to connect with.
not_available Turn your head, please.
not_available Maybe you're right.
not_available Maybe if I didn't try so hard.
not_available I love you just the way you are.
not_available And sooner or later everyone else in this family will love you, too.
not_available I quit my job.
not_available I quit my whole fucking life.
not_available You didn't quit, you got fired.
not_available I guess maybe I did, yeah.
not_available It may not have been the best thing that ever happened to me, but it was right up there.
not_available Getting married, becoming a father, getting creamed by a bus those are some of life's big moments.
not_available You were never cut out for this business.
not_available That's what I've been thinking.
not_available I mean, it's all a bunch of bullshit, right? Sometimes, yes; sometimes, no.
not_available Sometimes I'd even surprise myself at how heartfelt I'd find myself in a given situation, and then sometimes you just say the words and hope nobody realizes that you're completely full of crap.
not_available It happens to the best of us.
not_available But you're probably better off.
not_available I'd give anything if Lisa hadn't died.
not_available But then again, when she was here, I just wanted to be free.
not_available You coming inside? No.
not_available Not today.
not_available This one? 
not_available She's a keeper.
not_available Yeah, isn't she though? Whatever you do, don't fuck that up.
not_available You take care of yourself, buddy boy.
not_available What do we have here? Come on.
not_available So you still haven't even seen Cameron Diaz? It's only been two days.
not_available She's very private.
not_available Apparently so.
not_available It's a glamorous job, what can I say? You like the guys you're working with? They're okay.
not_available I got a blowjob today.
not_available You did not.
not_available I did.
not_available From who? From the plumber.
not_available You got a blowjob from a plumber? His name was Andy.
not_available A white guy? Yeah, he was good with a wrench.
not_available Did you return the favor? 
not_available No! You better not think you're getting out of having sex with me tonight.
not_available Okay, but I might need you to talk about water rams and hand snakes.
not_available Do you suppose it might be a late wedding present? Well, there's no return address.
not_available What is it? I believe it's feces.
not_available Feces?! Who in the world would send you feces in the mail? I don't know.
not_available Look at this, Maya, somebody sent Grandpa a big steaming pile of dookie.
not_available Wait.
not_available Don't throw it away before I can get my camera.
