
not_available That one's gonna be for the highlight reel this weekend.
not_available As we take another look If you don't get your fat ass in gear you're gonna be late for work.
not_available I just sat down.
not_available Come on.
not_available You only got this job two weeks a year.
not_available All right.
not_available You know, this goddamn suit itches like hell.
not_available You could lose a little padding here.
not_available Careful.
not_available Only good little girls get presents.
not_available No flirting with the faggoty elves.
not_available Can I help it if the elves think I'm a stud? You are a stud.
not_available But you're my stud.
not_available Careful.
not_available Yeah, like hell.
not_available You're a loser.
not_available Is that Santa? It is.
not_available It's Santa.
not_available Hi, Santa! You told me Donald Green was Jewish.
not_available I don't know.
not_available His shop was closed on Yom Kippur.
not_available He sent us a Christmas card with a baby Jesus on it.
not_available So he's not Jewish.
not_available We sent him one with a dreidel on it.
not_available Now he thinks we're Jewish.
not_available Is Brenda Jewish? Yeah, sort of.
not_available Her dad's Jewish, and her mom was raised Catholic, I think.
not_available But now they're atheists.
not_available I think.
not_available How would your children be raised? We haven't gotten that far yet, Mom.
not_available Is she coming to Christmas dinner? I'm making my list.
not_available That's the plan.
not_available Christmas Eve at her mother's place, and then Christmas dinner here.
not_available So I'll write you down for two.
not_available Great.
not_available David? 
not_available You can put me down for one.
not_available But what about Keith? Aren't the two of you Yes, we're having healthy, affection
not_available based sex on a regular basis.
not_available Twice a day sometimes.
not_available Why won't you bring him here for Christmas? Are you ashamed of us? Of course not.
not_available Taylor's living with him now.
not_available They're having their own Christmas.
not_available Invite them both.
not_available I'm cooking a goose.
not_available Don't they like goose? You really want them, or are you being politically correct? Of course I want them to be here.
not_available If he's someone you care about, then he should be here.
not_available I am sick and tired of this chip on your shoulder, David! How am I supposed to accept you if you resent every single attempt I make? All right, fine.
not_available We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night.
not_available I'll ask him then.
not_available If you both have plans for Christmas Eve who's going to midnight service with me? I'd like for you to go to church with me tomorrow night.
not_available And I need to know if you're bringing anyone to Christmas dinner.
not_available I was thinking about maybe asking Toby.
not_available Toby? I don't know any Toby.
not_available I met him at Aunt Sarah's, and we've been out a couple of times.
not_available Doesn't Toby have a family of his own to spend Christmas with? His parents are pagans.
not_available It's not his fault.
not_available When are you going to invite him? I need to know how many yams to buy.
not_available Look, if he's coming, I'll tell him to bring his own yam.
not_available And when are we going to decorate the tree? You need to calm down.
not_available Christmas is the day after tomorrow.
not_available What about tonight? I can't.
not_available I made plans.
not_available Me, too.
not_available I'm already doing the church thing.
not_available I wish I knew what I did to deserve such morose, surly children.
not_available I'll be so glad when these fucking holidays are over.
not_available Baby, you're making it worse.
not_available How come you can make a squashed face look like new but you can't even fix a stupid wall? It's the Sheetrock.
not_available It's all crumbled.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm still picking it out of the couch.
not_available Okay, Vanessa.
not_available Why don't you tell me what else I've done wrong lately? I don't understand why you fired Ramon.
not_available He was doing good work.
not_available He was cheap.
not_available I had my reasons.
not_available You're jealous 'cause he knows how to fix things and makes you look bad.
not_available I don't want him around here anymore.
not_available Look at you, Rico, you're jealous.
not_available All right, you wanna know why I fired him? Yeah? When I came home that afternoon, he was screwing someone.
not_available A man.
not_available Right here against this wall.
not_available Rico, that's disgusting.
not_available Stop lying.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available He was screwing a frigging man! Right here, right in my fucking house, he was screwing a man! Oh, my God.
not_available And that's why I fired him.
not_available Okay? Oh, my God! Okay, if you were a gay mortician, what would you want for Christmas? A new life? 
not_available I hate Christmas.
not_available I hear you.
not_available It's such pressure to live up to these images.
not_available The whole family sitting around the dinner table as Mom, dressed in her special Christmas apron serves a meal that she spent three days making.
not_available I mean, who has that? I do.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Just add the smell of death and people crying downstairs you've got my life exactly.
not_available It doesn't sound half bad, actually.
not_available It's awful.
not_available No, awful is when you celebrate the winter solstice by watching your father play the recorder while your mother dances around a bonfire chanting hymns to Gaea, the earth goddess.
not_available Sure, it's funny to you.
not_available So do you want to have Christmas dinner with my creepy family? Are you kidding? I would love it.
not_available Do you really want me to? It was my mother's idea.
not_available Ever since my last boyfriend tried to kill himself robbed a store, and shot at a guy before disappearing off the face of the earth, she wants to meet everyone I date.
not_available A biker funeral? 
not_available I know what you're thinking but they seem pretty cool.
not_available Are you kidding? I love biker funerals.
not_available These guys have big money.
not_available They all have Harley dealerships or repair shops And methamphetamine labs in their basements.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Money is money.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Johnson, I'm David Fisher.
not_available I've very sorry about your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available This is Pete, a close friend of the deceased.
not_available This is my brother, David.
not_available And this is Marilyn's brother, Bitsy.
not_available As in Itsy.
not_available So, is there a casket that appeals to you? It's gotta be steel.
not_available The Camry here is 20 gauge stainless steel.
not_available That sounds foreign.
not_available No, I assure you, it's built right here in the United States of America.
not_available All right.
not_available As long as it's the best.
not_available Jesse never liked to have a fuss made over him.
not_available He always said that when his time comes just set him out by the curb on trash day.
not_available But I want to do right by him.
not_available He was a good man.
not_available He was the fucking best! Now, we want the casket airbrushed the same as his gas tank.
not_available It's midnight
not_available purple with orange flames.
not_available I'm not sure 
not_available I'll give you the number of the guy that's restoring Jesse's hog.
not_available He can do it all at once.
not_available That is a hell of a bike.
not_available And on the inside of the casket lid, we want a picture of Marilyn here.
not_available You know, so she's looking down on him for all eternity.
not_available That was Jesse's favorite picture of me.
not_available It was Hustler's Beaver Hunt, April of '86.
not_available It's a very nice picture of you.
not_available Isn't it? I usually hate pictures of myself.
not_available We're gonna need a couple of kegs of Bud and a case of Jack for the service.
not_available I want this done right.
not_available It's gonna be one big
not_available ass Christmas Day funeral.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Christmas is the one day we don't hold services.
not_available We'd pay whatever it takes.
not_available A big
not_available ass Christmas Day funeral it is.
not_available So we're gonna be working on Christmas Day.
not_available We've had worse Christmases.
not_available Yeah, we have.
not_available Do you remember the last time you saw him? No.
not_available I can't believe it's Thanksgiving already.
not_available What happened to this year? I know.
not_available You can't even go anywhere that isn't all decked out with candy canes and Santa heads and shit.
not_available It's all so phony.
not_available I think in Hell it's always Christmas.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Hey, buddy
not_available boy.
not_available What are you doing out here? I had to take a break.
not_available It was just too much food.
not_available I know.
not_available Your mother's been baking all week.
not_available She outdid herself this year.
not_available So, how's Seattle treating you? It's all right, I guess.
not_available I got no complaints.
not_available Me, neither.
not_available Not many people can say that, you know, and mean it.
not_available I guess we've got a lot to be thankful for.
not_available Either that, or we've lowered our expectations so much we've given up on anything better than this.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Listen, I gotta pick up a body so I'm not gonna be able to drive you to the airport.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I can take him.
not_available Thank you, kitten.
not_available You coming down for Christmas? Yeah, I think so.
not_available I gotta see how my schedule works out.
not_available It's good to see you, son.
not_available You, too, Dad.
not_available Take care of yourself.
not_available Anything I can help you with? Yes, I'm looking for clothes so expensive only an idiot would buy them.
not_available Oh, there they are.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Your wife would like you to see how she looks in her Jil Sanders sweater.
not_available And I think you should leave, or I'll have to call security.
not_available Do you validate? You smell good.
not_available It's the flowers.
not_available You are so beautiful.
not_available I am not.
not_available Did you not wear panties today like I asked? I most certainly did not not wear panties today.
not_available Why not? 
not_available It's unhygienic.
not_available What kind of panties did you wear? Something sexy? No, they're not sexy.
not_available They are Fruit of the Loom control top briefs and they come three to a pack for $15 at Target.
not_available I want you to go into the bathroom and take them off 
not_available and then hide them someplace in my office.
not_available I will not.
not_available And I wish you'd stop talking to me that way.
not_available You don't like when I talk dirty? I didn't say that.
not_available I don't like it here at work.
not_available When I was shopping today, this total stranger felt me up.
not_available That's irritating.
not_available No, it was really hot.
not_available He was giving me the eye so I went over and stood right next to him, 
like "What are you gonna do about it, pal?" And he puts his hand on my ass very tentatively.
not_available I know, it was so polite.
not_available So I took his hand and I just put it inside me.
not_available I mean, if you're gonna do it, do it.
not_available Wow! Does this mean you have maybe some mixed feelings about marrying Nate? No.
not_available Seriously, that's not it at all.
not_available I think it's just natural biological drive at work.
not_available The need to sample as diverse a selection of people as possible before settling down with one mate.
not_available It's normal.
not_available Anyway, I got another chapter out of it.
not_available Do you know where the jaundice solution is? Mrs.
not_available Doyle's looking very yellow.
not_available It's back
not_available ordered.
not_available Use the ColorGuard.
not_available 10 ounces a gallon.
not_available Take a little break.
not_available Here, have some eggnog.
not_available This isn't eggnog.
not_available It's whiskey.
not_available Whiskey? It's rum, my boy.
not_available The drink of holidays.
not_available You know, when you were little, you always wanted to leave milk and cookies out on the tray for Santa Claus.
not_available Remember? Yeah.
not_available And you used to laugh and say, "What Santa really needs is a shot." And I was right.
not_available I always thought you meant a shot, like a shot of penicillin.
not_available I should 
not_available David, it's Christmas.
not_available Come on.
not_available Spend a little time among the living.
not_available Sit down with your pop and tell me what you want for Christmas.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Doyle's viewing's at 4:00.
not_available Mom said she might have a special guest for dinner.
not_available All right.
not_available If he's anything like her past special guests he's a 24yearold Venezuelan pool boy who makes up for his lack in English by being fluent in the language of power
not_available fucking.
not_available I'll try not to get into a conversation with him.
not_available Hey, Bren, hold on just a sec.
not_available Do you remember what happened a year ago today? Oh, God, I'm sorry, your father No, that's not what I'm talking about.
not_available It's our anniversary.
not_available Oh, my God! Of course.
not_available It's hard to believe it's only a year ago that we met.
not_available Yeah, it feels like 20 years.
not_available If you don't want to be with me, then don't, all right? Nate, I'm kidding.
not_available Come on.
not_available Of course I want to be with you.
not_available I love you.
not_available Then why do you treat me like shit all the time? Because I had a really fucked
not_available up life and I use sarcasm to hide how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.
not_available Come on.
not_available Jesus, you know that.
not_available Happy anniversary.
not_available I know I already got you another ring, but I can't believe you It was my grandmother's.
not_available It didn't cost me anything.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I love you.
not_available Well, it's about time.
not_available Hey, Mom, Merry Christmas.
not_available Merry Christmas to you.
not_available Nate, Merry Christmas.
not_available I know there's some mistletoe around here some place, God damn it! What's wrong, honey? You look like shit.
not_available Enjoying a Scotch, Mom? 
not_available Not nearly enough.
not_available Sweetheart, would you freshen up my drink? Come on, give your sister a big kiss.
not_available I told you we were having a special guest.
not_available Yes.
not_available I just didn't expect 
not_available To see your crazy brother.
not_available Sure.
not_available Don't worry they pumped enough electricity through me to light up the Eastern Seaboard.
not_available Kidding.
not_available I'm sorry, Bren.
not_available Come on, lighten up.
not_available It's Christmas.
not_available Come on, go get me another drink.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mom, what the hell is he doing here? I busted him out for Christmas.
not_available You could've warned me.
not_available Warned you? You need to be warned about seeing your own brother? Ever since he came at me with a knife? Yeah.
not_available Okay, so how long is he out for? For good.
not_available He's living with me now.
not_available So I guess you're happy to be home.
not_available Happy is a concept I try not to buy into.
not_available It just gets me into trouble.
not_available Listen, Nate I'm really sorry about everything that happened.
not_available I know I have to take responsibility for what I did but I was sick.
not_available And now you're not? I'm still sick.
not_available I'll always be sick.
not_available Just the cards I was dealt.
not_available I can manage it through medication, for the most part but it's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life.
not_available It's not up to me.
not_available Merry Christmas! We can't stay long because my mother's watching the kids.
not_available Ramon, you shaved.
not_available You look so young.
not_available We brought some presents for the boys.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're so sweet.
not_available Just little things.
not_available Where are they? Augusto's asleep.
not_available Julio's in the den watching The Grinch for about the thousandth time.
not_available I'll just put these under the tree.
not_available Oh, please! You haven't gotten that wall fixed yet? Ramon would have had it finished by now.
not_available What possessed you to make fig pudding? It sounded Christmassy.
not_available Well, it looks like throw up.
not_available None of it was very good.
not_available Be nice.
not_available Make better stuff.
not_available How about if we sing some Christmas carols? Come on, I got a CD.
not_available We can all sing along to it.
not_available You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available Come on, we'll scare the neighbors.
not_available Okay, you two sing songs.
not_available I'm gonna go get a Ding Dong and watch The Simpsons.
not_available Motherfuck! 
not_available Keith, relax.
not_available I just wanted her to have a good Christmas, you know? After everything that she's been through.
not_available You've been through a lot yourself lately.
not_available You can afford to cut yourself some slack.
not_available It doesn't mean you're a doormat.
not_available Are you sleeping any better? 
not_available Not really.
not_available I was reading an article on post
not_available traumatic stress I'm not suffering from anything, David.
not_available What happened, happened.
not_available It's a part of my job.
not_available Let's just move on.
not_available Why don't you and Taylor come to my house for Christmas dinner tomorrow? Why? 
not_available Because I'd like for you to be there.
not_available Then why'd you wait until the night before to ask me? Because my mom didn't bring it up until yesterday.
not_available Your mother.
not_available Jesus, Keith, all I did was invite you over for Christmas dinner.
not_available I don't think Taylor's quite ready for something like this yet.
not_available Are you sure Taylor's the one who's not ready? Just help me pick out a few poinsettias, and we can be on our way to church.
not_available Dear God! What happened? Oh, my goodness! 
not_available Hello, Ruthie.
not_available Were you robbed? Did they hurt you? 
not_available I am hurt, yes.
not_available Where are you hurt? There was fight.
not_available They break my legs.
not_available We have to get you to the hospital.
not_available Claire, back the car up to the door.
not_available Mom? You should take that down.
not_available No.
not_available I love it.
not_available You look so mysterious.
not_available It's kind of ghoulish.
not_available I don't like to think of myself in that way anymore.
not_available Then you'll just have to take a new picture for me of how you feel now.
not_available I know! You should take Brenda and Nate's wedding photos.
not_available We're engaged.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available That is so great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I love it when people who really should get married do.
not_available It doesn't happen that often, you know.
not_available Now, you just hush.
not_available It's true.
not_available I can't believe she got Billy out of the hospital so she would not have to spend Christmas alone.
not_available Fucking evil bitch.
not_available He's not ready.
not_available Really? I thought he actually seemed pretty okay.
not_available He's not okay.
not_available He's sick, and nobody wants to deal with it.
not_available Which is the way it's always fucking been! I'm not gonna do it anymore.
not_available I've been a fucking nursemaid more than enough for one lifetime.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available You're bashful.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I don't see nothing.
not_available Good morning, dear.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thank you, Ruthie.
not_available You haven't taken your painkillers.
not_available I hate pills.
not_available They make me crazy.
not_available Shut up and take them.
not_available Shouldn't he be in the hospital? We were there half the night waiting for a doctor after you left.
not_available This is so hot! 
not_available Merry Christmas, everybody.
not_available He's gonna be here eight weeks? You've gotta be kidding me.
not_available That's how long he has to stay off his legs.
not_available Mom, surely there's a better arrangement.
not_available He has two broken legs.
not_available What was I supposed to do with him? He doesn't even have insurance.
not_available Then who's paying for all 
not_available I am.
not_available David, later this afternoon, I want you to lift Nikolai into his wheelchair.
not_available There was that time we was coming down the big hill at Lone Pine.
not_available I hit a patch of ice and went down.
not_available Jesse comes barreling around that hairpin.
not_available He seen me there in the middle of the road.
not_available And instead of running me over he laid his bike down and slid it into a bunch of trees.
not_available He busted out his teeth.
not_available 'Cause that's just the kind of man that he was.
not_available Afucking
not_available men.
not_available He was a fine friend and a good husband.
not_available "From Jay Leno." Sure, he always sends flowers.
not_available Never comes.
not_available This world's a lot worse off without him.
not_available The InN
not_available Out truck's out back.
not_available We're gonna put on Jesse's favorite song and folks can help themselves to some grub.
not_available My brother lives up there, which I've always been jealous of.
not_available Once, when I was in junior high my dad was embalming someone in the basement.
not_available And the plumbing got backed up and blood started squirting out of this hose.
not_available It was like a scene from The Shining.
not_available Nasty.
not_available It was the first time I really thought about what they did down there.
not_available Hello.
not_available Mom, this is Toby.
not_available Very nice to meet you, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available You, too, Toby.
not_available Thank you for joining us today.
not_available Thank you for having me.
not_available Claire, surely that's not what you're planning to wear for Christmas dinner? No, I've got my Laura Bush pantsuit on underneath.
not_available I didn't want to get it dirty.
not_available Please, come in.
not_available So, what did you get me for Christmas? Who the fuck lives in Reseda? 
not_available So, what did you get me for Christmas? Why are you even asking me? You've barely ever spoken to me.
not_available Who else is gonna be there? I always wanted a silk smoking jacket.
not_available Dad, I'm on the phone.
not_available Something really garish with big embroidered peacocks.
not_available Look, I've gotta go.
not_available Just e
not_available mail me directions.
not_available Maybe I'll show up and maybe I won't.
not_available God, can't a person have a phone conversation around here? Somebody special, huh? What's his name? 
not_available Gabriel.
not_available Trust me, he's not that special.
not_available Don't waste your time with him, kitten.
not_available Because you deserve somebody special.
not_available Right.
not_available You wanna go with me later to the airport and pick up your big brother? I can't.
not_available I've got last
not_available minute shopping to do Could you try to be home for dinner? Because we hardly ever have the whole family together, and it's Merry Christmas.
not_available What's going on in here? 
not_available Biker funeral.
not_available Can't we stay down here? 
not_available Very funny.
not_available Hey, Pete.
not_available We're about to head upstairs and have our Christmas dinner.
not_available So? You've been here all day 
not_available Probably gonna be here all night.
not_available You go on and eat.
not_available We don't need you.
not_available It'll be fun.
not_available Nikolai's out of his mind on Percodan.
not_available Well, I think that's everything.
not_available Dinner looks amazing, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Thank you, Toby.
not_available Probably one of the bikers looking for the bathroom.
not_available Look who's here.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, Keith.
not_available You made it! 
not_available Merry Christmas, everyone.
not_available I hope it's okay that we came by.
not_available Of course it's okay.
not_available We're so happy you could join us.
not_available Does everyone know Taylor? Your mom hasn't looked at me since she saw the ring.
not_available Have some more wine.
not_available Hey, Keith.
not_available Hey, Taylor.
not_available That's a skinny turkey.
not_available It's a goose.
not_available This is lovely.
not_available We're all here together.
not_available Keith, would you say grace for us? Yeah, sure.
not_available Lord, for food in a world where many walk in hunger for faith in a world where many walk in fear and for friends in a world where many walk alone we give you thanks, O Lord, on this Christmas Day.
not_available Amen.
not_available That was lovely, Keith.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here you go, Nikolai.
not_available Your mom will always hate me.
not_available That's because you're a woman trying to steal her baby.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Toby seems nice.
not_available Yes, Toby's very nice.
not_available Not your type, huh? A deranged psychopath? No, I guess he isn't.
not_available Billy told me once that he got so used to living with crazy people that when he was sharing a room with a guy who thought he was Pinocchio the only thing that seemed weird about it was that the guy pronounced it "Pinochio." So you've been talking to Billy? Yeah, mostly through e
not_available mail.
not_available He's really funny.
not_available Isn't he? I've got a huge headache.
not_available Can we go home now? Bren, I'm working.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available Come home when you can, okay? I promise.
not_available Where do you keep your toilet plunger? Morning, Mr.
not_available F.
not_available Rico, what are you doing here? It's Christmas Eve.
not_available Yeah, I have to do Mrs.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Her viewing is this afternoon.
not_available Let David take care of it.
not_available No, she's pretty simple.
not_available That's why I want David to do her.
not_available I like to feed him the slow pitches, if you know what I mean.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm serious, kiddo.
not_available Get the hell out of here.
not_available Go home.
not_available Spend the day with the little one.
not_available They grow up so fast, you gotta enjoy it while it lasts.
not_available Go on.
not_available Thanks, Mr.
not_available F.
not_available You have a merry Christmas.
not_available I intend to.
not_available She took my kids back to her mothers'.
not_available What? You couldn't keep your fucking mouth shut.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available Merry fucking Christmas, Rico.
not_available Are you okay? Baby? 
not_available You fucking told her? I had to.
not_available I couldn't even look her in the eye.
not_available She was so happy yesterday.
not_available She told me she got him a Rolex watch.
not_available She has a right to know.
not_available I told you not to fucking tell her! I'm sorry.
not_available I had to! Fucking homo! Fucking fuck! They must not like that dead man too much.
not_available Why do you say that? Because they're all so happy he's dead.
not_available I think it's about time we get you home.
not_available No, but it's Christmas, and I want to watch the funeral.
not_available Too bad.
not_available I'm really glad you came.
not_available Why don't you come back with us? I could make some hot chocolate.
not_available I got a present or two that I didn't want you to open in mixed company.
not_available Let me talk to Nate.
not_available I'll see if we can wrap this up.
not_available I think we should start moving them out.
not_available No, it's Christmas.
not_available Keith asked if I wanted to go with him.
not_available Go.
not_available I've got everything under control.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Merry Christmas, Nate.
not_available You, too.
not_available What do you say we get out of here? 
not_available You're not having fun? No.
not_available This is like every party my parents have, only with better music.
not_available Where do you want to go? We could drive around Hancock Park and look at the Christmas lights.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Not without a carton of eggs.
not_available Why are you so hostile? 
not_available I'm not hostile.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available You act like you're incredibly put out by, I don't know, being alive.
not_available Maybe you think that's cool, but really it's just irritating.
not_available Okay, thanks for the input, which is totally irrelevant, but Apparently you need to feel all superior or something.
not_available I mean, if you just take a look at your life you really don't have that much to be angry about.
not_available You don't know anything about my life.
not_available Yeah, and I'm not really sure I want to considering how you like to shit all over everything.
not_available You know what? I fully support your little desire to have a life you'd see on Nickelodeon but I don't support you being a judgmental dick.
not_available Maybe I should just go.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Okay.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'm glad I could spend one last Christmas with Jesse.
not_available He was a crazy son of a bitch, but I sure loved him.
not_available I can tell.
not_available God, did he know how to live! It was full throttle all the way.
not_available We met in Sturgis, back in '78.
not_available I was sitting at The Broken Spoke with the biggest badass in town.
not_available But Jesse he had some balls on him.
not_available He walked right up to me, I'll never forget it, and he 
said "If I don't ask you to take a ride with me I'll regret it the rest of my life." And that ride lasted 23 years.
not_available He always said his two favorite things were riding his hog and riding me.
not_available And he treated us both like queens.
not_available You're probably wishing he treated himself as carefully.
not_available Honey, it just wasn't in his blood.
not_available If he were a careful man, he might have lived longer but would he have enjoyed his life as much? Would I have enjoyed his life as much? I had a bike in high school.
not_available Had it for about a week before I wiped out.
not_available Just fucked it up royally.
not_available I still have a pin in my foot.
not_available I never got back on a bike after that.
not_available I could never give it up.
not_available No way.
not_available Closest thing to flying without leaving the ground.
not_available Sometimes I fool myself into thinking I've lived my life to the fullest.
not_available But compared to you and Jesse I think I've got a lot to learn.
not_available Honey, if I were a few years younger I'd be willing to teach you.
not_available I just might let you.
not_available Jesse always said you gotta live every day like you might die tomorrow.
not_available 'Cause you know what? 
not_available You just might.
not_available Here's a glass of water.
not_available I couldn't find a bell.
not_available So if you need me during the night, just yell very loudly.
not_available I will be fine.
not_available Did you call the police yet to file a report? No, I will do that later.
not_available I'll put this where you can reach it.
not_available I don't like for you to do this.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available You have two broken legs, and you need someone to take care of you.
not_available And I'm happy to do it, so stop making a fuss.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available What I told you before.
not_available That you are beautiful.
not_available Stop it.
not_available I had the swirl in the dip just right.
not_available Just one for the road.
not_available Airport traffic's gonna be murder.
not_available Then you should get going.
not_available All right.
not_available I want to stay up and play with what Santa Claus brought me.
not_available Give it up, Taylor.
not_available I could make you guys a cupcake with my Easy
not_available Bake oven.
not_available He's a cop.
not_available He doesn't take bribes.
not_available Merry Christmas, baby.
not_available Mama! I drove all day long just so I could be here.
not_available That's how much your mama loves you.
not_available I love you, too, Mama.
not_available I knew you'd come.
not_available Billy didn't call or e
not_available mail me all day.
not_available So? So, you know, it's Christmas.
not_available You didn't exactly give him a warm greeting last night.
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available If he'd written me, told me he'd be there I wouldn't have been so freaked out by the whole thing.
not_available Do you ever call or email him? Yeah, I e
not_available mailed him in the hospital last summer but he never wrote back.
not_available He e
not_available mails Claire all the time.
not_available What? Yeah, even while we were there, she was running off to check her mail.
not_available Wait, when did this start? Did you bring any of that reindeer cake? 
not_available I asked you a question.
not_available I don't know.
not_available She just told me tonight.
not_available I don't want Billy having anything to do with Claire, you understand that? Why not? You said that he was okay.
not_available He's okay enough to walk down the street without a leash but he's not okay enough to be near my sister who we both know has this fucked
not_available up attraction to sociopaths.
not_available Don't tell me 
not_available I am telling you.
not_available He is your brother! You keep him away.
not_available And if you don't, I swear to God, I will! What are you gonna do, Nate? Challenge him to a duel? Brenda, would you knock it the fuck off? Why don't you wear a cowboy cap 
not_available Would you fucking listen to me? Will you shut the fuck up? Fuck.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's not my fault.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Shit.
not_available Yeah? I think I'm gonna have Shit.
not_available Nate, look at me! Get off! Get the fuck off! I'm fine! Nate, it's okay.
not_available What was that? So what are you taking for it? Dilantin.
not_available It's an anti
not_available epileptic.
not_available It's supposed to control the seizures.
not_available I thought it did, until tonight.
not_available We'll talk to your doctor.
not_available Maybe we can switch you to something stronger.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I won't let anything happen to you.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about this? I didn't want to be a burden.
not_available You'll never be a burden.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Hi.
not_available Marilyn Johnson left that for you.
not_available She had a belt buckle with a big skull on it.
not_available I thought that was odd.
