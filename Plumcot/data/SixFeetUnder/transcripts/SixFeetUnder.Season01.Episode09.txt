
not_available Yo, what's up? You get it? No, I didn't get anything.
not_available I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
not_available Anthony, go play in Mom's room.
not_available Why? Because I said so, you little shit.
not_available Go! Get up, come on.
not_available You suck! Kid's got so much major attitude.
not_available Six years old and he's already a hard
not_available ass.
not_available You can get more of this stuff? How much? How much money do you have? 
not_available Oh, like I'm a fucking loaded.
not_available Hey, Bennett and I are going to that record release party tonight.
not_available And then there's an after
not_available hours in Hollywood.
not_available No, dude, I fucking hate that shit.
not_available It's always a bunch of whacked
not_available out faggot tweakers shoving glow sticks in your eyes.
not_available It's at Sin Sin.
not_available Great, whacked
not_available out Asian tweakers.
not_available That club's weak, dude.
not_available Anthony? An Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Fuck! I gotta get out of here.
not_available What? 
not_available I gotta get that shit out of here.
not_available Oh, fuck.
not_available Anthony? Morning.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you mad at me about now? I'm busy, all right? My workload has doubled since Federico's gone.
not_available You can't expect me to engage you in small talk just to make you feel better.
not_available You flunked the licensing test.
not_available Did you think I didn't know? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available You didn't apply yourself.
not_available You think this is something people do as a last resort and therefore it can't be that difficult.
not_available I feel bad.
not_available You wanna make it worse? I don't care what you feel 
not_available Bullshit.
not_available You like it when I feel bad because misery loves company.
not_available How'd he die? 
not_available Heart attack.
not_available Fell down a flight of stairs, dead when he hit the bottom.
not_available His nose supposed to look like that? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available I have to finish embalming him before I can start on anything cosmetic.
not_available I can deal with whoever it is.
not_available Unless it's a walk
not_available in.
not_available You are choosing to be the victim here.
not_available I could handle an intake and you know it.
not_available Ladies, teacup chain.
not_available Good.
not_available And walk to the middle and back.
not_available All right, very good.
not_available Very good, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available So we'll see you all at the same time next week, okay? Be safe getting home.
not_available Morning, folks.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Goddamn it, why hasn't anyone answered the door? Where is Mom? Okay, if you haven't slept with that guy yet, would you start? Because I think it would do you a world of good.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available Do what? 
not_available Watch me like that.
not_available I can't help it.
not_available You're beautiful.
not_available Oh, for heaven's sake.
not_available I want to go camping again.
not_available Then go camping.
not_available With you.
not_available I've got a job now, Hiram.
not_available I can't just up and leave whenever I feel like it.
not_available Spring is a very busy time of the year.
not_available It's our anniversary tomorrow.
not_available The first time we went camping was two years ago tomorrow.
not_available We don't have anniversaries.
not_available I never agreed to anniversaries.
not_available Just you and me alone in the woods.
not_available Naked under the stars.
not_available Just like it was at the beginning.
not_available Tomorrow is such short notice.
not_available I can't promise anything.
not_available But I'll try.
not_available My mom wants to know how quickly we can do this.
not_available Well, I'd suggest a viewing in two days to allow proper restoration.
not_available Viewing? For friends, family.
not_available You can make it as small or as large as you wish.
not_available No, I can't see him in a box.
not_available I can't.
not_available All right.
not_available Ms.
not_available Dimas, seeing your son before you bury him might help you to let go.
not_available No, I don't want to see him! Of course.
not_available We'll arrange for a closed
not_available casket ceremony.
not_available Will three days give you enough time? Yeah, that's gonna be fine.
not_available Nate will show you to the door.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What happened? A 6year
not_available old found a gun and was playing with it.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They gave me this at the hospital.
not_available It's some sort of receipt.
not_available I don't know I don't know if you need it, but What was he doing here? 
not_available Gabe.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available My brother just told me.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I didn't know where else to go.
not_available My grandmother's funeral was here.
not_available Yeah, of course.
not_available My mom's waiting for me to unlock the car.
not_available I thought we were supposed to encourage people to have a viewing.
not_available Well, sometimes people don't want that.
not_available Well, sometimes you don't want to work any harder.
not_available When faced with the option of not having to restore a child's head that's been blown to bits, yeah, I don't want to do that.
not_available Do you? We can't force someone to do something they're not ready to do because we think it's the right thing.
not_available Because it will make us feel better.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Roses are if you love somebody, right? Roses are the classic choice, but other flowers could achieve the same effect.
not_available What if you were gonna ask her to marry you? Oh, how lovely.
not_available Well, roses would be the perfect choice.
not_available But she turned out to be a cheating coward and ran off with some shithead that she met at traffic school.
not_available What color would you give a coward? 
not_available Yellow.
not_available Yellow.
not_available Great.
not_available Twelve dozen yellow roses sent to this address, please.
not_available What would you like the card to say? 
not_available "Fuck you, cunt." I think it would be more personal if you write that.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have to take the day off tomorrow and Saturday.
not_available Why? I was supposed to have plans with a friend and I forgot.
not_available Is it with that man? The one with the funny little car that picks you up? It's an electric car and it's very good for the environment.
not_available Why are you laughing? 
not_available Because you are not.
not_available You like this man? 
not_available Can I have the days off or not? Take! Go, I don't care.
not_available We will miss you.
not_available Beep, beep.
not_available Beep, beep.
not_available Brenda? 
not_available Hey there.
not_available I'll be right out.
not_available I just got out of the shower.
not_available How was work? 
not_available It sucked.
not_available Like I figured, I failed that funeral director's test.
not_available There was this intake meeting this morning I totally fucked up.
not_available And I just picked up a dead All in all, it's been a pretty bad day.
not_available Goddamn it! Sometimes I feel like I don't have any fucking idea what I'm doing.
not_available It's like I made this bullshit decision to go into this business for all the wrong reasons and now it's too late.
not_available It's never too late.
not_available Jesus, Billy.
not_available What, do you live here now? No, Brenda just gave me a shiatsu.
not_available I've been kind of tense lately.
not_available So Bad day? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, I've had my share of those.
not_available Well, I don't doubt that.
not_available I don't really feel like cooking, so you guys decide what we're having delivered.
not_available That shit was all over the news.
not_available Six years old, right? Fuck! Some people should just not be allowed to have kids.
not_available She just sat there like a ghost.
not_available Just like she'd been erased.
not_available I felt so fucking helpless.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available That poor woman.
not_available There's a tribe in Nigeria that throws a dead baby's body into the bush because they believe if buried the dead infant would offend the earth gods which bring fertility and food.
not_available The Chinese consider the death of a child a bad death.
not_available The parents and grandparents aren't expected to go to the funeral.
not_available Or the Balinese mother who's counseled to be cheerful after her infant's death because grief makes one vulnerable to illness and malevolent demons.
not_available Well, that was informative.
not_available Yeah, I thought it'd be good to read up on your boyfriend's line of work.
not_available What a man does is Well, it's who he is.
not_available Right, Nate? Yeah.
not_available A man should know the history of his chosen profession if he expects to be anything but an amateur.
not_available So I'm an amateur.
not_available I prefer the term dilettante.
not_available And what are you, Billy? Running around with your camera, taking pictures of people's lives? Boys.
not_available You think knowing a bunch of arcane National Geographic shit is gonna help me cope with a 6year
not_available old who shot himself in the head? There are plenty of places in the world where a kid dying is pretty common.
not_available But we can't deal with it, because a dead child is the greatest failure of a culture that believes it's reversed the order of nature.
not_available This was an accident.
not_available This wasn't nature.
not_available You know what I find interesting? If you lose a spouse, you're called a widow or a widower.
not_available If you're a child and you lose your parents, then you're an orphan.
not_available But what's the word to describe a parent who loses a child? I guess that's just too fucking awful to even have a name.
not_available I was worried you weren't gonna show.
not_available I just got tied up at work.
not_available Believe me, I need this after the day I had.
not_available This ought to help.
not_available Oh, what is it? 
not_available X.
not_available Ecstasy.
not_available You ever done it? 
not_available No, can't say that I have.
not_available You're gonna love it.
not_available Are you gonna take one too? 
not_available I'm already there.
not_available Let's dance.
not_available I'm not a very good dancer.
not_available You will be.
not_available David.
not_available David.
not_available Here, you gotta keep drinking this.
not_available She was only 63.
not_available That's so young.
not_available Isn't that young? Have you thought about what kind of funeral you'd like for your mother? It has to be beautiful.
not_available It has to be beautiful.
not_available Well, we can offer you a wide variety of services ranging from simple to more formal to To anything you might need.
not_available Yes, anything at all.
not_available It's a good thing I was there, you know? I mean, Gabe was so wrecked I was the one who had to trash his weed.
not_available Seriously, if the police found that shit, it'd be way worse, you know? 
not_available Hey, Andy.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's Gabe? 
not_available He's okay, I guess.
not_available Well, have you talked to him? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Well, are you gonna see him later? I don't know.
not_available It's real weird over there.
not_available The mother's, like, all freaked.
not_available Yeah, but what about Gabe? Look, Morticia, I'm not interfering.
not_available It's too much to get into, you know? 
not_available I thought you were his friend.
not_available Why don't you fuck off, bitch? If you're so worried, why don't you go fuck him again? That'll cheer him up.
not_available Nice, that's nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available By the way, Parker told me how one of your testicles is, like freakishly small, like a peanut.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available That's not true.
not_available For later.
not_available You have a headache, dear? 
not_available Yeah, I thought I did.
not_available I'm throwing in a load of laundry if you need some done.
not_available By the way, I'm going camping with Hiram this weekend.
not_available I'm leaving this afternoon.
not_available Great.
not_available I'm doing whites first.
not_available Fuck.
not_available David, David.
not_available David.
not_available David? David! David? Are you all right? You look pale.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available It's just a headache, that's all.
not_available Okay, you're in this, like, total danger zone.
not_available Gabe Dimas is a dick.
not_available I'm sorry his brother's dead, but don't think that means he's not a dick.
not_available I just haven't seen him around, so I was worried.
not_available If you hook up with him now, it's gonna be like total emotional rape.
not_available Whatever he feels for you is gonna be wrapped up in some guilt
not_available grief fuckfest.
not_available You better stay away from that shit.
not_available I'm not kidding.
not_available So you failed a test.
not_available Big whoop.
not_available You want to be helpful to the people that walk in through your door so you have to be one of those people.
not_available Okay.
not_available I chose three funeral homes from the yellow pages at random.
not_available I've always felt an uncontrolled sample group provides more reliable data.
not_available What, you want us to pretend to be purchasing a funeral? Look up the first address.
not_available I think it's in Sherman Oaks.
not_available Come on, it'll be fun.
not_available Hello? Gabe? Is anybody home? Oh, Mrs.
not_available Dimas, I'm sorry.
not_available The door was open.
not_available Is Gabe around? 
not_available We can still leave.
not_available Why? What are you afraid of? Humiliating myself, wasting someone's valuable time.
not_available Don't be so left
not_available brained.
not_available I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available Now, how can I help? It's my parents.
not_available They were killed this morning in an accident.
not_available I'm terribly sorry.
not_available It was a A helicopter went down and there was an explosion.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available It's not right.
not_available They were in the prime of their lives.
not_available Everybody dies.
not_available We all die.
not_available Everything we ever care about will disappear.
not_available So, what's the fucking point of living? Can I suggest matching caskets? That's it? That's what you have to offer me in my time of grief? Merchandise? We have nothing to learn here.
not_available Water purifier.
not_available Rope.
not_available Bear bell.
not_available Flashlight.
not_available Toilet paper.
not_available And, yes, it's biodegradable.
not_available Bird caller.
not_available Binoculars.
not_available I'm sure you have everything.
not_available I know you have everything.
not_available You always do.
not_available It wouldn't be fun to get up there and realize we forgot the matches, would it? Or the champagne.
not_available Hiram, that's just decadent.
not_available Was it expensive? We shouldn't waste it.
not_available Waste it? It's our anniversary.
not_available Claire, you're home early.
not_available You remember Hiram.
not_available Hi.
not_available How was school? 
not_available I have a headache.
not_available Hiram and I are going camping.
not_available Your dinner's in the refrigerator and I'll be back tomorrow.
not_available It's a very beautiful time of the year.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, you two have fun.
not_available We should probably leave if we want to beat the rush
not_available hour traffic.
not_available Ruth? Honey, what's wrong? My children don't need me anymore.
not_available Let's think of this as a celebration of your uncle's life.
not_available Now, the Titan is an excellent choice for a distinguished gentleman.
not_available It's solid mahogany.
not_available It's hand
not_available finished.
not_available Burlwood and nickel accents.
not_available And Grace Field Grace Field is a lovely place for interment.
not_available It's serene.
not_available It's pastoral.
not_available How much? Well, after you sign the contract, we take care of everything.
not_available There's no worry.
not_available There's no pain.
not_available How much? It comes to just under $20,000.
not_available You're charging $ 12,000 for the Titan? What is that, like a 300 percent markup? I could come down to 10.
not_available And Grace Field is in between a power station and a freeway.
not_available There are nicer cemeteries.
not_available But they're just a little bit more expensive.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available We'll try and find somewhere that doesn't just want to swindle us.
not_available Nice tie.
not_available This business is a total racket.
not_available What business isn't? You know, sometimes I wish I could be this completely selfish asshole that didn't give a shit about anything and I could just work at some mindless job that paid me a fuckload of money.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available It would make my life a lot easier.
not_available You don't want your life to be easy.
not_available Gabe? Hi.
not_available I didn't know if anybody was home.
not_available Did you ring the bell? I just I came by to drop off this stuff.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's my brother's soccer clothes.
not_available I thought that he might like to get buried in them.
not_available You think that's okay? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I think that's really nice.
not_available I went to your house.
not_available You see my mom? Yeah.
not_available Just like a zombie.
not_available Just sits there.
not_available I don't know why she blames herself.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I killed him.
not_available Gabe, no.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available It wouldn't have happened if I'd been watching him.
not_available My mom can't even find Anthony's dad to tell him what happened.
not_available Probably moved.
not_available We haven't seen him in, like, two years.
not_available Oh, that sucks.
not_available He's a fucking drunken dipshit.
not_available He used to kick my ass just to prove he could.
not_available You know when people would call you those things like "cemetery girl" and "Vampira"? Yeah.
not_available I never thought that was funny.
not_available I should go.
not_available Would you just make sure your brother gets these? Of course.
not_available Hey, look.
not_available If you need anything, like to talk or something, you can call me.
not_available All right.
not_available Where do you want to hang the food? 
not_available Can't it wait till after dinner? I've already taken out what we're going to eat.
not_available I'd rather not risk it.
not_available I'm sorry it's inconvenient but would you prefer we were mauled in our sleep by bears? Ruth? You need to relax.
not_available Hello, I'm Rosemary.
not_available How can I help you? Hi.
not_available I need to make arrangements for a funeral.
not_available All right.
not_available My wife's in the restroom.
not_available She'll be out in a minute.
not_available Can I ask who the funeral is for? 
not_available It's for me.
not_available Bet you don't get too many people shopping for their own funeral.
not_available It happens.
not_available Most people who know they're going to die want to have a say.
not_available Planning it with your husband could be a meaningful process for you both.
not_available Is it cancer? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's everywhere.
not_available Liver now.
not_available Brenda.
not_available My husband hates me doing this.
not_available He wants me to spend this time doing things I always dreamed of but never gave myself permission to Pardon me.
not_available The coughing blood and pissing needles thing kind of gets in the way.
not_available He just wants you to be happy.
not_available He just doesn't want me to die.
not_available Okay, it's just too fucked up, Brenda.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available I can't.
not_available He's not ready.
not_available It's hard for him.
not_available Probably harder than it is for you.
not_available That was the most fucked up thing you've ever done to me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That was like the shit you pulled on those doctors to get a rise out of them.
not_available Are you gonna start barking at me? 
not_available I might.
not_available What you did just now was not funny! 
not_available Well, it wasn't meant to be.
not_available You counsel people about death every day, Nate when death is what you're most afraid of.
not_available What's wrong with this picture? 
not_available Of course I'm afraid of it.
not_available What sane person isn't? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available Yeah, well, I said, what sane person.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, what's up? 
not_available Nothing, I just I just wanted to talk to somebody.
not_available What are you doing tonight? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What are you doing? You.
not_available Shit.
not_available Fuck! Shit.
not_available What are you looking for? 
not_available Aspirin.
not_available I know there was a bottle of aspirin in here.
not_available Yeah, I took some earlier.
not_available You did? Are you okay? Yeah, why? You found it, didn't you? You found it and kept it for yourself.
not_available What's going on with you? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You're wearing my shirt.
not_available Fuck! 
not_available What is this, like a date? Sort of.
not_available No way, you're dating the squaredancing guy? 
not_available Weird.
not_available Weird why? No, I get it.
not_available He's hot in a kind of generic, Banana Republic kind of way.
not_available Claire, I really need that aspirin bottle.
not_available David, I really don't have it.
not_available What was in there? 
not_available He gave me some pills.
not_available Now I'll have to say, "Sorry, I lost them because I'm this old
not_available guy geek and I'm completely uncool in this world in which you seem to thrive you perfect distillation of human evolution." Okay, is this split personality thing like, something that happens when Mom goes out of town? Because I like you like this way better.
not_available Dinner was delicious.
not_available Food just tastes better outdoors.
not_available Remember what we ate the first time we went camping? No.
not_available Pork chops with fire
not_available roasted vegetables.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available The sky was so clear that night.
not_available Just like tonight.
not_available Did you know you're not supposed to go camping if you're menstruating? What? 
not_available It's true.
not_available My husband buried a young woman once.
not_available She went on a camping trip.
not_available She was menstruating.
not_available A bear smelled the blood and killed her in her sleeping bag.
not_available Killed one of her friends too.
not_available But we only buried her.
not_available Not the friend.
not_available I'm glad we're seeing each other again.
not_available Me too.
not_available It's nice.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I've got a little bit of a headache.
not_available I'm sorry I forgot those pills.
not_available That's no big deal.
not_available You can be my drug tonight.
not_available So, what's with the guy who's been staring at you since we got here? Shit! That's Keith.
not_available We dated.
not_available He's pretty hot.
not_available You guys still friends? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Why not? I'm friends with my exes.
not_available Why doesn't that surprise me? He's coming over.
not_available Is he into three
not_available ways? He's a cop, so don't mention the drugs or anything.
not_available Sure, Dad.
not_available David.
not_available Keith, hi.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Good.
not_available It's going good.
not_available This is the last place I'd ever expect to see you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it was Kurt's idea.
not_available Kurt, this is Keith.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Kurt teaches square dancing.
not_available Tried to get David to go dancing when we were together.
not_available Told me he didn't even like to dance.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Eddie, this is David and 
not_available Kurt.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available So how'd you guys meet? 
not_available Eddie's an EMT.
not_available Met on the job.
not_available Newlyweds in a car crash.
not_available He saved the bride right in front of me.
not_available What about the groom? 
not_available Didn't make it.
not_available The bride had eternity with the man she loved right in front of her then you go save her and she ends up left behind, alone.
not_available That's one way of looking at it.
not_available Well, it's good to see you.
not_available Yeah, nice meeting you.
not_available You too.
not_available Well, of course he's dating Mr.
not_available Fucking Super Guy ER.
not_available I bet they have great sex, I mean, with the uniforms and all.
not_available I dated a cop once.
not_available Total control freak.
not_available Now, firemen on the other hand Is dating an excuse for you to figure out who you wanna be when you grow up? I don't know.
not_available Is dating like an excuse for you to see who you wished you'd been when you were my age? 
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available Why? Come on.
not_available David.
not_available Wait, David.
not_available Look Who was that? 
not_available Just a guy I know.
not_available He wants to go home with us.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Come on, you'll love him.
not_available I promise, he's a total fuck machine.
not_available I said, no.
not_available Why not? Why are you taking this so seriously? Because I'm a serious guy.
not_available I bury people for a living.
not_available Well, that shit's in your head.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available That shit is in my head.
not_available Look, go.
not_available Have fun.
not_available I'm just too I'm sorry that I can't I'm sorry.
not_available Bye.
not_available You really spooked me, Bren.
not_available What? The idea of me dying? Well, yeah.
not_available I will die someday.
not_available We die, Nate.
not_available We all die.
not_available Hello? You certainly took your sweet time getting here.
not_available You'll ruin that shirt.
not_available Who cares? What, you're hitting on me now? Two guys aren't enough, you slut? Oh, dear.
not_available I suppose I owe you an apology.
not_available Why? I'm dead.
not_available Yes, but I was seeing Hiram before you I was gone long before I died.
not_available You'd like Hiram.
not_available He's kind.
not_available He makes me laugh.
not_available I got my money on the florist.
not_available Oh, heavens no, Nathaniel.
not_available The man is a complete savage.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available This is the hearse that was always stalling, isn't it? Remember after that funeral in Malibu for that jazz musician? We broke down on the side of the PCH and we made love in the back.
not_available If this baby could talk.
not_available Nathaniel, what happened to us? We were so in love once.
not_available Life happened to us.
not_available I buried hundreds of people and we watched each other grow old.
not_available But we're not old.
not_available Well, technically speaking I'm as old as I'm ever gonna get.
not_available We were such children when we met.
not_available Then we watched those children disappear.
not_available Damn it! Stalled again.
not_available Won't go forward.
not_available Won't go back.
not_available Well, these can't be helping.
not_available No tears.
not_available I miss what we had.
not_available So find it again.
not_available What a beautiful day.
not_available You should have woken me up.
not_available I thought you could use the sleep after the night we had.
not_available You've never been that passionate with me before.
not_available Thank you for a wonderful night.
not_available Last night? 
not_available You were spectacular.
not_available What? Do I just sit anywhere? 
not_available Wherever you'd like.
not_available Nice suit.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bought it last week.
not_available You need more than one suit to be a funeral director.
not_available No, you need to pass a test first.
not_available You just can't let go of that, can you? 
not_available I failed the first time I took it.
not_available You did not.
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available I fuck up a lot more than you might think.
not_available I fuck up a lot.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available Okay, I guess.
not_available It's just weird.
not_available Why are you being so nice to me? You little bastard! 
not_available Sam, we didn't think you'd show.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available Stop! Leave him alone! I'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck! Okay, everybody calm down.
not_available Probably wasted out of your mind, whacking off! Let my kid shoot himself! You're gonna blame him? Where the fuck were you for the past two years? All right, just take it easy.
not_available Everything all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't worry about it, I'll deal with it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Who the fuck was that little bitch out there? That's my sister.
not_available You should warn her.
not_available Gabriel has been a fuckup his whole life.
not_available When I lived there, he used to drive his mother nuts with all the shit that he'd do.
not_available Staying out all night.
not_available No fucking responsibility.
not_available That's my kid who's dead.
not_available I know.
not_available It was my gun.
not_available I bought it for Vickie.
not_available Because I was gonna leave for a while, you know? Go up north for a job.
not_available Make some extra money.
not_available How could he let something like this happen? It's not right.
not_available It's just not fucking right! Jesus, he was 6! Everybody dies.
not_available Some of us live to be 100, some never make it through the first day.
not_available That's just a fucking fact of nature, pal.
not_available Who the fuck do you think you are? You can punch as many people as you want.
not_available It's not gonna change the fact that boy is dead.
not_available And your chance to be in his life is over.
not_available Did you use that time well or did you just piss it away? And your own fucking life is a ticking clock too.
not_available Everybody's is.
not_available Mom, you're home.
not_available I was worried.
not_available Worried, why? Did you have a good time? 
not_available Oh, David, you must go camping.
not_available It's so spectacular up there right now.
not_available Spring is such a full time.
not_available So much color, so much detail.
not_available And the smells.
not_available It's like nothing else.
not_available And you're okay? No sickness, no headaches? Oh, no.
not_available I had one on the trip but I took some aspirin and it just disappeared.
not_available Yes, well, aspirin is damn good stuff.
not_available How was the service? There was a fight that broke out, but I let Nate take care of it.
not_available I'm glad you boys are working so well together now.
not_available Claire, you look terrible.
not_available Are you not feeling well? I'm just a little wrecked.
not_available We buried my friend's brother today.
not_available He's your friend? I had no idea.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's the foot guy.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Good night.
not_available There's so much you wish you could protect your children from.
not_available Night, Mom.
not_available Night, dear.
