
not_available Oh, whoa.
not_available Shit.
not_available Oh, I know.
not_available You went a little "Showgirls" on me there, not that I'm complaining.
not_available Happy anniversary, baby.
not_available Same time next year? You kidding? I got needs.
not_available I better wake up in the morning with you all over me.
not_available I hope you don't think I'm waiting till morning.
not_available Let's go shower.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available This feels too nice.
not_available Just don't cook yourself.
not_available Honey? Annie, you okay? Annie?! Annie?! Annie?! Oh my God, Annie! I'm really gonna miss you.
not_available This is the first time we've been apart 
not_available for any real length of time.
not_available Not that long.
not_available Keith, three months is a long time.
not_available David, we were split up for like, what, eight months? We weathered that.
not_available Oh God, you're gonna get hit on by really hot guys in every city.
not_available Come on, it's been okay for both of us to have an occasional random fuck here, what's gonna be so different? You're gonna meet some cooler, smarter, hotter guy who's a lot easier to get along with than I am.
not_available I could do that here.
not_available That makes me feel a lot better.
not_available We're gonna be able to buy a fucking house with the money I'm making.
not_available With a pool and a hot tub and a steam shower.
not_available And room for kids.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All of which you'll be sharing with the cooler, smarter, hotter guy you're gonna meet on tour.
not_available Don't you know I ain't looking? I'm settled down.
not_available I found what I want.
not_available Besides, this'll be good for us.
not_available How will this be good for us? lt'll show you you don't have to worry.
not_available C'mon, David, what does it take? Don't be so insecure.
not_available I love you.
not_available I'm not insecure.
not_available If you want me not to do anything while I'm gone, just ask me.
not_available Really? Yeah, as long as you don't do anything either.
not_available Just be safe.
not_available Of course I'm gonna be safe.
not_available I'm safe with everybody but you.
not_available Be extra safe.
not_available Even with blowjobs you have to use a condom.
not_available Excuse me, but did you use a condom with that plumber? But that was different.
not_available We hadn't made up the rules yet.
not_available And no sex with anybody more than once.
not_available We'll see about that.
not_available Keith.
not_available David.
not_available There's my car.
not_available How do I look? 
not_available So fucking hot it's ridiculous.
not_available Aw, I'm gonna miss you.
not_available I feel like I'm gonna cry.
not_available So cry.
not_available Call me every night.
not_available Okay.
not_available Starting tonight.
not_available All right, I will.
not_available All right, bitch, calm down! Bush just lies and no one cares.
not_available Nate, you got fuckin' oatmeal on my print! 
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available Hey, not in front of Maya, okay? Asshole.
not_available This is really important to me.
not_available Yes, Nate, they're for Claire's crit.
not_available Mom, don't say "crit." It sounds weird coming from you.
not_available What, are you trying to be a model or something? No, I'm not selling anything.
not_available Isn't that what you should be doing, trying to figure out how to sell out to the highest bidder as fast as you can before your life just totally blows up in your face? Because it will.
not_available It just doesn't stop, does it? It gets better.
not_available But it never goes away, no.
not_available Maybe you should try to meet someone new.
not_available Mom, I don't want to meet what, date? I don't want to be with anybody right now.
not_available I can't.
not_available Even if it's just sex then.
not_available Sex can be very healing.
not_available Mom, it's okay for us to be celibate if we want to.
not_available Thank you, Claire.
not_available Then maybe you should get a job.
not_available Look, I've been trying, all right? It's not that easy these days.
not_available Who's supposed to take care of Maya? 
not_available Us, her family.
not_available I think it's best if I look after my daughter right now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't you think what's best for Maya is to have a healthy father? Mom, all I do is think about what's best for Maya, okay? A bereavement group? Mom I was a professional grief counselor for three years.
not_available I know what a load of crap this is.
not_available When you lose someone it actually helps to spend time with others who are going through the same experience.
not_available If it's so great, why didn't you go when Dad died? 
not_available I did.
not_available You didn't tell us that.
not_available I went once a week for several months.
not_available Why didn't you tell us? One of us could have gone with you.
not_available I felt like it would have been wrong to burden my children.
not_available Maybe I could have used it too.
not_available Why is this family so repressed? I can tell you from experience, Nate, you're not simply gonna wake up one morning and find it's all over.
not_available You have to grieve.
not_available Look, I know that.
not_available I have grieved.
not_available I've done big grieving, okay? I just feel like I'm stuck in this quicksand and there's something bigger than me that's holding me back.
not_available It just doesn't make sense.
not_available Something as stupid as that falling in the shower.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available No no, of course not.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available No, I dragged her out to the hot tub, made her drink tequila, got her all dizzy.
not_available It was our anniversary.
not_available Mr.
not_available Thornton, I think your wife was very much in love and did all those things because she enjoyed doing them with you.
not_available Why did this happen? Out of nowhere, for no reason? I was a good husband.
not_available I loved her.
not_available I took care of her.
not_available Now why is God punishing me? I don't think God punishes people like that, Mr.
not_available Thornton.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Hello, Ruth.
not_available Hello, Becky.
not_available Pajamas.
not_available Yes, it's hard to get them long enough for George.
not_available He's such a large man.
not_available Nothing wrong with that.
not_available No no, I'm not complaining.
not_available How are things with Hakim? 
not_available He got back together with his wife.
not_available Oh no! Yeah, I guess I was just a pretty toy to him.
not_available $22.40.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I left a bag of burning dogshit on his front porch as a little parting gift.
not_available Movin' on.
not_available You know, George has a son.
not_available He got a job? I believe he's independently wealthy.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Kyle.
not_available He's about 40, rather boyish.
not_available Does he have a mustache? I like a mustache.
not_available No, but I believe he's capable of growing one.
not_available Why is he still single? He's a very complex man.
not_available Well, I like a man who can keep me guessing.
not_available Maybe I'll have you both over for dinner.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available Shall we start? Anyone? They remind me of Katy Grannan's earlier work.
not_available Yes, they certainly do.
not_available I like them.
not_available They're really simple and unpretentious pretty.
not_available Like Claire herself.
not_available I wonder though if they're a little too staged.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Are they staged, Claire? 
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available It's kind of hard to take a candid self
not_available portrait.
not_available Not just staged, but 
not_available stagy.
not_available Maybe they're a little stiff.
not_available Dead.
not_available That's what I like about them.
not_available This girl who's like dead, and beyond everything, beyond hunger, beyond sex, beyond boredom.
not_available And really, it's so beautiful to be in that state.
not_available Like, nothing can reach her.
not_available Nothing can get to her.
not_available See, I wouldn't say dead, I would say empty.
not_available Yeah, definitely empty.
not_available Was that your intention, Claire? 
not_available No.
not_available I was trying to capture the stillness I sometimes feel.
not_available Really? Not emptiness, apathy? No.
not_available Stillness.
not_available Okay, what are you doing in this picture? Nothing.
not_available Being still.
not_available What are you looking at? What are you thinking? Nothing.
not_available Okay, see, I thought you were actually thinking something deep.
not_available Okay, let me ask you this and feel free to roll your eyes, but do you really want to perpetuate the idea of woman as a vacant vessel? Is this more lesbian stuff? Yes, I have to meet my quota so I get my toaster oven.
not_available Okay, I'm not trying to perpetuate anything.
not_available I don't have an agenda.
not_available I shoot from a more instinctual place.
not_available An empty place? 
not_available I'm not empty! No, of course not.
not_available So maybe with your next work, we can see something that actually is inside you.
not_available May I help you? Oh, I'm just looking for Rico.
not_available Federico? Rico Rico.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available Oh God, I'm glad you called.
not_available I hated the way we left things this morning.
not_available How did we leave things? 
not_available Awkward.
not_available Oh.
not_available I was just calling to remind you to pay the cable bill.
not_available I left it on my desk.
not_available Okay.
not_available So how's it going? Oh, it's great.
not_available Got our own sushi chef.
not_available I'm eating yellowtail, and it's out of this fucking world.
not_available I'm drinking lukewarm coffee and driving a body back to the funeral home.
not_available I'm having an awful day.
not_available Why? 
not_available I told you.
not_available The way you left this morning, it just seemed so whatever.
not_available Honey, forget about it.
not_available You're just feeling needy right now.
not_available "Honey"? When do you ever call me honey? Because you don't want them to know you're talking to a guy? Jesus, why don't you just call me Darlene? I gotta go.
not_available They're starting a movie.
not_available What movie? 
not_available Some Japanese horror flick they want Celeste to do the remake of.
not_available Listen, I love you.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Rico! What are you doing here? What are you doing here?! Well, obviously you weren't gonna come to see me.
not_available Come on, Maria's watching Nicole today.
not_available Let's go to Magic Mountain.
not_available Are you stoned? So? I don't have to work today.
not_available You can't come in here stoned! You can't come in here at all! C'mon, you don't like me anymore? Of course I like you.
not_available It's just you know.
not_available I want you to take me to dinner.
not_available I got a new dress.
not_available It's very short.
not_available No, Sophia, no, Sophia, no! You got the wrong idea.
not_available I spent all day alone yesterday.
not_available I was so sad.
not_available I cried like three times.
not_available I miss you.
not_available You're important to me, Rico.
not_available You make my life better.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa, Sophia I'm sorry if I did something wrong, but No, you didn't do anything wrong.
not_available It's just 
not_available I can't help it that I like you.
not_available You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
not_available I guess I should go.
not_available Maybe I can get off early tonight.
not_available Uh, sorry.
not_available No, you're not interrupting anything.
not_available Sophia Morales, this is Nate Fisher.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You too.
not_available Do you need anything? 
not_available Uh I was just gonna play some Doom.
not_available Um, pick me up at 7:00? Okay okay.
not_available It's not what you think.
not_available Rico, I don't care.
not_available studios in Los Angeles, this is Marketplace.
not_available Patrolling for petrol.
not_available more than in any other land.
not_available No wonder about 40% Hey, I can't believe someone finally stopped.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available I ran out of gas.
not_available I know, so lame.
not_available No.
not_available It's happened to all of us at least once.
not_available Yeah, it's just I'm supposed to help my grandma today.
not_available She broke her hip and she can't make it upstairs, so I told her I'd move her bed downstairs into the den and I know she's just sitting there waiting for me.
not_available I'm sorry, it's just one of those days.
not_available Believe me, I know what that's like.
not_available Any chance you could give me a lift to the next gas station? I wouldn't even ask, I just I don't know what else to do.
not_available Sure, get in.
not_available Wow, thank you so much.
not_available I'm Jake.
not_available David.
not_available David, you just saved my life.
not_available This is so much fun! I haven't been on a campus in years.
not_available Hi.
not_available Ooh, let's wrap him up and take him home.
not_available Now what? You're being wildly inappropriate, as usual.
not_available And, as usual, I am feeling irritated and resentful.
not_available Well, that's your shit.
not_available Oh, is Richard Braun teaching here? Yeah, my cognitive psych class.
not_available You don't believe in all that cognitive crap, do you? You have to dig through the past.
not_available Just knowing where behavior comes from doesn't change the behavior.
not_available It doesn't change anything, except you know where the behavior comes from.
not_available Ricky Braun has the most unusually shiny penis.
not_available I went on this retreat with him and when he'd get out of the hot tub, the water would just bead up on his schlong.
not_available Do you suppose he kept it oiled? I don't know, Mom, and I don't care.
not_available He's a good teacher.
not_available He's an exhibitionist and an idiot.
not_available Then maybe you should teach the class.
not_available Here? No thank you, darling, I'm not that desperate.
not_available This happens to be an excellent program.
not_available It doesn't matter where you're doing your training, sweetheart.
not_available You're gonna be a terrific therapist.
not_available You really have this uncanny understanding of interpersonal dynamics, which you've always had.
not_available You just have a problem applying the principles to your own life, which is so often the case.
not_available I was wondering when the insult would come.
not_available C'mon, we're exactly the same.
not_available Who's a bigger train wreck than I? So, how's it going with Olivier? He's a very passionate man.
not_available He's a lot of fun if you don't take him too seriously.
not_available And he is completely supportive of my decision to have vaginal rejuvenation surgery.
not_available Oh, Mom! Darling, I've had a couple of children.
not_available You, especially, took your toll.
not_available I mean, c'mon, no one wants to fuck a glass of water, if you know what I'm saying.
not_available Speaking of children, are you still interested in having one? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You think so? And is Joe the man you want to have them with? 
not_available I think he is, yeah.
not_available You think he is? How's the sex? It's fine.
not_available It's creative.
not_available It's interesting.
not_available Oh, dear God.
not_available You have to dump him.
not_available Mom, last month when I brought him to dinner, you said he was the one! 
not_available I know, I didn't realize at the time that the sex between the two of you was this cerebral exercise.
not_available That's not good.
not_available Sex is something you should feel, not something you should think.
not_available I have to think to keep from behaving in a compulsive and destructive manner, thanks to my early exposure to compulsive and destructive sexual energy.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available I thought you just said that poring over the past is not important.
not_available Change the behavior.
not_available I have changed the behavior.
not_available Well, then what are you complaining about? This is probably the healthiest relationship that I have ever been in.
not_available No, I'm not gonna dump him.
not_available As a matter of fact, we're talking about moving in together.
not_available Now that's the Brenda I know.
not_available I hate your new hair.
not_available I could feel the gentle rocking of the train as we started to move.
not_available And he was so handsome, sitting there against the window, smiling at me.
not_available When I woke up, I could hardly believe I was this old lady in bed all by myself.
not_available Now, what's odd is I had completely forgotten about that trip.
not_available It was so long ago.
not_available I have so many memories of my time with Walter that I can't even remember them all.
not_available Memories are nice, aren't they, Ellen? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Their ATM is down.
not_available Really? I got no cash, so I tried to use my credit card to get a gas can and a couple gallons of gas, but of course I'm way over my limit so he wouldn't take it.
not_available I begged him, please, and he laughs in my face.
not_available How humiliating is that? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Man.
not_available I must have been a serious asshole in a previous life.
not_available I don't think it works that way.
not_available Things just happen.
not_available At least I stole a pack of gum.
not_available You stole that? 
not_available I figured he deserved it.
not_available Want a piece? Now you're my accomplice.
not_available Oh shit.
not_available What's wrong? My poor grandma's still waiting for me.
not_available I'd call her, but she's deaf.
not_available She never hears the phone.
not_available Why don't you let me buy the gas can and gas, okay? 
not_available No way.
not_available Really, it's no big deal.
not_available I'm going to.
not_available Only if you take me to an ATM so I can pay you back.
not_available Okay.
not_available An apple, some sharp cheddar, and a hunk of crusty bread.
not_available And somehow, it all tastes just a little bit better when you cut it with your grandfather's pocket knife.
not_available Hm.
not_available I've been thinking we should invite Kyle over for dinner.
not_available Why? 
not_available So he can meet my friend Becky, who's quite adorable in her own way and quite single.
not_available Ruth, what are you doing? I'm trying to arrange a dinner.
not_available I can make my vegetable lasagna.
not_available You like that.
not_available And Becky said she 
not_available You're meddling.
not_available I don't think it's meddling to simply introduce two people.
not_available When one of them happens to be my son who leaves boxes of shit on our doorstep? Oh yes, that's meddling.
not_available But don't you want to help him? I only agreed to meet with him because I wanted you to see firsthand what a mess he is.
not_available If I'd had any idea Oh, Christ.
not_available Look just leave it alone, Ruth, okay? You deal with your messed
not_available up children and I'll deal with mine.
not_available I don't care for that tone, George.
not_available I'm very disappointed in you, Ruth.
not_available Very.
not_available When you lose somebody you love, you truly have lost a part of yourself.
not_available Because you've shared a lifetime with this person, it's only natural to have moments when you're feeling completely lost.
not_available What if you haven't? Well, if you don't feel lost No, I didn't get to share a lifetime with her.
not_available Look, I'm sorry.
not_available I've been listening to your stories and they're they're really upsetting to me, because I don't have that.
not_available I don't have a lifetime of memories.
not_available We were just getting started.
not_available Just working things through.
not_available And, uh well, now I have a I have a twoyear
not_available old daughter who doesn't have a mother.
not_available And so she, uh she has to get everything from me because I'm all there is.
not_available And I don't know I don't know what to do with that.
not_available Most of the time, I just I just feel numb.
not_available And then sometimes I feel just just terrified.
not_available Then sometimes, I just feel so angry, but then I don't want to be this bitter guy, so I try to deal with it because I don't want my daughter to have to live with that poison.
not_available I try and be thankful.
not_available I try so hard to be thankful.
not_available And I am, I'm thankful, thankful I have a beautiful child that Lisa gave me.
not_available And some days, some days I just feel like I'm going crazy, like I'm literally losing my mind.
not_available That's the fire alarm.
not_available It's probably just a false alarm, but just to be safe, we're gonna walk down the hallway and out into the parking lot.
not_available Is everyone ready? I've never heard that before.
not_available Thanks for the gas, man.
not_available This is one incredibly shitty day for me, but you are like the coolest guy I ever met, David.
not_available Now we just gotta hit that ATM.
not_available They're usually all over.
not_available You want some water? No thanks.
not_available Are you gay? Uh yes.
not_available I thought so.
not_available You look gay.
not_available Oh.
not_available No, I mean you could be.
not_available I was hoping you were gay.
not_available I mean, I figure you have a boyfriend.
not_available You're too cute not to.
not_available But what if I could be your guy on the side, who understands you and loves you unconditionally and pretty much lives just to please you? You want me to take my pants off? Hello? Do you want some water or not? Oh.
not_available No, thanks, I'm fine.
not_available Dude, where'd you go? I'm a little preoccupied.
not_available I'm having one of those days too.
not_available Well, hey, say no more.
not_available I smell smoke.
not_available Does anyone else smell smoke? Okay, everyone, false alarm.
not_available We can all go back in.
not_available # It's my life # # Don't you forget # # Caught in the trap # 
not_available So did you grow up in L.A.? Yeah, one of the rare natives.
not_available What about you? I was born in St.
not_available George, Bermuda.
not_available Wow.
not_available Not as exciting as it sounds.
not_available It was the naval air station.
not_available Your dad was in the navy? At first, and then he worked for a food service company 
not_available that supplied the navy.
not_available I used to fantasize about running away and joining the navy.
not_available Mostly I just pictured myself walking down the gangway in my sailor uniform, like Gene Kelly in "On the Town." Who? 
not_available Never mind.
not_available The navy sucks.
not_available When I was little, as soon as I'd make friends, my dad would have to move.
not_available So I was always the new kid.
not_available Yeah, I know how that feels.
not_available I was never the new kid.
not_available I was just the odd kid.
not_available I think there's one in there.
not_available What? 
not_available ATM? Oh, cool.
not_available # Don't you forget # # Oh, it's my life # # lt # Hey.
not_available Okay, this is the deal.
not_available We walk in there, you get as much cash as you can with your ATM card.
not_available If you try anything, I mean if you even breathe in a way that I don't like, I will shoot you in the spine.
not_available Understand? Not 300, 500.
not_available I don't think you can withdraw 500 Yeah, you can, do it.
not_available I don't even have How much? Maybe four.
not_available Do four.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Nice try.
not_available Oh wow, I really hit you hard, didn't I? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry, bro.
not_available It just it felt so fucking good! God, I didn't even know I was gonna do that.
not_available I just fucking I just did it! Look, you got your money, just leave me alone.
not_available Aw, don't be angry, David.
not_available Come on, get in the van.
not_available I'm not going anywhere with you.
not_available Oh, hey, you're not gonna dump me after our first fight, are you? We're best friends forever.
not_available Now get in the van before I kick your motherfucking ass.
not_available Let's go, cowboy.
not_available Where? 
not_available That way.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wipe your face.
not_available Ahh.
not_available Do you want me to take you back to your car? I don't have a car.
not_available Where I picked you up.
not_available That wasn't my car.
not_available I don't have a car.
not_available Where would I get a car? So where am I taking you? Well, it's definitely party time.
not_available There are these guys I know in Long Beach that deal meth.
not_available Have fun all tweak
not_available end long, you know? Oh no no, we'll do it old school tonight.
not_available MacArthur Park.
not_available Head on down to the crack gallery.
not_available Jesus.
not_available You can just take the van No, I'm drinking.
not_available You have to drive.
not_available Friends don't let friends drive drunk.
not_available How do I get there? Just head towards downtown.
not_available No, what are you doing? I'm getting on the freeway.
not_available No, stay off the fucking freeway! Just go get on Alvarado.
not_available Okay, calm down! 
not_available I don't like the freeway.
not_available I had an accident on the freeway.
not_available My father was killed right after we moved here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available On the way to a Dodger game.
not_available We were just talking then bam! He plowed into the back of this truck.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available When the car finally stopped moving, he just wasn't there anymore.
not_available What happened? He went through the windshield.
not_available Pfft, he never wore his seatbelt.
not_available It was his little "fuck you" to the world.
not_available I lost my father in a car accident too.
not_available He was hit by a bus.
not_available How old were you? It was just three years ago.
not_available Oh, fuck you, that's not the same! I was 10 years old.
not_available Jesus, man, you fart? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh! Yeah, you did! Holy fucking Christ! It was the body.
not_available What? 
not_available The body, it's releasing gas.
not_available What the fuck is that?! 
not_available I just said, it's a body.
not_available I'm a funeral director.
not_available I was taking it home when I picked you up.
not_available Oh, fuck, fuck! Get it out of here! Stop the fucking van! Stop the fucking van! Oh, Jesus, it's a chick.
not_available Hey, you wanna fuck her? I was kidding! Oh shit, you should see your face! What do you want? I to get her the fuck out of my van.
not_available Jesus, that is a person! That's somebody's wife! Well, if she was always farting like that, he must be happy to be rid of her.
not_available Oh God, that is disgusting.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I said let's go! Man, you got any Lysol? 
not_available I still smell her farts.
not_available No.
not_available Pull in there.
not_available Get in the back.
not_available Lay down.
not_available On your stomach.
not_available What, you think we're gonna make out, faggot? Give me your hands.
not_available Is that too tight? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Tough shit.
not_available I don't want you going anywhere.
not_available I like you.
not_available Oh, bitch.
