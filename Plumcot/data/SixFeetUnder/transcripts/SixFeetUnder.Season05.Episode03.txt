not_available Or, wait, Portugal.
not_available Oh oh oh, Morocco.
not_available Wait.
not_available I still know people.
not_available What time is it over there? Well, what time is it right now? Okay okay.
not_available Okay okay okay.
not_available We all know that this procedure is cost prohibitive, Yet fascinating.
not_available So as a research experiment I committed myself to waterless embalming For seven months.
not_available This for many of us is the road not taken.
not_available But I diverged in the yellow wood To develop better techniques for those situations In which there may be no h20.
not_available Let us compare.
not_available Typically, the anhydrous process Would involves 16 ounces arterial fluid, 32 ounces humectant, Or humectant co
not_available Injection mix, Plus 32 ounces water treatment.
not_available Resulting in a final dilution strength Of 3
not_available 4% HCHO.
not_available Now in a typical conventional embalming The numbers would be somewhat different.
not_available With 1012 ounces arterial fluid, Eight ounces humectant, Or humectant co
not_available Injection mix Okay.
not_available Good to see you guys.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You guys take care.
not_available Hey.

not_available You fucked up.
not_available I did not.
not_available You told me you took care of it.
not_available You said the arrest was expunged.
not_available That's what the Vegas cop said.
not_available Look, I didn't make you fuck that hooker and get busted.
not_available That smug dyke Shirley rubs it in my face.
not_available You fucked up and it cost us everything ! The only reason I'm not screaming back at you right now is because I know how upset you are.
not_available Why am I the only one who's upset? Why aren't you freaking out? I am upset.
not_available But I have to drive the car and get us home alive while you freak out ! Bullshit ! You don't care ! I do care ! But it didn't cost us everything.
not_available There's a surrogate, maybe we can get things going with her? You never wanted to adopt in the first place.
not_available Fuck the surrogate.
not_available You can meet her yourself.
not_available I don't want any part of it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I mean, I knew he was pissed off, But I did not see it coming.

not_available I beg your pardon.
not_available That is my money.
not_available My father gave it to me.
not_available He set up a trust to pay for your education, not support your lifestyle outside of the classroom.
not_available It is not my lifestyle, it is my life ! And I'm learning more now than i ever did in that pretentious art barn ! You don't inherit free and clear until you're 25.
not_available The language is very specific.
not_available This is, like, bureaucratic bullshit ! How am I supposed to move to europe And fuckg ripen when you won't give me my money? Your mother and I discussed this and we feel it's in your best interest.
