not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Me and my buddy, we just moved in next door.
not_available We were wondering who lives here.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available I was just about to get in the shower.
not_available Come on in, I'll be out in a moment.
not_available Nice.
not_available She's hot.
not_available Yeah, you're telling me.
not_available I thought I told you guys to wait in the other room.
not_available We thought you might need some help getting clean.
not_available This is so cool.
not_available Yeah, you like this, don't you? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Let's move over here.
not_available You're a nasty girl, aren't you? You guys are the best neighbors I ever had.
not_available David.
not_available You're all wet.
not_available Were you crying? No, it was raining.
not_available And, yes, I was crying.
not_available I love you.
not_available We get just about all the minerals and vitamins that bones need from things like sunshine.
not_available Didn't I ask you to clean up after yourself? Why did you ask for an omelet if you weren't hungry? I was, but now my tummy hurts.
not_available Again? Girl, you better eat some breakfast.
not_available Maybe I'm full.
not_available Eat half of it and you can watch MTV or don't eat and go to school hungry, it's your choice.
not_available That's good, bribe her.
not_available Did I ask for your input? 
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Go.
not_available Your car is blocking me in.
not_available What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I'm taking care of Taylor I don't know where her mother is, I haven't slept in two months since I shot and killed that man.
not_available I'm sick of your shit.
not_available I'm sick and tired of you taking it all out on me.
not_available This is way more than I signed on for.
not_available I've got an idea.
not_available Find what's yours, and take it when you leave.
not_available Then I'll never have to look at your ass again.
not_available I have a better idea.
not_available I'll go right now.
not_available If you find any of my stuff, you can shove it up your tight white ass.
not_available Who the hell you think you're talking to? I know you didn't call my ass white.
not_available My tummy hurts.
not_available The answer is no, I'm sorry.
not_available It's not like it's some stranger.
not_available It's your sister.
not_available It's not like it's Kabul.
not_available It's Topanga, it's not even an hour from here.
not_available You heard what was done to Nate.
not_available I don't think anything was done to him.
not_available In case you haven't hung out with any 15year
not_available old guys they're like total hornswogglers.
not_available It was a much more innocent time.
not_available What, the '80s? Your brother was a much more innocent boy to say nothing of what happened to David.
not_available He hiked three miles down the canyon in pitch dark to get away from those people.
not_available He cut his ear on a bramble.
not_available The answer is no.
not_available Have you thought at all about scaffolding? When your house is falling apart, you build scaffolding to support you while you are doing the work.
not_available And I think a great way to build scaffolding is to revisit old experiences but try them a new way.
not_available So I'm going out there after school today and spend the weekend and be back on Sunday.
not_available I haven't even told Justin yet.
not_available He doesn't know his father's dead.
not_available Jewish tradition says we have to bury him tomorrow.
not_available You have had Jewish funerals here before, right? Of course.
not_available We decided not to do this in our temple because of the way Jeffrey died.
not_available Jess, if you want, I can do this with Jeffrey's mother.
not_available Fuck it, I can do it.
not_available What do you need to know? He killed himself for no reason while I was at goddamn Gymboree with Tess.
not_available Tess is four.
not_available While I was with her, my husband, Jeffrey Shapiro who worked for the third best law firm in LA and was three months away from making partner He came home on his lunch break and he hung himself with his pants around his ankles in our goddamn sunroom.
not_available There's your fucking eulogy.
not_available Can you say that in Hebrew? So you'll be conducting the service, Rabbi? I love my new place.
not_available You have to come see it.
not_available It's a condo, but it's like a hotel, too.
not_available It's got a concierge and a bidet.
not_available Get me one of those jumbo beers on the side as well.
not_available I'll share it with her.
not_available Get your own.
not_available Make it two, thanks.
not_available To living alone, finally.
not_available To bidets.
not_available And to starting over, with us, sweetheart.
not_available I think I was under much more emotional pressure than I ever realized.
not_available And I'm actually so sorry for those awful things I said to you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Aren't you sorry for hitting me? Yes, that was insane of me, but No buts, Brenda.
not_available Just be sorry.
not_available I know it was probably my fault, but I don't want to know why.
not_available So, now the headline.
not_available That whore has moved in with your father.
not_available Dad's seeing a whore? The Whore of Tranquility Spa, Brenda.
not_available Has your father said anything to you about her? What's in it for her, money? I know she's not in it for sex.
not_available Your father's not what he used to be after years of Paxil Okay, that'll be fine, Mom.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Let's talk about you.
not_available You sure you want to lose the focus just yet? Come on now, what's up in your world? Nate and I are getting married.
not_available Is he smart enough for you? Does he have what it takes, up here? Like you? Like me? No, Mom, he's not like us.
not_available He doesn't think so hard he wants to put a staple gun to his forehead.
not_available I get it.
not_available He's uncomplicated.
not_available I've been with a man or three like that.
not_available But Bern always had me because I knew he was much smarter than I am.
not_available That's why it's still so hot with us, all these years later.
not_available And we're back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available So, how did he propose? I asked him.
not_available You didn't.
not_available Yeah, I know, it's really funny.
not_available It's almost as funny as the notion of you trying to build a life on your own.
not_available I don't see how he could kill himself when he's got three kids.
not_available I don't think he meant to.
not_available He hung himself.
not_available I talked to the Quincy down at the morgue and he says that the cops said there was a porno playing in the VCR.
not_available And they found a bottle of Astroglide.
not_available What's Astroglide? It's lube.
not_available Lubrication.
not_available For sex.
not_available Thank you, David.
not_available No problemo.
not_available Wait a minute, I know about this.
not_available He was doing autoerotic asphyxiation like the guy in that band? 
not_available You got it.
not_available See, you cut off the air supply and that heightens the stimulation in the ensuing orgasm.
not_available Here's the 
giveaway They found a lemon wedge on the floor.
not_available You keep the lemon in your mouth and at the moment of climax you bite down on it to wake you up, so you don't die.
not_available See, the lemon was lying on the floor, untouched.
not_available I'm calling to let you know that Eddie and I broke up.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Are you okay? I broke it off with him.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Thank you for telling me, I'm going to go now.
not_available So, there's this part in my book where the main character meets a high
not_available class hooker.
not_available Is this fiction, or nonfiction? It's still kind of working itself out.
not_available There's definitely someone based on you.
not_available Part of her is you.
not_available Excellent.
not_available As long as she doesn't get raped and murdered to pay for her sins.
not_available I'm so sick of that tired old story.
not_available She's way beyond conventional morality.
not_available I can't wait to read it.
not_available I jerked off a client the other day.
not_available I didn't know you did release.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available He didn't ask me to.
not_available So, I'm sure you can imagine sometimes the guy gets a hard
not_available on.
not_available Normally I just ignore it.
not_available So what, was this guy just exceptionally hot? No, not even.
not_available So I'm giving the guy a massage he flips over, there's this hard
not_available on.
not_available It was kind of huge, but you'd never guess by looking at the guy.
not_available I could tell that he wanted me to touch it.
not_available I thought, well, I would be crossing a line.
not_available And then I did.
not_available I crossed a line.
not_available You are hilarious.
not_available I mean, what is that? Am I trying to be you or something? I don't know.
not_available How'd you feel afterwards? I was weirdly kind of inspired.
not_available I wrote this really cool chapter about it.
not_available As long as it's all for your art.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Aunt Sarah, hi! Baby, is everything okay? I thought we said a "probably
not_available maybe" about next weekend.
not_available But this weekend is fine, it's just fine.
not_available I thought it was this weekend.
not_available I'm totally cool to go home and come back whenever.
not_available You're here, and you're mine.
not_available I have to believe the universe sent you.
not_available It's our annual Howl weekend.
not_available Allen Ginsburg Howl? 
not_available Yes.
not_available So you're down.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available He was a dear friend.
not_available We once shared a flat in Berlin until I got fed up with the parade of Aryan starfucker boys.
not_available I'm going to summon his energy this weekend.
not_available I'm expecting some visitors.
not_available A wonderful poet named Basil and the painter Fiona Kleinschmidt, have you heard of her? A couple of freaks and some nasty hippies from my druggie days.
not_available It's going to be a riot.
not_available Sure you don't want me to come back later? Wouldn't hear of it.
not_available I'll show you to your sleeping nook.
not_available I love that bag.
not_available Why did you do that to me? 
not_available Do what? That.
not_available Just calling me and telling me that.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Mom, I'm on the phone.
not_available Are you going to have supper? I'm making pork chops.
not_available No, Mom, I won't be having dinner with you.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What do you want? You called me.
not_available I was calling to find out why you called me to tell me you guys broke up.
not_available You're my friend.
not_available I thought you'd want to know what happens in my life.
not_available A month ago you didn't think we should see each other anymore.
not_available Things change.
not_available Just what exactly is your agenda? I don't have an agenda, okay? 
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Wonderful.
not_available Great.
not_available Thank you for sharing.
not_available Shut up, just keep it shut.
not_available I was just eating.
not_available I spent most of the '90s thinking that stripping was goddess work but I've come around to my original position which is that it's just plain cheap.
not_available I've always been astonished at some of that pole work.
not_available I once saw this woman, she could hang upside down from 20 feet in the air.
not_available She looked like an inverted Jesus.
not_available It's the PVC boots.
not_available They make your legs stick to the metal.
not_available No way.
not_available I would totally take my clothes off on stage at least once, if I didn't harbor a vague feeling of hatred about my body.
not_available You're crazy, you have a beautiful body.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's Nate.
not_available Listen, the whole prostitute thing 
not_available he wouldn't be into it.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Where'd you get the hummus? Sorry, incredibly rude and hungry.
not_available This is Nate, my fiancé.
not_available This is my friend, Melissa.
not_available Cool.
not_available Where'd you guys meet? Melissa's a client of mine.
not_available So does Brenda have all your auras aligned? Chakras.
not_available Did you note the tone of mocking? Have you guys ever heard of autoerotic asphyxiation? Cutting off your air supply so you can come harder? Sure.
not_available There's a name for it in the fetish community.
not_available It's called breath play.
not_available I read a thing.
not_available We have this guy who died of it and it's weird because it's definitely suicide but is it accidental suicide or just plain old suicide? He was indulging in something he knew could kill him but even if it's accidental it's still sort of on purpose, right? What do you mean, "this guy we have"? 
not_available Nate's an undertaker.
not_available Funeral director.
not_available Did you note the tone of mocking in that? Don't tell me you're a couple that likes to bicker in front of others until it gets uncomfortable and I have to leave and you guys fuck? No.
not_available No, not us.
not_available Okay, you want to know my agenda? My agenda is to take you to dinner tomorrow night.
not_available You there? If I say yes, what am I agreeing to? You and me having dinner, maybe a little conversation, that's all.
not_available Dinner? We could make a plan, but it seems a little soon after Would you just shut up and say yes? Yes, I would like to have dinner with you tomorrow night.
not_available How you doing, baby? 
not_available Good.
not_available How are you? Be careful, Snoopy has an ear infection.
not_available I brought tomatoes from my garden.
not_available But I'm making the sauce, right? Do you have fresh pasta or do I make some? The Napa contingent can't make it.
not_available Fernando's doing community service, again.
not_available Who are you? This is Claire, Ruth's daughter.
not_available I didn't know Ruth had a daughter.
not_available If I remember correctly, you certainly knew she had a son.
not_available How is Ruth? 
not_available How is Nathaniel? My mom's great.
not_available My dad is not so great.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Shame.
not_available Hell of a guy, your dad.
not_available So funny, fucking wicked.
not_available I can still see him sitting here at this counter hunched over his little rolling machine.
not_available He used a rolling machine.
not_available I'm gonna have my cell phone on, in case you need to call me or anything.
not_available Okay, have a good one.
not_available You want another cup of coffee? 
not_available Lf you make it, I'll drink it.
not_available Be really careful when you're taking down this plastic 'cause of Julio's allergies.
not_available There's tons of dust all through here.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available We know, honey.
not_available I'm going to make some breakfast.
not_available Hungry? That sounds good.
not_available I moved your circular saw to the porch.
not_available I know, man, I got it.
not_available It's cool.
not_available Honey listen, if it gets too loud in here you can take the kids to the park.
not_available You don't have to stay.
not_available Okay, baby, I got it.
not_available Have a good day.
not_available Okay.
not_available Julio, turn that TV down.
not_available There's a spray cleaner that's much more earth friendly.
not_available Maybe I'll order it.
not_available Oh, god damn it! Or we can keep using this.
not_available I don't talking to you! Are you mad at us? Why the grumps, Mr.
not_available Cranky Pants? Someone's in a real snoot.
not_available I don't think he's feeling well.
not_available I feeling fine.
not_available I can't come to your house for dinner tonight.
not_available I have other obligation.
not_available We planned this three days ago.
not_available I bought aubergines.
not_available I can't.
not_available Stop with all the question, okay? I'm not asking you questions.
not_available I haven't asked you any questions.
not_available So, tell what do you do with aubergines? It's a Greek thing, it's like a It's like a lasagna.
not_available Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Nothing would please me more, muffin.
not_available Star sighting.
not_available I think I just saw that Jewish "Friend" in there.
not_available What, Jennifer Aniston? 
not_available The guy.
not_available Ross.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll be back in a couple hours.
not_available Hey, did you forget to shave? 
not_available I was running late.
not_available Really? I'll thank you not to discuss my facial hair any further.
not_available Come here, let me check it out.
not_available Come on.
not_available What time's your date? 
not_available Who said I have a date? Tonight.
not_available Dinner.
not_available It's a little soon.
not_available The whole Oopsldidn'tknowlwas
not_available sexy stubble look will peak at around noon tomorrow.
not_available Believe me, I've perfected the art.
not_available Can you make it drinks after dinner? You'll have more time.
not_available I can't discuss this now.
not_available I'm going out.
not_available Clothes shopping? 
not_available No.
not_available Stay out of Structure.
not_available Augusto's got a little cold so I'm gonna head home and give Vanessa a little break.
not_available Okay, that's cool.
not_available I'll be right here, then.
not_available You may be seated.
not_available We are here today to mourn the loss of Jeffrey Marc Shapiro.
not_available Talmud says, "Better is one day in this life "than all eternity in the world to come." "And if they ask, you answer "Damn the high
not_available walled guard towers of right and left "Coast to coast, now, here upon a time "where leaf shines, shimmers "tokes to toasts "Fear forever, nevermore" And there you have it, the crap of the moment! It's not crap.
not_available Look what just arrived.
not_available Hi, Jill! Hey, magic mushrooms, special delivery.
not_available Throw them in the sauce.
not_available No, no, sauté them first.
not_available You guys, sauté them first! Hey, do you have any of that THC butter in the freezer from last year? Hey! Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck is going on in here? Just get out of here, man.
not_available Give me a sec.
not_available Get out of here? This is my fucking house, you fucking homo! It's nothing.
not_available Just chill, Rico.
not_available Damn! Are you out of your fucking mind? My kids could have seen that! Vanessa! She took the kids to the park.
not_available Are you fucking crazy? Are you out of your fucking homo mind? Get the fuck out of here! What the fuck is wrong with you, Ramon? Do you have anything to fucking say? No, I'm just going to get out of here until you calm the hell down, okay? Damn! What the fuck? What the fucking fuck? Rabbi? 
not_available You can call me Ari.
not_available I need to ask you a few questions.
not_available As a funeral director, I want to ask about death from a Jewish point of view.
not_available Sure.
not_available But I warn you, Jews tend to answer questions with more questions.
not_available I'll give you my card.
not_available I mean now.
not_available We're going straight to the cemetery.
not_available You could drive with me.
not_available I'm coming.
not_available Mother.
not_available Baby.
not_available I got this for you.
not_available It doesn't need watering or caring about in any way.
not_available So, Brenda, I had this vision of your wedding at the Hollyhock House.
not_available They're wonderful as long as you bring in your own caterer.
not_available Loulou Smigel's daughter had her wedding there.
not_available Well, actually, I was thinking of somewhere more beautiful and natural.
not_available Oh, God! What? You know, your father and I got married on the beach and we ran in the surf afterwards.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available You were barefoot, he wore clogs.
not_available I think you're going to have to leave.
not_available I've just got so much coming up right now and I need to go in my room and sob for an hour.
not_available Look, I could stay.
not_available I'll massage your shoulders.
not_available No, that It doesn't help me right now that you're here.
not_available Sure I can't make you a cup of tea or something? I'm sure.
not_available And, Brenda please don't tell your father that you saw me cry.
not_available Mom, come on, let me help.
not_available I'm not Billy.
not_available If you want to help me, just leave.
not_available Okay.
not_available Every time I get a headache, I'm thinking this could be it.
not_available You must be really scared.
not_available Yeah, I'm going to die.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available Really, what do you have? 
not_available A body.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, we're all going to die and maybe I'm going to die before everyone else, maybe not.
not_available So what's the Jewish answer to what I'm supposed to do now? I don't know what the Jewish answer is.
not_available I know what I try to do.
not_available I try to live my life every day in a way that honors God.
not_available I don't even know if I believe in God.
not_available Maybe it's time to find Him.
not_available Maybe God's a woman.
not_available Maybe.
not_available There he is now.
not_available Jeffrey Shapiro.
not_available I'll wait here by the car.
not_available Come and watch him be buried.
not_available Jeffrey can't repay you, so it's considered a great mitzvah.
not_available Kindness, love, for its own sake.
not_available Some people call that God.
not_available What I'm saying is, yes, definitely, forgive your mother and father.
not_available I mean, we've all heard that before, but what's become clear is that my family of origin never really lived in a house.
not_available They lived in this tent city, psychologically.
not_available It's no wonder that my own house never felt remotely like it was built on solid ground Shut up.
not_available Shut the mouth.
not_available It was built on this quicksand of emotional incest if there is such a thing 
not_available Shutting it now.
not_available Shutting it and stopping it.
not_available But The Plan would call that "old blueprinting" If you say another word, I will stab you in the heart with a fork.
not_available that's about the size of it.
not_available If there is a God in heaven, He will surely shut your mouth.
not_available You never stop renovating.
not_available Robbie, I have to tell you something now.
not_available I do believe I've learned everything I needed to learn from The Plan and I no longer feel the urge to speak in building metaphors or talk about myself or my feelings in this way any longer.
not_available I don't know what kind of power trip you're on, but it seems cruel, to be honest.
not_available Oh, God, Keith, you poor thing.
not_available You mind checking on her one more time? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available How is she? 
not_available She's in surgery right now.
not_available I guess her appendix was huge, but they got it before it burst and she's going to be fine.
not_available I'm just waiting.
not_available It's been an hour and a half.
not_available She kept telling me her stomach was hurting and I thought it was some kind of game.
not_available You can't be perfect all the time, Keith.
not_available That's what life's 
about Striving for perfection.
not_available And when that fails, accepting ourselves for being imperfect.
not_available Not in my book.
not_available God, you are so self
not_available righteous sometimes.
not_available Yeah, and you are a doormat.
not_available Do I really come off as being a doormat? How is she? 
not_available Great.
not_available It went very smoothly.
not_available She's in recovery.
not_available Good.
not_available When can I see her? You can wait for her in her room.
not_available When she comes out of her anesthesia, she might be a little weepy.
not_available Don't let it concern you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, God, don't let her come over here.
not_available No, it's too late.
not_available Beat these gourds! No spectators! Oh, my God, is there a lock on this thing? They use this place as a meditation hut but it's been my safe
not_available house more times than I care to remember.
not_available What fucking freaks.
not_available Yeah, at least two of them aren't your parents.
not_available I'm their designated driver every year.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's better than getting a call from the sheriff saying your parents are laying in the bottom of Topanga Canyon and would I like a ride in a helicopter.
not_available We shouldn't be doing this.
not_available Why not? Because, you know, like people are having, like, endofthe
not_available world sex and just, I didn't bring condoms Like I would even anyway.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, you're quite the fox, I'm happy to report but, like, I would never just hook up with somebody I just met.
not_available Like, ever.
not_available Seriously? Seriously.
not_available I get it.
not_available You're just trying to let me get my guard down and then, all of a sudden, we're hooking up.
not_available Wrong.
not_available I'm 19, okay, Claire? I've had the major life experience to know it kind of sucks to enter the body of another human being you're not in love with.
not_available Okay, what are you, like, straight
not_available edge, or all Jesusy or just gay? None of those things, okay? Forget it.
not_available Just lay down here with me.
not_available We won't have sex.
not_available That's all you have to know.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Who said I even wanted you to? I promise you, you're gonna be fine.
not_available This is all going to be over soon, and we'll have you back at home.
not_available I'm sorry I got sick.
not_available Baby, it's not your fault.
not_available You kept trying to tell me.
not_available I just wasn't paying attention to you.
not_available In the future, we need to have a code word, okay? Okay.
not_available Secret words you can use to let me know when the pain is real and you're not just playing.
not_available But it was always real.
not_available I know.
not_available Baby, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't know why you guys are depressed.
not_available I haven't gotten laid since September 11 You laughed at the wrong part.
not_available I'm just telling you.
not_available What a crowd! You drinking NyQuil, ladies? Sit up, come on! Blonde Jews, everybody! Hip crowd! Good to see you back in men's clothes, Senator.
not_available All right.
not_available Cousin Stu, right out of rehab.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available The landscaper's here, thank God! 
not_available So what's shiva mean, standup? Jeffrey represented a lot of comedians.
not_available There's one part I haven't told you.
not_available I'm engaged.
not_available Well, we couldn't go out anyway.
not_available You're not Jewish.
not_available No, I didn't mean You would go out with me? No, I just said I wouldn't.
not_available But it crossed your mind.
not_available I said, I would not.
not_available Well, then, why'd you say it? You thought about it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Maybe.
not_available You know, with your whole illness thing I have a bit of a messiah complex saving the men.
not_available Yes, messiah complex.
not_available You know, you can save me.
not_available If that's what you need to do, you can save me.
not_available It's really good that you have someone.
not_available If anything is going to save you, that will.
