
not_available Vance, I don't know what's wrong with me.
not_available I've got no fucking appetite lately.
not_available That's a sign of depression.
not_available Really? Oh, yeah.
not_available I've been reading up on it.
not_available Ever since my wife's hysterectomy, she's been real down in the dumps.
not_available Loss of appetite, loss of sex drive feelings of hopelessness and despair, no energy.
not_available All of which she has.
not_available I only got the loss of appetite thing.
not_available You know what is depressing? My wife's cooking.
not_available Here.
not_available What the fuck is that? It looks like cat shit.
not_available I think it is cat shit.
not_available She's fucking useless in the kitchen.
not_available She always has been.
not_available At least your wife still fucks you.
not_available Thank God.
not_available If she didn't do that, I'd have to kill her.
not_available Shit! Oh, fuck! Fuck me.
not_available This is fucked! Fucking fuck! It's kind of beautiful, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah, it's way beautiful.
not_available You add the sunset factor, it'll be perfect.
not_available There's horseshit everywhere.
not_available So? So isn't it gonna mess up your white dress? Yeah, like I'm gonna wear a white dress.
not_available Besides, if we exchange vows surrounded by horseshit it'd be kind of fitting.
not_available Meaning you think us getting married is a shitty idea? Meaning we're going into this open
not_available eyed, shit and all.
not_available And hopefully, my mother will step in some of it.
not_available Or even better, fall face first into it, and then it really will be the happiest day of my life.
not_available Are you sure you want to marry me? We can still call it off.
not_available Of course I want to marry you.
not_available But I could die, Bren.
not_available I mean, I could die any day.
not_available I could die any moment.
not_available Yeah, and I couldn't? Yeah, we're all gonna die, I know but the chances of it actually happening are significantly higher for me.
not_available That's just a fucking fact.
not_available And the last thing I want is for you to marry me because you feel sorry for me.
not_available You really think I'd do that? You've made enough sacrifices in your life without having to go through some I'm marrying you because I love you.
not_available You're the first man I thought I could stand to spend the rest of my life with.
not_available Or the rest of your life, if it's tragically cut short or whatever.
not_available You're not some car I want to trade in because it has faulty transmission.
not_available Jesus, do you really think I'm that shallow? Of course not.
not_available All we have is this moment right here, right now.
not_available The future is just a fucking concept that we use to avoid being alive today.
not_available So be here now.
not_available So why do we need to get married at all then? So we can rack up all that free shit from all my mother's wealthy friends, that's why.
not_available Hey, I know this really cool rabbi who can possibly do our wedding.
not_available A rabbi? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why would you even go there? You are half
not_available Jewish.
not_available Yeah, I'm also half
not_available Catholic.
not_available So you wanna invite the Pope? It's a marriage.
not_available It's a sacred occasion.
not_available You'd rather have just some civil servant there? Personally, I think the two of us should be enough to make it sacred.
not_available Hey, did you sleep okay? No.
not_available I finally dozed off around 5:00.
not_available Keith, go back to bed.
not_available I'm not gonna sleep anymore, believe me.
not_available Maybe you should talk to your doctor about medication.
not_available Yeah, drugs, that's the answer.
not_available You're right.
not_available Suffering when you don't have to, that's much more constructive.
not_available Idiot.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Is there any more coffee? I really don't think you should be drinking caffeine when your sleep is so erratic.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available Bitch.
not_available Taylor left her gummy vitamins.
not_available Big surprise.
not_available She hated those.
not_available I should run these over to Karla.
not_available Okay, no.
not_available Karla can get her more vitamins.
not_available You could probably use a little space now.
not_available Yeah, well, I need to make sure Karla's staying clean.
not_available You need to take care of yourself right now, okay? That's what you're for.
not_available I see.
not_available So, basically, I just exist to serve you.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available You're gonna make me late for work.
not_available That's your problem.
not_available There are two chicken
not_available salad sandwiches in here.
not_available They're for your lunch.
not_available And don't eat them before noon because you'll have to wait until I get home from work to eat again.
not_available What are these things supposed to be? Have a nice day.
not_available Are we really supposed to believe Britney Spears is a virgin? Why exactly are we supposed to care? I'd like for you to do me a favor and check on Nikolai when you get home.
not_available I won't be home until late.
not_available Parker and I have plans.
not_available I thought you and Parker had a falling
not_available out.
not_available We made up.
not_available I figured it was better to have a loser for a friend than to have no friends at all.
not_available Well, what are you doing with her? We're going to the Getty.
not_available Do you think I'm an idiot? No, of course not.
not_available It's not like I'm lying to cover up my drug habit.
not_available I'm lying to get out of having to empty the bedpan of the man you're sleeping with.
not_available I don't feel I should have to do that.
not_available For God's sake, that's not what I'm asking you to do.
not_available Good.
not_available You have absolutely no idea how easy you have it.
not_available Please tell me you're not gonna start talking about your legless grandmother again.
not_available I pity you, Claire.
not_available You are under the mistaken impression that life owes you something.
not_available Well, you're in for some very harsh surprises.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available Traffic was unbelievable.
not_available Are they here yet? Yeah, they're waiting in the Wisteria Room.
not_available Dave, I've got something I need to ask you.
not_available What? What's with the red face? Keith and I were fooling around, and, well, he hadn't shaved.
not_available You big whore.
not_available Is it really bad? 
not_available No.
not_available Actually, it's bright red.
not_available It's red as a baboon's ass.
not_available Oh, my God! I look like a burn victim.
not_available What I wanted to ask was if you'd be best man at my wedding.
not_available Of course I will.
not_available Excellent.
not_available All right, you ready to roll? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good Lord.
not_available So, Dad already took care of everything? It's all specified in the pre
not_available need contract.
not_available For the viewing, he's chosen a Parliament casket followed by a cremation and internment at Cedar Grove in the remaining chamber of a prayer
not_available level double crypt.
not_available With Mom? 
not_available Harriet Mitchell Garrison? That's her.
not_available So there's nothing for us to do.
not_available All you have to do is show up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, my God! I feel so awful.
not_available I can't remember the last time that I saw him.
not_available Honey, it's okay.
not_available He knew we loved him.
not_available I can give you the number of a great dermatologist.
not_available What up, Uncle Keith? 
not_available Hey, you forgot these at my house.
not_available I hate these nasty old things.
not_available They're good for you.
not_available I like the Flintstones.
not_available Shouldn't you be in school? Mama's sick.
not_available I'm staying home today to take care of her.
not_available Hey.
not_available Don't come too close to me.
not_available I got the flu.
not_available You got the flu.
not_available Have you been to see the doctor? I ain't paying nobody's doctor $100 just to tell me to stay in bed.
not_available Fuck that shit.
not_available You don't have a temperature.
not_available Are you sure? Maybe you should stick a thermometer up my ass.
not_available Go play in your room.
not_available No, honey, Taylor.
not_available You stay here.
not_available Mama needs you.
not_available Go.
not_available You've got a choice to make.
not_available You can either let me check you into a drug rehab I already told you.
not_available I went to rehab in Oakland.
not_available I am clean.
not_available What the fuck? I'll call the station, we'll search this house, and if we find anything you'll face charges.
not_available You got that? It's your choice.
not_available You sound just like Daddy, you know that? You know that? You done gone and turned into Daddy! What are you gonna do next? Slap me so hard I can't hear out of one ear for the next dayanda
not_available half? You remember that? It's your choice, Karla.
not_available God damn it.
not_available You need help.
not_available I can get you help.
not_available I'll find you the best help there is.
not_available I swear to you I will.
not_available I said okay.
not_available Okay, but it has to be outpatient.
not_available I'm not leaving Taylor again.
not_available So No major facial damage.
not_available That's a plus.
not_available I'm gonna have to do some major plug
not_available ins on the top of the head here, though.
not_available It's a good thing he's not bald.
not_available Why's that? It'd be a little hard to wig him since everybody remembered him with his head all nice and shiny, you know? Hello? Oh, for Christ's sake! I gotta swing by Appleby and pick up the Parliament.
not_available You probably need some help with that.
not_available Not really.
not_available Yes, really.
not_available Hello? Anyone! Please, I'm so bored.
not_available That's not my problem, pal.
not_available He's gotta be driving you crazy.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Actually, our relationship has reached a whole new level.
not_available How so? Well, it's not just about the sex anymore.
not_available There's more intimacy.
not_available He's letting his guard down.
not_available He's allowing me to see him at his most vulnerable.
not_available Well, that's great, cupcake.
not_available Clarify one thing for me.
not_available He is bedridden, right? Hello? Who is there? Can you help me? That depends on what you want.
not_available I ate already my lunch, and I am starving.
not_available I cannot walk.
not_available She is my favorite, this one.
not_available Such a bitch.
not_available She would be a wildcat in love I think.
not_available She's the kind that leaves scratch marks all over your body.
not_available Yeah, but she's, like, 60.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Besides, I think she's Latin.
not_available They're always hot
not_available blooded.
not_available What kind of sandwich this is? 
not_available Pork.
not_available It is not so good.
not_available Needs salt.
not_available Lf you don't like it, I'll eat it.
not_available No, I will eat.
not_available It was supposed to be mine anyway.
not_available What happened to your face? 
not_available It's none of your fucking business, pal.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I'm his wife.
not_available He should be buried with me.
not_available Well, unfortunately, he stipulated in his pre
not_available need contract that he was to be buried with his former wife.
not_available That's gotta be a mistake.
not_available He must've made those arrangements before he married me.
not_available This is dated October of '98.
not_available I never even knew he had done this.
not_available Neither did his daughters.
not_available God, I'm sure they just love it, though.
not_available They've always hated me.
not_available They thought their daddy was too good for me.
not_available And apparently, so did he.
not_available I'm sure that's not true.
not_available So this thing's all signed, sealed, and paid for? There's no recourse for me.
not_available Well, actually, it hasn't been paid in full.
not_available Really? You know, he did leave everything to me and I hope you don't think I'm gonna be paying for such a blatant slap in my face.
not_available What the hell is Mom doing in Belize? She's on some sort of cruise for the recently separated.
not_available Maybe it's for people who want to quit smoking.
not_available What a freak.
not_available I'm fine with water.
not_available Have you spoken to Dad? Yeah, right.
not_available So what's with you living with her? Well, it sure beats the hospital.
not_available You know, Bren, I still go in three times a week to see Dr.
not_available Hanover.
not_available She's great.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah, she's a total genius.
not_available She's helped me look at a lot of my shit.
not_available That's good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, how's Nate? He's not so great.
not_available He was recently diagnosed with this brain condition and he's had a couple of seizures, actually.
not_available He could have a stroke.
not_available Shit! 
not_available That sucks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, now I know why you're marrying him.
not_available Fuck you! Wow, that hit a nerve.
not_available Must be true.
not_available No, I'm just a little surprised at how randomly cruel you can be.
not_available I guess I'd forgotten what a kick you get out of that.
not_available See, this is what you do.
not_available You invalidate anything I say that might challenge your authority.
not_available You learned it from Mom.
not_available The same way that you learned to explain everything to me 
not_available like I'm an idiot from Dad.
not_available No, I learned that from you.
not_available Apparently you're still angry at me for committing you.
not_available No.
not_available That was the best thing that could have happened to me.
not_available Then why wouldn't you see me or take my calls or e
not_available mail? Because Dr.
not_available Hanover suggested that I might be able to do more constructive work if I cut things off with you for a while.
not_available Because you have contributed a lot to my pathology.
not_available You have a medical condition.
not_available It's not just about pharmaceuticals.
not_available I never developed any functional way to deal with the world because you kept me from it.
not_available I've done a real number on you.
not_available You were always there, looking out for me, protecting me, being strong for me.
not_available I never learned how to take care of myself.
not_available I mean, shit, Brenda, I've never even had a real girlfriend.
not_available I never let you have a girlfriend? That's really You fucking asshole! I thought we could have a rational discussion.
not_available How dare you blame me for that, Billy? I'm not saying that you did it on purpose.
not_available But I do think we need to disengage from each other because our relationship is really toxic.
not_available Okay.
not_available And I don't know how long it needs to last.
not_available Probably a very long time.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Anyway I have somewhere I have to be, but thank you for the grub.
not_available Hey, you look nice.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where you going? 
not_available To meet a friend.
not_available Billy Chenowith? Yeah.
not_available I don't think you should be seeing him.
not_available I'll just file that under "couldn't possibly matter less." He can be dangerous.
not_available I can take care of myself, Nate.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you armed, in case he pulls a knife on you? How much time have you spent with him? 
not_available How much time have you spent with him? Enough to know he isn't a drooling psychopath.
not_available He's got a disease.
not_available He went through a period where he went off his medication because he was fucked up and in denial about it.
not_available It's under control now.
not_available Sound familiar? It was very slow at work today.
not_available It is because I wasn't there.
not_available You and Robbie are lazy.
not_available That is not true.
not_available Why, just today I reorganized the ribbons, I cleaned the inside of the cash register and I spent a couple of hours looking at the books.
not_available That is not your job.
not_available No, and it's apparently not yours, either.
not_available I've never seen a messier, more incoherent bookkeeping system.
not_available I thought my husband was bad.
not_available I don't want you messing with my books.
not_available This is my personal finances.
not_available None of your business.
not_available May I remind you that I've been paying your medical bills? I will pay back.
not_available You're gonna be in big trouble if you get audited.
not_available That bullshit.
not_available Language.
not_available So, listen, I really wanted to thank you.
not_available For what? For being the only person who kept in touch with me while I was in the home for the tragically inappropriate.
not_available Are you kidding me? Your e
not_available mails were totally brilliant.
not_available I saved them all.
not_available It was the only thing that kept me going.
not_available I know I would never have given me a second chance after the way I treated you the first time we met.
not_available So, no word from Gabe at all? 
not_available Nada.
not_available Which is fine.
not_available Like, seriously, good riddance.
not_available It was so obvious he was never gonna take charge of his life, you know? Well, it's hard.
not_available Few people ever do.
not_available Yeah, but most people are able to avoid becoming drug
not_available addict criminals.
not_available Yeah, most people.
not_available Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I'm not sure.
not_available Why? Well, I need some help with this project and there's not really anybody else I can ask.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah? Cool.
not_available We're back with our exclusive visit with one of the year's happiest and sexiest couples, David and Keith Fisher
not_available Charles.
not_available So guys, tell me, how do you do it? 
not_available Well, Leeza, it takes a lot of work.
not_available It's not that much work.
not_available He's right.
not_available We've done all the work.
not_available I think people don't appreciate how important that is.
not_available No, they really don't.
not_available Now, you've got kids.
not_available How many? 
not_available Two.
not_available And we're talking about a third.
not_available Yeah, we're talking about a third.
not_available I think the key is to do everything together from PTA meetings to the White Party in Palm Springs.
not_available Togetherness is the key.
not_available We're a partnership.
not_available We're a team.
not_available How long have I been asleep? 
not_available About an hour I think.
not_available Shit.
not_available I'm never gonna get back to sleep tonight.
not_available Why didn't you wake me up? Because you're totally sleep
not_available deprived.
not_available You should take it where you can get it.
not_available Are you staying here tonight? 
not_available I was planning on it.
not_available Would you rather I didn't? 
not_available Maybe I don't know.
not_available Maybe we're moving a little too fast.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can go home.
not_available I mean, it's just that we've spent the last six nights together.
not_available Yeah, sure, no problem.
not_available Call me tomorrow.
not_available What? 
not_available It's what our father wanted.
not_available No, it's what you want.
not_available Because you've never liked me.
not_available Well, you got that right.
not_available You couldn't control your father when he was alive and now you're trying to do it when he's dead.
not_available It was his decision.
not_available There is a significant unpaid balance on the account.
not_available We'll pay for it! Take money from them, you'll hear from my attorney.
not_available I really don't think that's necessary.
not_available No? I gave the last six years of my life to that man and contrary to what these stupid bitches think I really did love him, and I will not be humiliated like this! Well, if you do not follow our father's instructions exactly you'll hear from our attorney.
not_available Who used to work for Disney.
not_available Bring it on, ferret face! Fuck you, you golddigging slut! 
not_available How dare you! There are naked pictures of you on the Internet.
not_available My son showed them to me.
not_available Shut up, all of you! Shut the fuck up! Jesus Christ, a man died.
not_available Your husband.
not_available Your father.
not_available He lived a life, and now he's dead.
not_available Show some respect.
not_available And if you really loved him, and I believe you did you'll give him what he wanted.
not_available If you don't, then you never really loved him.
not_available It's as simple as that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And if I so much as get a phone call from anybody's lawyer we'll give the body back and the three of you can tear him to pieces like fucking jackals if you want to.
not_available It's not your decision.
not_available God! Oh, my God.
not_available Hey, I'm right here, okay? It's okay.
not_available What happened to me, Keith? I used to be okay.
not_available I used to be able to live without all this sadness without all this 
not_available never having any hope.
not_available You're here, aren't you? And my baby she's so precious.
not_available I am such a bad mother.
not_available Hey, look at me.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available I've seen worse.
not_available Believe me, I have.
not_available None of it's her fault.
not_available She doesn't deserve this.
not_available Look, let's just put it all behind you, okay? I wish we could just start over.
not_available Nate, hi.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm just Remember when I told you about that movie producer who was looking for a vegan chef? I finally caved in and took the job.
not_available Cool.
not_available Yeah, finally sold out.
not_available So, you live here now? 
not_available Well, the Palisades.
not_available Since when? Since right after Christmas.
not_available I didn't want to bother you.
not_available You have a whole new life and all.
not_available Lisa, come on, we're friends.
not_available There's a great juice bar here.
not_available Let's get caught up, okay? Okay.
not_available "Of all the lies we're fed, on which we gorge in our comfort
not_available addicted world "none is more insidious than the lie of romance.
not_available "The seductive but infantile notion "that somewhere there exists someone to complement us in every way.
not_available "Someone who will make us complete.
not_available "Of course, this illusion "keeps us from ever being complete in and of ourselves "and eventually encourages us "to despise our shortcomings, our flaws "everything in which our humanity lies.
not_available "Our humanity, without which, of course "we are nothing." It's strange.
not_available I mean, she's a strict vegan but she drinks like a fish and she does a lot of blow.
not_available But she's nice to me, and I needed to make some real money for a change.
not_available So, what's new with you? Well, not much.
not_available Same old same old, you know.
not_available How's Brenda? 
not_available She's great.
not_available We're We're engaged.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Yeah, I know, it's What about you? You seeing anybody? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available By the way, I'm pregnant.
not_available Wow, that's great! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Five months.
not_available She's a kicker.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I don't expect anything from you.
not_available I don't expect anything at all.
not_available Lisa, I don't Don't you remember when you came to Seattle last August and you fucked me? Then you left the next day like it didn't mean a goddamn thing? It did mean something to you 'cause you were crying like a baby.
not_available That's not the reason I was crying.
not_available You were crying 'cause you knew you were home.
not_available Because you missed me.
not_available Because you knew that you and I should be together.
not_available Then you fucked me.
not_available Then you chickened out the next day and I saw you for exactly who you 
are A coward who was never going to own up to the way he really felt about me.
not_available How could you not tell me about this? Because we already went through this once before.
not_available But this time, I'm gonna do it.
not_available I'm gonna have it without you.
not_available I don't know Congratulations, you know, on the whole getting married thing.
not_available She must be out of her fucking mind.
not_available Just give me Don't.
not_available Come on in.
not_available All right, let me show you.
not_available You can put your purse down if you like.
not_available Here it is.
not_available This is your focus, and this is your zoom.
not_available That's pretty much it.
not_available So here you go.
not_available You'll get a feel for it.
not_available Okay, what do you want me to do? Just, you know, follow your instincts.
not_available Relax.
not_available Don't think about yourself at all.
not_available I know that's impossible for a 1 7year
not_available old.
not_available Eighteen.
not_available What you don't know is you're going to be 18 for the rest of your life.
not_available I've tried to do self
not_available portraits before but they always turn out so contrived, like I'm trying to be some version of myself.
not_available So fucking juvenile.
not_available And I really want to see it, you know? I want to.
not_available I need to see what I've done.
not_available And I think it really is impossible for somebody to see themselves.
not_available You need someone else's eyes.
not_available I need somebody else to see me.
not_available Somebody who isn't Brenda.
not_available She sees things a little too darkly.
not_available I mean, I don't need any help going there.
not_available Besides, I've looked through her eyes enough for one lifetime, you know.
not_available What are you seeing? I'm on your scar, really close up.
not_available What does it look like? Like the surface of the moon.
not_available That's good.
not_available That's the thing about Narcissus.
not_available It's not that he's so fucking in love with himself, because he isn't at all.
not_available Fucking hates himself.
not_available It's that without that reflection looking back at him he doesn't exist.
not_available Billy, are you okay? Yeah.
not_available Don't be freaked out.
not_available This is good.
not_available This is exactly what I needed to happen.
not_available I'm fucking crying.
not_available Oh, God, I'm sorry, this is intense.
not_available You can go.
not_available It's okay, I'll be all right, I swear.
not_available Nikolai? 
not_available I told you, he's not here.
not_available Where is Nikolai? 
not_available He's not in today.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Where is he? He's at home.
not_available No.
not_available There is no one at his house.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available I'm a friend of his.
not_available I have something for him.
not_available I need to know where he is.
not_available He's in the hospital.
not_available He was robbed and beaten up and the police are investigating.
not_available You tell You tell Nikolai that Yuri says he is sorry and hopes he will be better very soon.
not_available I take this for my mother.
not_available Way to go, buddy boy.
not_available Nice to know you're not shooting blanks, right? Oh, God, what the fuck am I going to do? You don't have to do anything.
not_available That's the beauty part.
not_available No, I have to tell Brenda.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available I can't keep something like this from her.
