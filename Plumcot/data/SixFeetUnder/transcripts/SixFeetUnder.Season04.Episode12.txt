not_available We don't get reception up here.
not_available Just wait for the rescue teams.
not_available Shit.
not_available Shit.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available You'll make it worse! 
not_available We have to do something.
not_available Let's all try to pry this door open one more time.
not_available Give it everything we got.
not_available Okay, go.
not_available We're gonna drop 10 floors, and we're all gonna die! We could use a little more Bruce Willis attitude, mister.
not_available Let me out.
not_available Here.
not_available Just let me out! Will you just let me out? You'll be fine.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Get up there, we'll give you a boost.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll take the stairs.
not_available I'll get some help.
not_available Oh! Oh my God.
not_available Oh my God! We're all gonna die! 
not_available Stop it! Stop it! Okay, somebody grab my hand.
not_available I'll go.
not_available No, she should go first! Go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh my God! 
not_available Ken, get in here! No no no! Let me go.
not_available Don't pull me back in! No! No! No! Oh my God! What happened?! Go find out what happened! Let's both go.
not_available I think we should stay together.
not_available I'm too scared.
not_available George, the glass, put on your slippers.
not_available George.
not_available What did you do? George.
not_available George.
not_available George.
not_available George.
not_available I'm awake.
not_available You were whimpering and paddling with your feet.
not_available What were you dreaming about? I don't remember.
not_available Yeah, it's at the Bellandi Gallery downtown.
not_available Where Jimmy was.
not_available You got my postcard, right? Okay, well, call me if you do need directions.
not_available All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Oh, bring cool people.
not_available Oh, hi, Edie.
not_available It's Claire.
not_available Listen, tomorrow is my show.
not_available I know you probably won't be there, but I wish you would be there.
not_available Okay, never mind.
not_available I broke up with Russell.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why do you think? He's a big drama queen.
not_available Everything's so heavy and negative.
not_available He's such a fucking victim.
not_available Yeah, really.
not_available He got in my face about your show.
not_available Oh, God, he's unbelievable.
not_available I was like, "Whoever's idea it was and I don't fucking care, Claire ran with it." I was like, "Adapt, dude." Thank you for defending my honor.
not_available Hey, I brought you a present.
not_available Happy fame.
not_available Oh my God, is that cocaine? This is so disco! 
not_available Let's do a few lines.
not_available Oh, shit, I want to, but I have to go to my gallery and meet some, like, huge movie star.
not_available Seriously? What movie star? I don't know.
not_available Some, like, celebrity woman wants to buy my stuff.
not_available You're getting way too cool for me.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available No, it's the fishtail.
not_available It's a fishtail! 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm calling the lawyer again.
not_available Where's the phone? You're too clever.
not_available He already told you.
not_available Yeah, I know he already said that Barb has no right to custody, but I just saw this article on the internet.
not_available You're the father.
not_available Barb's the aunt.
not_available Maya's staying right here where she is.
not_available You're not taking this seriously.
not_available Yes, I am, but it doesn't do us any good to live in this constant state of panic.
not_available That's easy for you to say.
not_available Maya's not yours.
not_available Yes, can you reach Mr.
not_available Sutcliffe for me, please? Nate Fisher.
not_available It's an emergency.
not_available This isn't about Maya.
not_available It's about your emotions and how you deal with them.
not_available Would you stop using the therapy voice? It drives me nuts.
not_available How would you know? You've never tried therapy.
not_available I don't need therapy.
not_available It's not my fault there's a disaster every time I blink.
not_available What's with this book? It's macabre.
not_available Just get rid of it or put it away.
not_available Michaela gave it to me to give to David.
not_available I keep forgetting about it.
not_available I really wish you'd consider it.
not_available Look, everything is under control! Of course it is.
not_available Number three.
not_available Excuse me? That's him, number three.
not_available David.
not_available David, it's almost 11:00.
not_available Are you gonna get up? Yeah.
not_available What? I'm still replaying that fucking look he gave me.
not_available Do you want to talk about it? No, I don't want to talk about it.
not_available I've told you about it 900 times.
not_available I've told my therapist about it 900 times.
not_available I want to fucking move on and leave it behind me.
not_available So do it.
not_available You can.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I'm fucking stuck.
not_available If you could do anything, what would you do? I'd I'd tell him what I think of him and what he did to me.
not_available That evil, evil fuck.
not_available Well, you can do that.
not_available I know, I said it all to the therapy pillow.
not_available No, you can visit him in jail.
not_available What?! Maybe he'll see you, maybe he won't, but you can try.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available I think it would be extremely self
not_available destructive to put myself in that situation! I can't believe you'd even suggest it to me.
not_available Two hours, great! Let me know when you're on the ground and I'll come meet you.
not_available Me too.
not_available Bye.
not_available My daughter's on her way to Hawaii for a conference and she has a layover this afternoon.
not_available Would you like to meet her for lunch? Maggie? Really? Oh, yes! This is so exciting! What kind of conference? I don't know anything about her.
not_available What does she do? Pharmaceutical rep.
not_available You're proud of her.
not_available I can tell.
not_available She's the apple of your eye.
not_available I know you're doing this for me, too, George.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You'll like her.
not_available I can't wait! I'm not the person who's supposed to be here.
not_available We've been divorced for ages.
not_available He must have a new wife or a girlfriend.
not_available You were his emergency contact.
not_available He worked at the same place for 25 years.
not_available I'm sure he just forgot to change the form.
not_available Maybe he still loved you.
not_available He's a very nice guy, but you know I've moved on.
not_available I'm sorry, but there are decisions about the funeral that have to be made.
not_available Yes, well, I don't want to make them! Now there must be someone else who can deal with this.
not_available 'Cause I can't believe it! How can you get killed by an elevator? Well, there were three other people trapped inside.
not_available He tried to get them out and the elevator tore him in half.
not_available I hit a new low.
not_available I made the bereaved vomit.
not_available Don't tell me we have to send this guy somewhere else.
not_available I just embalmed him.
not_available No no, we worked it out.
not_available I think it's weird we don't sew him together.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Once he's in the casket dressed with a little padding, can't even tell the difference.
not_available Here, it's a present from Michaela.
not_available What a sweet kid.
not_available Little morbid, but sweet.
not_available So unlike her mother, that crazy bitch from hell.
not_available What's that? It's Roger Pasquese.
not_available Does that ring a bell? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, it does.
not_available How are you, Keith? I'm fine.
not_available A little surprised.
not_available How are you? I'm well, thank you.
not_available Enjoying the day.
not_available Carpe diem.
not_available Yeah, that's great.
not_available What's up? I'm taking a break from angry ugly white men.
not_available Let's take it easy now, huh? Okay, seriously.
not_available I have a business proposition for you and I'd like for us to meet.
not_available What do you say you come to my house and we talk? Probably not.
not_available Nothing against you.
not_available It just doesn't seem like a very good idea.
not_available But thanks, anyway.
not_available You know, certain papers have yet to be signed.
not_available Our lawsuit might rear its ugly head again.
not_available Roger, we had an agreement.
not_available I don't think a blowjob is legal or binding.
not_available How about tomorrow afternoon? I'll think about it.
not_available Well, you see, Nicole, Claire has a plurality of influences at work here.
not_available They're portraits, an ancient, classical form.
not_available And they're photographs, which are essentially modern.
not_available And then they're torn to bits.
not_available A nod to the Dadaists, and the Cubists as well.
not_available Then the pieces are reassembled for a deconstructed mix of detachment and tenderness which seems to me to be very new millennium.
not_available Anything you'd like to add, Claire? Um, well what you said is part of it.
not_available Of course, it's more involved than that.
not_available I totally get it.
not_available It reminds me of paper dolls and bad relationships and lies people tell about stupid things.
not_available Right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Is this all you have? 
not_available As a matter of fact, she's working hard on a whole new series.
not_available It looks very promising.
not_available Cool, when can I see it? Soon.
not_available Very soon.
not_available I have to figure out some stuff.
not_available We used to come to this place when I was a girl.
not_available Sarah and I would eat Thousand Island dressing all by itself.
not_available What a treat! 
not_available I like this place.
not_available The menu never changes.
not_available And this building has stood through all the mudslides, fires, earthquakes.
not_available Yes, it's comforting.
not_available Maggie! Daddy! 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh, sweetie, oh, it's great to see you.
not_available You, too.
not_available This is wonderful.
not_available Oh, what a treat.
not_available With managed care the way that it is, most of these samples that I haul around end up going to patients who can't pay for prescriptions, so everybody at the doctor's office is glad to see Maggie.
not_available So what's new in antibiotics? Here.
not_available A course of this will knock out just about anything.
not_available But you have to take the whole seven days.
not_available Any side effects? Minimal.
not_available Maybe a little nausea, so take it with food.
not_available Thanks, hon.
not_available Are you sick? No.
not_available I just want to be prepared.
not_available Of course, these things won't touch anything viral.
not_available Did you know that you can order potassium iodide off the internet now? 
not_available Oh, that's great.
not_available That is so much more convenient.
not_available What's potassium iodide? Anti
not_available radiation.
not_available If you take it in time, it blocks the thyroid's uptake of airborne radioactive iodine from a nuclear accident.
not_available Let's not worry today, Dad.
not_available We're okay today.
not_available Of course we are.
not_available Okay, I'd like to talk about this morning.
not_available What about it? Well, besides the fact that your attitude to therapy is totally medieval, you have really big emotions, Nate, and they're not that easy to live with.
not_available You know? Sometimes you dump them all on me and it's not fair.
not_available Maybe if I got a little support for what I'm going through, that's not how it would feel to you.
not_available You have got to be kidding, right? All I do is support you.
not_available It's like a full
not_available time job.
not_available What are you looking at? I can't compete with a dead woman.
not_available Brian and I just adored him.
not_available He took us hiking, camping Camping? I love camping! We'll have to go, too.
not_available He taught us campfire songs.
not_available Campfire songs? You? 
not_available Yeah, a couple.
not_available Remember? # Above the plain of gold and green # # A young boy's head is plainly seen # # Ahooya, hooya, hooyaya # # Swiftly flowing river # # Ahooya, hooya, hooya
not_available ya # # Swiftly flowing river.
not_available # It was kid heaven.
not_available Oh, George.
not_available If you ladies will excuse me Well, thank God he shaved for you.
not_available He used to have a big scraggly beard.
not_available A beard? I can't picture it.
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available Exactly.
not_available He looked like he just walked out of the Bible.
not_available So how's he been? Fine.
not_available No problems? You can tell me.
not_available What do you mean? Ruth, I want you to have all my numbers.
not_available If you need me, call.
not_available Anywhere, anytime.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available He trusts me.
not_available Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? 
not_available If it isn't too personal.
not_available Are those whiskers your own? No one else has claimed them.
not_available Do you think I should? I can't tell you what to do.
not_available What do you mean? You love to tell me what to do.
not_available This is different.
not_available One more question were you followed by the police? That's just the trouble.
not_available Nobody wants me.
not_available Maybe if I see him and tell him how I feel, 
not_available I can finally get my balls back.
not_available You have balls.
not_available Yeah yeah.
not_available Look, if you decide to go, I'll go with you.
not_available No, I have to handle this alone.
not_available I'm going.
not_available I just said I know what you said.
not_available The same thing you said when I was on the road.
not_available "I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine." But you weren't.
not_available You weren't honest with me.
not_available I wasn't honest with myself.
not_available I did the best I could.
not_available I know.
not_available But, I still don't know when to believe you.
not_available I'm not taking any chances.
not_available Oh, come on, guys.
not_available Look at this mess.
not_available You're supposed to be helping me out here.
not_available And you're sitting too close to that television.
not_available Get away from it.
not_available Garbage men, come on.
not_available Come help Mommy out.
not_available Yes, very good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Could you turn off the light and go to sleep? Can't.
not_available Yes, you can, if you quit suckin' weed and lie down.
not_available I have to make sure I invited everybody on my list.
not_available Plus, I'm not tired.
not_available I'm all buzzy.
not_available Did you get into that blow without me? No, look, it's my first exhibition.
not_available There's all this stress.
not_available Claire.
not_available One night.
not_available Some pictures.
not_available A party.
not_available I think you can deal.
not_available Hey, Bren! 
not_available Shh, Maya's still asleep.
not_available Check this out, this is what Lisa wore.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available No no no, when she died.
not_available She bought this shirt a week before she died.
not_available Oh, Nate.
not_available No, I know it.
not_available Don't do this to yourself.
not_available She showed it to me.
not_available She asked me if I liked the color.
not_available This is the shirt.
not_available And this is the beach where she disappeared.
not_available So how can Michaela have sent me this picture of Lisa at this beach when Lisa never made it to Santa Cruz? I don't know.
not_available There's probably a simple explanation.
not_available Then I want to fucking hear it.
not_available I'm going up there.
not_available Oh God, this is never going to end.
not_available Don't you fucking realize what's going on here? There was somebody there.
not_available Somebody took this picture.
not_available Okay, why don't you call the little girl and just ask her? 
not_available No, I'm going up there.
not_available The way they feel about me, do you think they're gonna just give her the phone? "Here's Uncle Nate." How do you think they're going to feel when you turn up out of nowhere sounding like a crazy man? Thanks for the support.
not_available This is exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available Oh, come on, this is ridiculous.
not_available You're driving up there all because of some random snapshot.
not_available I don't need your permission.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Yeah, I don't.
not_available So I'm gonna take Maya to my mother's house.
not_available Why? Well, because she's never spent the night here without me.
not_available Nate, if you don't think that I can take care of Maya, there's not really a whole lot of point to the three of us living together.
not_available Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just, you know I have to do this.
not_available Every day it seems harder to breathe.
not_available Is that my imagination? No.
not_available The air is poison, George.
not_available It's a scientific fact.
not_available They took blood samples from a remote village of Indians in Bolivia.
not_available Alto Los Zarzos.
not_available Even they were contaminated.
not_available There are chemicals in the rain.
not_available I keep thinking any minute something terrible will happen.
not_available It's already happening.
not_available Yes, I know, but Our days are numbered.
not_available It's only a matter of time.
not_available But I truly believe if we prepare Don't be naive, George.
not_available You weren't brought up that way.
not_available There's no hope.
not_available Stop saying that! Even if it's true, I can't give up.
not_available No! No, I won't.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yes, yeah.
not_available No.
not_available Could you could you sit with me? Okay.
not_available The way he died, oh God.
not_available God, it's awful.
not_available I can't stop thinking about it.
not_available If there was anyone who deserved to go in their sleep, it was Ken.
not_available It's the way that Ken lived that's important.
not_available We weren't close anymore.
not_available He was your husband once.
not_available Honestly, when I got the call I had to think, "Ken, Ken who?" Then I remembered.
not_available Every minute we spent together, I remember everything.
not_available I'm going to bury him with the rest of my family.
not_available That's the way it should be, don't you think? Yes, yes I do.
not_available Even if I marry again, when I'm dead I want Ken there too.
not_available Family's family.
not_available Divorce doesn't change that.
not_available Not divorce, not death, not anything.
not_available When people get in your heart They stay for good.
not_available Maggie, this is Ruth.
not_available I'm very sorry to bother you in Waikiki, but please call me back.
not_available I'm worried about your father.
not_available Mr.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Can I see a valid passport, a visa, alien registration card or valid California driver's license? You may take in one handkerchief, an unopened pack of tissue, $30 in coins and $1 bills only.
not_available You may not take in cameras, cell phones unless approved prior to entering the visiting room.
not_available I don't have anything.
not_available Are you wearing implants or prosthetic devices? No.
not_available Please proceed down the hall to the next officer.
not_available He'll direct you to the metal detector.
not_available Sir, please proceed down the hall.
not_available God, what if a lot of people come? They're all going to be looking at me.
not_available Isn't that what you want? I don't know.
not_available I haven't done much coke.
not_available I don't want it to make me more nervous than I already am.
not_available No, it'll help.
not_available This shit's not cut with meth.
not_available It's pretty smooth.
not_available It makes you feel really important for about 20 minutes.
not_available Gimme.
not_available I'll hang onto it if you want.
not_available I thought it was a present.
not_available It is, but since it's your special night I could be like, the keeper of it.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah? Okay.
not_available It's nice.
not_available What? 
not_available I just want to look.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'll meet you back here in a half hour for a little Okay.
not_available # We got friends # # We got lots of friends # # We got feelings for each other once again.
not_available # The boys aren't here.
not_available They're at a birthday party.
not_available But if you call, you could probably stop over.
not_available It's you I came to see.
not_available Well, I gotta go soon.
not_available Okay.
not_available Vanessa I apologize.
not_available This is this is all my fault.
not_available All my fault.
not_available What I gave Sophia, the time and the attention The money.
not_available The intimacy.
not_available I had no right.
not_available It all belonged to you and the kids.
not_available Even if you hadn't slept with her, it was adultery.
not_available Being close to somebody else when you're the most important person in my life, yes, that was adultery.
not_available I betrayed my marriage.
not_available I was so wrong.
not_available And I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart.
not_available You finally said it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So I'll come back home and we'll go back to being ourselves again, okay? We can't go back.
not_available Everything has changed.
not_available I never expected this.
not_available And I feel really sad, but it feels right.
not_available No.
not_available You know that we got together so young.
not_available Being on my own is good for me now.
not_available And I think that maybe it's good for you too.
not_available No.
not_available No no, it is definitely not good.
not_available Don't you love me anymore? Of course I love you.
not_available It's just not like before.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available I'm not trying to hurt you, Rico, I swear to God.
not_available I want a divorce.
not_available You don't mean it.
not_available You don't mean it.
not_available Who are you? David Fisher.
not_available Remember me? Yeah, I think so.
not_available How ya doing? How do you think I am? I don't know.
not_available You look pretty good compared to everybody else I see.
not_available I hope you're happy here behind bars where you belong.
not_available Nobody belongs here, man.
not_available You ever been through detox? It's like dying.
not_available Every fucking minute you die.
not_available Good.
not_available Did you bring me something? No, I hate you.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Here we go.
not_available You soaked me with gasoline.
not_available You beat me and stuck a gun in my mouth.
not_available Well, yeah, you drove me all over hell with a dead chick farting in the back of your van.
not_available What was I supposed to do? You scared me shitless.
not_available Now I walk around all the time feeling like everybody's gonna humiliate and murder me.
not_available Well, they are.
not_available So I did you a favor.
not_available Now you'll be a little more careful, won't you? Stop your fucking games for once, you It's your game.
not_available You come here and visit me and you don't bring anything.
not_available You just want to shit on me and break me down, like everybody else.
not_available Well I won't let you.
not_available Apologize to me.
not_available For defending myself? Fuck you.
not_available You have a family, right? You have people looking out for you? Yeah, but All I have is you, David, and you hate me.
not_available You made a special trip up here to tell me that you hate me.
not_available I think I'm the one that deserves a goddamn apology.
not_available You really are sick.
not_available I'm not the one who sits in jail when he doesn't have to.
not_available Well, at least you know how I feel.
not_available And you know how I feel.
not_available Look, you can come visit me again if you want to.
not_available No, I won't be back.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, maybe when I get paroled you can come and take me out to lunch.
not_available Probably not.
not_available I'm pretty busy.
not_available I don't think you can be an artist without experiencing major suffering.
not_available And you have to be super
not_available aware of the suffering around you.
not_available And yeah, I've been influenced by Dada and Cubism, but I also feel like I've added detachment and tenderness, for the new millennium.
not_available This is fucking fantastic.
not_available Everybody loves my shit.
not_available There's somebody in here! 
not_available Have you talked to Jimmy? No, every time I see him, somebody grabs me and wants to talk about the pictures.
not_available You should at least get him high.
not_available Here, you do it.
not_available How do you think it's going? What? 
not_available My show, whore.
not_available Oh.
not_available Fine, whore.
not_available What are people saying? I don't know.
not_available I'm just hanging out with my friends.
not_available Come on, I wanna know what they're saying.
not_available And don't do it all.
not_available Save some for me.
not_available Ow! Maya.
not_available What are you doing? Everyone is very impressed with Claire's pictures.
not_available You must be very proud.
not_available I certainly am.
not_available I'm proud of all my children.
not_available Nate and I back together again.
not_available That must seem very sudden.
not_available I married my husband almost right after we met.
not_available Sudden is something I understand now.
not_available It's not always best.
not_available But, sometimes it is.
not_available Brenda, I'm glad Nate is with someone, and I hope the three of you are very happy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He says you're studying psychology.
not_available Yes, I am going to be a cognitive therapist.
not_available What does it mean when a person starts talking to himself out of nowhere? None of your pieces have names.
not_available How come? I couldn't think of any.
not_available Come on, don't bullshit me.
not_available I'm actually interested.
not_available Well I feel like when you give something a name people take your word for it.
not_available Which is okay for some things, but not these.
not_available I didn't want to tell anybody what to see.
not_available It's like music.
not_available That's called "Opus 15" or "Three
not_available Part Invention in A Minor." What's that about? I want you to really look at it and deal with it on your own.
not_available You know, it's like life.
not_available It's kinda scary.
not_available With no guide, I don't know where I'll end up.
not_available You know what? I have no fucking idea what these pictures mean.
not_available I know.
not_available Isn't it great? 
not_available Roger, you don't need a bodyguard.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Look, I have enemies.
not_available There are fuckers out there that would do anything to get me.
not_available Anything.
not_available I just want to feel safe.
not_available And I will pay you a shitload of money.
not_available Well, I couldn't work for you exclusively.
not_available It would have to be a freelance, whenl
not_available can situation.
not_available I'm sure we can figure something out.
not_available We'll draw up a contract.
not_available First, I need something in writing that says you're going to drop our lawsuit.
not_available Forever.
not_available Oh, all right.
not_available Is that one of the people you're afraid of? No, that's Steve.
not_available He stays in the guesthouse sometimes.
not_available Well? I'll give it serious consideration.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd be here.
not_available Of course I'm here.
not_available You were my student, my assistant.
not_available You think that means nothing to me? It's my responsibility and my pleasure to support you, Claire.
not_available Wow.
not_available Besides, you're competition now.
not_available Though I thought it would be Russell first in this position.
not_available Well, you were wrong.
not_available Because it's me.
not_available And so it all begins.
not_available With the first success, corruption.
not_available It's corrupt to feel like I finally did something right? Actually, yes, it is.
not_available You'll see.
not_available But so what? Who wants to be a saint, right? Not me.
not_available No, no one does.
not_available And the work suffers.
not_available I toast you with this shitty wine.
not_available Hello there.
not_available Well, you look recovered.
not_available I feel fabulous.
not_available Everyone should drop an organ.
not_available After the first shock, it's positively liberating.
not_available So, is this the fruit of Nate's loins? Maya, this is Margaret.
not_available Look, don't take this personally, but I don't think she likes you.
not_available She hardly knows you're here.
not_available Margaret can't help trying to make us feel bad about ourselves.
not_available You know, Brenda, it's unethical to use an innocent child to express your resentment.
not_available Claire, do you do commissions? Uh, yes.
not_available Well, I want you to photograph Olivier and me and do that thing you do, only mix all our pieces together.
not_available That will be a portrait.
not_available Kudos, darling, you're brilliant.
not_available Later.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There's somebody who may want to buy something.
not_available I'll be back in one minute.
not_available What the fuck? Are you blowing me off? No.
not_available You haven't said shit to me since I got here.
not_available I mean, what the fuck? I think it's pretty fucking rude.
not_available Okay, maybe you didn't realize this, but I'm a little fucking busy right now.
not_available I'm in the middle of my fucking show.
not_available Maybe you don't remember, but I'm the one who fucking got you this fucking show.
not_available Jimmy.
not_available Well, fuck you, then.
not_available Fuck you all.
not_available Hi, Michaela.
not_available Hi, Uncle Nate.
not_available I gave the book to David.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He liked it a lot.
not_available There was a picture in it.
not_available I know.
not_available Where'd the picture come from? Do you know who took it? Why'd you put it in the book? You should talk to my dad.
not_available He's in the office.
not_available Oh God, you freak, when are you gonna let it go? When you admit in public that I am part of your work.
not_available You're not! I created these pieces.
not_available They are mine and people love them.
not_available I love you.
not_available You love you fucked a man and lied about it.
not_available You fucked a woman! 
not_available Not when I was with you! No, you just went and had an abortion without me! Don't you dare go there.
not_available Don't you fucking dare! Is there a problem, guys? You are so deeply irrelevant.
not_available Are you fucking him now? 
not_available All right, Russell.
not_available You fuck Jimmy, get a gallery.
not_available What can Billy Chenowith do for you? You asshole, I fucking hate you.
not_available This has to stop now.
not_available It's time to leave.
not_available Get your hands off.
not_available Just leave.
not_available This needs to stop.
not_available Out.
not_available Are you all right? Take me home.
not_available Are you crazy? If I was you, fella, I'd move on down the road before Barb finds out you're here.
not_available Hoyt, I'll ask you one more time.
not_available Then I'm calling the police.
not_available Whoa whoa whoa! Did you take that picture? She's a Kimmel.
not_available We tend to point cameras at each other.
not_available Somebody obviously took it.
not_available Maybe it was me.
not_available No, I remember this.
not_available This was a couple of years ago.
not_available We had a picnic.
not_available You're a fucking liar.
not_available You were with there with Lisa on the beach the day she died.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, you were.
not_available And this proves it.
not_available You son of a bitch, what did you do to her? Nothing! God, nothing! This was a place that we used to go.
not_available I'd drive south and I'd meet her there.
not_available Alone? Maybe, a few times.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? We had a thing.
not_available It was on and off.
not_available But it was intense.
not_available You know Lisa.
not_available She was intense.
not_available When was this? When we were married? Before.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available She told me what it was like to be your wife.
not_available What the fuck is wrong with you? Why did you put her through all that? You think she just spent her whole life waiting for you? People loved Lisa.
not_available And she loved us back.
not_available You know, she might have killed herself because of you.
not_available Oh, yeah, did you ever think about that? No, she Listen, let's take a walk, okay? This is a big misunderstanding.
not_available No no no! Lisa would never kill herself! I know that.
not_available She might leave me, but she would never leave Maya.
not_available So you tell me what happened on that beach right now.
not_available Right the fuck now! I wanted some time by ourselves.
not_available Lisa said she wasn't into it.
not_available You know, clean slate, never again.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available I couldn't let her tell Barb.
not_available I did not get angry with her.
not_available I played the guitar.
not_available I sang her a so I sang her a song.
not_available And we went our separate ways.
not_available George? George? Have you been here all night? I had to put things in order and I guess I fell asleep.
not_available Didn't mean to worry you.
not_available No harm done.
not_available Come on, let's go back to the house.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Yes, you can, dear.
not_available It's where we live.
not_available No, Ruth.
not_available This is where I live now.
not_available Let's get married and have a baby.
not_available Will you? Yes yes.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available My bougainvillea needs this.
not_available You were brave to face him.
not_available Not really.
not_available There was a guard.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available I thought it would set me free.
not_available But it didn't change anything, except now I know he really is insane.
not_available You're missing the point.
not_available There is no point.
not_available That's the point.
not_available Isn't it? Oh, don't give me this phony existential bullshit.
not_available I expect better from you.
not_available The point's right in front of your face.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, but I don't see it.
not_available You're not even grateful, are you? Grateful? For the worst fucking experience of my life? You hang onto your pain like it means something, like it's worth something.
not_available Well, let me tell you, it's not worth shit.
not_available Let it go.
not_available Infinite possibilities and all he can do is whine.
not_available Well, what am I supposed to do? 
not_available What do you think? You can do anything, you lucky bastard.
not_available You're alive.
not_available What's a little pain compared to that? It can't be so simple.
not_available What if it is?
