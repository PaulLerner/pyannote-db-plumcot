not_available One person did, but i think she was psychic.
not_available Okay, we have one downtown
not_available Oh, I should probably tell you, I have applied for this grant for emerging artists, And if I get it which could be this month, Or even this week, I'd have to stop working, like, immediately.
not_available Yeah well, "temp" is short for temporary.
not_available Okay, here we are.
not_available "Quality control auditing clerk, legal department, Braeden chemical.
not_available Employee verifies accuracy of figures, Business transactions recorded by other workers, As well as support the support staff in general tasks." Sound good ? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, let me call over there and see if they've found anyone yet.

not_available You do have corporate attire, right ? Like a business suit ? Or a nice blouse, a skirt, some hose.
not_available I feel so lucky.
not_available I am just so lucky to have been with her in her final moments.
not_available What a gift.
not_available She was so alive.
not_available And she was happy happy happy, And excited to see the view.
not_available You've never seen such a perfect morning in topanga canyon.

not_available I can't believe Fiona's gone.
not_available You knew her too, huh ? 
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available It's like the second person you've known.
not_available I know.
not_available This just must be the time when everyone's dying.
not_available Nate, it was her time.
not_available I was compelled to bring her.
not_available I was driving through the canyon to go on my hike And my car just pulled over into her driveway.
not_available It's like something said, "bring Fiona with you." The spirit had to have her.
not_available The spirit Works in mysterious ways.
not_available Coroner's office.
not_available She must be ready to go.
not_available You okay ? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available Yep.
not_available Yay ! I love these flowers.
not_available Ooh, they smell good.
not_available Smell them.
not_available If y're upset, tell him.
not_available If he loves you he should be able to hear that.
not_available I don't want to freak him out unnecessarily.
not_available I thought billy was back on his medication.
not_available Ah, that's what he says.
not_available "I'm back on my meds" like that's all that matters.
not_available "Is he on or is he off ?" He's completely oblivious to the fact that we're all just exhausted.
not_available They should call it "bipolar asshole disorder." Just tell him.
not_available Okay ? You need a break.
not_available Yeah, that scares me too.
not_available I feel like I have to keep him close So that if he falls off the edge someone will know.
not_available People are starting to notice I'm pregnant.
not_available Brenda, you look beautiful.
not_available Okay, like a glowing mommy.
not_available Really.
not_available Look, you've got one at home and one in there, You know, put your energy where it deserves to be.
not_available Billy can take care of himself.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Okay.

not_available I don't know.
not_available Are you mad I mean, that I can't help you as much anymore ? 
not_available Tell me.
not_available Don't.
not_available Everything you ever wanted is coming true.
not_available It's just a stupid sitcom.
not_available I'm sure it will get canceled.
not_available I just I don't want it to be weird for you, You know, having a stranger in the house, especially from saskatchewan.
not_available Where the hell is saskatchewan ? 
not_available Near calgary, I think.
not_available To tell you the truth
not_available She can have horns and weigh As long as she brings in the water bottles, can be here when the cable guy comes And starts putting away the groceries that are melting While I'm getting the rest out of the car.
not_available I just need another adult.
not_available Sarah ? Oh, Ruthy, you never gonna believe what happened.
not_available Fiona's dead.
not_available Fiona ? 
not_available Climbing.
not_available I know you hated her for what she did to Nate.
not_available But we've lost her, Ruthy.
not_available She's gone.
not_available I know, it's horrendous.
not_available Jesus, I can't imagine.
not_available There was nothing she could do ? 
not_available No, nothing.
not_available Fell hundreds of feet right down to the bottom of the ravine, And was dead when they pulled her out.
not_available I'm just sick about it.
not_available Fiona was a very close friend of mine.
not_available Very close.
not_available You sure you don't need me to come over there ? I think sarah's in shock.
not_available It's not a pretty scene down here Only appropriate for family Of origin.
not_available People, I need people.
not_available Who can we call ? What did she say ? She's just jabbering.
not_available She's incoherent.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Get me my phone book.
not_available It's in my satchel.
not_available I need to circle the wagons.
not_available Do I need to come down there ? Okay okay, I'll stop by the office when I come to pick the boys up.
not_available Bye.
not_available Durrell pulled a fire alarm.
not_available Now I have to make an appointment with the principal.
not_available I can't tell keith.
not_available He's just looking for more proof these kids are too messed up for us.
not_available The foster's just temporary, right ? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available They try to get them in the right place, have it lead to actual adoption.
not_available That's the ideal.
not_available You want to keep them ? I do.
not_available Anthony's so cute I'd keep him in a heartbeat.
not_available Durrell, on the other hand, is a mess.
not_available But what can you expect ? These kids come from a broken home.
not_available Their dad basically abandoned them.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hey, did I tell you i found my own place ? A two bedroom.
not_available I'm waiting to hear.
not_available Then my boys can stay over.
not_available I can't wait to wake up with them again.
not_available That's what I miss.
not_available Pajamas, and messy hair and their eyes all sleepy.
not_available Well, I hope you get the place, If that's what you want.
not_available What I want Is to be back home.
not_available But I have to take in the reality That it's not going to happen.
not_available I'm sorry about the mess.
not_available I was rushing around this morning.
not_available I didn't get a chance to pick up.
not_available You certainly don't have to clean for me.
not_available That's what I'm here for.
not_available I'm so excited.
not_available I love california.
not_available I practically barfed on the plane.
not_available Well, don't do that.
not_available Can she come in my room ? 
not_available Yeah, hold on, julio.
not_available Uh, so I wrote up a list.
not_available Some of it is common sense, like do the dishes when they start piling up.
not_available And if you could be here tomorrow between 10:00 and 2:00, The cable guy's coming 'cause our satellite's out.
not_available Oh, do you have those giant water bottles in canada ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're way too heavy for me.
not_available So if you ever see that it's empty, go ahead and bring one in.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Would it be okay if i got a little settled in first ? Oh my god.
not_available Of course.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm 
not_available Just really happy you're here.
not_available Help is on the way.
not_available Oh, here's the e
not_available Mail that's from fiona's artist week group.
not_available Mm, I'll call them from my house.
not_available Should we regroup in the morning ? Sure.
not_available I'm going to stay here tonight.
not_available George and I are in transition mode.
not_available You sounded like you were together wh you were on the phone.
not_available You threw the bum out because he couldn't get his shit together ? No, I made a plan with my new friends at knitting.
not_available First, get set him up in his own place, Sort of pad the landing, as it were, and then
not_available Parachute out of there ? When the time is right.
not_available Cut to you 30 years from now changing his diapers And downing a gallon of merlot every day.
not_available Oh, claire, your aunt sarah's dear friend fiona was killed today.
not_available Someone killed her ? 
not_available No.
not_available She fell of a cliff in topanga canyon.
not_available Oh my god.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available You met her at the full moon celebration
not_available Fiona Kleinschmidt, the ceramicist.
not_available Yeah, she wrote me a recommendation for art school.
not_available And she knew dad and Nate ? Uh, yes, that's the one.
not_available So who gets to speak at the service About fiona's penchant for ushering young boys into manhood ? Bettina, that was once.
not_available Hey, that's the one thing I really admired her for.
not_available The old table's back.
not_available Isn't it wonderful ? The other table just didn't make any sense in here.
not_available George has it.
not_available He moved out, but I don't want to discuss it.
not_available Your aunt sarah needs our help now.
not_available How are you, claire ? Well, I had to start temping.
not_available But only until I hear from this emerging artists' grant that I applied for.
not_available But what really sucks is I had to waste my money on these ridiculous clothes.
not_available Oh my god.
not_available "Yet these are all still chess moves.
not_available Even being mad at you today is still a chess move.
not_available What I hate the most is the game being played." Okay, let me get her response.
not_available Okay, Maya is down.
not_available Okay, this is what she wrote back.
not_available "Sadly, I never learned to play chess, So be assured I'm not making a move." Now why would she put "sadly" if she didn't feel at least some Unconscious regret for the way things ended ? There is no way two people could have gone through What we went through together and just let itUnless
not_available Wait, let me read you the transcripts from our i.M.S No ! Well, nate, have you asked her what she's thinking ? Clearly she's moved on.
not_available To be honest, the only reason I'm dealing with you Is because you're here and you're not out here stalking my sister.
not_available Nate ! Stop.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm on my medication.
not_available It's just gonna take awhile.
not_available The end of a relationship is hard for anyone.
not_available I remember when you two 
not_available Billy, please don't ! I'm sorry.
not_available I'll just Did you guys say you had that scorsese thing tivo'd ? I'll just eat some ice cream.
not_available Then I'll watch it and then head out.
not_available And I won't call her.
not_available I killed her.
not_available I killed my best friend.
not_available Honey, you didn't kill her.
not_available Of course you didn't.
not_available You always tell me everything happens for a reason.
not_available Oh, fuck off ! Fuck that one to the ground ! "Everything happens for a reason." What a crock ! You say there's a reason grandma lost her legs, And there's a reason there's a war.
not_available And tsunamis ? And there's a reason georgeFuckingBush got reelected ! Shit goes wrong because there's evil in the world, like me ! 
not_available I'm evil.
not_available Sarah, no ! 
not_available Let her go.
not_available It was my idea to go get her To go on the walk.
not_available She didn't want to.
not_available I I dragged her.
not_available She turned me down twice.
not_available I begged her.
not_available Twice ? 
not_available Who am I, the antichrist ? Some one should Just lock me up and keep me in a cage.
not_available Someone should dig a hole and throw me in it, Not let me out ! Oh my god ! It's a playstation 2 ! 
not_available Cool.
not_available With turismo 4 ! Can weCan we hook it up ? Of course ! But we have to leave for school in 10 minutes ! All right ! 
not_available Okay ! What ? It's just a playstation.
not_available All kids have them.
not_available I just think buying this without any rhyme or reason Is like saying they deserve a prize, when clearly they don't.
not_available It's not a prize.
not_available It's just something fun to have a good time.
not_available Yeah, good times.
not_available That's your answer to everything, miss pollyanna.
not_available It's to give them an activity.
not_available It's going to rot their brains.
not_available Who knows ? I don't.
not_available I don't either.
not_available I'm just trying to make everyone happy.
not_available Maybe that's your problem.
not_available You're always trying to make everybody so damned happy.
not_available What you should be doing 
not_available Oh god, just shut the fuck up.
not_available Are we having fun yet ? Here's beverly's birthday card to sign.

not_available I don't even remember what I said.
not_available You were blaming yourself.
not_available I don't know why I do that.
not_available It's so narcissistic, you know.
not_available I am the asshole at the center of the universe, Forgetting how vast the universe is, And how nothing Is in our control.
not_available An idea both terrifying and beautiful As spirit itself.

not_available What's the matter, claire ? It is kirsten, is she being a butt ? Oh no, it's not that.
not_available It's just It's just these pantyhose.
not_available Oh, do you have a run ? 'Cause i have a little clear polish You can put on 
not_available No no, it's not that ! It's they're like squeezing against my torso and I can't even breathe ! I mean, none of this work would even seem that hard If I didn't feel like I was sitting here In some kind of torture chamber all day.
not_available Maybe you should try a different brand.
not_available Mine energize me.
not_available No, it's not the brand.
not_available They're all the same.
not_available It's 
not_available I mean I don't understand how having your legs Sheathed in this smooth plastic barbie leg, Like, encased in a sausage casing Would help you do your job better.
not_available Doesn't seem sexist that it's a regulation only for women ? Men have to wear ties.
not_available Right, but they don't suffate you.
not_available And it's not on their penis.
not_available I'm gonna go wash out some mugs.
not_available * she's a brick, ba ba ba na * * house, ba ba ba na * * she's a mighty, mighty * I'm gonna put the music underneath, but I have to get the beat.

not_available Oh, I love helping people.
not_available And I know you do everything by yourself.
not_available My mom was a single mom.
not_available It's not only twice as hard without a man, it's exponentially harder.
not_available Was he good to you.
not_available Did he take care of you ? Yes, he was good to me.
not_available And then he was really bad to me.
not_available Durrell broke it.
not_available I did not ! It wouldn't let me get to level two so I had to fix it.
not_available You didn't have to open it.
not_available Crybaby crybaby.
not_available What the hell did you do, durrell ? 
not_available It broke ! Okay, I broke it ! Why did you have to buy us a present that you knew was gonna break ? You opened the machine up.
not_available I'd have gotten it fixed had you only waited.
not_available Why does everything always have to get ruined ? Everything was already ruined From the time we had to move into this stupid gay house ! Durrell, you're going to your room ! 
not_available Get off of me ! Leave him alone.
not_available I hate you ! Get off me ! Leave him alone ! Stop it, you're gonna break his arm ! Keith ! Stop ! You're hurting him ! I said, get off of me ! What the hell is going on ? Durrell's getting a timeOut ! 
not_available You're locking them in a room ? These kids will walk all over you if you let them.
not_available I'll beat you, man ! 
not_available More violence, that's what you want to show them ? Discipline and violence are not the same thing.
not_available I'll kill you, you faggot ! 
not_available Let us out of here, you faggot ! This is a nightmare.
not_available Keith, look at yourself ! U're completely insane right now.
not_available Let go of the door or I'll tell D.C.F.S.
not_available ! You think anybody over there give a shit about you ? You did that to yourselves ! * adrift on the water * * could it be actually * * wearing these clothes * * I've never been * * this fucking uncomfortable * * never again * * to wear pantyhose * * 'cause you ride up my thighs * * you're tight on my ass * * you climb up my crotch * * you ruin my day * * and fill my soul * * you fill my soul with hate * * it can't be right * * when they feel so tight * * 'cause you and you and you * * all of you *

not_available Coming ! 
not_available Hi, daddy.
not_available Sweetheart.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Here.
not_available Happy housewarming.
not_available Ooh, beautiful.
not_available Tea's ready ! Where does ruth keep her hand lotion ? I don't know.
not_available It's been so dry out this week, And the only stuff in the bathroom's yours.
not_available Maybe she took it with her.
not_available Took it where ? Earl grey or green ? When did you move in ? 
not_available Two days ago.
not_available Stop being so nosy.
not_available Earl grey or green ? Daddy, I'm not, I just
not_available Green.
not_available So I guess You guys are just taking your time unpacking ? Look, I rely on ruth to take care of you, daddy.
not_available I just want to make sure you have everything.
not_available We're fine.
not_available The only reason I'm alone is that ruth's sister was involved in a fatal accident.
not_available Oh, you're kidding.
not_available Evidently, she's being blamed for it.
not_available And ruth, caretaker that she is, is by her side.
not_available Apparently she's quite distraught.
not_available I think they've outlived their usefulness.
not_available Men are obsolete.
not_available It's true.
not_available I feel more of a connection to my women friends than any of my husbands.
not_available I've wanted to have an all
not_available Women weekend on my land.
not_available Nice idea.
not_available Let's make it an all
not_available Woman year ! All women forever ! A land of no men ! Men can visit, but only for a weekend.
not_available Just to satisfy our needs.
not_available But they have to bring money.
not_available I've got the land, ladies.
not_available There's We'll buy yurts off the internet.
not_available Save me a yurt.
not_available Brenda, we could midwife your baby for you.
not_available You can deliver her in a horse trough.
not_available And we camp while you're in labor.
not_available Mmm.
not_available I know how to grow vegetables ! We'll only eat what I can grow or kill.
not_available We can start this weekend.

not_available No.
not_available It's been two weeks.
not_available That's more than enough time to know.
not_available We should stop before they bond to us.
not_available But I've already bonded to them.
not_available What you've bonded to is the idea of becoming your mother
not_available Just running around here blind to everything.
not_available "Oh, everything's gonna be okay." You turn into your father, you solve everything with a beating.
not_available I haven't touched those kids ! 
not_available You were close.
not_available Exactly.
not_available That's why when the social worker comes tomorrow I'll be explaining to her that this is a bad match.
not_available You should pack their things in the morning.
not_available How can you just abandon them When their little lives have already been filled with so much trauma ? Good, so now you abandon me ? That solves everything.

not_available As soon as i get this hot
not_available Dog suit off I am gonna take a bath and be naked.
not_available If I put anything else on with a waistband I'm gonna cry.
