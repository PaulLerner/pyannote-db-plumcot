
not_available Expansion has slowed, but then the economy has slowed.
not_available It's only natural.
not_available No, growth is the only thing that is natural, Mr.
not_available Gilardi.
not_available And growth is the only thing that is acceptable.
not_available Now, I know that may sound harsh, but it's the truth.
not_available To accept anything less is sheer laziness.
not_available And if there's one thing I can't abide, it is laziness.
not_available I've been watching you.
not_available Really? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available You're smart.
not_available You're ambitious.
not_available You're also shallow and amoral.
not_available I like that in a man.
not_available Kroehner needs new funeral homes.
not_available We got a serious cash
not_available flow problem.
not_available We need new real estate that we can unload at a profit.
not_available Because we're not exactly liquid at the moment.
not_available Understand? 
not_available I do.
not_available I need at least three new homes in L.A.
not_available Before the end of the year.
not_available Three? 
not_available That's right, three.
not_available And I'm making you responsible for finding them.
not_available Now, I would only do that if I thought that you were up to it.
not_available Any questions? 
not_available No, ma'am.
not_available Fuck you with the "ma'am" shit! Call me that again, I'll have your balls on a plate, your spleen on a stick and your heart wrapped and FedEx'd to your mama, all right? 
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Huntley, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available I shouldn't have had escargot at lunch.
not_available Little fuckers always give me heartburn.
not_available Hey, let's quit after this hole.
not_available I need a drink.
not_available Goddamn it, I hooked it! Hi.
not_available David, something awful's happened.
not_available I didn't know where else to turn.
not_available Tracy, I'm sorry you're having trouble, but I thought it was clear I need to arrange a funeral.
not_available Yes, my Aunt Lilian.
not_available She was only the most important person in my whole life.
not_available What? You thought I was here for some other reason? Oh, David, please.
not_available You need to get over yourself.
not_available All right, this won't be hard.
not_available I'm massively organized.
not_available I'm a professional party planner.
not_available Did you know that? I did this huge party for New Line for the Golden Globes last year.
not_available The Hollywood Reporter called it "resplendent." And it was.
not_available Aunt Lilian's funeral needs to be equally resplendent.
not_available I need these programs by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, George.
not_available You've been such a good supplier to me.
not_available I'd hate to see that relationship end.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay, bye, now.
not_available All right, that takes care of that.
not_available Now I have to go to Harry Winston's, see if they'll loan me something fabulous for Aunt Lilian's viewing.
not_available I just need you to sign 
not_available I'm serious, David.
not_available Don't worry about the cost.
not_available She practically raised me.
not_available I owe her.
not_available Besides she was loaded.
not_available And also I intend to sue the pants off that country club.
not_available I still need a signature 
not_available I've had it out for them ever since my debut, when one of the Chinese busboys made a really inappropriate comment about the neckline of my dress.
not_available I'll be faxing you.
not_available Jesus Christ, Nate, what took you so long? I told you, I was taking the Funeral Directors' Licensing Exam.
not_available I had to finish or wait until next March to take it again.
not_available Oh, God, I'm sorry.
not_available It's just I have to go see Billy in the hospital.
not_available I have to, Nate.
not_available All right.
not_available He needs me.
not_available I can feel it.
not_available Will you come with me, please? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what're you up to this weekend? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Probably come up with some creative way to avoid my family.
not_available Why? 
not_available I'm having this big party on Saturday.
not_available Yeah? Yeah, my dad and my stepmom are renewing their vows in Hawaii.
not_available You're not going? 
not_available No way.
not_available They do this, like, every six months.
not_available It's so not a big deal.
not_available And guess who has the keys to her dad's total party house in Bel Air.
not_available I'm beginning to see how this Little Miss Perfect act pays off.
not_available Yeah, why do you think I do it? So, what's up with you and Mr.
not_available OD? Shut up.
not_available No, I was just wondering if he's, like, you know over it.
not_available Yeah, he is.
not_available He's incredibly strong.
not_available He's much stronger than he thinks.
not_available Well, that's a good thing, right? I guess.
not_available Bring him to the party if you want.
not_available Okay, I will.
not_available I'm sure he hates me.
not_available The one person he thought he could count on, and I had him committed.
not_available Well, it was for his own good.
not_available He always felt the entire world was against him.
not_available It's all because of my fucking mother.
not_available She had children as, like, fashion accessories.
not_available You had no choice.
not_available He could've harmed himself.
not_available He did harm himself.
not_available I'm so afraid of what he's gonna say to me.
not_available Brenda, you cannot let him hurt you anymore.
not_available For your good and for his.
not_available What if he thinks I hurt him? What if he's right? 
not_available You saved him.
not_available I'll go by Bristol Farms and pick up some of those dried Porcini mushrooms.
not_available You wanna take me out to dinner? No, there's nothing wrong with that, it's just Hiram, do you realize that you've never taken me out before? I suppose because of Nathaniel we just always got in the habit of staying in.
not_available I have to run.
not_available Can you pick me up at? Is 8 too late? No, at the house.
not_available Bye, now.
not_available I need you to stay and work tonight.
not_available What? It's very busy right now.
not_available We have three unfilled orders, that's nothing.
not_available And Robbie's coming in at 6 tomorrow morning.
not_available It's coming up on Father's Day, very busy time.
not_available No one sends flowers for Father's Day, which is the day after tomorrow.
not_available You think we'll get a rush of orders tonight? Yes, you have to stay.
not_available Change your plans.
not_available No.
not_available This is my business! I am boss here.
not_available I'm not debating that.
not_available But your authority does not extend to my personal life.
not_available I don't care about your ridiculous personal life.
not_available Going to sleep someplace outside in a tent, like refugee.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available You don't like me seeing Hiram because you're jealous! It's no longer flattering.
not_available It's just irritating.
not_available I have chosen Hiram! I'm sorry if I somehow made you feel that's not the case, because it is! I wish you'd stop behaving like a spoiled child! I've dealt with enough children in my life.
not_available I'm finally at the point where they get along without me, and I won't go back! You are fired! 
not_available You can't do that.
not_available I just do do that! Now you can go.
not_available Get out of here, you're fired.
not_available Go on, get out! It's a piece of cake.
not_available Just the one bump on her head and a pretty big bruise.
not_available But most of it's covered by her hair, which, lucky for us is remarkably thick for a woman her age.
not_available What?! Tracy wants to change the casket, the flowers the music and the times of the viewing.
not_available And the ceremony.
not_available How am I supposed to put together a resplendent funeral in two days when she can't make up her fucking mind? By telling her that once she signs a contract she can't pull any of this shit.
not_available That's what I'd do.
not_available If I was a partner.
not_available Which you're not, so let me handle this.
not_available I need you to do everything you can to make her look the best she possibly can.
not_available I always do that, David.
not_available Of course you do, Federico.
not_available It's just that it's a very important funeral, and we stand to make a lot of money.
not_available Which I won't see any of.
not_available We just gave you a raise.
not_available Do you want me to come with you? No, I don't want him to know that you're here.
not_available I'll be right out here if you need me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Billy? Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available How're you doing? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available Whatever I was feeling before I'm not feeling now.
not_available I'm so sorry, Billy.
not_available It's so weird.
not_available I love you more than anything and I could've seriously hurt you.
not_available It all made sense at the time.
not_available You know 
not_available I hate this.
not_available I hate that my blood makes me crazy.
not_available I hate that I can't function without being chemically altered.
not_available I hate that I fucked up your life.
not_available You haven't.
not_available I did that on my own.
not_available No, you deserve to be happy.
not_available I don't.
not_available I must have some weird
not_available ass karma.
not_available We both do.
not_available No, it's just me.
not_available The fact that I could've hurt you like that upsets me like nothing ever has.
not_available And when I look at you all I want to say is I'm sorry.
not_available Please forgive me.
not_available And inside I feel like tears are streaming down my cheeks.
not_available But they're not, are they? Don't cry.
not_available Please don't cry.
not_available Just because I can't.
not_available You be happy.
not_available I want you to be happy.
not_available I'll be happy if you are.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm so lost inside.
not_available I wish that I could get out.
not_available But I don't think I ever will.
not_available You'll be all right.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You're so beautiful.
not_available How come there's no home movies of me when I was a kid? I'm not sure.
not_available After I bought that new super
not_available 8 camera, we filmed everything the boys did.
not_available After you came along, I guess we sort of felt like, you know been there, done that.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Which made me feel, like, totally secondary, thank you.
not_available Cheer up, kitten.
not_available Maybe some of that attention you never got will motivate you to get off your lazy ass and do something interesting with your life.
not_available I got fired today.
not_available That sucks.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available If you wanna know the truth, I was a victim of sexual harassment.
not_available What? 
not_available Nikolai wanted me to work late to keep me from dinner with Hiram.
not_available When I refused, he fired me.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What a dork! 
not_available I know.
not_available Can you believe it? I have a good mind to call a lawyer.
not_available Well, it sounds like you're better off out of there.
not_available I have a certificate in floral arranging.
not_available I can get a job anywhere.
not_available Screw Nikolai.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Have you ever thought about getting married? Sure, I've thought about it, but 
not_available We've been together almost a year.
not_available And you practically live at my house.
not_available You've seen me at my worst.
not_available What other information do you need? 
not_available We've been together six months, Bren.
not_available I didn't realize you were counting the days.
not_available I'm not 
not_available What, you mark them off at night? Like a prisoner in his cell, like the Count of fucking Monte Cristo? Since when are you so hot on marriage? Well, I need to know where this is going.
not_available I need to know if I'm wasting my time.
not_available What if I wanna have children? 
not_available Well, you said you didn't.
not_available Well, do you? I mean, you're what, 35? What's the longest relationship you've ever been in? 
not_available This one.
not_available Yeah, well, that's pathetic.
not_available You haven't had a serious relationship since fucking high school.
not_available At least I've had a serious relationship.
not_available At least I know what one is.
not_available You know how many guys would've left after all the psycho shit you've put me through? 
not_available Now we're getting to the point.
not_available This is what's really going on, you wanna bail.
not_available No, you want me to bail! Look out! Hey, Augusto's christening is Sunday afternoon.
not_available We're thinking about having a party afterwards.
not_available For my folks and Vanessa's and Well, our place is a little small.
not_available You think we could have it here? Right now, Lilian Montrose's viewing is scheduled for 3 to 6, so Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I was thinking after that.
not_available I'm only asking because I I still think of your family as my family.
not_available And I really want you all to be there.
not_available Sure.
not_available We'd be happy to let you have the party here.
not_available Thanks, boss.
not_available Could you load me a hypodermic with some phenol solution for this bump? Wouldn't you rather start with a compress? Why? An injection will get rid of the swelling and take care of the bruising.
not_available You're getting better at this, Dave.
not_available Thank you, Federico.
not_available Oh, great, now what? Tracy's decided to have Aunt Lilian cremated and her ashes placed in a Faberg'e egg? Can we do it by 7 tonight? 
not_available I think you should look at this.
not_available Well, what is it? Oh, good grief.
not_available Adult female, unrestrained driver, unconscious upon arrival.
not_available Now responsive only to painful stimuli.
not_available Blood pressure, 86/40.
not_available Pulse, 130.
not_available Respiration, 36 and shallow.
not_available Brenda? 
not_available She has a large scalp emulsion.
not_available Why won't you talk to me? 
not_available Trachea's midline, neck veins are flat.
not_available Lactated ringers.
not_available What happened? What happened? Patient two, adult male Sir, you've been in an accident.
not_available Just stay calm, okay? Everything's fine.
not_available Adult male, he's alert now but confused, no memory of accident.
not_available Why is her head in that thing? 
not_available She had an injury.
not_available She's gonna be okay.
not_available Is she dead? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's gonna be fine.
not_available How's your sea bass? 
not_available Delicious, thank you.
not_available Ruth, I need to tell you something, and 
not_available I'm not proud of this.
not_available What is it? I've met someone.
not_available I never meant for this to happen.
not_available I wasn't looking.
not_available Yes, well, that's always when it does happen.
not_available Well, I'm not sure quite how to Oh, boy.
not_available I'm not quite sure how to say this.
not_available For heaven's sake, spit it out.
not_available I'd like to pursue it.
not_available Things between you and I have felt Well, not exactly And I feel a bond with this new person that Well, the beginnings of a bond, that could be something quite profound.
not_available All right.
not_available I thought you'd be more upset.
not_available I would've thought the same thing.
not_available Hiram, please.
not_available Go, explore.
not_available You owe it to yourself and whoever she is.
not_available Maybe the two of you could have something, as you say, profound.
not_available Lord knows we don't.
not_available Well, if it was, this would be a lot more difficult, wouldn't it? Oh, it is difficult for me.
not_available Let's order dessert.
not_available That'll cheer you up.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Doctor says you're gonna be okay.
not_available Well, I like hearing that.
not_available What about you? 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Banged up, but apparently nothing broken.
not_available I'm sorry I almost killed you.
not_available Goddamn it.
not_available This is gonna send my car insurance premiums through the roof.
not_available When you were unconscious, I prayed.
not_available You know how long it's been since I prayed? And I've never prayed like this.
not_available So because of me, you've become born again.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available You are one incredibly difficult and sometimes infuriating woman.
not_available And I cannot imagine my life without you.
not_available Promise me you'll be a better driver.
not_available Promise me you'll take care of yourself and you'll live as long as you can.
not_available Because I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
not_available So if you wanna get married, I'm all for it.
not_available Okay, maybe I was overreacting.
not_available Let's just take one step at a time, shall we? Okay.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What a bad dream.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Father Jack doesn't deny he performed a commitment ceremony for two lesbians.
not_available Privately, not in the church.
not_available The Lambeth Conference resolution on sexuality expressly condemns the blessing of same
not_available sex unions and councils against ordination of those involved.
not_available Whether or not we agree with this resolution Do we really want our children learning from a man that ignores God's laws? I think we should ask Jack to leave.
not_available And so do James and Owen, and I'm guessing David feels the same.
not_available Actually, I don't.
not_available The church rejects homosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture.
not_available So because of their random genetics, gay people should be denied any romantic or sexual love? 
not_available That is liberal claptrap.
not_available It's not genetics.
not_available It can be overcome.
not_available Walter, the only way you could know that for sure is if it's something that you overcame.
not_available And the only way you couldn't know is if it's something you're not strong enough to overcome.
not_available Are you gay, David? Yes.
not_available Then his vote cannot be counted here.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available He's a deacon.
not_available He gets a vote.
not_available David does not obey the laws of the church.
not_available Without his vote, it's an even split.
not_available How do you plan to resolve the matter? I think we should get the bishop involved.
not_available You sure you wanna do that? Okay, we talked about the flowers.
not_available I gave you the CD I burned with music for the viewing.
not_available I wish David were here.
not_available I'd much prefer to go over things with him than with some underling, but Oh, no.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available This won't do.
not_available What? Well, this right here, there's a nick in the wood.
not_available Oh, no, that's part of the grain.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available All right, well, we'll just have to return it and then get a new one.
not_available That's not possible.
not_available I'm sorry? There's nothing wrong with this casket.
not_available Even if there was, it's too late to get another like it by tomorrow.
not_available I don't care how much it costs.
not_available This isn't about cost.
not_available There's not another one of these available.
not_available We had to ship this one down from San Francisco as it was.
not_available I'm very unhappy about this.
not_available If you want to call it off, I can bring your aunt's body up and you can take it somewhere else.
not_available Okay? Hello? Hiram, there's nothing to talk about.
not_available No, I'm not angry.
not_available Oh, Mom, I'll probably be spending tonight at a friend's house.
not_available What friend? 
not_available Parker McKenna.
not_available I don't know any Parker.
not_available Well, you haven't met her yet.
not_available Oh, good grief! Hiram, you're the one who wanted to break up.
not_available I'm sorry if you're having second thoughts, because I'm not.
not_available Men can be so stupid.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd like for you to have Parker's mother call me, okay? Okay.
not_available Oh, Nate, glad you're here.
not_available Need to talk to you later.
not_available About what? 
not_available In private.
not_available Good morning.
not_available How are you this morning? Oh, God.
not_available I was having the most incredible dream.
not_available I was swimming with dolphins.
not_available Only we weren't swimming, we were flying.
not_available Oh, and Drew Barrymore was there.
not_available Whatever you are on, I would like some of it.
not_available She was like my best friend.
not_available How's your headache today? 
not_available It's better.
not_available Oh, my God, and there was this shark following us and I think it was Courtney Love.
not_available How'd she look? 
not_available She was in Versace.
not_available Are we supposed to believe that the same God who made us wants us to be lonely and frustrated while the rest of the world's free to make love and have families? 
not_available No, God isn't that cruel.
not_available Good for you for marrying two lesbians.
not_available My high school girlfriend.
not_available Who do you think sent that fax? Walter swears it wasn't him.
not_available I am so fucking tired of being ashamed.
not_available We'll just fight back, you and me.
not_available We'll fight them.
not_available Walter's just a bully.
not_available We'll just bully him back.
not_available I don't think that's such a good idea.
not_available I've agreed to not officiate at any other gay weddings.
not_available And you get to stay.
not_available How do you feel about that? 
not_available Relieved.
not_available I've put in almost six years here at St.
not_available Bart's.
not_available And I'd really prefer not to have to start over somewhere new.
not_available Not at this point in my life.
not_available And I have a favor to ask of you.
not_available I need you to resign as deacon.
not_available Otherwise, Walter will keep making noise until he gets his way and I'd really prefer not to get the bishop involved.
not_available Jack, you can't give in to them.
not_available I know which battles can be won, David.
not_available This is not one of them.
not_available I guess I just thought that you were I don't know, braver than that.
not_available I'm tired.
not_available I'm tired of trying to make it better here and never succeeding because of politics.
not_available I just don't have it in me right now.
not_available But how can you? You're gay.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available I'm not.
not_available People have always assumed that.
not_available But I'm not.
not_available Sorry.
not_available More Scotch? No, thanks.
not_available I 
not_available I really don't wanna be here.
not_available Oh, get over yourself.
not_available I know you and Parker had sex, so what? You're not the first guy I slept with.
not_available Right, but am I the last? Maybe.
not_available If he's gonna get me in here, I'll use it, but Oh, my God.
not_available What the fuck do these people do? Her father's, like, some movie bigwig.
not_available I think.
not_available Invitation only.
not_available Okay, this is tragic.
not_available We can always leave.
not_available Let's just find the bar.
not_available Excuse me? Excuse me, do you know where the bar is? 
not_available Over there.
not_available Right.
not_available Where's Parker? 
not_available It's not her house.
not_available This is a porn party.
not_available I'm telling you, they're shooting a porno here.
not_available What the fuck is that? 
not_available Faggot.
not_available Hey, shut up.
not_available My brother's a faggot.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Let's just say hi and leave, okay? Oh, no, this could be kind of fun.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hey, Parker.
not_available Hey.
not_available This is a really nice house you've got here.
not_available I know.
not_available So, like, of course I don't get to live here.
not_available I just get to trash it when they're gone.
not_available This is Warren.
not_available This is Claire.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available And Gabriel.
not_available This is what concerns me, this area of decreased attenuation.
not_available It's very faint.
not_available Doesn't look like there's an acute injury, but something's not right.
not_available Well, she's gonna be all right, isn't she? These are your CAT scan results, Nate.
not_available Mine? 
not_available Don't worry about Brenda.
not_available Hers was totally clean.
not_available So, what do you think it is? I'd like to give you a shot of contrast dye and do another CAT scan to really know.
not_available Oh, hello, Mrs.
not_available Fisher? This is Elise McKenna, Parker's stepmother.
not_available Claire asked me to call you.
not_available Yes, I just wanted to be sure there's proper adult supervision if she's staying there.
not_available Oh, absolutely.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available Don't worry for a minute.
not_available All right, then, I don't want her drinking.
not_available There isn 't even any liquor in the house, You see, my husband and I are both alcoholics.
not_available And Parker's fresh out of rehab.
not_available So we'll take really good care of Claire.
not_available I promise, Kisses, 
not_available That was mean.
not_available What? A Hollywood ass
not_available waxing party.
not_available Everybody's wearing leather or rubber.
not_available Seriously, bro, seriously.
not_available Rip those fucking nipple
not_available rings out.
not_available No shit.
not_available Where were you last night? I called you, and your mom was all, "I don't know." I was hanging with my girl.
not_available Okay, well, while you were getting your toes sucked we sucked down a free sixer from 7
not_available Eleven.
not_available Fuck, we pulled a beer cow.
not_available A beer cow, dude, that's the shit.
not_available Hell yeah, a fucking beer cow.
not_available Dink, shut the fuck up, dude.
not_available What the fuck is a beer cow? Oh, shit, it was mad.
not_available So we go to buy some beer, right? And we get to the counter, but it's like, nobody has enough cash.
not_available So Dink just starts fucking mooing at the top of his lungs at this guy, right? So I'm like, "Fuck it." So I start mooing too.
not_available Oh, yeah, but really fucking loud.
not_available Like we just might totally go nuts.
not_available The guy was so fucking scared of us.
not_available It was hilarious, man.
not_available It was a total movie moment.
not_available Fuck yeah, and then we grab all the beer and we fly.
not_available We laughed for, like, five straight hours.
not_available It was the shit.
not_available Yeah, dude.
not_available A beer cow, right? We gotta do that shit again, man.
not_available I haven't had that much fun since I was, like, 6.
not_available Fucking beer cow, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Well we did find something that concerns me.
not_available My guess would be that it's AVM.
not_available Arteriovenous malformation.
not_available What the fuck is that? Abnormally enlarged and intertwined blood vessels in your brain.
not_available Have you been experiencing any headaches? Yeah, I get headaches.
not_available I take Advil, they go away.
not_available Any vertigo, nausea, problems with your balance? Nope.
not_available Any fluctuation in your field of vision? Like what? Like a fluttering in your peripheral vision? 
not_available Once.
not_available Do the headaches seem to affect one side of the head more than the other? The left side.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Well, I would like to schedule an MRI for you as soon as possible.
not_available What's the worstcase scenario here? 
not_available Nate, it's way too early for that.
not_available You fucking tell me.
not_available Not all vascular malfunctions of the brain become symptomatic.
not_available Some, however, carry a significant risk of hemorrhage.
not_available So I could have a stroke? You could be at a higher risk for stroke or seizure than most.
not_available We need to do more tests to be certain.
not_available Could I die from this? It's possible.
not_available Yes.
not_available There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
not_available I mean, I don't smoke.
not_available I haven't had any red meat since 1989.
not_available I run three miles a day.
not_available Don't blow this out of proportion.
not_available There are treatments, surgical options.
not_available Even if it is AVM, you could live for another 50 years.
not_available However, I would like to run a full cardiovascular profile on you before you continue with the running, okay? This happened yesterday? For heaven's sake, why didn't you call me earlier? Because I thought I was okay.
not_available Well, you are okay, aren't you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available I'm a nervous wreck.
not_available Are you all right, dear? Yes, thank you.
not_available Well, I want you both to promise me that you'll be more careful from now on.
not_available We promise.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available This time it's personal.
not_available What's wrong? Nothing.
not_available So how old did you say you were? How old do you want me to be? Parker? 
not_available Oh, of course.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What do you want? Nothing, I was just looking for Gabe.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You drop a beer, you have to pay for it.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available Moo.
not_available Moo.
not_available Hey, say "moo." Where the fuck did you get that? Say "moo." 
not_available Moo.
not_available Now get the money out of the register.
not_available Go get the fucking car! Moo.
not_available So do you think I should resign? 
not_available What do you want to do? I don't wanna belong to a church that's so intolerant.
not_available And I don't wanna waste my time with a fight that can't be won.
not_available But I don't wanna just take it either.
not_available I've been doing that my whole fucking life, and I'm fucking sick to death of it.
not_available And to top it all off, I'm scheduled to do a devotional reading in Mass tomorrow.
not_available You gonna do it? 
not_available Of course.
not_available They're not gonna intimidate me into just disappearing.
not_available Oh, I came out to my mother.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available It was really uncomfortable.
not_available How's she taking it? 
not_available Hard to tell.
not_available She's as weird as always.
not_available Thanks for meeting me here today.
not_available I just had to talk about it to somebody.
not_available And I could always talk to you.
not_available Well, I'm glad that we've managed to remain friends.
not_available Listen, I gotta run.
not_available I'm meeting Eddie later.
not_available Hey, he said he saw you at the candlelight vigil for Marc Foster.
not_available Yeah, yeah, I was driving by on my way home.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, thanks again.
not_available Yeah, well, let me know how it all turns out.
not_available I will.
not_available Take care, David.
not_available You too.
not_available Tell Eddie I said hi.
not_available Don't you wanna do what those really cool kids in there are doing? No.
not_available Where's your boyfriend? I don't know.
not_available I like him.
not_available You do? 
not_available Yeah, something about him.
not_available Can't quite put my finger on it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Where'd you go? We just went to get some more beer.
not_available Why, did you miss me? 
not_available Not that much, ego man.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I help you? I'd like to speak to David, if at all possible.
not_available Well, he's not here right now.
not_available Well, where is he? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Perhaps I can help you.
not_available Perhaps you can.
not_available That remains to be seen.
not_available My aunt's viewing is tomorrow.
not_available And I'm not at all satisfied with the state of her casket.
not_available I spoke to one of your other employees about it earlier today and he didn't seem to be the slightest bit concerned.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available See? Right here.
not_available It's been nicked.
not_available How about we take 100 bucks off? 
not_available I want a new casket.
not_available Well, I'm not sure that's an option.
not_available Why does nobody around here seem to care about doing things right? If I'm not mistaken, you haven't even signed a contract, right? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available So you could turn around in the end say, "I never agreed," and not pay? 
not_available Of course not, that's ridiculous.
not_available Yeah, that is ridiculous.
not_available So I'm gonna go get that contract right now and until you sign it, you don't get to complain about anything else.
not_available I resent your implication.
not_available You ought to be thanking your fucking stars that you're alive and healthy.
not_available And that you don't work like a dog just to starve or get shot in the street.
not_available I'll be right back with that contract.
not_available I thought this is what you wanted.
not_available It's too little too late.
not_available What, are you trying to get your wings? 
not_available Where's your boyfriend? I do like him.
not_available Yeah, you said that already.
not_available He'll be headed over to my neck of the woods pretty soon.
not_available Right here.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I like it.
not_available Why you are here? You're fired.
not_available Dear Lord, have you been here all night? Go drive in the woods with your man who burns chicken in the funny little toy car.
not_available I came here to get my things before I go to church.
not_available I thought this would be a safe time not to run into you.
not_available Is he rich? 
not_available What? No.
not_available So he is a good lover, yeah? That's none of your business.
not_available Because you are the kind of woman who needs a good lover.
not_available Oh, and why is that? Because you're so scared of feeling.
not_available You are scared of your own heart.
not_available You should have a man who can touch you there.
not_available Who sees your beauty.
not_available I hoping he is this man for you.
not_available In your steadfast faith and love, that through your grace we may proclaim your truth with boldness and minister your justice with compassion.
not_available For the sake of our savior, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available "In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.
not_available Let me never be ashamed.
not_available Deliver me in thy righteousness." "Let me never be ashamed." There's a concept.
not_available I've been ashamed my entire life.
not_available I grew up thinking I was unworthy in the eyes of God instead of trusting God not to be an ignorant, frightened bigot.
not_available Because of this, I've made myself crazy.
not_available I've put myself in danger, I've made a lot of mistakes.
not_available Big mistakes.
not_available Which all could've been avoided if I'd just had faith.
not_available Faith that maybe God really is love, like we say.
not_available How am I supposed to spread God's love throughout the world when I deny it to myself? God be with you all.
not_available Really nice job.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, David, wonderful.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available David! I am so proud of you.
not_available That was great, David.
not_available I didn't even know you were here.
not_available I had to see what you were gonna do.
not_available We're gonna get something to eat, why don't you come? Yeah, Fred 62 in Los Feliz.
not_available Maybe a movie afterwards.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I've gotta work.
not_available Okay, well, congratulations.
not_available You spoke the truth.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Take care.
not_available Okay, well don't be a stranger.
not_available We go for big breakfast now, yeah? No, I can't.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But it's Sunday.
not_available I can't believe I missed church.
not_available My son was giving a reading during the service.
not_available You are happy, no? 
not_available Yes, I'm very happy.
not_available I'm never gonna marry you.
not_available What? I will be your friend and your lover, but I will never be your wife.
not_available I spent the first half of my life doing that, I don't need to do it again.
not_available Maybe I can convince you.
not_available Nope.
not_available Not going to happen.
not_available Nate.
not_available Mom told me about the accident.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Thanks for making Tracy sign that contract.
not_available I don't know if you've noticed this, but she's kind of crazy.
not_available Yeah, I got a whiff of that.
not_available And thanks for staying in L.A.
not_available And helping me run the business.
not_available Things have been a lot more fun around here since you've been home.
not_available Why, thank you, Dave.
not_available Look, I'm gonna be late for Augusto's christening.
not_available I gotta run.
not_available Oh, that crazy
not_available ass niece is upstairs crying and won't come down.
not_available Oh, no, I think this one is yours.
not_available Okay.
not_available But I'm warning you, I might just fucking punch her.
not_available Tracy? My Aunt Lilian was the only person who ever really loved me.
not_available My parents didn't.
not_available My husband certainly didn't.
not_available And now she's dead.
not_available Her husband died, then her daughter died too in this car crash on her 17th birthday.
not_available But Aunt Lilian just went on.
not_available She raised Welsh corgis and she took up watercolors and she loved me.
not_available And now she's dead.
not_available I've never felt this alone in the world.
not_available And I'm used to feeling alone.
not_available I know what that's like.
not_available And now I find out that there's this whole new level.
not_available Why do people have to die? To make life important.
not_available None of us know how long we've got.
not_available Which is why we have to make each day matter.
not_available And it sounds like your Aunt Lilian did exactly that.
not_available Yeah, she did.
not_available Then you can be happy for her.
not_available For a life well
not_available lived.
not_available That's the most any of us can hope for.
not_available I go to funerals sometimes.
not_available Funerals of people I don't even know.
not_available Harold and Maude is, like, my favorite movie of all time.
not_available I saw it when I was in junior high and it profoundly affected my life.
not_available It's a great movie.
not_available You're very kind.
not_available Are you married? Sort of.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Julio! Get over here, man! Baby, does that dead lady have to be in here? No.
not_available No, I'll take her downstairs right now.
not_available Get over here.
not_available Thank you for coming.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What's up with you? I'm just thinking about how lucky I am.
not_available I love you.
not_available You know that, right? Yeah.
