not_available This is the spirit of a real football player here! Do you think caviar is too pretentious? Well, with the foie gras and the smoked salmon, it might seem like you're trying a little too hard to impress him.
not_available Fuck.
not_available I do want to impress him without it looking like I could give a shit, which, actually, I don't.
not_available So, why do you want to impress him? I don't know.
not_available Because Trevor was a big part of my life once.
not_available Cause his wife won a fucking National Book Award.
not_available Because I have nothing else to obsess about.
not_available Well, you have me.
not_available You I take totally for granted, don't you know that? I'm so glad you're feeling better.
not_available Yeah, you and me both, fuck
not_available o.
not_available That's the thing about depression.
not_available If you really allow yourself to feel it, it gets very boring very fast.
not_available You're not jealous, are you? Of Trevor ? Should I be? No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available So what if he's the man whose masterly touch ushered me into womanhood? The one I ultimately compare all other men to? Okay, okay, fine.
not_available But, just so you know, you'll only have yourself to blame when I go all alpha dog and beat him to a bloody pulp in front of his wife and kid! Oh, my Hero ! I'm gonna kick his ass.
not_available Fucking Trevor.
not_available Fucking Trevor.
not_available Good morning, Mrs.
not_available Huntley.
not_available Looks like another scorcher, huh? Where are my new acquisitions, Mr.
not_available Gilardi? I'm on it.
not_available What you're on is my shit list, cowboy.
not_available I made you personally responsible for finding three homes that we can dump at a profit, and what do I get from you? Diddly squat! I already closed McKenzie Bros.
not_available and Dayle Montgomery! Three new homes, Mr.
not_available Gilardi.
not_available Apparently, I misjudged your capabilities.
not_available What about Fisher &amp; Sons? You've been after them for months now.
not_available Well, they're more resilient than I expected.
not_available Jeez Louise! Man, play like you've got a big dick! Can you get them for me or not? You said I had till the end of the year.
not_available Well, Christmas came early this year.
not_available You're fired.
not_available What ? Your presence is no longer required.
not_available You're hereby rendered irrelevant.
not_available You can't be serious! Mitzi! I can do this.
not_available I swear.
not_available Now just give me another chance! You know, just because I fucked you, that doesn't put us on a first name basis! Well, you're dressed early.
not_available We have an intake at 9:30.
not_available Josh Langmead.
not_available Am I supposed to know who that is? Don't you watch the news? Not if I can help it.
not_available It's too depressing.
not_available Josh Langmead is the Cal State football player who died of heatstroke yesterday.
not_available Till his brain fried.
not_available Fuck.

not_available I have a breakfast meeting with the Living Splendour sales rep.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available That means Now that you're a licensed funeral director, we can get twice as much work done around here! Just do me a favor.
not_available Don't even mention the word "cremation." Okay.
not_available Can I mention the word "condescending"? Be back by noon! We thought Josh would want to be wearing his number for the viewing.
not_available Well, of course.
not_available I took him to his first Rams game when he was 3.
not_available It wasn't long after that he started wanting to play football.
not_available He had He had NFL sheets.
not_available Curtains.
not_available Pajamas.
not_available Five Halloweens in a row, he went as Bo Jackson.
not_available It was his dream to play pro.
not_available I bet he could've, too.
not_available I think he was good enough.
not_available He was certainly motivated enough.
not_available You ever play ball? Football.
not_available No, no way.
not_available My dad wouldn't let me.
not_available He said it was too d I played a little baseball in high school.
not_available Have you made a decision about a casket? We'd like the Titan 4.
not_available How much is that? What the hell? It's only money.
not_available Well, granted, but the layout is so ergonomic that it feels twice as large.
not_available Honey, it's got a sun roof! 
not_available Girl's gotta get a better poker face.
not_available Yeah, too late.
not_available It's very good that you brought your own inspector.
not_available Uh, no, he's my cousin.
not_available He's in construction.
not_available So what's with the foundation? 
not_available Oh, nothing.
not_available Perfect shape.
not_available Well, part of it was rebuilt two years ago, to the tune of 20,000.
not_available So, it's better than new now.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What do you think, man? I'm not living here, man.
not_available I've got a house.
not_available What do you think? I don't know.
not_available Vanessa likes it.
not_available Yeah, Vanessa likes dragging you around by your crank, too, is what I think.
not_available You're talking about my wife, man.
not_available Vanessa and me are tight, man.
not_available You know that.
not_available It's not about her.
not_available I'm just breaking it down to you the way the guys have been telling me.
not_available You've been acting like a candy
not_available ass bitch ever since you got married.
not_available Screw you, Ramon! Hey, screw me all you want! You know I'm right.
not_available What are all these people doing in our new house? Baby, do you really like the house? 
not_available Yes! Yes! Rico, the house is good.

not_available Rico, there's a yard for the boys.
not_available They'll be able to walk to school.
not_available You're closer to work.
not_available Ramon, can we use your truck to move? Nate Fisher.
not_available Hi there, Nate, this is Sheri from Appleby Caskets.
not_available We received your fax order, and I'm awfully sorry, but the Titan 4 is no longer in production.
not_available Oh, you've got to be shitting me! Well, you must not have our 2002 catalogue! I can pop it in the mail if you'd 
not_available Well, what's the closest casket to the Titan? Oh, that would probably be our Haven 2.
not_available Son of a motherfuck! 
not_available Sir! Alright, I'll have to get back to you.
not_available I swear, I fuckin' hate public school! This year
not_available round shit? Fuck! Well, we get October off, and six weeks in the spring.
not_available What do you want? This Persian girl who used to be my best friend at Archer, till I fucked her brother, she's spending the entire summer in France! Where the fuck is Gabe? He was supposed to meet us here like 10 minutes ago! Dink, it's gonna be alright, man.
not_available Everything is chill.
not_available It's not chill.
not_available The cops have that fuckin' video at every school in L.A.! Which means they haven't ided us yet, okay? Which means they probably can't id us, and anyone who could is gonna keep quiet if they know what's good for him.
not_available You'd better fuckin' hope so You fucker! Did you fuckin' tell somebody? Because if you fucking told somebody, I will fucking kill your bitchass, do you hear me? No, asshole! 
not_available What about Andy? How am I supposed to know? He's your fuckin' best friend! What ? Uh, you were supposed to meet us like 10 minutes ago.
not_available We're waiting.
not_available Jesus, Claire, don't pussy whip him.
not_available You gotta act like you don't care.
not_available Guys hate it when they're pussy
not_available whipped.
not_available Like you've ever stuck around long enough to find out, Wonder Slut! What, Squirrel Nut? Your soul's on fire.
not_available I know.
not_available Your souls are on fire.
not_available Whoa, you are not on the list of people who get to touch my tits! Andy, what is wrong? Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! 
not_available This is so fucked up! Oh, God! Andy, Andy, say something to me.
not_available I don't know what to do right now! Andy! Oh my God! Andy! Look at me! Go get the nurse! Did he take something? 
not_available Go! You stop it, stop it, you fucking bitch, or I will kick the shit out of you.
not_available Do you hear me? What the fuck are you looking at? I told you last week that the Titan Series was out of production.
not_available Yeah, well, I think that you should have torn the damn page out of the catalogue! It was an honest mistake.
not_available We'll give them the Haven 2 for 11600$ instead.
not_available David, they're already paying more than they can afford.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available God, I cannot tell you how much I hate it when you patronize me! I'm being understanding.
not_available You want patronizing? I'll give you patronizing! Hey, guys.
not_available Hey, Rico.
not_available Langmead's in the reefer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You guys got a moment? Yeah, what's up? Vanessa and I found a house.
not_available Oh, Rico, that's great! Yeah, yeah, we really like the house! And, uh, we can swing the monthly payments, if we put down 20%.
not_available What are we talking about? Well, we pieced most of it together, but we're about 11 grand short.
not_available Yup.
not_available By tomorrow.
not_available Look, we'll pay you back, over 18 months, at 7% interest.
not_available Now, that's a lot better than the bank, and not too far off the market.
not_available We'll let you know by tomorrow.
not_available Thanks.
not_available But right now, Mr.
not_available Langmead needs your attention.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available See? I am understanding.
not_available Scene 
Eleven Nikolai's Flower Shop That's a lovely arrangement.
not_available What is it? Scalene vase.
not_available Didn't they teach you anything at Daffodil University? Actually, it's a combination of inverted T and scalene.
not_available It's my own design, and it's yours.
not_available No.
not_available I just wanted to learn how to make one.
not_available It's a gift from my heart.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Thank you so much, Robbie.
not_available Okay, Ruth, this is going to be hard for me to say, but I forgive you.
not_available Forgive me? For what? You destroyed the natural order of the universe, cupcake.
not_available Everything was perfectly quiet and boring around here before you came, and now Nikolai's all aflutter, wanting to make improvements.
not_available I'm expected to work.
not_available For his own carnal reasons, he favors you over me.
not_available And for that, I forgive you.
not_available I resent that! I've always conducted myself with complete professionalism! Whatever, Ruth, I forgive you.
not_available I don't need your forgiveness! Oh, no, no, goddammit! It's not supposed to go this way! What isn't? OK, Ruth, I'm graduating from The Plan tomorrow, and I would really like it if you would be my witness.
not_available The Plan? What is The Plan? It's a multi
not_available disciplined course that allows you to think way beyond yourself, and rebuild your life, from the ground floor, plank by plank.
not_available That sounds awful! It teaches you how to feel really good about yourself and get what you want out of life.
not_available Do you want to go? It would really mean a lot to me, Ruth.
not_available Wow! 
not_available Pretty sweet, huh? Each portal is lit by recessed halogens.
not_available Tasteful signs for the model name, materials, and pricing.
not_available And this little drawer here? This displays your interior upholstery fabric.
not_available Point of purchase does not get any better than this, my friends.
not_available It's very impressive.
not_available Impressive? It's fucking gorgeous! It's a completely interactive retail experience! 'Cause human beings, we're tactile.
not_available We like to touch the fruit before we buy.
not_available I can't believe you guys! You're still using a catalogue! Now these caskets here, there're on the upper level.
not_available They appeal to men.
not_available It's at their average height.
not_available Down below are the ladies' favorites.
not_available I have seen the future, and this is it! Dave, where would it go? We put it in the second viewing room! What, the room that we've been using for storage? David, that room needs serious work.
not_available So? We use this as a reason to do it! Haven't we been planning to do that with the money Mom gave us anyway? Dave, that money is almost all gone.
not_available A two by five like this will not break your back.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available That includes installation.
not_available I'll even throw in a fresh coat of paint for your room.
not_available You cannot beat that with a stick.
not_available Nate, you always say we need to spend money to make money.
not_available Alright, how long to install? Give me the word, and you'll be making sales in two days.
not_available You really like it? 
not_available Who wouldn't?!? I've never seen David happier.
not_available It was like Christmas morning when we were kids.
not_available Whoa! Working out a little aggression there? We're having chicken piccatta.
not_available It needs to marinate over night.
not_available You never cook like this for me.
not_available You never even cook.
not_available And when Trevor goes back to New Haven, I need you to forget that I can! Alright.
not_available What should I wear? Speedo? Hair extensions? Wear what you want.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Don't wear one of your funeral suits.
not_available Oh, I thought you don't care.
not_available Wear something that makes you look like the sexy bad boy you really are.
not_available Something that makes Mister Wife and Kids question all of his middle
not_available class choices.
not_available I'm all for that, just as long as you wear something low
not_available cut in the back, so he can see my name branded on your ass! Hello! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey.
not_available New casket wall, huh? You boys are doing better than I thought.
not_available I'm Mitzi Dalton Huntley.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Do you need to plan a funeral? You have no idea who I am do you.
not_available I'm Southwest Regional Director for Kroehner Services, International.
not_available I was hoping that maybe you and your brother might share a cup of coffee with me.
not_available Well, hello! Mitzi Dalton Huntley.
not_available Nate Fisher.
not_available You're a runner, huh? It's bad for your knees.
not_available Yeah, well, everything's bad for something.
not_available So I hear.
not_available Why are you here? I made it abundantly clear to Matt Gilardi we're not interested in selling.
not_available Oh, Matt Gilardi is no longer with Kroehner.
not_available Yup.
not_available I fired his worthless ass, because I didn't like the way that he was representing our company.
not_available And that is why I'm here today.
not_available To do a little damage control, and apologize to you boys.
not_available Right.
not_available Oh, I don't blame you for not trusting me.
not_available Frankly, I'd be worried about you if you did.
not_available Cream with three sugars.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available You didn't put rat poison in here, did you? Drink it and find out.
not_available Oh, please! You boys aren't afraid of Big Bad Mitzi, are you? Come on.
not_available The economy is in a tail spin.
not_available Corporations are downsizing, and resizing, and reorganizing, including Kroehner.
not_available We can't afford to take you over.
not_available Honey, we've got problems of our own.
not_available Okay, let's just cut the foreplay.
not_available But that's the best part.
not_available It's not that we don't trust you.
not_available We despise everything you stand 
for corporate profits over personal service, stockholders over clients, greed over everything else, so I think you should take your gesture of good faith, and shove it up your ass! Ooh, well that's one opinion.
not_available Anything that you would care to add, David? No, I think Nate pretty much summed our position up.
not_available Well, alrighty then.
not_available I'll just show myself out.
not_available By the way, you might want to clean out your coffeemaker.
not_available Your coffee sucks.
not_available This is not so good.
not_available Well, who the fuck is named Mitzi anyway? That sounds like something you name a fuckin' chiuaua! Pretty bitchin', huh? When did you start getting all excited over caskets? You're turning into David! Don't ever say that again! Very nice.
not_available Oh, welcome to Casketeria! May I take your order? So, Mr.
not_available Langmead is all ready to go.
not_available Great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, Nate, have you guys had a chance to think about what weyou know? Uh, yeah yeah? 
not_available Yeah, let's go in the office.
not_available Okay.
not_available So do these really open? Can you, like, hide shit in here? Can you close the door? Close the door doesn't sound too good.
not_available We can't give you a loan right now, Rico.
not_available Look, we just spent a fortune on the new casket wall, and now we have to maintain an emergency fund in case Kroehner starts acting up again, which suddenly looks very likely.
not_available It was a tough choice, I'm sorry.
not_available How much did that casket wall cost? Rico, our first priority is keeping this house open.
not_available The more income we make, the more you can make.
not_available Tell me one thing.
not_available Did you and David decide to buy that wall before or after we spoke.
not_available Wow.
not_available You know, first you won't make me a partner, now you won't even God, you know, I've had it with you moping about not being a partner.
not_available It's not happening, alright? I wish I could help you, but I can't.
not_available I mean, fuck, we're your employer, alright! We're not a goddamned savings and loan! I'm sorry, Rico.
not_available If it were my money, I'd give you all of it, you know that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available I'll pass it along to my kids, after playing in a parking lot next to a dumpster! Fuck! I'm scared.
not_available What's gonna happen to me now? Well, that''s not my problem, pal.
not_available What? I was so young.
not_available Why me? Well, why the fuck not you? What? Did you think you were immune to this? Everybody! What makes you so fuckin' special? What do you think? I'm not signing up for anything.
not_available Oh, I'm not selling anything.
not_available I'm a visitor, just like you.
not_available Do you know how you can tell? The Elevated wear plastic tags.
not_available The Elevated? Oh, you'll learn the lingo.
not_available My daughter is graduating today.
not_available You? My business associate is graduating.
not_available So what exactly is this? Well, I don't know for sure myself.
not_available But Shelia has never been happier, so I wanted to see what it was all about.
not_available Let's get started.
not_available Today just might be the most important day of your entire lives.
not_available Come sit with me.
not_available There's safety in numbers.
not_available You cannot design a life that works without first drafting a clear blueprint.
not_available And you cannot construct a life that has meaning without first laying a solid foundation.
not_available You are the architect of your life.
not_available Not your emotionally distant father.
not_available Not your overly critical mother.
not_available Not your petty, fairweather friends.
not_available You ! It was hard the first time I stood up for myself.
not_available I always wanted everybody to like me.
not_available Even though I hated myself, you had to like me.
not_available When I rebuilt my foundation, and I was able to honor and elevate the better part of me, I realized I really like me.
not_available So you don't have to! I'm not a salvage job.
not_available I am not a teardown.
not_available I am not junk.
not_available It's taken me many years to say that.
not_available To believe it.
not_available There are days that I slip, and I treat people like shit.
not_available Like I treated myself for the last 30 years.
not_available But then I swear I'm going to win this.
not_available I'm going to build the life that I always wanted to live.
not_available I thought it was too late.
not_available Two terrible marriages.
not_available Children who won't even return my phone calls.
not_available It hurts.
not_available I'm 41 and I feel like I'm 80.
not_available But I have value.
not_available I'm still here.
not_available And as long as I believe in myself and speak fiercely from the Eye, then there's still hope.
not_available There's no mortgage on my life.
not_available I own it.
not_available Thank you, Mom.
not_available Well, that was humiliating.
not_available As if my self
not_available esteem wasn't low enough.
not_available It's kind of funny.
not_available All that time we were racquetball partners, we actually never played racquetball.
not_available I am serious about wanting to learn how to play.
not_available Are you available Thursday afternoon? I don't know.
not_available I'll check.
not_available Hey, wanna drop by my niece's birthday party later? 
not_available Eddie's on call.
not_available Uh, sure.
not_available I got a couple of errands to run.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available I've got nothing to do.
not_available I'll just tag along, if that's okay.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available Did you hear? Andy was doing Fry! I'm sorry.
not_available In English? Fry ! Wet ! Illy ! You're telling me you've never heard of Fry? I'm sorry.
not_available My parole officer frowns on controlled substances.
not_available Okay.
not_available You take your standard garden variety doobie, right? You dip it in embalming fluid, cut it with God knows what, and BAM! All your states are altered and you see God! Oryou're in tweaker hell, bouncing off lockers, and swallowing your own tongue, like Andy.
not_available Embalming fluid? Are you kidding me? I've smelled that shit! It's like lethal! You oughtta get out more.
not_available Live a little.
not_available You've done this?!? 
not_available No.
not_available But if you ever wanted to make a quick buck Oh, fuck off, Parker! I am not getting into the pot and embalming fluid business! I've had enough run
not_available ins with the police, thank you! At 50 $ a pop, you might change your mind.
not_available Oh my God! That fuckin' asshole! Right? I mean, Andy's gonna be in detox for like a week! Look okay? It looks fine.
not_available It looks like a page out of Gourmet Magazine! Excellent ! You know they put hairspray on food before they photograph it sometimes? Really? Yeah, I used to go out with this food stylist in Seattle.
not_available I mean, they do stuff to food that is way worse than what we do to bodies, believe you me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell me I look beautiful.
not_available You are beautiful.
not_available You even mean that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi! 
not_available Hi! Will, at least say "Hello!" Hello! Wow, Bren, it's great to see you! It really is.
not_available Oh my God! I'm gonna cry! You must be Dawn! 
not_available Hi! Oh, it's nice to meet you.
not_available Thank you so much for letting us bring Will.
not_available Trevor really wanted you to meet him.
not_available Oh, I really wanted to meet him.
not_available Hey, hi, Will! Will, can you say hi? He'll crash in a little while.
not_available I promise.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Trevor.
not_available Nate.
not_available Oh! Nate.
not_available Dawn.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Pleasure.
not_available This place is really cool.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, wine anyone? 
not_available I'd love a glass.
not_available I want wine! Oh, you do? Well, what do you say? Hi, Mr.
not_available Pooh Bear.
not_available Do you remember what we discussed in the car? .
not_available "I want wine, please!" Please So, how's the press tour going? Oh, God, I feel like such a sell
not_available out! I actually did "Politically Incorrect" last night! Wow! Was it fun? Oh, hardly.
not_available It was me, Kobe Bryant, that emaciated chick from "The Practice," and some twelve year old rap singer I'd never even heard of! I read your first book.
not_available I thought it was brilliant.
not_available Thank you! 
not_available I can send you a copy of the new one, if you'd like.
not_available I would.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You know, I read "
Charlotte Light and Dark." Oh, dear! Why? In grad school.
not_available I had this idiot professor who insisted qthat it was the perfect profile of a classic borderline personality.
not_available You've heard that before, right? I actually went to the library, looked up the symptoms and started behaving like that just to fuck with them! Seriously? That's brilliant! How old were you? I must have been 9 or 10.
not_available It was towards the end.
not_available Personally, I think it's a crock of shit.
not_available Did you ever notice how the majority of borderlines are women? I see it as just a misogynistic attempt to pathologize women who refuse to toe the patriarchal line! Yeah, yeah, I spent 6 months in Seattle on a teaching fellowship.
not_available Ever do any cliimbing up there? Oh, yeah, some boulder climbing.
not_available Normal climbing with ropes but Are you a cragger? Eh.
not_available Rank amateur urban kind, but I love it.
not_available You done climbing rock? Yeah, that's where I learned.
not_available I never knew 30 feet was so high off the ground.
not_available I've got a couple of buddies.
not_available They're real thrillseekers.
not_available I mean, they climb high, but no way I can do that.
not_available Gotta think about more than just myself now.
not_available Bren looks great.
not_available How's she doing? Oh, she's doing great.
not_available Man, she is so fucking smart! 
not_available Yes, she is! She used to run circles around me, I can tell you that.
not_available Everybody expected such great things from her.
not_available How's her brother? He's in the hospital right now.
not_available I just really wanted to get out of my head, so I took 18 months of classes, down at the Shiatsu Institute, thinking I'd do it until I figured out what I really wanted to do.
not_available And here we are 10 years later.
not_available But you love what you do, right? 
not_available I do.
not_available That's the key.
not_available And you know what? There is this girl in my health club.
not_available She doesn't do shiatsu, but I swear.
not_available She is gifted.
not_available Gif
not_available ted! You know, there's a science to shiatsu.
not_available Chinese medicine dates back over 2000 years.
not_available HmmThis is delicious, Brenda.
not_available You know, I never cook like this.
not_available I can make pasta, but that's about it.
not_available She's got me beat.
not_available I can make toast.
not_available And ice cubes.
not_available Nate does pretty good microwave popcorn.
not_available What do you do, Nate? I'm a funeral director.
not_available Really? Whatwhatwhat makes one to decide touh
not_available become a funeral director? Well, I was born into it, actually.

not_available What are you on? Don't lie to me! 
not_available I ain't on nothin'! Ok? What? You think I'm suicidal or just plain stupid? I think you need to stop living just for yourself, and start thinking about that little girl in there.
not_available I am 7 months clean! I work 2 jobs and take care of my kid! What? I forgot her motherfuckin' birthday! Do you want to arrest me for that? Look, you can do all the damage you want to yourself.

not_available I hate my fucking life.
not_available What's wrong? I was watching Trevor and Dawn tonight, thinking they're just soso complete.
not_available Like they have something that I will never have, ever.
not_available Either I wasn't born with it, or it was beaten out of me, or maybe, maybe I made myself into a self
not_available fulfilling prophecy, and I really am a borderline personality.
not_available Now, wouldn't that be ironic? Hey, what's going on with you? Je ne sais pas.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I spent my childhood performing for clinicians, the rest of my life taking care of my trainwreck of a brother, and I have no idea who I am.

not_available Want one? No thanks.

not_available We figure it'll pay for itself in less than 8 months.
not_available What did we spend on this? About 20000 $.
not_available How much is left in the reserve fund I gave you? I'll have to check.

not_available Appleby Caskets is owned by Kroehner.
not_available Since when? Since three weeks ago.
not_available Enjoy.
not_available She has us selling Kroehner caskets! Wow.
not_available She's good.
not_available Well, I guess we can at least help out Rico now.
not_available Yeah, that's a good idea.
not_available Then we go under, and he's out of work, and he can't afford to pay us back.
not_available Which won't matter because we won't exist anymore.
not_available David, we just saved 20000 $.
not_available We didn't save 20000 $ ! We just didn't spend it! Actually, we just lost 1600 $ because we had to give the Langmeads the Haven 4 for 10500, thank you very much! Honey, of course I love the house, but, believe me, they are never gonna give us the money.
not_available You love the house, though.
not_available We just have to keep on looking, baby.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available I went to the realtor this morning, and we got the house! I wrote a check for the down payment, and now Julio can have his own room! What? Where did you get the money? What do you mean? Okay, don't be mad.
not_available You went behind my back and asked your sister for the money? Are you crazy? 
not_available Rico, I wasn't about to lose that house.
not_available I provide for this family, NOT HER! I've gone 8 to 10 hours a day missing my kids to get us what we need.
not_available I DON'T NEED HER FUCKING HANDOUTS! Please, I don't want to hear any machismo bullshit today! What did you say to me? Baby, we have a house.
not_available It's our first house.
not_available Can you be happy? I'm cancelling that check.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available When the transmission went last month, where'd the money come from? When I chipped my tooth and we couldn't afford the dentist, who paid for it? Angelica's doing good.
not_available She has extra money.
not_available She's family.
not_available She loves us.
not_available She wants to help us.
not_available So please, put down the phone.
not_available We have a house.
not_available Everything is good.
not_available How's Andy? He's gonna be okay.
not_available What was he on? Some weird shit.
not_available I don't really know.
not_available Because I heard he smoked a joint dipped in embalming fluid.
not_available I wouldn't know.
not_available That wouldn't be embalming fluid that you stole from my house, right? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you have any idea how much trouble this could get us in? I mean, first of all, he could've died.
not_available And my brothers could be getting a fucking phone call from the cops right now, and you're gonna bring this on my head? Would you stop? Look, I gave Andy 5 or 6 to sell, and he fucking smoked them all.
not_available I am sorry that I fucked with you.
not_available But you took me down there, and I saw the stuff, and I just wasn't thinking.
not_available Oh, you were thinking.
not_available You were thinking about yourself! Claire, listen to me.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Look, the cops have a videotape of me and Andy and Dink robbing a fucking convenience store, and now I'm worried that Andy's gonna turn me in.
not_available Who the fuck are you? Fuck! Everything I touch turns to shit! Everything is shit! Everybody was right about you.
not_available You are the only good thing that I have left.
not_available Please don't give up on me.
not_available Please.
not_available No.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available You know, you're really starting to piss me off.
not_available What? What? What? What the fuck do you want from me? I want you to see me! Look at me! Look at me! That's more like it.
not_available You done with your run already? Uh
not_available I didn't need it.
not_available Well, the Langmead viewing is at 6.
not_available You're ready, right, because if you're not Dave, I need to tell you something.
not_available What have you done now? I think we should sit down.
not_available What is it? Um
not_available Listen, if I've been a dick or something, I'm really sorry.
not_available I found out that I have a condition, called AVM.
not_available It basically means
