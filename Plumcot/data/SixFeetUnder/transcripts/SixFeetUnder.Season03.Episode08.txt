
not_available ! See, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name ! It felt good to be out of the rain ! In the desert you can't remember your name ! Cos there ain't no one for to give you no name ! La, la! I don't understand.
not_available Why can't I go to arithmetic? Mary Jane, that time's over.
not_available Turn, turn, turn.
not_available You're almost a woman now.
not_available ! La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la! All right, last one.
not_available Hannah Grace, bring your hand mop.
not_available I'm a busy, busy businessman.
not_available All of you poor people, out of my way.
not_available Excuse me, young lady, how much is that hand mop? $3, sir.
not_available I love my money so much, I wanna keep it all.
not_available Golly, I do need a hand mop.
not_available This is a $111
not_available bill.
not_available Change, please.
not_available 108! 
not_available That's the number! All right, gather round and close your eyes, it's time for today's lesson from the Book of Daddy.
not_available Once upon a time, a wise person said, "Every day we must dance.
not_available "If only in our minds.
not_available " Why do we dance? Because we're happy to be alive.
not_available So every day we must dance to say, "Thank you, God.
not_available Thank you.
not_available "For life.
not_available " School's out! Everybody dance with your feet.
not_available Daddy.
not_available Vanessa? Vanessa.
not_available Don't say it, I'm serious.
not_available Your mom's been dead for four months.
not_available I get a year.
not_available We spend every Sunday in a graveyard, it's not good for the boys.
not_available Our sons.
not_available What? They're happy, they like to visit her, too.
not_available You know she's not here.
not_available Don't.
not_available You know what? Next Sunday, after church, let's have a party.
not_available Come on, she loved parties.
not_available I can't.
not_available I miss her so much it feels like somebody tore out my heart and fed it to dogs.
not_available Fine.
not_available Take them to Knutsberry Farm.
not_available Just come back before dark.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available You know, you don't smile or laugh any more.
not_available You don't act like you, you act like you're one of the Fishers.
not_available Vanessa, I think you're depressed.
not_available Why do you keep bugging me? I'm never gonna see my mother again.
not_available This is normal.
not_available I'm normal! And your organisation is called The People? Organisation? 
not_available I wish.
not_available The family.
not_available We were so happy.
not_available And you are his wife? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Not in a stupid paper way.
not_available Those whom God has joined, no man can tear asunder.
not_available Amen.
not_available We make it so.
not_available Let it be.
not_available Would you like us to embalm uh Daddy? 
not_available What's that? We replace the blood with embalming fluid in order to preserve the body.
not_available Yes, I want it.
not_available I want it.
not_available Abigail, it's just an old corpse.
not_available We don't care.
not_available Embalming will allow you to view the deceased one last time, which helps most people.
not_available The Book of Daddy says, "The physical body is only "tears, bones and desire.
not_available " You transcend, you don't preserve.
not_available Please, let's preserve his body.
not_available We love that body.
not_available Please.
not_available Oh, all right.
not_available All right.
not_available Abigail's a new soul.
not_available This is my first life.
not_available Really? One of us will stay with Daddy's flesh till it goes in the ground.
not_available We'll take shifts.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available Daddy is perfectly safe here.
not_available There are government agents.
not_available Space forces are always following us.
not_available No one's allowed in the embalming room without legal permission.
not_available Then get it.
not_available Right.
not_available Children.
not_available Holy fuck.
not_available Hello there.
not_available Hello there.
not_available Your washing.
not_available Mm.
not_available Mm.
not_available Have you ever noticed your profile? You look like an emperor.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Your face has character.
not_available It's not an everyday, bland face.
not_available Stop! You'll give me megalomania.
not_available Now, Ruth, pay attention.
not_available For the last time, you don't have to take care of me.
not_available I don't want you to do my laundry.
not_available I know.
not_available That's what makes it fun! Oh.
not_available My goodness! If I'd known you intended 
not_available Shit.
not_available Language.
not_available They want to hang around the body? 
not_available Not all at once.
not_available Eve, Abigail, Rachel, Rebecca.
not_available Rachel and Rebecca are sisters.
not_available Sick! 
not_available I don't get it.
not_available You could do like a Warhol series, with polygamous Mennonite concubines.
not_available I'm just worried this place will be crawling with kids.
not_available Man.
not_available Why us? They live three blocks away, we're neighbours.
not_available We're neighbours with Children Of The Corn.
not_available I don't want to be alone with sharp things and a Manson chick.
not_available Grow up! They simply subscribe to different spiritual and cultural beliefs.
not_available If you're so mature, you deal with them.
not_available No way! Tomorrow's gay paintball day.
not_available Um, Mom? Shudder.
not_available Oh! Hi, do you have some cheese? 'Why didn't you invite us?' 
not_available Because you have jobs.
not_available 'Hello! Sick days.
not_available ' It's Keith's thing.
not_available He's renewing ties with old gay cop buddies, I didn't think you'd want to.
not_available What kind of a candyass do you think I am? Everybody loves guns.
not_available What time? 
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available 'OK.' If we're showing skin, I have to go to the gym first.
not_available This is supposed to be sexy? Only religious fanatics with frozen shit up their asses could produce such horror.
not_available i.
not_available e.
not_available Americans.
not_available What is it now? A teen fashion magazine.
not_available This gauche repression, this adolescent exhibitionism.
not_available No wonder you can't tell the difference between violence and passion.
not_available You wanna kill those martyrs.
not_available It's pop culture.
not_available There isn't one person in this country who knows how to fuck.
not_available Cos real fucking would overthrow your government, it would send Americans screaming into the streets.
not_available You think you're different? Look at this! Empty.
not_available It's supposed to be empty.
not_available It's about empty.
not_available Bullshit.
not_available You're 18.
not_available What's wrong with you? Where's sexuality? Huh? You should be consumed with sex.
not_available Everything that happens should make you wanna fuck.
not_available Your flesh should be on fire all the time.
not_available It is.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh.
not_available I have an interview tomorrow so I'll meet you at paintball.
not_available Look for the owner, Boo.
not_available He'll tell you the rules and give you some practice.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available What? Don't kill me but Terry and Patrick are coming.
not_available They invited themselves.
not_available I would have checked with you but I didn't have a chance.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think it'll be a good opportunity for our friends to meet each other.
not_available OK, wait.
not_available I'm an asshole.
not_available I lied.
not_available I could have checked with you but I thought you'd rip my head off.
not_available David.
not_available I should trust you more.
not_available You know what, it's OK.
not_available It takes time.
not_available We're getting better and better.
not_available Why did you and Brenda break up? Why? 
not_available It's part of you.
not_available I should know about it.
not_available We were selfish.
not_available She went nuts, I went nuts, we tried to keep it together but it wasn't meant to be.
not_available So you just walked away from each other? 
not_available Yeah, pretty much.
not_available Nate, that's way too clean.
not_available Break
not_available ups are gory and humiliating.
not_available Not always.
not_available Yes, always.
not_available I mean, you get dumped like you're nothing, like you're fucking garbage, then you crawl around with your guts hanging out crying all over total strangers on the bus 
not_available Lisa No, it wasn't me.
not_available It was a friend.
not_available That's all you're gonna say about it? 
not_available What do you want? Tell me what happened so I can understand.
not_available How can I? It's not like I have it all figured out, I don't.
not_available It was seriously fucked up.
not_available Did it hurt? Yeah, it fucking hurt.
not_available I know.
not_available ! Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme ! Which never bore blossom since Adam was born ! Once he was a true love of mine ! Will you buy me an acre of land? ! Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme ! Between the sea foam and the sea sand ! Once he was a true love of mine! Can't we just observe? 
not_available No.
not_available Keith was actually happy this morning.
not_available I don't know about him.
not_available He's hot but I see big footprints all over your back.
not_available Shut up.
not_available She's jealous.
not_available Boo.
not_available Hi, we'd like to play with the other gay children.
not_available People, chose your comrades well.
not_available They'll lead you to glory or they'll bury your ass in shame.
not_available Five on five, two reds switch over.
not_available Keith, you put on the wrong colour.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available You did.
not_available We're on different teams.
not_available It'll be more fun.
not_available Come on, they're newbies.
not_available They're stupid and weak like kittens.
not_available Hurry up, Reds.
not_available I'll go.
not_available Whoo! 
not_available Keith.
not_available David.
not_available Do we need to talk? 
not_available I'm tired of talking.
not_available Don't you ever get tired of talking? 
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Fuck.
not_available You're embarrassing me in front of 
not_available The leading ladies? I've been there.
not_available I survived.
not_available That was not my fault.
not_available I hinted.
not_available How could you forget Waterworld? It was three hours long.
not_available I'm not thinking about that.
not_available All I want today is a good time.
not_available It was only a party game.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Welcome to my party baby.
not_available Bitch, you set me up.
not_available Any changes? Nope.
not_available No.
not_available OK, then.
not_available You, you're out.

not_available Game commences on the Delta at 1400 hours.
not_available Keep it clean.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Is your hopper full? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Sorry Keith wouldn't play on our team.
not_available I'm not.
not_available OK, hate this.
not_available Where do we go? 
not_available To Magic Mountain, like normal fags.
not_available There's cover a few metres that way.
not_available I can't do metric conversion in combat.
not_available Goggles down! Suck it up, Louise.
not_available Get out there and lay some paint.
not_available Come on.
not_available Here! What do you want me to do? Stop yelling like a fishwife.
not_available Yikes! Smell this.
not_available Think this is old hummus or baba ghanouj? I think when they're old, they become the same thing.
not_available Hm.
not_available You brought your shadow.
not_available He's not my shadow.
not_available You need to go to Azusa for me.
not_available Why? 
not_available You know what the name is? Azusa.
not_available It's everything from A to Z in the USA.
not_available Azusa.
not_available That's how you guys name your towns.
not_available What am I eating? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Well, taste.
not_available I think it's clay! Look, I can't go to Azusa for you.
not_available Russell and I are going downtown.
not_available Find this person.
not_available She's donating Visqueen for the alumni show.
not_available She's a terrible sculptor.
not_available It'll be interesting for you.
not_available I'll call her and tell her you're on the way.
not_available This is really unexpected.
not_available Azusa's a really long drive.
not_available Russell and I have plans.
not_available It's like 115 degrees in the desert.
not_available You're an assistant.
not_available Assist.
not_available OK.
not_available OK, let's go.
not_available No, Russell.
not_available You could organise my monographs.
not_available What would you do in Azusa anyhow? Fuck.
not_available I love her, too.

not_available That's cheating.
not_available You'll be known as a wipe forever.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available You're dead.
not_available Put up your gun and walk out of bounds.
not_available Those are the rules.

not_available Give it up.
not_available Fuck you, Ratso.
not_available You're out! 
not_available Damn.

not_available David cheated.
not_available He's our captain, he should know.
not_available I'm a wiper.
not_available Cool.
not_available You smart
not_available talk the other girl, she's sensitive.
not_available I got something for you to try.
not_available We can win.
not_available Yay.
not_available No, I do not think that it's paranoid.
not_available I researched Todd's ex
not_available fiancee.
not_available I spent $150 on the internet.
not_available Did you find out why he loved her? No.
not_available But I can tell you the serial numbers on her breast implants.
not_available It's because I'm curious, not because I think Brenda's gonna take Nate away.
not_available Nate adores Maya, he would never 
not_available He thinks about her.
not_available How can you tell? He's twitchy and far away.
not_available That's Todd with basketball.
not_available And there's this Brenda vibe.
not_available I know I'm being compared but I don't know what to.
not_available That's what kills me.
not_available Come on, Todd doesn't compare? No, he's not deep.
not_available I love that.
not_available I know where Brenda works.
not_available Oh, wow.
not_available OK, don't shoot.
not_available I'm dead.
not_available See? Dead newbie walking.
not_available Happy? 
not_available Hell, yeah.
not_available Damn it! You cheated, asshole.
not_available Who's your daddy? Haha! Come on! Is that all you got? Get off the field, you flannelshirt, mullethead dyke, or fight like a man! You're a cock
not_available sucking pansy.
not_available I'd like to make an appointment for a traditional massage with Brenda.
not_available I hear she's so good.
not_available 'She's booked solid for this month.
not_available ' 
not_available Booked.
not_available They always say that.
not_available They try and give you an intern.
not_available Just do a Carol.
not_available This is totally unacceptable.
not_available Cherie Lansing told me you'd help me out.
not_available Shall I call her right now or shall I call your supervisor? 'You're in luck.
not_available There's been a cancellation.
not_available ' 'Can you be here in an hour?' An hour? 
not_available I got Maya.
not_available 'Your name?' Dana Todd.
not_available So how long have you and Keith been together? Well, we were together for a few months, then we split up and he was with somebody else and I was Oh, never mind.
not_available We got back together and it's been almost a year.
not_available I've been talking with a couple of The People.
not_available They have some interesting beliefs.
not_available They certainly believe in dairy.
not_available The little ones beg for cheese.
not_available Yes.
not_available Cows are sacred to them.
not_available Did you know they only recognise the love of God? They don't believe in romance.
not_available Where did all those children come from? We didn't get into it.
not_available But romantic love wasn't even invented until the 14th century.
not_available I never heard that.
not_available Petrarch.
not_available He was Italian.
not_available Arthur, the things you know.
not_available This morning 
not_available We don't have to talk about it.
not_available We do.
not_available We can pretend it never happened.
not_available That'd be a lie.
not_available It was two seconds.
not_available I didn't plan it, it was an accident.
not_available Your friendship has so much value for me.
not_available Anything more would be unprofessional.
not_available I know.
not_available Please, don't kiss me again.
not_available I never will.
not_available Never.
not_available Friends? 
not_available Friends.
not_available You'll have to help yourselves.
not_available I'm out of control.
not_available What are you doing here? There's no action.
not_available Shh! Let's go bust a move on Sarge.
not_available Hey! Don't make me tell you twice.
not_available I would have voted him off first.
not_available You didn't think he was cute? 
not_available No.
not_available Not forever cute, just for the island cute.
not_available What about that hot lawyer? 
not_available He didn't fish.
not_available True.
not_available Jeanne Tripplehorn.
not_available Fisher &amp; Diaz.

not_available tee I'll take him with me to hell.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available I really like your studio.
not_available You work in so many different media.
not_available That's because I can't find the right one.
not_available So, what do you do in Azusa? I teach at a Christian Junior College.
not_available And I art.
not_available You're really good.
not_available Oh, fuck you.

not_available Yes.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I thought you were already on the table.
not_available What? 
not_available The robe.
not_available They should have given you a small.
not_available I think it is a small.
not_available Never mind.
not_available They size those things for egos, not for people.
not_available I'm not really a spa lady.
not_available Neither am I.
not_available OK.
not_available I can come back.
not_available No, I'm ready.
not_available I'm Mary Jane.
not_available I remember.
not_available Sorry you lost your daddy.
not_available He's not lost.
not_available Well, right.
not_available His body died in this place but not in every place.
not_available He's fine if you step a little this way and squint.
not_available Know what I mean? Yeah.
not_available He was Daddy but he wasn't my daddy.
not_available Excuse me? If you meant human.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you like cheese? Um, yeah What kind of cheese? Um 
not_available Cheddar.
not_available Yeah! Me, too.
not_available Um

not_available huh.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Monterey Jack with jalapeno.
not_available No.
not_available Brie.
not_available Brie? What's brie? Does that taste like blue cheese? Because I hate blue cheese.
not_available I know your name.
not_available Yeah? I'm almost a woman now.
not_available All right? Yeah.
not_available Oh! No, I'm sorry.
not_available I was working on your hara.
not_available That's the seat of mind
not_available body power.
not_available You know, if you believe in that sort of thing.
not_available I do.
not_available There are places we store trauma, tension.
not_available Our selves know what we go through.
not_available Our bodies remember.
not_available Sometimes just a little pressure then tears.
not_available My life has never been so good.
not_available I have a beautiful baby.
not_available I'm happily married.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available I know.
not_available Happy stuff, it's pretty new.
not_available Maybe you just needed a good cry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Are you OK? I'm fine.
not_available You look sad.
not_available I'm not so lucky.
not_available Not lately.
not_available But I wouldn't change anything.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, if you change one thing, that changes everything.
not_available And some things are the way they should be.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on, sweetheart, let's go find Mummy Abigail.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available May I? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available Ruth Fisher.
not_available Eve.
not_available It was my mother's pattern.
not_available It would have been mine.
not_available Another name, another life.
not_available The silver was a wedding present.
not_available That was another life, too.
not_available You're a widow? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available May I ask you something? The other three? 
not_available How on earth? I was grateful.
not_available Honestly? You didn't know Daddy.
not_available Sometimes less than one man is more than enough.
not_available But when your husband proposes to other women He never did.
not_available Never once.
not_available They all came to him, the same way I did.
not_available We all chose him.
not_available Poor guy, he never had anything to say about it.
not_available Weren't you jealous? Didn't it hurt your feelings when he'd go upstairs? If the people around you were dying of cold and you had a fire, wouldn't you share? I did worry at first because they were younger and I thought I had nothing to offer that could compare.
not_available But I feel young.
not_available Oh, so do I.
not_available Because we are young, Mrs Fisher.
not_available Time doesn't tell the truth about our souls.
not_available Only love.
not_available We're all children when we truly love.
not_available Even Daddy? 
not_available Especially Daddy.
not_available That man They don't know what they want, that's why you have to choose.
not_available Julio, I want you to find your brother, go into the bathroom and close the door.
not_available I'll be there in a minute, OK? Uh Poppy loves you.
not_available Just go sit in the tub, OK? Wha? Julio? Sleep all day, I don't give a shit, but do not fuck around with my kids.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available You didn't do anything.
not_available Do you know why Julio's home? 
not_available No.
not_available Because he has lice, Vanessa, like some dirty convict.
not_available And we probably have it too because you have stopped being his mother.
not_available I had to hear it from the school nurse.
not_available You don't even know what's on the heads of your children.
not_available If he has lice, then we're just gonna have to move.
not_available No, we don't have to move, OK? I bought the shampoo but you have got to change.
not_available You're right, you're right.
not_available I'm a shitty mother, my own mother would have killed me.
not_available What am I doing? I need help.
not_available We'll get you the help.
not_available OK? I love you.
not_available Can you forgive me? Of course I forgive you.
not_available Our kids have bugs.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Are you deaf? I've been out there 20 minutes yelling for help.
not_available I had to drag all that Visqueen in.
not_available Oh, hello.
not_available Everything go smoothly? Absolutely.
not_available Can we leave now? Your Visqueen is in the garage.
not_available You were supposed to take it to school.
not_available I'd help but I'm dining with a provost at Patina.
not_available Well, I'd help but I'm dining with my boyfriend at Taco Bell.
not_available Take it after.
not_available No.
not_available And I really don't wanna be your assistant any more.
not_available Why is that? 
not_available All I do is run personal errands for you and it's taking too much time away from my own work.
not_available Fine.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available No, on that field you gotta get around back.
not_available You cheated your ass off.
not_available I was robbed.
not_available Jeez, totally illegal.
not_available Totally! Are you going out later? You know, you look like a leprechaun.
not_available Am I right? Never mind.
not_available They may be hell on the battlefield but they have no party stamina.
not_available How did they make it through the '80s? 
not_available And they call us choirboys.
not_available My God! We were supposed to meet James and Katie an hour ago.
not_available They're married, he's not gay.
not_available I'll walk you out.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Love you all, soldiers.
not_available Whoohoo! 
not_available That was fun today.

not_available Careful, somebody might take him away.
not_available Yeah, go ahead and try.
not_available Dude You and me, we're the same.
not_available Maybe.
not_available I live down La Habra.
not_available Look, I didn't mean to, but I'm too wasted to drive.
not_available You could have pulled out the couch.
not_available He was already asleep on the floor.
not_available I'll get him another blanket.
not_available Shut up and get over here.
not_available No.
not_available You killed me today.
not_available You loved it.
not_available Not as much as you did.
not_available You tried to kill me.
not_available Can we help you? It's cold out there.

not_available So, Sarge, will you be paintballing today? No.
not_available I gotta get going soon.
not_available Working on my uncle's car.
not_available Ah.
not_available Scoot over.
not_available I left my number next to the bed so if you're ever in La Habra, you could find me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Will you pass the funnies? Daddy's Book is where he put everything he found that was true.
not_available This is why we live by the Book of Daddy, which says there is no death, there is only birth.
not_available And birth and birth and birth.
not_available The Book of Daddy says, "Consider the trees "that allow the birds to perch "and fly away without calling them back.
not_available "If your heart can be like a tree, you'll be close to the way.
not_available " The Book of Daddy says, "When the multitude laughs at you, you are blessed.
not_available " And this is what Daddy wants us to know.
not_available "I depart as air.
not_available "I shake my white locks at the runaway sun, "I bequeath myself to the dirt "to grow from the grass I love.
not_available "If you want me again, "look for me under your boot soles.
not_available "You will hardly know who I am or what I mean "but I shall be good health to you nevertheless.
not_available "Missing me one place? Search another.
not_available "I stop somewhere.
not_available "Waiting for you.
not_available " I hate to see The People go.
not_available Mm.
not_available I just hope the cheque clears.
not_available Of course it will.
not_available Daddy worked in hospitals, he was a clown.
not_available Why am I not surprised? There's a big market for hand mops and they're on welfare and social security.
not_available Yeah, that's where I want my tax dollars to go.
not_available I'd rather buy them cheese than build bombs.
not_available At least they practise what they preach.
not_available The People won't kill any living creature.
not_available They've all had lice for years.
not_available I've had to boil everything but I don't mind.
not_available Mom, that's disgusting.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available 'What are you dressed like that for?' 'I'm going to a funeral.
not_available So are you.
not_available ' 'Yeah? Who died?' 'Walker Stevenson.
not_available ' 'Give me a break.
not_available ' 'I think these are people we know ' Did Olivier make a move on you? Whoa, whoa.
not_available What? Since I got back from Azusa you've been all quiet and weird and he really likes you.
not_available Did he make a move on you? Cos he really likes you, too.
not_available No, but he flirts.
not_available Well, he flirts with everything.
not_available Well, did he? 
not_available No.
not_available Jesus.
not_available I mean, we we smoked a joint and we watched TV.
not_available And even if he did make a move, hello, I'm not gay.
not_available I'm your fucking boyfriend.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come here.
not_available Look, if he ever does anything, you have to tell me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ugh.
not_available So, we're gonna have to boil everything.
not_available If Maya gets lice Don't worry.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You're looking good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Feel like I haven't seen you lately.
not_available What's been going on? Wouldn't you like to know? Right now, I could fuck you where you stand.
not_available What's different? Is it hair? Perfume? Maybe nothing's different.
not_available Maybe it's just me.
not_available Maybe.
not_available You're lucky I love you.
not_available You're lucky I do.
not_available I care for you, Arthur.
not_available I care for your music.
not_available I care for your hankies.
not_available I won't pretend I don't.
not_available That would be a lie.
not_available If you want me to leave you alone, I will.
not_available But that's your choice because I choose you.
not_available There's something I didn't tell you about Petrarch.
not_available Oh? He started the Renaissance.
