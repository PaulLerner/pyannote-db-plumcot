not_available poisoned bread that might kill 100 people Is that good? Oh, Jesus I gotta get to my chiropractor.
not_available Hey.
not_available Think anyone's ever had sex in here? Now, why the fuck would you even think that, huh? Romano? Ro..
not_available Romano? Romano? You Are OK? "THOMAS ALFREDO ROMANO MAY 16, That was
not_available you made the weirdest noise back there.
not_available I if were you, I would not get into the weird noise contest.
not_available Oh, yeah? I love this song.
not_available This? Really? Yeah.
not_available My dad had all these old big band records.
not_available All this reminds me of being a kid still being blissfully ignorant of what a sick joke life can be.
not_available I'd have pegged you as more of a fan of what? Sting? U2? You know, grew up in the 80s but too straight to be into real hardcore punk stuff.
not_available Oh, yeah? And I suppose you were into the really hardcore punk stuff? Kind of.
not_available I think it was just the heroine talking Oh man, I love that look! I really have to go.
not_available Mom and David and I are having some sort of family meeting to discuss whether we should sell the business to Kroehner.
not_available Oh, God, I hope we will.
not_available Why? So I can get the hell out of here and go back to Seattle.
not_available Why don't you come with me? Why on earth would I want to do something like that? Because you are my woman.
not_available You're out of your mind.
not_available Oh, yeah? How come my name's branded on your ass? I love that look.
not_available You don't understand how serious this is.
not_available We're under siege by a major corporation.
not_available Stop being so dramatic.
not_available Mom, it's a fact.
not_available David, we all have problems.
not_available This oat bran is stuck on here like cement because you didn't soak any water in it, thank you very much.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers to demand money up front.
not_available Now Continental Caskets wants us to pay for anything we put in the showroom before we actually sell it.
not_available That's thousands of dollars.
not_available Your father never let these things <br.
not_available get to him like you do.
not_available Well, he never had to deal with this kind of situation.
not_available I'm sure things will work out.
not_available They always do.
not_available No, they don't.
not_available Good morning.
not_available What's going on with you? Nothing Oooh, what a little moonlight can dooo
not_available oo.
not_available Dooo
not_available oo.
not_available Oooh, Oooh, what a little moonlight can do to you.
not_available Do to you.
not_available You're in love
not_available You're not leaving here till you put some food in your stomach.
not_available Oh, I'm starving.
not_available Are you bulimic? Is that what we're going to have to deal with now? Mom, apparently you want a child with an eating disorder.
not_available Morning.
not_available How was your run? I haven't gone yet.
not_available I stayed over at Brenda's last night.
not_available Oh.
not_available No one cares where you were.
not_available Why do you have to tell people every single thing you do all day? Sorry.
not_available I forgot we're supposed to live under a shroud of secrecy So I think we should sell, and I'm not saying that just because I don't want to have anything to do with this business.
not_available Come on.
not_available Have you looked at their offer? That's a lot of money.
not_available Stock options.
not_available Do you have any idea how arrogant you are? You don't get to decide what we're doing.
not_available I own half, Dave.
not_available You haven't spent the last 11 years working here.
not_available You didn't give up anything for this.
not_available Well, is this really what you want to be doing with your life, or are you just trying to make a dead man happy? We should have this conversation later.
not_available Why can't she be a part of this?
not_available Thank you.
not_available Nate, this is all I know.
not_available So stay and run the place for Kroehner Or go to law school like you always wanted.
not_available Take my trust fund.
not_available I'll take the cash.
not_available I think Nate's right.
not_available Who knows how long any of us has left? We should do what makes us happy.
not_available Fine.
not_available Sell.
not_available What do I care? You mean it? Sure.
not_available Let's just invalidate my entire life.
not_available I'll go to Gilardi today and tell him our decision.
not_available Choice.
not_available / I don't know.
not_available I guess the one with the satin interior.
not_available Ma, there were like five with satin material.
not_available Let's just go with the Classic Regal.
not_available I like the White Pearl.
not_available Classic Regal will be fine.
not_available Who cares anyway? My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces by a big giant dough mixer.
not_available Oh, Ma, Pop wasn't in that many pieces.
not_available Ma, he's gonna look just as you remember him.
not_available Right? Um It says in your brochure you have a gifted restorative artist Whatever Can he make sure Pop looks good enough for an open casket or not? Because, you know, we'll go elsewhere.
not_available You'll be completely satisfied with our work I guarantee it.
not_available Humpty Dumpty, huh? Train tracks? Uh
not_available dough mixer.
not_available Can you go to St.
not_available Joseph's to pick him up? Not today.
not_available It's my cousin Ramone's baby's christening.
not_available I told you about this.
not_available I'll give you 50 bucks extra A hundred.
not_available I'm the godfather, David.
not_available Shit.
not_available I can't go because of Mrs.
not_available Bond's viewing, and I can't call the service, because Kronauer told Marty if he does our pickups, he'll lose all their business.
not_available So send Nate.
not_available You know, I know he hates this shit, but he's your partner now, right? He's like in a lot of pieces.
not_available Humpty Dumpty, I know.
not_available Careful, that could be his head.
not_available Jesus.
not_available / Or his pelvis.
not_available Aah, it's probably his head So what happened to Rico? He get canned? No, he's just busy.
not_available You new over there? Nope.
not_available I'm just a temp.
not_available I heard Old Man Fisher kicked.
not_available You know him? Not really.
not_available Hey, no offense, pal.
not_available You might want to call your agency and ask for a new assignment I'm already on it.
not_available Hey, Gabe.
not_available I looked for you in the quad this morning, but I didn't see you so maybe you stayed home because you were tired or something Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you and not in any serious way, I was just thinking about you casually.
not_available OK.
not_available Bye.
not_available I wanna kill myself.
not_available This Little Piggy Lover, Foot Slut Toe Sucker, and Oink Oink Little Piggy.
not_available It's such a fucking easy decision for him.
not_available Oh, and Mom takes his side.
not_available Big surprise.
not_available It's like I don't even exist.
not_available Like me giving up law school meant nothing.
not_available So fight.
not_available If you really want to keep the business, don't give it away.
not_available See, that's just it.
not_available All day long I've been feeling this incredible sense of relief I don't know if I want to keep it.
not_available I could do anything.
not_available I'm still young.
not_available Right? You kidding? You're still a baby.
not_available What about that one? That's a little too Mayberry for me.
not_available Something simple and clean, like the ones that hang in the deserted truck stop and that handsome drifter blows into town.
not_available Of course.
not_available What about that one? Not bad.
not_available I could see Ava Gardner lying beneath it, plotting to steal Clark Gable away from Grace Kelley People start their lives over all the time, right? Yeah.
not_available That guy just cruised you.
not_available Really? Bitch! Right in front of me, like I'm not even here.
not_available He did? And I missed it? Well, I'm sorry Oh, Ruth.
not_available Amelia, another casserole.
not_available Lemon bars.
not_available The kids'll love 'em.
not_available Don't you have candy striping today? I did, but I told them my best friend needed me.
not_available You made the right decision.
not_available I know.
not_available I never realized how much money there was to be made in the funeral business.
not_available Death care industry.
not_available And it's only gonna grow with all the baby boomers and all Wow, gee.
not_available There'll be bodies everywhere.
not_available Hopefully..
not_available and all the final resting places provided by Kroehner.
not_available With a little help from Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available You know, we've had our eyes on your operation for some time.
not_available Your father was a nice guy, but he didn't know how to run a business.
not_available Well, my dad was never in it for the money.
not_available I think he was more concerned about, you know, helping people.
not_available You wanna help people, join the Peace Corps.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Greedy little Nazi fuck.
not_available So, how exactly will this work? We won't change the appearance of your unit at all.
not_available Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading, perhaps, but preparation of loved ones will now take place at a centralized location which services several other units technicians on staff, constantly producing.
not_available So it's like a little factory of embalming.
not_available Preparation for visitation.
not_available Now, we maintain a small fleet of vehicles.
not_available Hearses Funeral carriages.
not_available Dead wagons.
not_available Removal vans.
not_available Once you centralize operations, you'd be amazed how you maximize profits.
not_available So, in the end, we're all just Human McNuggets.
not_available Just as we began.
not_available I like you, Nate.
not_available You hear that, buddy boy? He likes you.
not_available Wow, you are so cool! Your initial payment, sir.
not_available The rest will follow after both of our lawyers have held up the process long enough to justify their fees In the meantime, we'd like to send a facilities inspector out to take a look at things as early as next week.
not_available I'll see ya later.
not_available / Yeah, right, later.
not_available Hey.
not_available what's going on? Fucking asshole.
not_available Why is my car covered with words like "toe sucker"? I
not_available I don't know.
not_available You didn't, for instance, blab to your friends that you bagged me, and that I sucked your toes? I might have told 1 person.
not_available IAndyhe justhe asked me what I did the night before, so I told him I mean
not_available You know, it's not like I thought this was going to work out, because I know nothing ever works out.
not_available But I guess I just wanted to enjoy this for a little bit.
not_available And instead, the whole world is calling me "this little piggy lover.
not_available " I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry I
not_available Come on, so what? So what? So it got out? Who cares? You know what I wish? I wish that just once people wouldn't act like the cliches that they are.
not_available This can go to good will.
not_available And this, and this one too.
not_available Maybe Nathaniel's clothes are too dull for good will.
not_available Does good will ever refuse anything? Ruth, if you want to cry, cry.
not_available What are you talking about? Just let it out.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available For the last time, I'm fine.
not_available I just think it's very interesting.
not_available You're supposed to be making two piles.
not_available One for good will, and one for memories, and yet you have not held onto one thing.
not_available The memory pile was your stupid idea.
not_available What am I supposed to do with Nathaniel's old clothes? Make pillows? A quilt? I mean, how about just burn them all? How can someone with so little clothing have so much clothing? What is this? Nothing.
not_available It's stupid.
not_available Something about visiting the pyramids, taking ballet lessons.
not_available I wrote down things I might want to do now that I'm
not_available have more time.
not_available Well, I think that's wonderful.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available It's stupid.
not_available I don't even want to do any of these things.
not_available I just did it, because some book told me to.
not_available What am I, going to be in "Swan Lake"? Why not? You see stories like that on the news all the time.
not_available It's inspiring.
not_available It's depressing.
not_available It seems so desperate.
not_available Maybe it's a little desperate.
not_available Besides, who knows? It's always possible you might meet a man.
not_available That part of my life is over.
not_available You know, you're supposed to flip this mattress every two months.
not_available I do mine every 14 weeks.
not_available Well, I can't remember ever flipping this It's probably been 20 years.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get up.
not_available You haven't finished going through Nathaniel's clothes.
not_available Ruth.
not_available Ruth! How can I help you? You can lift this up with me.
not_available An uncovered mattress is so sad.
not_available Help me turn this over.
not_available Does it feel any different? No.
not_available Save our park! Save our park! No more money for politicians, money for parks, "Live and let play" "Save our city's green spaces" "Think of our children" "Sellout" "Take the Money and Run" "Go back to Seattle, bag boy" "You fucking moron.
not_available " What are you doing? You have a gift.
not_available You can help people.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go back to peddling soy milk and nailing waitresses What do I care? I'm dead.
not_available Move it, asshole! So now you don't want to sell? I know it sounds crazy.
not_available Oh, no, not at all.
not_available We'll keep the business for the rest of the day, then sell it again tomorrow for a few hours.
not_available Just here me out.
not_available No, no, this is a good system.
not_available We'll sell in the mornings, keep it in the afternoons, and maybe sometimes we sell again in the evenings when we really can't make a decision.
not_available David, you're not being fair.
not_available When I didn't want to sell, you could have cared less.
not_available And when Nate doesn't want to sell, you listen.
not_available OK, I'm a terrible mother who's responsible for all you problems.
not_available Happy? So what? You had some revelation and now you want to be a funeral director.
not_available How long is that going to last? He does have a point, Nate.
not_available You don't always stick with things.
not_available I mean, come on, you can't even stand to be in the same room with a dead body.
not_available I know, but there's a reason for that.
not_available This is what I'm supposed to do.
not_available Which is why I've spent so much time running away from it My whole life, I've been a tourist Now, I have the chance to do some good instead of just sucking up air.
not_available I know it's a lot to ask of you, I know, but I just really think that we can do this You and me.
not_available Together.
not_available Brothers, like we used to be.
not_available We could still sell to Kroehner and both manage Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available Yeah, but then we're just spokesmodels working to make fat Republican stockholders richer And Kroehner doesn't give a shit about people.
not_available We care.
not_available We can help them through their grief.
not_available That's what we do.
not_available This is a business, Nate.
not_available It's not a charity.
not_available Well, of course it's a business, but it's more than that, and you know it.
not_available OK.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll call Gilardi and tell him he can kiss our collective ass.
not_available Language! Maybe Dad knew what he was doing.
not_available You really did not have to waste this stuff on me.
not_available Oh, please, my parents got a case of it from some TV movie they were technical advisors on.
not_available Some serial killer thing for cable.
not_available Oh, they're such whores! They'll do anything.
not_available Gosh.
not_available Do you believe this stuff is expensive? You know, I'd always wanted to tell off some corporate shit some greedy little Nazi fuck, you know? That's very hostile.
not_available No, it's very diplomatic.
not_available I just said thanks, but we changed our minds.
not_available What did he do? He didn't do anything.
not_available What's he gonna do? This is completely unacceptable.
not_available What can I tell you? The Baxters changed their mind They're going with the Unger Mortuary.
not_available Was there a reason? They probably just underbid you.
not_available I know Hal Unger.
not_available He never underbid anybody.
not_available Unger moved to Florida.
not_available They were bought out by Kroehner months ago.
not_available Sign here.
not_available You know, I didn't just decide to stay in Los Angeles because of the business.
not_available I had another reason.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Don't ruin this.
not_available I've got such a nice buzz going.
not_available It was you.
not_available Nate, get serious.
not_available / It's true.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available You're staying here because you found something that you want to do.
not_available I am the extra bonus that probably won't work out.
not_available Sometimes your honesty gets really tiresome.
not_available I don't want any children.
not_available Whoa, who said anything about children? I was referring to you.
not_available / Aah.
not_available I got something for you.
not_available Open it.
not_available Glen Miller Orchestra at the Hollywood Palladium.
not_available Brenda, this is so cool! I've never been to the Palladium.
not_available You grew up in L.A., and you've never been to the Palladium? That's pathetic.
not_available Hey, this is for three weeks from now.
not_available How'd you know I wouldn't be in Seattle? I didn't.
not_available Good morning, Rico.
not_available Just what I need.
not_available Another boss breathing down my neck.
not_available Hey, put me to work.
not_available Hello? The pregnancy's kicked Vanessa's hormones into overload.
not_available I gotta go talk her down.
not_available Look, if you really want to help, take Mr.
not_available Romano out of the bag and put him on the table.
not_available And remember, breathe through your mouth, man.
not_available He's pretty ripe.
not_available Oh, Christ.
not_available Nate? / Great.
not_available Look what you made me do! Oh, gross.
not_available I want to talk to you about something.
not_available I don't know if you noticed but I'm a little busy right now, swimming in a man's guts.
not_available I don't know what this is.
not_available I'm picking up a part of a person, and I don't even know what part it is! Fine.
not_available I'll
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Sorry.
not_available What the hell are you doing? I work here now.
not_available I have to be a part of things.
not_available Let Rico take care of him.
not_available I have a job for you that's much better suited to your particular talents.
not_available Morning, Nate.
not_available Lovely day, isn't it? I've seen better.
not_available I only wanted to say hello, seeing that I'm your new neighbor.
not_available We just bought that house across the street.
not_available Got it for a song, too.
not_available Oh, and by the way, we're planning to put you out of business in six months.
not_available They're opening a Poseidon Society across the street?!? That's right.
not_available What is a Poseidon Society? They sell cremations.
not_available Cheap cremations.
not_available Now for a fraction of what we charge, you can now dump off the relative you never really liked anyway at the Torch Mart across the street.
not_available I guess we have to just continue to do our best.
not_available And how exactly do we do that? You know, Lu, the florist, that sweet old guy? He just upped what he charges us by 200%.
not_available And that chemical dealer on Figaro is now suing us over some non
not_available existent shipment of cavity fluid.
not_available And every other supplier that we have in common with Kroehner has suddenly developed some sort of problem with Fisher and Sons.
not_available For some unknown reason by the name of Kroehner, the health department is going to inspect us next week.
not_available Yeah, so what? Isn't everything clean? Yes, but any inspection means we have to update something.
not_available If it's the ventilation system, we're sunk.
not_available We should've sold.
not_available Uh, Nate.
not_available I'm having a problem.
not_available You don't happen to have Mr.
not_available Romano's foot on you, do you? Do you remember picking up the foot? I think so, but my eyes were shut, and I was trying not to vomit.
not_available I'm not happy.
not_available Well, that's very interesting, David, because I'm ecstatic! Maybe the morgue never gave us that foot.
not_available Both feet are listed in the paperwork, Nate.
not_available Just think, Nate.
not_available Is there any other point you could have lost it? Lost what? Nothing.
not_available If you lost something, look under the bed.
not_available That's where things always turn up.
not_available I doubt that applies in this case.
not_available That's what people always say, then they find whatever it is they're looking for under the bed.
not_available Mom, we're really busy down here.
not_available The upstairs machine is broken.
not_available I called the repairman, but Oh my God, what is this?!? Someone left the Kleenex in their pocket, and now it's all over everything.
not_available Disgusting! Nate, retrace your steps.
not_available Is there any other point you could have lost the foot? I almost dropped him at the morgue, but the bag didn't open.
not_available I tripped on the stairs, but nothing fell out.
not_available I banged him into the freezer
not_available nothing.
not_available Spilled him on the floor, but And I picked him up off the floor.
not_available It should be here.
not_available I'd say it's an 8 million dollar lawsuit.
not_available At least.
not_available Hey, you like my new shoes? They're size 12! Toe slut! Amelia? It's me, Ruth.
not_available Your best friend needs help.
not_available Is he all put together? Oh, he's 100% there.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I'd like to see him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Our enbalmer is a little on the artistic side.
not_available He gets crazy if he has any "input.
not_available " It's best to wait until we're completely done.
not_available One more thing.
not_available His shoes.
not_available What are you, an idiot? Those are his favorite shoes.
not_available He has perfectly comfortable loafers.
not_available Which would be much more appropriate.
not_available Yes, I myself have loafers, which are just like walking on air.
not_available We should have just told them the truth.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Sorry, Mrs.
not_available Romano, but my idiot of a brother lost a part of your husband.
not_available Yeah, that woulda worked.
not_available Where are you going? I have some place I have to be.
not_available When I return, I hope to be greeted by a foot, a solution as to how to stop a billion dollar corporation from putting us out of business, and pruned hedges.
not_available Now, aren't you glad you got out of the house? Yes, this is just what I needed.
not_available We should try to get a seat right down front.
not_available I'm placing a bet.
not_available No, we should just try to enjoy the day.
not_available I don't see why we need to gamble.
not_available They're sweet.
not_available You both look so happy.
not_available It's an act.
not_available Just enjoy it while it lasts, which isn't very long.
not_available Excuse me? You think you have forever, but you don't.
not_available Soon you start to get on each other's nerves, then you don't tell the other person as much as you used to, because, really, what's the point? You thought they understood you, but they never did, not really.
not_available Ruth / Finally, not only do you not tell the other person anything real.
not_available You actively start lying to him.
not_available And then when you think it can't get any worse, he up and dies! I think I see a shorter line over there.
not_available Bye.
not_available No matter what you do, you end up alone, not knowing who you are, or what you really want.
not_available Ruth, Ruth, why did you come here today? To have fun.
not_available Aren't you having fun?!? I think it's wobbling.
not_available It's not wobbling.
not_available It just looks like it's wobbling, because you've been staring at it for so long.
not_available No, it's definitely wobbling.
not_available You're hallucinating.
not_available Life is strange.
not_available Just one of those tiny screws isn't screwed on tight enough, that thing could fall and kill us instantaneously, just chop us to bits like a cuisinart.
not_available Yeah, an assassin with a semi
not_available automatic could walk through the door and spray our brains all over the place.
not_available The sun could become a supernova and engulf the entire planet in flames.
not_available David Fisher.
not_available Yeah, we just got a call from Claire's school.
not_available She's in trouble.
not_available Can't Mom handle this? Nuh uh.
not_available She's MIA.
not_available And besides, I think you might be interested in what they told me.
not_available What?!? Start from the beginning.
not_available Jesus! OK, I'll be right there.
not_available Until then, tell Nate
not_available Oh, great, he's MIA, too? Alright, bye.
not_available There's a rumor going around school that my sister put a dismembered foot into some boy's locker.
not_available Shut the fuck up.
not_available She did it.
not_available I know she did.
not_available Where's the foot now? I don't know.
not_available The student who supposedly found it now denies that it ever happened.
not_available OK, where's your sister? No one knows.
not_available A police report has been filed, and now Mom is supposed to meet with the principal at 9 tomorrow.
not_available I don't understand kids.
not_available When I was her age, I never would have taken a foot.
not_available David, I can help.
not_available I'm a cop.
not_available That's what I do for a living.
not_available You find feet?!? What the fuck am I gonna do? Tell me who lived here again.
not_available The Fritzens.
not_available I totally fucked things up.
not_available I kept us from selling, and now we're gonna go under, and it's all because of me.
not_available I'm a fucking moron.
not_available You used to hang out over here? Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play here after school.
not_available Both her parents worked.
not_available Brenda, this is serious.
not_available My entire family could go bankrupt.
not_available So, swallow your pride, go back to the corporation, and sell.
not_available They cut their offer in half now that they know we're so quick to buckle under.
not_available Plus, I really don't wanna let that greedy little Nazi win.
not_available Oh, so this is a pissing contest.
not_available Nate, I'm gonna get you! I lost someone's foot today.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I really thought I had like this profound revelation.
not_available Fuck, if this isn't what I'm supposed to be doing with my life, then what is? Living it.
not_available And you're doing that so relaxed.
not_available You really don't give a fuck what I'm going through, do you? Sure.
not_available As much as I can, given we've known each other less than a month.
not_available There's no big investment.
not_available I mean that's part of the appeal for both of us.
not_available Right? Right? Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me in this room.
not_available I wouldn't let her.
not_available You can't control things.
not_available Nobody can.
not_available / Shut up.
not_available There's only one thing that's 
certain Everything changes.
not_available / Shut up.
not_available I already talked to the other cops.
not_available I mean, I don't understand why I have to go through this again.
not_available Because this time, I want the truth.
not_available Man
not_available / Now, a witness already said she saw you running down the hall screaming the crazy funeral home girl put a foot in your locker.
not_available It was a joke.
not_available OK? It was just a joke.
not_available She's just this girl who's kind of a loser, and we all pick on her, you know? She totally asked for it.
not_available You know, modern technology's really something.
not_available I don't care, man.
not_available You should.
not_available We now have chemicals we can put on our hands to tell if you've touched human remains.
not_available No way.
not_available You wanna tell me what really happened today? Who's that? That's my partner.
not_available You'd better be glad you don't have to mess with him.
not_available That guy's into some crazy ass shit.
not_available Now, either you can tell me where you put the foot, or you're gonna be dealing with that crazy ass motherfucker.
not_available We won! Oh God, I just can't believe it! I won $6! I told you this would be fun.
not_available How much did you win? I don't know.
not_available Dollars.
not_available Oooh, and by the way, I had an affair with a hairdresser last year.
not_available You did?!? Yup.
not_available Are you a cup? How many cups are you? I'm a loaf of bread.
not_available Hello? OK.
not_available Talk slowly.
not_available When can I see you? I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do I'm gonna see you in a few hours.
not_available Fuck Slow down Slower Well, you're gonna have to wait Because you have to.
not_available Brenda? What am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go? Just stay there.
not_available I'll call you in half an hour.
not_available Promise? / I promise.
not_available Who was that? Nothing to worry about.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available Brenda, who was it? Just someone else, OK? Just back off.
not_available I
not_available I can't deal with this right now.
not_available I'll call you.
not_available I'm glad you staying in here.
not_available He threw it out of his car?!? He was taking it to show some friends.
not_available And it hit him.
not_available Might get it trouble, what with people not really supposed to be in possession of other peoples' feet.
not_available He tossed it out.
not_available I've gotta get home.
not_available Just drop me off, and I'll pick up my car later.
not_available Alright, I'll take a look where he said he tossed it.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available Hey, how can I sleep, huh? Knowing that there's a foot on the loose? You lost $25,000 that's just gone?!? I suppose it still exists.
not_available It's just not mine anymore.
not_available I'm waiting for an explanation.
not_available Don't talk to me like a child.
not_available I was on awhat do you call it?
not_available a roll, so I kept betting more and more, and I just felt so good, like I was living someone else's life.
not_available I was up $9000, and then I started to lose, and then I started to feel like me again, and so I kept betting more and more and more and losing more and more.
not_available You should have been more careful.
not_available I don't wanna be careful.
not_available I wanna feel alive.
not_available There should be a way to do that that's a little less expensive.
not_available I have a right to make mistakes, Nate.
not_available You, of all people, shouldn't begrudge me that.
not_available What? I lost $25,000, alright? OK? You got it out of me.
not_available Now leave me alone! Hey.
not_available Claire? You're David's friend.
not_available Keith.
not_available What's going on? Not much.
not_available So where is Claire now? Well, I've gotta say, I'm totally relieved.
not_available That I didn't lose it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Nice job, Rico.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Boy, they did do a marvelous job.
not_available They ought to.
not_available They charged a fortune.
not_available Can I assist you, Miss Romano? Yeah, I know it's silly, but I just want to see with my own eyes that Pop's put together right.
not_available We get to do that, don't we? Good.
not_available I think I'll be able to sleep much better now.
not_available Rico, you gave him a foot? Yeah, yeah.
not_available I thought it was for the best.
not_available Remember thatremember that leg of lamb that your mother had in the back of her freezer like forever? OK, stop
not_available / Enbalmed.
not_available Wrapped with latex and duct tape.
not_available Well, I was following him home to get it back when I saw him toss it.
not_available Now I've been here four hours and I can't find it.
not_available Describe it to me again.
not_available It's a foot.
not_available Why did you take it in the first place? Well, at the time, it seemed like a good way to pay him back for something.
not_available I just wanted to shake him up.
not_available I don't understand how guys can be so unshakable.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available Did you ever suck a guy's toe? Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available Have you been watching Mrs.
not_available Romano? Yeah.
not_available Been watching her all night.
not_available You thinking what I'm thinking? Casket climber.
not_available Her? She doesn't look that energetic.
not_available Yeah, well they're the ones that really go for it.
not_available So we should probably have a conversation with Rico about what's going on with Kronauer.
not_available OK.
not_available So there was no baby christening the other day.
not_available I lied.
not_available I only took one meeting with Gilardi.
not_available You met with him? Why? Hey, Gilardi called me, OK? I had the right to consider my options.
not_available My father put you through mortuary school.
not_available I wanna go with you! / Mrs.
not_available Romano, I wanna go with you! / whoa, whoa, Mrs.
not_available Romano.
not_available Come on, it's OK.
not_available / Mommy 
not_available Here we go, Mrs.
not_available Romano.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available I give up.
not_available It's not here.
not_available This probably isn't over.
not_available There's a lesson to be learned that 
not_available your actions have consequences.
not_available Oh, yeah, well Gabe should learn that.
not_available I know you and my brother are like gay.
not_available OK.
not_available What do you see in him? He's just David, ya know? I know.
not_available That's why I'm asking.
not_available He is smart.
not_available He's kind.
not_available He's funny.
not_available I know he can be a little uptight, but underneath that, he's such a little boy.
not_available Innocent.
not_available And I like that.
not_available Most of the men I meet, well they kind of just want me to be one thing.
not_available Like what? Big black sex cop? Sorry, I was speeding, officer.
not_available Guess you have to punish me now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I don't wanna be that.
not_available Rent a video! David, he gets me.
not_available When someone sees you as you really are and wants to be with you, that's powerful.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I wish I could know the David you know.
not_available You could be a little nicer to him.
not_available He's under a lot of stress with that cremation place opening across the street.
not_available What cremation place? She stole a foot? From a person? Yes, would it have been better if it was an animal's? A little bit.
not_available You wake up one day, and your baby's stolen a foot.
not_available Where have I been? Losing $25,000.
not_available Hey
not_available OK, I've had a long day.
not_available Oh, David, I ran into your friend, Keith.
not_available Who's Keith? You met at Dad's thing.
not_available I never met a Keith.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available The cop.
not_available I asked him to help out.
not_available He says he's gonna see what he can do about there not being an official report.
not_available Why does this person have to be so involved in our life? Claire, we should probably talk about getting you some help.
not_available You're not my father.
not_available If you need a project, get a dog.
not_available Keith says the school's probably gonna make me see a shrink, anyway.
not_available Oh, dear! By the way, that house across the street is on fire.
not_available I guess this should solve all your problems, huh? Freckles! Freckles! Here, girl! Freckles!
