
not_available Trash.
not_available As in trailer trash.
not_available They're 20 minutes late with my Vioxx again.
not_available I'm in such pain.
not_available I'm in such agony.
not_available I wish the Good Lord would take me soon.
not_available How are things at home with you and Rico? He still acting crazy? I don't know, but he definitely has a bug up his ass.
not_available Mid
not_available life crisis.
not_available He's too young for that.
not_available Honey, men start having their mid
not_available life crisis in their early 20s and they keep on having them every three to five years after that.
not_available You're gonna have to eat more than this, Mrs.
not_available Kippleman.
not_available Shit! 
not_available Now what? Vanessa, she's got no pulse.
not_available Shit! She's a full code? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on, Edith, come on.
not_available A world
not_available class complainer like you isn't gonna give up that easy.
not_available How about these? 
not_available The green pants.
not_available Actually, these are olive.
not_available I can get myself dressed, you know.
not_available I'm just trying to help.
not_available Did I ask for your help? 
not_available No.
not_available Then what the hell are you doing in my room? Hey, you don't talk to David that way.
not_available You'd better start showing some respect around here.
not_available Or what, you're gonna put me in jail? 
not_available What did you say? Let her go.
not_available We've got to start setting some serious boundaries with her.
not_available Look at all the shit she's had to deal with.
not_available Not to mention the past couple of months.
not_available She's 9.
not_available I know how old she is.
not_available I'm just saying Do you want to pick a fight with me? No, do you want to pick a fight with a 9year
not_available old about her attitude? This morning I do.
not_available Too fucking bad.
not_available I know you're nervous about your old man coming but I don't have to let you take it out on Taylor.
not_available Or me.
not_available It's 9:30.
not_available So? Let me sleep late.
not_available It's the last enjoyment I'll know before I become a cog in the wheel making mocha lattes for the people who have a life.
not_available Don't you think that's a little dramatic? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Can I make you something to eat? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available You never eat a decent breakfast anymore.
not_available This is a glass of orange juice.
not_available This is an apple.
not_available That's two of my daily servings of fruit recommended by the USDA.
not_available Claire, are you depressed? I'm not even gonna answer that question.
not_available Whatever you're going through, I hope you don't blame me.
not_available I was just calling you.
not_available What, you can be late all you want but I'm not allowed to be? 
not_available Calm down.
not_available Why? I'm pissed off! I get pissed off sometimes.
not_available I have a right to express it.
not_available Express it to somebody else, because I've got to run.
not_available Brenda and I have a meeting with Rabbi Ari.
not_available You're thinking of converting? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available What? I'm already circumcised.
not_available Anything I need to be aware of here? 
not_available I did a pickup this morning at Bay Breeze another referral from Vanessa.
not_available Great, another chance for Rico to act like we owe our entire livelihood to him.
not_available Hello! Mr.
not_available Fisher? Dave, you've got to lighten up, man.
not_available Can I help you? Are you Nathaniel Fisher? 
not_available No, he's deceased.
not_available Wait a minute, that's me.
not_available I'm Nathaniel Fisher, Jr.
not_available Consider yourself served.
not_available Shit.
not_available Who was that? You remember Mrs.
not_available Collins? The waitress who got locked in the walk
not_available in overnight? No, the wife of the guy who fell off the boat, got sliced up by the propeller.
not_available Yeah, the bargain hunter.
not_available She wanted to see the body.
not_available You didn't.
not_available She made me.
not_available Now she's suing us for emotional distress to the tune of $500,000.
not_available Fuck! There's an ashtray over there somewhere.
not_available You should really clean this car out sometime, you know.
not_available What the fuck is this? It's some creepy thing my Aunt Sarah sent me for my birthday.
not_available I don't know what happened.
not_available Usually she has pretty good taste.
not_available It's filled with some nasty Chinese holistic herb shit.
not_available Newsflash! These aren't Chinese herbs.
not_available They're not? 
not_available These are shrooms.
not_available My aunt sent me mushrooms? Whatever you thought you were doing tomorrow, plan on blowing it off.
not_available What's wrong with today? 
not_available I have a date with Mr.
not_available Schussler.
not_available Mr.
not_available Schussler the vocational arts teacher? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And you can't fuck for shit when you're on shrooms.
not_available Marriage is a profound experience that can deeply enrich your life and even bring you closer to God.
not_available But our culture has many misconceptions about it.
not_available Like marriage will cure Ioneliness or that most of our satisfactions in life should come from our partner.
not_available Or that good sex means good marriage.
not_available And the truth is that marriage is different for different people.
not_available So in this and our next five sessions we'll talk about what marriage means to you.
not_available I'm curious.
not_available Have you ever been married? 
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available But I have counseled many couples in my congregation both before, during, and after marriage.
not_available One thing I can say without hesitation is you can't have a good marriage without honesty.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That kind of goes without saying, doesn't it? Are you completely honest with each other? You don't have to answer that right now.
not_available It's just something to think about for next week.
not_available Would you like some cucumber salad? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available I made more than enough.
not_available I reading paper.
not_available Fine.
not_available Take it, go ahead, take it.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Like Terminator, no? What is he? Did he threaten you? Mind your own business, woman! Can I just say that I think total honesty is not always the best thing? What about privacy? What about trying to maintain the mystery of a relationship? Sometimes truth is irrelevant.
not_available Brenda, I did something stupid.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available The trip to Seattle, my friend Lisa? I slept with her.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available I don't even know how to respond to something like this.
not_available What do you feel? I don't know what I feel.
not_available I don't feel anything.
not_available I feel numb.
not_available When were you planning on telling me? 
not_available I'm telling you now.
not_available What do you expect me to do with this information? Christ, Nate! This whole wedding thing scares the shit out of me but I've been trying to make myself believe that we could actually Almost done.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available How bad is it? Your brother showed her the body? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It was in pretty bad shape, huh? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I think she's got a pretty airtight case.
not_available I think that you guys are more or less fucked.
not_available She made him show her the body.
not_available I can certainly argue that point, but, David, she was under duress and this woman is going to describe in great detail exactly what she saw when she's up on the stand.
not_available On top of that, she's hired herself an aggressive law firm that nobody likes to mess with, so I think that we should try to settle.
not_available How much money do you guys have? 
not_available I'm sorry I was late.
not_available Where were you? With Brenda.
not_available We were in the middle of something pretty intense.
not_available Do you know how much trouble we are in because of this lawsuit? I have things I've got to deal with.
not_available I have a life, too.
not_available I have a kid now.
not_available At least I try to keep it separate from the business that you seem so hell
not_available bent on flushing down the fucking toilet! We are fucked, Nate! And you fucked us.
not_available I'm afraid my daughter's suffering from depression and I don't know what to do.
not_available Most teenagers suffer from mild depression at one time or another.
not_available Is that true? 
not_available True enough.
not_available But I'm pretty familiar with clinical depression 
not_available and I don't see Claire suffering from that.
not_available You don't? Look, she's the kind of person that needs her life to be meaningful.
not_available I'm sure you know this better than I do.
not_available No, I don't feel as though I do.
not_available And by the way, who doesn't need their life to be meaningful? You'd be surprised.
not_available She has no idea how easy she's had it! Do you want to know what you can do to be more supportive of Claire? Of course.
not_available That's why I'm here, I think.
not_available This is a brochure for LAC
not_available Arts.
not_available I think Claire should think about going there.
not_available It's a great school for someone with her creativity.
not_available You really don't think she's depressed? 
not_available I don't.
not_available But can I speak candidly? 
not_available Please.
not_available I think it's possible that you might be.
not_available It's me.
not_available I'm leaving another goddamn message on your voice mail.
not_available Listen, I really need to talk.
not_available Billy, God damn it, I need you.
not_available I really need you.
not_available God damn it, where the fuck are you? Mr.
not_available Charles, hey! It's good to see you again.
not_available You met me when Keith brought me down to San Diego last 
not_available It's been over a year ago.
not_available I know who you are.
not_available Hey, Lucille.
not_available I'm sorry I'm so late.
not_available I guess I missed dinner, huh? 
not_available I left you a plate in the microwave.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, you're home.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry I'm so late.
not_available Did you get my Where's Taylor? 
not_available Brushing her teeth.
not_available Did she floss first? 
not_available Yes, I watched her.
not_available Listen, I put fresh linens on.
not_available Extra blankets in the hall closet.
not_available Keith, your mother and I want to have a word with you.
not_available Can't it wait until morning? 
not_available No, I don't think it can.
not_available I can leave the room if you'd like.
not_available I don't care if you're here for this or not.
not_available Keith, we'd like to take Taylor home with us when we go back to San Diego.
not_available What, for a visit? 
not_available No, to live.
not_available Why? 
not_available This isn't any of your concern, sir.
not_available I'm sorry, but I think it is.
not_available No, David, let's hear him out.
not_available For one, we have a yard big enough for her to play in.
not_available We'll be able to spend more time with her.
not_available And we'll be able to offer her more stability.
not_available It's what's best for the child, and you know it.
not_available Fine.
not_available Ari, hi.
not_available I'm sorry to just drop in like this so late, but I was in the neighborhood.
not_available Well, nearby, speaking to somebody who's interested in arranging a funeral.
not_available His own, actually.
not_available What do you call that? A pre
not_available need.
not_available Right.
not_available So I was wondering if you would be willing to help him? Yeah, sure.
not_available Just give me his name and number.
not_available I'll call him first thing tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm great.
not_available Okay, that's bullshit.
not_available I'm coming in, and you're gonna offer me something to drink.
not_available That is a lot for her to absorb.
not_available She already knew about the AVM, but I just told her about the baby today.
not_available You said we'd never have a good marriage without honesty.
not_available I did say that, didn't I? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why do you think you have so much trouble being honest with Brenda? 
not_available I don't think it's particular to Brenda.
not_available With women, then.
not_available I don't have trouble being honest with you.
not_available I'm a rabbi, Nate.
not_available You don't look like a rabbi.
not_available I am a rabbi.
not_available Unavailable to you, not even in your wildest dreams.
not_available That's why you don't have trouble being honest with me.
not_available There's nothing at stake.
not_available How do you feel about becoming a father? I don't know how I feel about it.
not_available I certainly never imagined it would happen like this.
not_available All of our actions have consequences.
not_available We may not even be aware of them, but they exist nevertheless.
not_available You should consider it a blessing.
not_available What if you had never known? Sorry.
not_available Just give her some time, Nate.
not_available Time.
not_available Right.
not_available We got another one from Bay Breeze! That's the fourth one this year.
not_available Yes, I'm aware of how many referrals your wife sends our way.
not_available Just making sure you know where the business is coming from.
not_available Something funny about this one, David.
not_available Funny how? The certificate says the cause of death was congestive heart failure.
not_available So? Old people have their heart quit on them all the time.
not_available Yeah, but she's got these contusions around her neck.
not_available Old people bruise easily.
not_available Those probably happened while they were trying to resuscitate her.
not_available Maybe.
not_available What the fuck? A hot dog? You tell me.
not_available I don't think something this big just happened to go down the wrong way.
not_available Is it okay if Parker spends the night at our house tonight? Of course.
not_available Would you like me to pick you up a frozen pizza and some videos? No, I think we're good.
not_available Are you doing something with Nikolai tonight? I think he's losing interest in me.
not_available He's been spending a lot of time alone lately.
not_available He was living here with plastic casts on both legs and peeing in a bedpan for, what, six weeks? What's that supposed to mean? Just give him some space.
not_available Guys need a lot of space.
not_available He doesn't know how to take care of himself and he needs my help! If you say so.
not_available I'm a little confused about this term "pre
not_available need." It's a payment structure that allows you to Make the purchase before you need it.
not_available I get that.
not_available I may be dying.
not_available I'm not an idiot.
not_available My question is with the choice of the word "need." I mean, who really needs a funeral anyway? If you're dead you don't need shit.
not_available Yes, the funeral is really for the people you leave behind to help them come to terms What if you're not leaving anybody behind? What if your whole fucking life has been one big waste of time for everybody including yourself? 
not_available You don't know that.
not_available I'm all for thinning out the human race.
not_available There are just too many fucking people.
not_available Anthrax, smallpox.
not_available I say bring it on.
not_available You'd probably like that, huh? Good for business.
not_available Maybe I should just leave this information with you and I'll come back later.
not_available Sorry if I'm being antisocial.
not_available Sit down.
not_available The good rabbi went through all the trouble of setting this up.
not_available Besides, I may not be here tomorrow.
not_available You mind if I ask What I have? 
not_available Pancreatic cancer.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's one of the worst ones you can get.
not_available I did not know that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I should be dead already.
not_available So this is just gravy time.
not_available It's extra frosting on the cake.
not_available Most people last up to maybe six months, tops.
not_available Me, I've been hanging in here for over a year.
not_available Can you fucking believe it? I'll bet you never met anybody half as lucky as I am.
not_available And you pulled this relatively intact out of the deceased's airway? That's correct.
not_available What made you decide to look in her throat? I would have gone in there anyway to swab her out before I started embalming her.
not_available But I had my suspicions.
not_available What made you suspicious? The contusions around her neck.
not_available These contusions could've been made when they tried to resuscitate her.
not_available They could have.
not_available If they tried to resuscitate, why didn't they find the frankfurter stuck in her airway? It was stuck pretty far down.
not_available Some of these nursing homes aren't exactly up to speed on their CPR training.
not_available She was brought over from the Bay Breeze Nursing Home? That's correct.
not_available And who tried to resuscitate her? Wait a minute.
not_available I think I got that.
not_available Dolores Willitts and Vanessa Dial Diaz.
not_available Vanessa Diaz.
not_available She is my wife.
not_available Where is Nikolai? 
not_available He's out on a delivery.
not_available Tell him I stopped by, and I come back later.
not_available How much money does Nikolai owe you? Excuse me? How much money does Nikolai owe you? Who are you? 
not_available I'm his friend.
not_available His lady friend? 
not_available That's right.
not_available It is none of your concern.
not_available Tell me how much he owes you, and I'll pay you the money.
not_available You will pay me the money? 
not_available Tell me how much it is.
not_available $87,000.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available I had no idea it was that much.
not_available You don't have that kind of money, do you? As a matter of fact, I do.
not_available You would do this for Nikolai? 
not_available Please, I'm trying to count.
not_available Nikolai's a lucky man.
not_available What is your name? Ruth Fisher.
not_available I would've taken a check, Ruth Fisher.
not_available Who's this pretty little girl who wants to join the party? Isn't it way past your bedtime, honey? Brenda, honey.
not_available Mommy and Daddy have company, and you need to go back up to bed now.
not_available Margaret, you're stigmatizing the situation for her.
not_available No, I'm not, Bern.
not_available Keith, you cannot let them take my baby.
not_available Karla, they're only as far away as San Diego.
not_available I think it's for the best.
not_available There ain't no fucking way it's for the best.
not_available Are you crazy? Daddy didn't even need an excuse to smack the shit out of me or you 
not_available and look what that did to us.
not_available Look what that did to you.
not_available I don't want Taylor growing up with that shit.
not_available But you don't mind her growing up with a mother who's a drug addict? I might be a drug addict, but I never hurt my child.
not_available That's the way people raised their kids back then.
not_available I'm tired of you blaming everything gone wrong in your life on Dad.
not_available Please.
not_available You know how the slightest little thing would set him off.
not_available I think he's changed.
not_available People can change.
not_available People don't change.
not_available They just get older, that's all.
not_available David Fisher, how the hell are you? 
not_available Jesus! Certainly not in any mood to deal with the likes of you.
not_available Honey, you could stand to work on those manners.
not_available Hi, Nate.
not_available I understand you boys are being sued.
not_available So what, you've come here to gloat? I just wanted you to know we are paying poor Mrs.
not_available Collins' legal fees.
not_available And, honey, we've got awfully deep pockets.
not_available Y'all, this thing is gonna go on forever.
not_available In the end it's gonna drag you boys down, I can guarantee you that.
not_available Now, we are still willing to buy this little momand
not_available pop shop of yours at a drastically reduced price, I'm afraid.
not_available But I think that if you're smart, and I'm betting you are you'll go on and get out while the getting's still halfway good.
not_available I'm curious, Mitzi.
not_available What do you get out of this? I like to win, honey.
not_available It's the way I was brought up.
not_available I hope you don't expect me to apologize for it, because I'm not gonna do it.
not_available I don't expect anything from you.
not_available But I wonder, at the day's end, when you're alone staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror do you really like who you see looking back at you? I love what I see.
not_available See, I just don't buy that.
not_available Because if you did you wouldn't be doing this.
not_available You know, it's a crying shame that someone as cute as you has to be such a goddamn doomand
not_available gloomer.
not_available You boys think it over and let me know what you decide.
not_available Personally, I think it's a no
not_available brainer but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.
not_available But I don't have the money.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Of course you have the money.
not_available I don't.
not_available It's all gone.
not_available Where did it go? 
not_available That's none of your business.
not_available Mom, we need that money in order to offer Mrs.
not_available Collins some kind of settlement or we're seriously screwed.
not_available The only time you tell me what's going on in your lives is when you need money.
not_available If you'd told me about this before, the money would've been there.
not_available It's gone.
not_available You guys, this is my friend Parker.
not_available Hi.
not_available We're just gonna be upstairs.
not_available Bye.
not_available I give up.
not_available That was weird.
not_available That was totally weird.
not_available Are they always like that? Always.
not_available My God! Your room is so beautiful.
not_available We should do something.
not_available What do you want to do? I don't know.
not_available What do you want to do? What do you feel like doing? 
not_available I feel like throwing up.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Is it normal? 
not_available Totally.
not_available These shrooms are fucking kick
not_available ass.
not_available Holy shit, you have a sewing machine? Yeah, I found it in the attic.
not_available It belonged to my dad's mom.
not_available Let's make something.
not_available Do you know how to use it? Yeah.
not_available My God, it's so fucking cool.
not_available People used to have to make their own clothes all the time! People used to have to make their own soap.
not_available Can you believe that? People used to have to kill their own cows and stuff.
not_available I really wish we could've been alive back then.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Hi, it's me.
not_available I'm not here, so talk to the machine.
not_available Thank you for seeing me, Mrs.
not_available Collins.
not_available I just want to apologize for the unfortunate incident that brings us to this unpleasant juncture.
not_available My brother is new to this business.
not_available He didn't know what he was doing when he showed you your husband's remains.
not_available That's not my problem, is it? No, of course not.
not_available You were vulnerable when you asked him to do this and he shouldn't have.
not_available But, nevertheless, you did ask him.
not_available What's your point? What's my point? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you even have one? You know it's not my fault or my brother's that you allowed your husband to smack you around all those years.
not_available That's your problem.
not_available You've no right to talk about my marriage.
not_available You chose to be a doormat, or a punching bag or whatever metaphor for victimhood you're comfortable with.
not_available You stayed in an abusive marriage and wasted God knows how many years of your life.
not_available Years you'll never get back.
not_available And that makes you furious, doesn't it? You've probably spent your entire miserable life blaming other people for all the mistakes you've made.
not_available Now you want us to pay for that? Jesus, lady, just how fucking low are you willing to sink? This lawsuit of yours is gonna cost my family our business! That's my point! There.
not_available Are you happy? Now get out.
not_available Get the fuck out of my house! Can you spare a joint? I love halter
not_available tops.
not_available Are you looking at my tits? I'm talking to you.
not_available Yeah, you.
not_available Are you looking at my tits? My God, I wish I could've lived during the Renaissance.
not_available Those are so fucking beautiful.
not_available I love those pants.
not_available So when you walk it makes music, right? See, if we live our lives the right way then every single thing we do becomes a work of art even the pants we wear 
not_available or just the way we make our bed.
not_available Wow.
not_available That's the whole fucking problem with the world right now.
not_available It's that we don't try to be creative with every single thing we do.
not_available Martha Stewart does.
not_available I thought you might be getting hungry, so I made you girls some sandwiches.
not_available We are so not hungry.
not_available We'll eat them later.
not_available All right, then.
not_available I'll come back later to get the tray.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Yes, dear.
not_available Here, I made these pants for you.
not_available Thank you, Claire.
not_available These are lovely.
not_available I love you, Mom.
not_available I never tell you how much, because I'm afraid to for some reason but right now I want you to know I love you.
not_available I think you're so beautiful.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available You don't know my dad, David.
not_available He's like a pit bull when he gets his jaw locked on something.
not_available Believe me.
not_available What happened to the Keith who fights for something he believes in? For something we both believe in? 
not_available This isn't that simple.
not_available Are you taking his side 'cause looking after Taylor is too big a commitment? No, I'm taking his side because, for once, I think he's right.
not_available You know what I think? I think you're not sure that two gay men should raise a child.
not_available That's your shit.
not_available Then why aren't we fighting for her? Because they have more time to spend with her.
not_available Please.
not_available Your father plays golf all day and your mom plays with her for halfan
not_available hour, tops, then pops in a video and gets on the phone.
not_available I am not ambivalent about wanting kids.
not_available Then you're ambivalent about wanting kids with me? Of course not.
not_available I just want to be ready.
not_available Life doesn't work that way.
not_available It just dumps things in your lap and then you try to make the best of it.
not_available I'm tired of talking about this.
not_available You know what this is really about? You're afraid of him.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available As much as I hate you treating me like a doormat it's even worse seeing your father treat you like one.
not_available You think I treat you like a doormat? 
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Why don't you stand up to him? I don't think I treat you like a doormat.
not_available Sometimes you do.
not_available Go to sleep.
not_available We both have to get up early.
not_available Okay, you guys need to go now.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Can I have your number? Why? So we can date? Late.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available Hey.
not_available How did it go with the police? How do you think it went? They kept us there all night.
not_available They didn't even talk to us until about an hour ago.
not_available At least they didn't arrest you.
not_available Do you think I could shove a hot dog down some old lady's throat? No, of course not.
not_available But you could have noticed it was there.
