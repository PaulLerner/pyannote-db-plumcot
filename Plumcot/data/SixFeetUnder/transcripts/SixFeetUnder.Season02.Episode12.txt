
not_available Very beautiful.
not_available The coronation time.
not_available Encyclopedia Brown, are you snooping? 
not_available No, it was open.
not_available "Fuck me harder, surfer boy, with your fat little crooked cock "and your pleasetellmeyou'renotserious shaved balls." 
not_available This is pretty out there, Bren.
not_available Not really.
not_available Have you had sex with two men at the same time? You ever had sex with two women? And once again, you refuse to answer my question.
not_available Have you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How was it? Which time? "He puts on his yin
not_available yang baseball cap and asks for her number.
not_available "'Why? ' she says.
not_available 'So we can date?"' Well, she has a point.
not_available "On his way out, he says, 'Late,' in that stupid surfer way.
not_available "She feels sad for about half a second "then the familiar relief when she hears the door shut.
not_available "Why does it always feel so good when they leave?" What? I love it.
not_available I think it's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's just really weird hearing it out loud.
not_available I don't care if you love it.
not_available I didn't write it for you.
not_available You know what I think? You're angry with me about sleeping with Lisa.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe you're getting back at me by writing about you being with someone else.
not_available Nate, it's not that simple.
not_available I started writing this long before I found out about you and Lisa.
not_available So tell me.
not_available What else is in that computer? Or this computer.
not_available Taylor, someone very important is coming over tomorrow.
not_available A very important friend.
not_available And we need you to be on your best behavior.
not_available You mean a social worker? I've had them before.
not_available Miss Pastorelli and Mr.
not_available Shipley.
not_available He smelled like Fritos and coughed a lot.
not_available Me and my mom, we used to call him "Mr.
not_available Shitfor
not_available Brains." I am sick and tired of your mouth, all right? When you speak like that, you're not showing any respect for yourself.
not_available There are people in this world who'll not respect you, without you adding to it.
not_available You know what I'm talking about? You're gonna be late for school.
not_available Go brush your teeth so we can leave.
not_available Keith, I don't think 
not_available I don't want to hear it.
not_available Because I'm white, I couldn't possibly understand? Because you'll start spouting that child psychology bullshit you've been reading.
not_available It's not bullshit.
not_available It's called the "whole
not_available child theory" and it's only the collective thoughts of some of the greatest educators around, okay? Letting her know that we love her for who she is builds trust.
not_available Constantly scolding her for behavior we don't like, doesn't.
not_available I don't know how we'll raise a child.
not_available We just are, okay? The board still hasn't cleared me on the shooting.
not_available We're going to get the guardianship, and we're going to be good parents.
not_available Taylor, how long is it going to take you to brush your teeth? I would like to go on record as saying I am in full support of you going to art school.
not_available Consider it recorded.
not_available But I'm just taking a tour.
not_available Let's not get our panties in a wad over it.
not_available That's such an unpleasant expression.
not_available I never got to go to college.
not_available Did you even want to? 
not_available I did.
not_available I wanted to study French feminist writers.
not_available You're a feminist, Mom? Feminism means being accepted for who you are.
not_available I wanted to be a wife and a mother.
not_available I never gave anything up to be a mother or a wife.
not_available It was what I wanted.
not_available I thought you said you gave up college.
not_available Why is every conversation with you a trap? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Be a feminist.
not_available We can both be feminists.
not_available Check it out, Cindy Sherman went here.
not_available And Billy Chenowith? I never knew that.
not_available Brenda's brother? The one in the mental institution? 
not_available He's out.
not_available Is he cured? 
not_available Who knows? God, I hate my hair.
not_available When I go to college, I'm gonna cut it all off, like Felicity.
not_available Have I met her? Yeah, she was here for dinner once.
not_available Federico? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, David.
not_available You know her? Abuelita.
not_available It means "grandma." 
not_available Federico, I'm so sorry.
not_available No, she's not really my grandma.
not_available She's sort of adopted.
not_available She lived by herself, right across the street from me and Vanessa, before we moved.
not_available I used to clean the leaves out of her gutters and bring her trashcans back up the driveway.
not_available I mean, nothing big, just when I was doing mine.
not_available We used to invite her to all the kids' birthday parties.
not_available She used to sit in this folding chair just happy to be there, with a big smile on her face.
not_available That's sweet.
not_available Is that the preneed she and I did together? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is this a new rule? Wear pajamas to work? Sorry.
not_available I live at Keith's now.
not_available I don't know where half my stuff is.
not_available What? She wants the Our Lady of Guadalupe casket.
not_available I love that one.
not_available Listen, we heard back from the Useof
not_available Force Review Board about your shooting.
not_available I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this but you're being brought up on charges.
not_available Turns out all the perp had was a toy pistol.
not_available There's evidence to suggest that if the perp hadn't died he might have invented a clean
not_available burning alternative to fossil fuels reducing our dependence on imported energy sources thus ending the conflict in the Middle East and deflecting the horror of the impending world war.
not_available It's good.
not_available They decided it was a good shooting.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Well, the board ruled.
not_available I'm off the hook.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Love you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Claire Fisher? How'd you know? 
not_available You don't look like a Mujadeep Siddiqui.
not_available I'm Henry.
not_available I'll be your cruise director.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Let's go.
not_available So let me guess.
not_available You were, like, the one total weirdo outcast at your high school.
not_available Not the only one.
not_available But definitely one of the top ten.
not_available I think that's what all of us are.
not_available I think every last freak of every last California high school winds up here.
not_available We're kind of the Island of Misfit Toys of colleges.
not_available Can anyone take welding? 
not_available You have to.
not_available It's a requirement.
not_available How cool that welding is a requirement, not fucking calculus.
not_available Nobody'll be looking at my math grades to get in here.
not_available Even though you don't need the grades you gotta make sure you rock the application thing.
not_available Yeah, definitely.
not_available No, seriously.
not_available A lot of people want to go to school here, so it's not like a sleepwalk to get in.
not_available Your essay, your portfolio, all that stuff counts.
not_available Letters of recommendation.
not_available Who do you know? 
not_available Nobody.
not_available I sort of know Billy Chenowith.
not_available He's okay.
not_available I think everything he does Gregory Crewdson did better, except years ago.
not_available But the alumni thing should work in your favor.
not_available This one's called "The Jesus Balls." 
not_available First year student.
not_available No, that's fine.
not_available We don't have to go out tonight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Although we did decide that we would get together every other night.
not_available But this is actually better, because now we can go out Saturday then Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week.
not_available Wait.
not_available Then we can't be together next Saturday.
not_available So, truth be told, every other day isn't a workable plan.
not_available I think we should decide on a number of days of a week.
not_available Say, three days a week or four days a week.
not_available Three days a week.
not_available Right.
not_available Or four days a week.
not_available And then choose those four days always making sure we include Saturdays because who wants to stay alone on a Saturday, right? Whatever you decide.
not_available Nikolai, don't let me talk you into something you don't want to do.
not_available No.
not_available Is fine.
not_available Good, let me go look at a calendar.
not_available So, tell me everything.
not_available What does the human Frymaster look like? The crematory? It's a big steel thing in a big room.
not_available How does it work exactly? The container is placed on these chrome rollers.
not_available Then a small door raises and the body goes through.
not_available Like how your tray disappears through that thing in the cafeteria? Yeah.
not_available Actually, it's just like that.
not_available And then? And then, once the body is in there, there's a button that's pressed.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Even though the good rabbi said I shouldn't, just burn me up.
not_available Who pushes the button? 
not_available Whomever you specify.
not_available Buddhists have a family member.
not_available Some people choose no one in which case the person at the crematory does it.
not_available I'll take that guy.
not_available I guess I'll be on my own at that point, though.
not_available What about family members? Your parents? They just got to be total downers.
not_available I told them to stop coming.
not_available They'll find out I'm dead when the rest of the world does.
not_available Got any other friends? 
not_available Yeah, I had some.
not_available A lot of work, you know? A lot of people freak out when you get sick, and a bunch of people betrayed me.
not_available Some people just got too crazy to deal with.
not_available What about a girlfriend? 
not_available No.
not_available I mean, yeah, I had girlfriends.
not_available Relationships.
not_available But I'd be in something for whatever, like two months, two years and then it would just get too Nothing.
not_available Just "too." I'd start thinking, "I don't like this about her, and I don't like this about her." Then I'd start to feel this thing on the back of my neck like one of those SuperBalls, and it would throb with the word "Leave.
not_available Leave.
not_available Leave." And so I would.
not_available And the second I got my life back, the ball would disappear.
not_available I suffer from that American thing big time.
not_available You know, always looking around for someone better.
not_available Shopping.
not_available I think a lot of people go through that.
not_available No, they don't, man.
not_available Okay? They don't.
not_available Most people just pick someone.
not_available I never looked at someone and just said, "Okay, I'll take you." You can still connect with people.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available It's too late.
not_available Listen I'm gonna make a commitment to you.
not_available I am hereby committing to come and see you every day, without fail.
not_available You don't have to come and see me every day.
not_available No, I want to.
not_available Whatever.
not_available All right, until tomorrow, then.
not_available You want me to bring you anything? Magazines? No.
not_available May I help you? Are you the owner? 
not_available Yes, I'm David Fisher.
not_available Andrew Perez.
not_available I understand my mother's funeral is to be held here.
not_available Yes, of course.
not_available I'm so sorry for your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Could we go over the arrangements? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Let me just get my associate.
not_available He helped your mother with her pre
not_available need contract.
not_available Fine.
not_available I was a personal friend of your mother's.
not_available My family and I lived across the street from her for many, many years.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hello? Yeah, I just wanted to ask you I'm, say, about a 55
not_available minute drive from Mission Viejo.
not_available Where's that course you and Jim played last winter? Hold on.
not_available You got a pen? Yeah, got it.
not_available Yeah, thank you so much.
not_available It was her time.
not_available She lived a full life.
not_available Okay, you take care.
not_available I'm an orthopedic surgeon, and every May, we do a tournament.
not_available Your mother was very proud of you.
not_available She always said, "My Andresito's a surgeon." She was a wonderful woman and I'd like to give her a topofthe
not_available line funeral.
not_available I like this one.
not_available Is it real mahogany? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Your mother already chose a casket, sir.
not_available It's in her pre
not_available need.
not_available She liked this one.
not_available I'd like to give her something nicer.
not_available Yes, well, she liked this one.
not_available This looks like some kind of gangbanger, low rider, I don't know what.
not_available She chose this one because she was living on a fixed income.
not_available I have money, and I want to change it.
not_available She liked this one, and this is the one that she should have.
not_available I'm offering your business more money.
not_available Your associate has some kind of conflict of interest that I don't understand.
not_available I only want to give my mother the best.
not_available I appreciate your concern, Mr.
not_available Perez and I'd be happy to upgrade your mother's casket.
not_available But legally, we're required to fulfill her wishes.
not_available I don't know what kind of pieceof
not_available shit operation you're running here.
not_available I really don't.
not_available I'm trying to do something nice for my mother and you just won't get out of my fucking way.
not_available I'm going to go make a salad.
not_available If you weren't legally bound to follow Mrs.
not_available Perez's instructions, would you To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely sure we are legally bound.
not_available All right, that should be everything.
not_available Now, I will contact you as soon as I know if we'll be able to do a viewing, okay? No one should have to see him this way, not even my mother.
not_available My son is the one who saw everything happen.
not_available It was raining, and I had told my dad that it was too slippery on the roof 
not_available Of the house.
not_available My husband was fixing the roof himself.
not_available But he went up there anyway.
not_available You're gonna freak when you see him.
not_available I saw him.
not_available I'll be okay.
not_available I turned him over, and I looked at him.
not_available I know you're not supposed to touch them because it might be a back injury and all.
not_available And my mother started yelling not to touch him.
not_available I thought it might be a back injury.
not_available But I turned him over.
not_available You see, he fell face first into the pile of bricks on the side of the house so, I saw him.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What are you looking for? 
not_available Anything that seems too funny.
not_available Funny ha
not_available ha or funny gay? What about this? You think I should put this away? What is it? Esquire's Things A Man Should Know About Style.
not_available Please.
not_available A book about fashion has to be gay? Stop being such a bigot.
not_available Spy Kids, Shadow, Shadow 2 Here, Taylor.
not_available Put this away.
not_available The Wiz? You're kidding.
not_available It's a gay video.
not_available It's a kid's video.
not_available Diana Ross and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's a scarecrow.
not_available It's not like they'll not know that we're gay.
not_available We're two men living together.
not_available I don't want to seem too gay.
not_available Or like we're trying to make her gay.
not_available Right.
not_available Watching The Wiz will turn her into a lesbian.
not_available Don't be so naive.
not_available That's the way these people think.
not_available You ought to worry about it making her want to have plastic surgery.
not_available Y'all are crazy.
not_available Okay, now what about this? 
not_available Okay, that's pretty gay.
not_available So, thank you for hooking me up with LAC
not_available Arts.
not_available I finally went and visited.
not_available And actually, it was amazing.
not_available Not just the facilities, I mean, which were unbelievable.
not_available They had this whole giant, like, kiln wing.
not_available What wing? 
not_available Kiln.
not_available But there were these, I don't know, not cool people because they're not like the posers here but the people there 
not_available How large is the student body? I don't know.
not_available But I just did my whole application thing.
not_available And I just You just what? I want this.
not_available I really want to go there.
not_available Just let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
not_available Actually, I do need to get three letters of recommendation.
not_available I'll be happy to write you one.
not_available It just may take me a couple days.
not_available No, I mean, they have to be from, like, successful artists so I was wondering if maybe you knew anybody who No.
not_available I don't know those kind of people.
not_available Is it your birthday or something? Just going
not_available away gifts from some of the kids I've worked with over the past few years.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Cutbacks.
not_available Just one counselor is going to serve the district.
not_available Not me.
not_available Some other guy who's been in the system longer.
not_available I can't believe they 
not_available Wanna get rid of me? I think it was time to move on anyway.
not_available I'm sure we'll find each other at graduation, right? No, of course.
not_available Thanks for getting back to me.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, sorry, I don't know where that is.
not_available How do I get there? "Last thing at night before I fall 
asleep Love.
not_available "First thing after 
sunrise Love.
not_available "I was born searching for you.
not_available "And when I go into the darkness of my final goodbye "it will be with you, love." Well, what do you think? Shouldn't you and Dad be writing your vows together? No, we're going to surprise each other.
not_available He's at Esalen doing some rituals to cleanse his boy energy.
not_available I know he's going to be naughty and get Ram Dass to help him write his speech.
not_available I still don't understand why you have to have another commitment ceremony.
not_available Can't you just go to Hawaii? Leave the rest of us out of it? It's about understanding that we have a lot of work to do, but we need to do it together.
not_available Honey, do you know what a soul twin is? Soul mates aren't enough? I have to have a "soul twin" now? Great, more fucking propaganda.
not_available Brenda, soul twin only means that your father and I made an agreement in another world to meet again in this world and walk through it together.
not_available And so now, we have to stop walking alongside one another and turn and face each other, and move through the world face to face.
not_available But how will you see where you're going? You know, all this sarcasm only impedes your prana.
not_available What's with all the New Age shit? You and Dad dropping acid again? Not at all, darling.
not_available Something wonderful has happened.
not_available After a lifetime of being blocked, I've finally discovered my spirituality.
not_available Great.
not_available Someone who's completely not in touch with herself now has a whole new vocabulary to not be in touch with herself with.
not_available I don't know why you have to be so cynical.
not_available It's just fear.
not_available You and Nate have that thing, don't you? I call it "the magnet." Baby? Brenda, I want to give you a little piece of advice.
not_available If you don't have that feeling, get out.
not_available Now.
not_available Of course we have that.
not_available You think you're the only ones to have that? God, the ego.
not_available $149,000.
not_available A what? A hundred what? 
not_available $149,000.
not_available And she left it to us? 
not_available Yes, she did.
not_available Which I'm gathering is somewhat of a surprise to you? Yeah, somewhat.
not_available I love when this happens.
not_available It's the fun part of being a trust attorney.
not_available I have a couple of forms for you to sign before you can collect your inheritance.
not_available I'll be just a moment.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available $149,000, babe! That's like $150,000.
not_available Jeez, all I did was clean her gutters sometimes.
not_available And all I did was give you some pasteles to bring to her.
not_available Why would she leave all of this to us? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You know, you went and saw her.
not_available She counted on you more than you even thought.
not_available No.
not_available You, too.
not_available Okay? This money is for both of us.
not_available You're the one who made her the pasteles.
not_available If I only knew she'd leave us all this money I would have made her some alcapurrias or something.
not_available I read about a bike trip where you tour the countryside of Vietnam.
not_available It's in 2003.
not_available In 2003, how you know where we're going to be? How you know this? That's right.
not_available We very well might be dead.
not_available We're all going to die sooner than we'd like.
not_available Maybe we should do some nice things before we die like bicycle through Vietnam.
not_available We could save up for it.
not_available It would give us something to look forward to.
not_available Two for Murder by Numbers.
not_available No, I don't like it.
not_available Is Sandra Bullock.
not_available Is a girl's movie.
not_available I thought we agreed.
not_available I see Blade II.
not_available You go ahead and see the girl's movie.
not_available Why did we even come together if We go to two different movies.
not_available We get together later to eat.
not_available One for Blade II and one for Murdering by the Numbers.
not_available All right.
not_available Here's your tickets.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Next in line.
not_available I'll meet you right here at 7:40.
not_available Then we'll have a nice supper.
not_available Okay.
not_available In your eyes, I see myself.
not_available My copious imperfections as well as the tattered shreds of my divinity.
not_available All the joy I've brought you and the pain I've caused and still you hold me in your gaze, undaunted by what love demands of us.
not_available You give me strength to see you only you, now and forever and I'm blessed.
not_available And so, in the name of the four elements and of the God Lingam and the Goddess Yoni I now pronounce you, Margaret and Bern Chenowith newly wed.
not_available So what's your favorite part about fourth grade? Math is fun.
not_available Really? And recess.
not_available She's good at so much.
not_available Yeah, she sure is.
not_available So, would you say you two have a parenting style? We've been reading a lot about the whole
not_available child theory.
not_available Although we definitely like to mix in a little common sense.
not_available How so? We certainly believe in setting limits, but we try not to be too rigid.
not_available I think that should just about do it.
not_available Thank you for coming, Mr.
not_available Sherman, sir.
not_available I'll need to have a conversation with your supervisors about your work and so forth.
not_available I'm my own supervisor.
not_available I'm a business owner.
not_available And, as my supervisor, I'd like to say that David Fisher is a great person, and great to work with.
not_available My supervisor is Sgt.
not_available Potts, Northeast Division.
not_available I'll phone him tomorrow.
not_available I'll let myself out.
not_available Where'd you get your coffee table? 
not_available Restoration Hardware.
not_available God, don't you just love that store? I swear, I could live there.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available That man was totally gay.
not_available That's an interesting theory.
not_available I can't admit to something I didn't do.
not_available Looks like you won't have to.
not_available Justin's talking in there.
not_available Justin's here? Nikolai? Please excuse me.
not_available Nikolai, you don't really love me.
not_available I know that.
not_available You're staying with me because you feel obligated to, and that's not fair to either of us.
not_available So I'm breaking up with you right now, okay? Well, okay.
not_available I'm so sorry, please excuse me.
not_available Christ, lady.
not_available Which Lisa? So you really need to tell me what happened.
not_available Just think of it as a game.
not_available Whoever talks first is the winner.
not_available So you're next? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available So, wasn't that ceremony unbelievably 
not_available Pitiful? Pathetic? Or maybe a word that hasn't been invented yet.
not_available Vomitrocious.
not_available Is that a word? 
not_available I was gonna say sweet.
not_available I thought it was sweet.
not_available You're joking.
not_available I kind of bought it.
not_available I mean, look at the two of them.
not_available Who else would have either one of them? 
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available And they recognize that.
not_available For better or worse, they accept each other.
not_available For better or for worse.
not_available By worse, do you mean all the people they randomly fucked Stop.
not_available Please.
not_available They're our parents, Bren.
not_available It can't be good for us to talk about Mom and Dad like that.
not_available I crossed the line? 
not_available It's the way we've always been.
not_available It's our family ethos.
not_available I understand why you go there.
not_available But I don't want to talk that way anymore.
not_available I don't think we have to perpetuate the negativity.
not_available God, what happened to you? Can't we just celebrate? This is a celebration, right? Yeah, whoopee.
not_available Your vows were really, really moving.
not_available I hope my ceremony with Brenda can be that heartfelt.
not_available What we have now is based on real honesty.
not_available And forgiveness.
not_available That woman sees me.
not_available Always has.
not_available She knew you were with another woman 
not_available Many, many other women.
not_available Past tense.
not_available Wow.
not_available And she not only dealt with the jealousy 
not_available but she even renewed your vows with you.
not_available Her idea.
not_available So I sold the house, moved in.
not_available I say, if life offers you a new beginning, take it.
not_available Thank God, you know.
not_available I can't believe I fell into that mid
not_available life crisis trap.
not_available God, what a fool a man will make of himself for some new pussy, huh? To growing up.
not_available She forgave me.
not_available Thank God, you know.
not_available Are we even moving? You forgot to push the button.
not_available "The manner in which she opens her heart to a moment of visual truth inspires me.
not_available "I am simply amazed at the depth "of Claire Fisher's artistic clairvoyance.
not_available "And as a LAC
not_available Arts alumnus "it is with great pleasure that I highly recommend her for your program." Thank you.
not_available You made up a lot of really cool shit.
not_available All true.
not_available I still need to get two more letters.
not_available This guy who works in my Trader Joe's had one of his collages in a show at MOCA.
not_available I could ask him to write a letter.
not_available Cool, that would be great.
not_available When I went to visit my Aunt Sarah, I met this painter, Fiona Kleinschmidt.
not_available You've heard of her? 
not_available Sure, she's huge.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think she had sex with my brother when he was, like, 15.
not_available Devirginized him, even.
not_available Use it.
not_available This one is really hot.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're looking at me weird.
not_available What? You are so That I just wanna reach over and But I also want to do nothing because I wanna make sure I know you for as long as I can without fucking it up which is, like, my special superpower.
not_available That's why I don't want to touch you.
not_available That's verbatim, moment for moment what I was thinking when I was looking at you with the weirdness.
not_available I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.
not_available You'll never be able to see yourself the way other people see you.
not_available The way I see you.
not_available Which is a shame.
not_available Because you are I really think you have no idea how beautiful you are.
not_available You got a double of this one.
not_available Mind if I snag it? It's fine.
not_available I should go.
not_available He's ready.
not_available Who the fuck are you and how did you convince my mother to leave you her savings? I didn't convince your mother of anything.
not_available That was my money she left you.
not_available I sent her $2,500 a month.
not_available And my attorneys have counseled me that this is highly suspect.
not_available She left you everything, and yet I have no idea who you are.
not_available You don't know who I am because you didn't speak to her often.
not_available I called her every other Sunday, my friend.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available We invited her to a barbecue and she said she couldn't come because there was a chance her Andresito might call.
not_available Yeah, a chance.
not_available Listen.
not_available You know, I'm as surprised as you are.
not_available Okay, I am as surprised as you are.
not_available You're sure everything's okay, ma'am? 
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available Thank you, you people can leave now.
not_available We're fine.
not_available You're sure? They just came in! You didn't walk into my house without a search warrant.
not_available No, I did.
not_available This is bullshit.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available It's the law that we can enter your residence to investigate a domestic abuse call, okay? Calm down.
not_available We want to talk to the both of you.
not_available I know the law.
not_available I know you can't come here without a search warrant.
not_available Is your name on the lease, sir? Is that any of your business? 
not_available You need to back up.
not_available This is my fucking house.
not_available I'm warning you.
not_available You need to back up.
not_available You can warn me all the fuck you want 'cause I know what my rights are.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Let go of him! Oh, my God.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Keith, easy.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's over, all right? What did you do? She gave them to me when I was a boy.
not_available It's nice that you kept them.
not_available I haven't been to Mass in over two years.
not_available These are my two boys.
not_available This is Augusto and this is Julio.
not_available They called her abuelita.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available Sure, kiddo.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you 
not_available for how you fixed up my father.
not_available Glad I could do it.
not_available I lost my father a few years back.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The worst thing is how it comes up on you.
not_available From nothing.
not_available When my dad died, I still had baseball tickets I bought while he was alive.
not_available And, you know, when we all 
thought "Of course he'll be around next Sunday." Yeah, we never really went to games.
not_available Mr.
not_available Fisher, you know, if you ever need any help around here like cutting the grass or like a parttime job 
not_available I'd be more than happy.
not_available I'll keep that in mind.
not_available Bye, Mr.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available There was a person at both ATMs, so I started my own line in between them.
not_available Then this woman comes and starts her own line behind one of the ATMs.
not_available I said, "I already started a line." So, she goes She goes what? She goes Bren, you know him? 
not_available Oh, God, I think I've seen him around.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Kyle.
not_available Nate.
not_available Never caught your name.
not_available Brenda.
not_available Right.
not_available This is the kind kind.
not_available Both my connections totally dried up.
not_available One of them got arrested, and the other I had to blow off 'cause he was an actor and made me go to his one
not_available man shows if I wanted to buy a bag.
not_available Fucking beauteous day, huh? Warm.
not_available I'm actually getting burnt.
not_available I'm gonna go inside.
not_available Ciao.
not_available All right.
not_available Good to meet you.
not_available Good to meet you, too, bro.
not_available Good to see you again, Brenda.
not_available What? 
not_available Turn it on.
not_available Nate, please, come on.
not_available Turn it on! Fiction, my ass.
not_available Everything you've written, you've actually done? 
not_available No.
not_available All right, then.
not_available Read this aloud, and tell me what's true.
not_available It's my writing, it's private.
not_available I don't care.
not_available You can't be private anymore.
not_available Tell me the truth.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available Who the fuck do you think you are? Who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you? You know who I am, Nate.
not_available I'm the woman that fucked you in the closet of an airport a couple of hours after I met you.
not_available That's who I was the day we met.
not_available You really fucked two guys? 
not_available You had sex with two women once.
not_available Not when I was engaged to you.
not_available You only had sex with one woman when you were engaged to me.
not_available Without a condom.
not_available Where'd you fuck them? Did you fuck them in our bed? Why didn't you break up with me? Jesus Christ.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know why I did it.
not_available I fucking wish to God I did.
not_available Did you fuck your brother? 
not_available Right, go there.
not_available Why not go there? Did you? Did you fuck the rabbi? I know you wanted to.
not_available No.
not_available I'll bet it was because she wouldn't.
not_available Just for the record, you did it in Seattle before I was scared to death.
not_available I just had a fucking seizure! You wouldn't have told me about it if you weren't forced to.
not_available You know what? I felt safe with her which, frankly, is something I have never felt with you.
not_available You felt safe with her? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, because you were leaving the next day.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Nate, you created a human being.
not_available There'll be another person on this planet now a person who might have a totally miserable fucking life and curse the fucking day she was born because you are walking out on her the same way you'll walk out on me.
not_available Life doesn't have to be miserable just because you are.
not_available I know, weird shit happened to you.
not_available You know what? It happened to all of us.
not_available I'm sick to death of you using it as an excuse to act like some fucking cunt from hell.
not_available How long have you hated me like this? 
not_available I don't need to hate you.
not_available You do a pretty damn good job of hating yourself.
not_available You picked me, you know? Yeah? Only because I had no idea how fucked up you really are.
not_available That's bullshit.
not_available You knew and loved it, because it made you feel good about yourself.
not_available Oh, God, you are so full of shit.
not_available You just can't see it, because you're so in love with the idea of Nate, the good guy, Nate, the hero Nate, the fucking saint with the fucking great haircut.
not_available The truth is, you'd run from real love if it ever came at you Real love? What the fuck do you know about real love? and the neediness and the ugliness and the responsibility.
not_available You would fucking run and you know it.
not_available The only reason you stayed with me is because I was never really here.
not_available You know what? Take your ugly fucking ring.
not_available Don't you throw that ring at me.
not_available That's such a fucking cliché.
not_available I'll fucking barf.
not_available There, barf.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Is Nate there? I'm afraid he's not.
not_available Is this Mrs.
not_available Fisher? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Hi, this is Lisa.
not_available Lisa Kimmel, from Seattle.
not_available Why, hello, dear.
not_available I'm so sorry I didn't get a chance to speak to you when Mr.
not_available Fisher died.
not_available You were very much in my thoughts.
not_available Aren't you sweet.
not_available What a surprise to hear from you.
not_available How is everything in Seattle? Nate hasn't told you what's going on? 
not_available He hasn't told me anything.
not_available No one ever tells me anything.
not_available It's part of being old.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm in L.A.
not_available Now, and you're a grandmother.
not_available No, dear, I'm afraid I'm not.
not_available You are.
not_available I just had a baby.
not_available Nate's baby.
not_available It's a girl.
not_available She was a couple of weeks early.
not_available I named her Maya.

not_available I just got a phone call from Stan.
not_available Kroehner is filing for Chapter 11.
not_available And there's a federal investigation underway.
not_available Isn't that great? 
not_available Yeah, that's great.
not_available I guess the good guys actually do win sometimes.

not_available Listen, I'm not gonna be home for a while.
not_available You want me to hold dinner? 
not_available No, you and Taylor go ahead and eat.
