not_available You're too smart.
not_available You're too good.
not_available Don't waste that.
not_available Okay, I just turned into my father Like exactly.
not_available That was my father.
not_available This is what you do to me.
not_available Call me please.
not_available When you said go away, I didn't think you meant "Go away ! " This is bullshit and you know it.
not_available So this is what happens when I really need you.
not_available It's nice to know I can depend on you in a crisis.
not_available This is for us.
not_available No, this is for you, you arrogant macho fuck ! You think everybody's supposed to be so fucking strong all the time ! You can't stand to see me weak like this.
not_available You're revolted by me.
not_available "This is for us.
not_available ".
not_available Fucking liar ! I meant all four of us, you fuckin' idiot ! You never even wanted those kids 
not_available That's not fair.
not_available and now you honestly think you can take care of them on your own ? You're not up to being a single parent, Keith.
not_available Well, you're not up to being a parent at all.
not_available You are using this as an excuse to dump me, Which you've wanted to do ever since Anthony and Durrell came here ! Don't touch me.
not_available Come here ! God ! 
not_available David, I love you.
not_available But I am those boys' father, And right now I have to take care of them, because you can't.
not_available You are sick, and I don't think you can get well here.
not_available Jesus, when am I gonna find a fucking medication that works ? She has a pretty severe lack of surfactant in her lungs, But she is breathing steadily with a ventilator.
not_available I wanna see her.
not_available Why hasn't somebody brought her in ? Well, she's in an incubator, and she's hooked up to monitors, a feeding tube.
not_available Then why doesn't somebody take me to her ? She's my baby.
not_available You can't keep her from me.
not_available We're still looking for sepsis, possible bleeds in the brain.
not_available Oh god.
not_available Most babies born before 30 weeks Experience cranial bleeding with varying degrees of severity.
not_available When can I see her ? 
not_available As soon as she's ready.
not_available I promise you someone will come take you to her.
not_available Oh god.
not_available Don't you worry.
not_available Willa is going to get through this and be healthy, And she's going to be home with you soon.
not_available And Maya is gonna be home with you too.
not_available I know you don't like kiwi But, really, I think you need to give it a second chance.
not_available What ? Was that pushy ? No.
not_available No, it's just I'm eating fruit salad In bed with a naked frat boy who voted for George Bush.
not_available We're listening to what sounds suspiciously like christian music ? It is christian music.
not_available What ? I just hear songs on the radio And if I like them, I buy the cd.
not_available Oh my god, You might be the most deeply un
not_available Hip person I've ever met.
not_available Ah, seeing how being hip is primarily an adolescent concern, I'll take that as a compliment.
not_available You know, if you really are christian Um, I should probably tell you I had an abortion.
not_available That's okay I sort of paid for one.
not_available Well i didn't really pay for it.
not_available I still have to send her the check.
not_available God, I feel like I'm trapped underwater.
not_available And it's not just Nate dying.
not_available I mean, I have absolutely no idea What I am supposed to do with my life.
not_available Don't you still wanna be an artist ? Yeah.
not_available But I'm scared that maybe I'm not good enough.
not_available Is that true ? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available So get better.
not_available I really don't want to go back to school.
not_available I mean, even though it's art, I still feel that I'm just being programmed.
not_available Just take pictures.
not_available If you're good enough, you'll find out.
not_available And if you're not, you'll get good enough.
not_available Or you'll find out you can't.
not_available But I bet you are, though.
not_available Maybe I should take pictures of you naked.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available But you have to promise that you won't post them on the internet.
not_available I might want to run for public office some day.
not_available Are you serious ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Aren't you ? Too bad you don't believe in anything Or you could pray.
not_available This is exactly what I was afraid of.
not_available Fuck ! Come on, charles.
not_available You're our hero ! 
not_available I'm no hero.
not_available Sure you are.
not_available You've gotta snap out of it.
not_available You have to remember the good times ! Like when ? 
not_available Like over there ! Uh, boys I'm gonna be taking off for a few days.
not_available Why ? Well
not_available 'Cause y'all are splittin' up, And you're gonna leave us with him.
not_available That's why.
not_available Like we don't know.
not_available Durrell.
not_available I'm not leaving, 
not_available Yeah, well, why you have a suitcase ? look I have to go away for now Because there's a funeral directors' conference in portland.
not_available Do you want me to bring you something back ? Yeah, bring me a silver Escalade.
not_available Durrell, I promise you I am coming back
not_available I heard that before ! Are you gonna bathe yours ? Fuffle with it.
not_available Tulips.
not_available Pretty ! You leave your door open like that ? We were just outside picking flowers.
not_available Ruth, it isn't the '50s anymore, no matter how you dress.
not_available So you're ready to go, you little monkey ? No ! No ? ! 
not_available Go where ? Well, back to Brenda's of course.
not_available Brenda said you agreed to that.
not_available Well, yes, but I thought Brenda was staying in the hospital a little longer.
not_available Brenda's not the one who's sick, And anyway, she can't really visit the baby after 10:00 p.m.
not_available So she's coming home tonight.
not_available And the baby's staying in the hospital an extra couple of weeks.
not_available I suppose I'd better go pack her things then.
not_available That would be helpful, Ruth.
not_available So he says the house alone is worth $2 million.
not_available So 25%, I should be entitled to half a miion dollars.
not_available What "should be" ? You are.
not_available Are we gonna have $1 million ? Mm
not_available Hmm, someday, if you eat your eggs.
not_available You know, I could put half of that down as a deposit on the new place, Spend 100 or so on upgrades.
not_available The rest would tide us over until we got things going.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You really think this could work ? You know what, Rico ? I liked when I helped you out with that funeral yesterday.
not_available It was sort of like being a nurse, But without all the blood and bedpans and pills And I got to wear better clothes.
not_available Julio, please, eggs.
not_available Augusto thinks they're gross.
not_available Well they are kind of gross, But eat 'em anyway.
not_available All you gotta do now is get the Fishers to buy you out.
not_available Or sell Preferably to someone who just wants the house and the land And wants to shut the business down.
not_available What ? Nate left his part to Brenda.
not_available I don't think she wants to be in the funeral business.
not_available I think David's going kind of nuts.
not_available He needs to get out.
not_available Plus, who needs the competition anyway, you know ? Hello ? 
not_available Hi.
not_available I just thought I'd check in with you.
not_available How are you doing ? Any news about Willa ? No, and I'm fine.
not_available Doesn't sound very convincing.
not_available Well, I'm sorry, George, but I have enough to worry about Without having to convince you how I'm feeling.
not_available Another bad day ? 
not_available Yes, it's a terrible day.
not_available Brenda's mother came and took Maya.
not_available Now I'm alone.
not_available I'm finally completely alone.
not_available Oh, honey.
not_available You're not alone.
not_available You have me.
not_available George, I have to go.
not_available David's here.
not_available I can't be at home right now.
not_available Where will you go ? Here.
not_available Go put your things upstairs then.
not_available I'll make you some cereal.
not_available Would you like it in your yellow bowl ? Mom, I don't think I've eaten out of that yellow bowl Since I was a little boy.
not_available Yeah, put it in the yellow bowl.
not_available Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Claire Fisher.
not_available This is Dennis at New Image And I'm just calling to find out where I should 
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi, Claire Fisher ? Yeah ? I need an address to send your application package to.
not_available Are you from the temp agency ? No, I'm from New Image.
not_available 'Re a stock photo production house in New York city.
not_available What kind of application ? Photographer's assistant.
not_available It's like a training position.
not_available About a quarter of our staff photographers started out as assistants.
not_available Really ? Uh, really.
not_available All I could think of is maybe the gallery owner from my show Is the one who suggested me.
not_available Or maybe it was Billy.
not_available Yeah, he would do that, Partly just to make me feel guilty for dumping him.
not_available Fuck that.
not_available And the pay is shit, I'm sure.
not_available But it is a job, New York city ! I actually could move up to become a staff photographer, Although I'm not gonna get my hopes up like I did about that grant.
not_available It's wonderful to hear.
not_available You couldn't pay me to live in New York city.
not_available Would you like a bowl of cereal ? Um, no thanks.
not_available I'm not sure who designed the stained
not_available Glass window.
not_available I heard it was a somewhat influential artist.
not_available Uh, what about the water problems in the basement ? Oh, big repair job less than a year ago.
not_available They completely redid the plumbing as well as all the underground drainage.
not_available What did I tell you ? 
not_available Wow ! Yes, apparently, there was some sort of a a problem.
not_available Eh, when everything gets backed up, Then blood comes out of the toilet.
not_available Yeah, that happens.
not_available Can we get a copy of the work report and the guarantee ? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Great.
not_available I will have the seller fax that over to you.
not_available We could put an espresso bar in this nook.
not_available You know, I always wanted to do that, But David thought it would be disrespectful.
not_available Great.
not_available Very nice.
not_available I can't say she's out of the woods for sure.
not_available You'll have to watch and see how she develops To know if there's any permanent brain damage.
not_available But, from a physical standpoint, She is doing remarkably well.
not_available Thank God.
not_available She's been taking your milk from the bottle all the time now, right ? 
not_available Right.
not_available Then I think we can Permanently remove that feeding tube.
not_available When can I take her home ? Well, I'd like to keep her another 24 hours After the tube comes out just to be on the safe side.
not_available So there's absolutely no sign of spina bifida or down's ? Definitely neither of those.
not_available And you checked for every possible problem That the triple marker could have found ? And I can't find anything.
not_available Nothing that would be apparent at this point anyway.
not_available Great.
not_available So she'll seem normal for a while Before whatever's fucked up about her shows up.
not_available Well, that's positive news, isn't it, sweetheart ? Shut up, Marge, you fuckin' idiot.
not_available The fact she was premature Has something to do with that blood test and you know it.
not_available There's something wrong with our baby.
not_available You should never have had her.
not_available Oh God.
not_available For Christ's sake, Brenda, There's something to feel good about.
not_available Don't shit all over it ! Thank you, doctor.
not_available I got him Don't ever do that ! What ? Do what ? 
not_available Pop up like that.
not_available Like this ? 
not_available Don't ! Ruth ? The back door is open.
not_available Yes, I suppose someone could just come in and murder me in cold blood, 
not_available Which would be a blessing.
not_available Ruthie It just takes time.
not_available Liar.
not_available That's what everybody always says and it's a lie.
not_available Each day I feel worse, More empty, more dead.
not_available I barely even remember my life before Nate.
not_available I was practically a child when I had him.
not_available How can I live without him ? I can't.
not_available Yes, you can for Maya.
not_available They've taken Maya.
not_available I will probably never see her or her sister again If her sister even survives.
not_available Ruth I promise you, you will get through this.
not_available I don't wanna get through it ! This is the worst thing that can ever happen to anyone.
not_available This is hell, George, hell, And I just want it to end.
not_available Then let me take care of you.
not_available Let me make sure you don't go through this alone.
not_available You did it for me.
not_available Now it's my turn.
not_available To do what ? Feel helpless while you watch me lose my mind ? Just let me hold you.
not_available Absolutely not ! This is my family's business and I won't sell it.
not_available So buy me out.
not_available Fine ! But I hope that you're aware that this place Is probably worth $2 million.
not_available I had it appraised.
not_available So what do you want to do with your part, Brenda ? I don't really care.
not_available Sorry, David, I don't.
not_available You know what ? I don't really care either.
not_available Why am I fighting for something I've always been ambivalent about ? Habit.
not_available So we put it on the market ? Sure.
not_available Why not ? Cool.
not_available I mean, if we can make that kind of money, Why hang on to it ? I have no reason.
not_available We've been clutching so desperately to the past, and for what ? Because that's when there was hope.
not_available Um, I'm going over to Ted's tonight.
not_available Take a sweater ! Oh damn ! What is she doing ? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Mom ? Maya's monkey ! She loves this monkey ! I have to wash it.
not_available I think it's great.
not_available I mean, think of what we can do with your portion and my savings.
not_available We could finally buy a house.
not_available We could buy a house now.
not_available But we could buy a house and you could go back to school And become a lawyer like you've always dreamed.
not_available I don't think I ever really even wanted to be a lawyer.
not_available I think I just wanted to have sex with Harry Hamlin.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available You can be whatever you wanna be, David.
not_available So can you.
not_available Exactly.
not_available We could really buy a house, couldn't we, with a yard ? We could get the boys a dog and a tire swing.
not_available Those boys don't want a tire swing, they want a tv the size of a wall.
not_available So do you think you're rea to come back home soon ? 
not_available Because I do.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Good.
not_available Man, those are big teeth.
not_available Whoa, look at the wolf brain made into asphalt ! Wow ! 
not_available But it looks like poop ! Cool.
not_available No, it's not cool.
not_available And you saying it is just makes it even more not cool.
not_available I think it's cool.
not_available Thank you, Anthony.
not_available I've never never seen you act this way ! So ? 
not_available Yeah, so it has to be analyzed And diagnosed and turned into an example of some kind of pathology.
not_available I mean, this is the Chenowith family.
not_available Oh god, Billy ! Have a drink ! That's what you are born into.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Aren't they funny ? Oh, dear, she's having guests.
not_available Mom, she knows we're coming.
not_available I called her.
not_available I can't go in.
not_available I'll wait in the car.

not_available I've applied for this, like, entry
not_available level position At this, like, stock photo house ..
not_available New Image.
not_available Impressive.
not_available Not really.
not_available It's just a lame gofer job like I used to do for you.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available You could easily go on to become a soulless advertising photographer.
not_available And with your gifts, hmm, I'm sure you probably will.
not_available And I'm the one who recommended you.
not_available Shut the fuck up.
not_available Claire, it doesn't matter who fucked Russell.
not_available I still believe in you.
not_available Jesus, Olivier, That's so nice of you.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Calm down.
not_available I mean, you just popped into my mind Because I'd just seen you at that junior show.
not_available Maya, Don't you want to show grandma your okapi ? Okapi ! 
not_available Yes ! I don't believe I've ever heard of an okapi.
not_available Oh, the okapi is the only known living relative of the giraffe.
not_available Its young really don't seem to imprint on the mothers, So they nurse from many available lactating females.
not_available We just went to the zoo this week.
not_available So, uh How long have you and Claire been Together ? 
not_available Uh Well, we met, I guess it was about..
not_available Four months ago.
not_available Well, we..

not_available Really ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was there when she got the call about Nate And I spent most of that night In the hospital with her.
not_available That's how my sister met her brother.
not_available The night his father died.

not_available She's a very calm baby.
not_available I think she's blind.
not_available She gets stronger every day.
not_available Oh, she's fierce when she nurses.
not_available I'm covered in bruises.
not_available Nate had a big appetite.
not_available Is she gassy ? No, not overly so, But she's always hungry.
not_available That's because she knows she doesn't have much time.
not_available She wants to get it while she can.
not_available So you're really going to sell your legacy ? Your birthright ? 
not_available Yeah, and good riddance.
not_available Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
not_available You never had it in you.
not_available Neither did you.
not_available The only way you could handle it Was to have a secret room over a really bad indian restaurant.
not_available And you don't think you have a secret room ? What do you think being gay is, you fucking freak ? Fuck you.
not_available What did you just say to me ? Leave me alone, dad.
not_available Who do you think you are ? You think you can just walk away from this ? Are you really that stupid ? 
not_available It only gets closer, david.

not_available So, what ? I'm just fucked ? Maybe you can find someone to buy your share out.
not_available Nobody's gonna wanna pay half a million dollars For 25% of this business, you fuckin' moron ! If they have that kind of money, They're gonna want to Open up their own place.
not_available Something smaller.

not_available Really ? I always liked this on you.
not_available It itches.

not_available You don't even know where your own daughter is ? Ruth, please, don't sensationalize it.
not_available George, don't talk to me like you're my father or my teacher.
not_available Do you have any idea how much I hate it when you do that ? I saw Maggie Just before Brenda gave birth.
not_available And she was completely irrational.
not_available She was very very angry.
not_available With you ? 
not_available No I think she was angry with the state of her life.
not_available She just chose to take it out on me.
not_available What state of her life ? I don't know.
not_available She didn't tell me.
not_available You didn't ask ? 
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available She told me she would call me when she got settled.
not_available Look, this is not the first time it's happened.
not_available I don't think I can move in with you, George.
not_available Why not ? Because Don't get me wrong, You're a good, decent, Man with a big heart.
not_available But there are walls around that heart Walls behind walls behind walls.
not_available And I can spend a certain amount of time around that, But I cannot live with it, not anymore.
not_available Oh, don't look so sour.
not_available It doesn't mean I won't go out with you.
not_available We can have a lot more fun this way.
not_available Believe me I could use a little fun.
not_available Father, we thank thee for these and all thy blessings.
