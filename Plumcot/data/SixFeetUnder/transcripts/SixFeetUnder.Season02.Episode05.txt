not_available I'm not crazy.
not_available Oh, my God! I'm just surprised.
not_available Why? I told you I was going to write a book.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available I thought I did.
not_available What? 
not_available I need to get in there.
not_available So you're just gonna sit down today and start writing? Yeah, I think that's how it's usually done.
not_available Except for Hemingway.
not_available He stood.
not_available What? 
not_available I need to get in there now.
not_available What? You think I can't write a book? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available It's just a book is so big.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available Well, it's just the last time we talked about you doing something new you mentioned getting Billy's friends to help you open an art gallery.
not_available Yeah, well, I got to thinking.
not_available I don't need to help others express themselves.
not_available I should do it myself.
not_available I think this is great.
not_available Charlotte finally speaks.
not_available Your fucked up childhood from your point of view.
not_available People will want to read that.
not_available No way.
not_available I'm not gonna write a memoir.
not_available What is it, then? 
not_available Fiction.
not_available Really? That's so ambitious.
not_available I love it.
not_available I hope I'm going to be in it.
not_available I've always wanted to be thinly veiled.
not_available You might be in it if you ever do anything interesting.
not_available I need help.
not_available Do you think the hair on Mr.
not_available Peterson's forearms is sexy? Or is it too unkempt? Sometimes he gets all tufty.
not_available I really don't have time for this.
not_available This weekend is my last chance to take the SATs.
not_available I have to do well.
not_available Just take a break.
not_available It'll keep you from burning out.
not_available Every fall, I rate the male teachers' fuckability.
not_available I've been doing it since the sixth grade.
not_available I am, like, 400 times smarter than you.
not_available Why aren't you panicking more about this test? Because I know how to play the game.
not_available I have a tutor.
not_available I've taken practice tests.
not_available And my mom's life coach is advising me.
not_available Your mom's life coach? Parker, do you have any idea what a parody of yourself you are? I feel bad for Mr.
not_available Van Kirk.
not_available If he hadn't stopped working out, he could've easily cracked the top 10.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Gitterman's coming in at 22? I was feeling generous.
not_available Hey, Claire.
not_available Gary, hi.
not_available See you this afternoon? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Gary has a great ass.
not_available You think he has a great ass? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Like you haven't noticed.
not_available My mom calls them buns.
not_available She's so not of this century.
not_available I don't care how much she pays her life coach.
not_available I could fuck Gary.
not_available Easy.
not_available So this woman in her 40s just died alone in her apartment? Just out of the blue? I mean, she must have had some kind of medical condition.
not_available No, she choked to death.
not_available She lay there for a week before anyone found her.
not_available Why didn't anybody notice sooner? Maybe they thought she was on vacation.
not_available Here are the arrangements for her funeral.
not_available They're self
not_available explanatory.
not_available You should be able to take care of it.
not_available Shouldn't I talk to whoever's gonna bury her? Nate, it's a pre
not_available need.
not_available She buried herself.
not_available She bought everything she wanted ahead of time.
not_available You have her contacts for family and friends, directions for the service and the specifications about her restoration.
not_available She knew exactly what kind of service she wanted.
not_available You'll need to order the sheet music for the organist.
not_available And I am telling you I'm not going.
not_available She certainly had a sense of humor.
not_available What song is that? It's from Dreamgirls.
not_available You know 
it And I am telling you I'm not going You're the best man I've ever known It must be weird to fill one of these things out for yourself.
not_available I had fun doing mine.
not_available I have a test on Monday, I have an art history paper due next week.
not_available I know I could do a good job on both if I had more time, but I don't.
not_available Do I have something on my face? 
not_available No.
not_available You're giving me this look.
not_available It's just nice to see you so involved.
not_available Are you taking the SAT this weekend? I saw the books in the library.
not_available I don't know why I didn't tell you.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I just signed up for it.
not_available I wasn't sure.
not_available No, it's great.
not_available You're taking school more seriously, and you're gonna take the SAT.
not_available It shows you're nurturing yourself.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available I'm so scared of having my own thoughts or going my own direction that I need some safety or approval.
not_available This stuff is just cop
not_available out distractions.
not_available You know what? This session's given me some clarity.
not_available I should just blow this test off and look really hard inside myself for what I really want.
not_available Claire, you're obviously frightened by taking this test.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available It's like, when I think about the test I see this nasty fluorescent light.
not_available The kind that shows all your pockmarks and tiny scars that you wish you could hide.
not_available I see.
not_available So it's very safe in the darkness, isn't it? Okay, you're getting kind of corny.
not_available All I'm saying is you're finally in a place where you're coming into your own.
not_available You're afraid if people see the real you, it'll be scary.
not_available And guess what? It is scary.
not_available For all of us.
not_available Isn't it? Don't be silly, David.
not_available You don't need to apologize for what you said about the plan.
not_available If you live in a neighborhood for a long time and somebody moves in and renovates the house across the street that could just make you feel your own house is shabby.
not_available I see.
not_available Did you just insult me? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available You'll see.
not_available When you're ready, you're going to live in a palace.
not_available Claire, wash your hands.
not_available We're about to eat.
not_available Don't set a place for me.
not_available I'm not staying.
not_available Who are you having dinner with? 
not_available No one.
not_available I'm having coffee with someone I met at St.
not_available Stephen's.
not_available David, if you have a date, just say it.
not_available Nothing ever gets built if the materials aren't labeled properly.
not_available Okay, I have a date.
not_available David, I'm having a problem with the Emily Previn funeral.
not_available Let's hear it.
not_available I've called her entire contact list, and the friends she listed have moved or died.
not_available She has two distant relatives.
not_available One of which I can't reach, and the other has this phobia about funerals.
not_available Some people are so sick.
not_available Now we know why she wasn't found for a week.
not_available I don't think she had anybody in her life.
not_available How awful.
not_available Have you called her job to notify her colleagues about the service? No.
not_available She worked at a temp agency, so she just had jobs here and there.
not_available She must have had someone that she forgot to list.
not_available Try her high school.
not_available Everyone has friends from high school.
not_available No, they don't.
not_available Maybe they have people they talk to, or do things with but they're not really friends.
not_available They're just filler.
not_available What? It's true.
not_available I want a glass of wine.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available It's so weird.
not_available Who the hell was Emily Previn? Nate, are you okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available 'Cause your eyes look really weird.
not_available Yeah, it's just this medication I'm taking.
not_available It makes me a little drowsy.
not_available That's all.
not_available Honestly.
not_available Maybe Emily Previn was autistic.
not_available I read an article about a high
not_available functioning autistic person who didn't need people.
not_available She just had a job designing these big cattle slaughterhouses.
not_available At night, she came home and sat in a machine that made her feel like she was being hugged.
not_available And that was all the intimacy she needed.
not_available That's really upsetting.
not_available I don't see why this person has to be mentally ill just because she had a life that doesn't conform to a familiar image in our heads.
not_available Maybe she was living the life she wanted.
not_available A life without the hassle of other people.
not_available What kind of a life is that? "Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor "but how was I supposed to know it was your car?" 
not_available I don't think I could be a public defender.
not_available No? Why not? I just don't think I could defend people who are guilty.
not_available I guess I could be a someofthe
not_available public defender.
not_available So, what do you do? Me? My family owns a business.
not_available Actually, it's a funeral home.
not_available But I got out of that really quickly, and now I'm in textiles.
not_available I like fabric.
not_available I have to be in court in the morning.
not_available I have a lot of work 
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe we'll see each other around.
not_available David, relax.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I understand.
not_available I guess there's not much of a spark here.
not_available I thought there was.
not_available You don't? No, I do.
not_available I was just worried.
not_available I'm sorry, Ben.
not_available I get a little nervous at these things.
not_available If I seem calm, it's only because I take a beta
not_available blocker before I have to get in front of a jury or first dates.
not_available You're still nervous on the inside, but you don't show it as much.
not_available Do you have any extra? Let's go on a real date next time.
not_available Like, for dinner.
not_available Okay, that would be nice.
not_available You seem a little Are you coming out of a bad breakup? 
not_available No, I'm coming out of a bad celibacy.
not_available I was in a relationship, but that ended.
not_available Well, whatever happened, I blame him.
not_available You shouldn't.
not_available He's a great guy.
not_available You get your spoiled little ass into that bed right now! Do you hear me? You suck! Right now! I mean it! I'm not tired.
not_available When I'm at my real home, I don't have to go to sleep until I get tired.
not_available I'm going to turn off the lights now, and soon you'll be tired.
not_available What if I never get tired? Then you'll lay awake for hours and hours wondering why life is so hard.
not_available That's what the rest of us do.
not_available That sounds boring.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available Do you want to talk about anything? Like how you feel about staying here? Or being scared, because your mom's been in Oakland so long? No.
not_available Okay.
not_available But we don't know how long you're gonna be here.
not_available So why don't we both try and ease up on each other a little bit, okay? You guys have bad toothpaste.
not_available My first instinct is to get angry with her.
not_available I open my mouth, I hear my father.
not_available Stop being so hard on yourself.
not_available That child is not easy.
not_available I swore to myself I would never be like him.
not_available I'm not in the mood.
not_available Fine.
not_available Get up! Hello? 
not_available Hi, Melissa.
not_available It's Brenda.
not_available Chenowith.
not_available Your massage therapist.
not_available Hey, how's it going? Listen, I was just wondering if you hadn't eaten yet if you wanted to have lunch.
not_available Actually, I'm at a restaurant right now.
not_available Look, I'm probably breaking all these client/masseuse boundaries.
not_available I'll see you at your regular appointment tomorrow.
not_available No, I was just gonna say I'm by myself.
not_available I'd love the company.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Oh, Jesus! This one's gonna be one hell of a ride.
not_available I'm sure you'll be able to take care of it.
not_available Yeah? Well, don't be.
not_available She must've been laying out for a week in a partially
not_available ventilated space.
not_available Why can't everyone die in an air
not_available conditioned room? Her face is discolored from being lain on.
not_available That I can fix, although it's gonna take me hours.
not_available Her abdomen's all distended.
not_available This woman's got a lot of gas in there.
not_available When I poke a hole, we're gonna get some major fumes.
not_available Whew, Nellie! I have no idea why I came in here.
not_available Maybe you have Alzheimer's.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available We really are just biology, aren't we? You may need to talk the family out of an open casket.
not_available There's only so much I can do, man.
not_available She doesn't have any family.
not_available No one? 
not_available No friends, or anybody.
not_available I ran an obituary in the paper today.
not_available I'm just praying someone will read it and come tomorrow.
not_available Pre
not_available need? If she wanted an open casket, we'll try to give her one.
not_available I'll boost up the fluids and see if that'll bring the swelling down.
not_available There's a good chance we're going to get some skin slippage, and then we're screwed.
not_available Maybe she was just some vicious asshole, you know? Just twisted and evil.
not_available Maybe that's why she didn't have any people in her life.
not_available No.
not_available You can tell what kind of life people lived even when they're dead.
not_available Yeah, she was all right.
not_available Please have your IDs out and ready so we can speed things along.
not_available Claire Fisher.
not_available ID? 
not_available Sign right here.
not_available Name? 
not_available Parker McKenna.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Parker.
not_available Sign here, please.
not_available Next? Does anybody have an extra number two pencil? Here you go.
not_available So it sounds like a pretty serious relationship for you.
not_available It is.
not_available I love Nate.
not_available I really do.
not_available But, lately, I feel kind of separate from him.
not_available Which I know is healthy on one level.
not_available But, on another, I kind of miss how it was.
not_available When we started seeing each other and weren't together I'd be wondering, "What is he doing," all day long.
not_available Now? I never even think about it.
not_available I don't know exactly when I changed.
not_available But at some point, he became less present with me.
not_available Sometimes I think it's because I don't give him enough to be present for.
not_available But then I think, maybe he's not present because he knows if he was really present then I'd leave him.
not_available You know, it's just so sad that you can love somebody so much and have absolutely no idea what's going on in their head.
not_available Relationships are fucked.
not_available That's what I always say.
not_available I haven't had a real relationship in over a decade.
not_available Is that because you 
not_available Because I blow guys for money? I'm so sorry.
not_available That was It's okay.
not_available I've only been doing that for about five years.
not_available So why, then? I'm just not built for it.
not_available Some people aren't, I think.
not_available It's not healthy or unhealthy.
not_available It just is.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available I'm being paged by a client.
not_available I am not driving out to Calabasas in this traffic.
not_available Let the jerk whack off.
not_available You know, I'm really glad you could have lunch.
not_available Me, too.
not_available You know, it means a lot to me that you're so normal around me.
not_available Most people have preconceived notions about what I do.
not_available Yeah, well, people can be such judgmental assholes.
not_available You don't have to tell me that.
not_available You want to know what's worse? Most girls want to be my friend so that they can pump me for all the gory details about being a lady of the evening.
not_available It's just question after question, like I'm some kind of freak.
not_available All right, you get three questions.
not_available Oh, goody! There's that one.
not_available No, I think that one makes you look fat.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Which one do you think will look better on Miss Previn? The pink one.
not_available Didn't she specify which gown she wanted, or did Dad slip up? No, Dad didn't slip up.
not_available She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.
not_available The outfit she came in with was shot.
not_available Give her the blue to get rid of it.
not_available It's coming apart in the back.
not_available David! Mom, did you want something? 
not_available I was dusting your casket wall.
not_available If this woman wanted to be buried in her own clothes then one of you boys should go to her home and pick something out.
not_available Isn't that a bit much? I remember Dad doing it once or twice.
not_available You get the building manager to let you in.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll pick out something dressy.
not_available Considering the shape her body's in I should pick whatever covers her up the most.
not_available I'll come with you.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available I know that.
not_available Aren't the guys scary? It must get dangerous.
not_available To tell you the truth, it doesn't.
not_available You just have to trust your instinct.
not_available It's never wrong.
not_available We're kind of like animals that way.
not_available When I first meet a client, I take a good long look into his eyes.
not_available That stupid stuff they say about looking in people's eyes is true.
not_available You just look into them, and you know.
not_available Know what? You know, whether someone is right, or whether they're you know, wrong.
not_available And if they're wrong, you just get out of there immediately.
not_available No.
not_available I think everyone has the answers to everything in life.
not_available It's a matter of knowing how to listen.
not_available You're fantastic! Fuck, you are! There is no bullshit with you! You are just who you are.
not_available Period.
not_available Even the way you talk about your work.
not_available You provide a service for which you're well
not_available compensated.
not_available Unlike the rest of us losers.
not_available Please.
not_available If there was anything else that paid this much, I would do it in a heartbeat.
not_available But there's not a touch of victimhood about you.
not_available It's almost like it's empowering, in a way.
not_available I went through that whole feminist rationalization stuff at first.
not_available Now I'm just a little more honest.
not_available It's just a way to pay the bills.
not_available Sorry I can't make it to the funeral.
not_available My kid's got a soccer game.
not_available She was one of your tenants, for God's sake.
not_available She lived among you.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available I just started, all right? She only lived among me for a week.
not_available She never even got to finish her crossword puzzle.
not_available All right, look.
not_available Five minutes? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Great.
not_available Mom! Eddie needs to adapt to how things have changed.
not_available I have a lot more responsibility now.
not_available He needs to be more understanding that sometimes I'm gonna be tired, man.
not_available Yeah, kids come first.
not_available Period.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Have you had this conversation with him? He'd just say I need to make more time for him, which would piss me off.
not_available So why bother talking to him about it? Because you keep everything bottled up inside you, my friend.
not_available That's not good.
not_available That creates cancer.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available It does.
not_available My wife's cousin was a very angry person, but she never showed it.
not_available She just cleaned all day, then she lost both her breasts.
not_available It's weird.
not_available You get away from me, dickless fuck! 
not_available You don't own me.
not_available What the fuck's wrong with you? You know, you fucking lie to me, bitch! Bitch, I'll blow your fucking brains out, you stupid cunt! I wish you would, but you don't got the balls to shoot me! Police! Drop the gun! 
not_available Stay out of this! Fucking cops! Drop the gun.
not_available You shoot me, they'll shoot you.
not_available Then you'll be dead! You know what? The world will be a better place! Shut up! 
not_available Drop the gun now! What is wrong with you? What did you do that for? What's wrong with you? I like all of these, but they seem so flat.
not_available I wish one had a little more oomph.
not_available Just grab that one.
not_available That one has oomph.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available Don't rush me, Nate.
not_available I'm not nearly done and I haven't even started with the shoes and the jewelry.
not_available Nate Fisher.
not_available Yeah, hi.
not_available I left a message there for Father Martin Farrell.
not_available He was requested by the deceased to officiate at her funeral.
not_available Great! Well, I'm fucked.
not_available I'm sorry, Sister.
not_available Are there any other priests you'd recommend for a funeral tomorrow? Mom? What, are you hungry? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Then, are you ready to go? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe she liked solitude.
not_available Maybe she was living the life she wanted and was happy.
not_available I hope so.
not_available But what if some nights, she wanted to talk to someone and she picked up the phone and realized she didn't have anyone she could call? What then? We don't know that she didn't have anyone to call.
not_available Maybe there was someone.
not_available I hope so.
not_available No one thinks you did anything wrong.
not_available You were just doing your job, okay? Now I know what's different.
not_available You're not wearing your glasses tonight.
not_available I was getting dressed, and nothing looked right and I realized it was all my glasses' fault.
not_available So I put in these contacts, which I actually hate but I thought it was worth it, if you'd This is me without beta
not_available blockers.
not_available It's good.
not_available Maybe it's even better.
not_available I still work in the family business.
not_available Excuse me? I'm a funeral director, that's who I am.
not_available I have to say, I'm glad you're not in textiles.
not_available That sounded really dull.
not_available Why did you lie? Well, come on.
not_available People always get that look in their eyes, like there's something wrong with you.
not_available They wait about 5 seconds before bringing the conversation around to necrophilia.
not_available I just liked you too much, and I was scared it would repulse you.
not_available So what made you tell me now? Because on our last date, I just sort of liked you and now I really like you.
not_available So I didn't screw things up because I lied? 
not_available No, I think it's cute.
not_available And I'm gonna wanna take this slow.
not_available All right.
not_available Can we just make out, already? We had plans to meet tonight.
not_available At the Tiki Ti.
not_available Did we? Claire, why did you blow me off? And why didn't you return my phone calls? Because I have nothing to say to you.
not_available Look, I know this is about the SATs, but it wasn't my fault.
not_available It was my mother's idea.
not_available She heard about this girl through one of her friends.
not_available She's this genius from Westlake who's going around taking the test.
not_available And let me tell you, it works.
not_available She got three people into Yale and five into Harvard.
not_available This is so gross.
not_available What was I supposed to do? My mom came into my room last night and told me she'd already paid the girl $1,000.
not_available You make me so sick.
not_available Just get out of here! Okay? I don't feel like ever seeing you again.
not_available You're serious? 
not_available Yeah, I am.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fuck you, Claire! By the way, I flirted for 45 minutes with Gary Deitman outside of school yesterday and he's this total horny little freak.
not_available And I'm gonna bag him, big time.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I hope you and his stupid buns will be very happy together! "David Fisher and Benjamin Cooper invite you to a holiday open house.
not_available " "Merry Christmas from Ben and David." "Happy Holidays from the Cooper
not_available Fishers." "Fish &amp; Coop, new this fall on ABC." Keith, what's wrong? I'm not sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Come in and sit down.
not_available I shouldn't have even come here.
not_available It's fine.
not_available You want a beer? I have Rolling Rock or Amstel Light 
not_available I killed someone today.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It was this guy Him and his woman were having a fight.
not_available They were obviously both high on something.
not_available He had a gun and I'm sure whatever it was, you did the right thing.
not_available He's dead, you fucking idiot! I should have aimed at his arm or his leg.
not_available I'm stupid.
not_available I'm so fucking stupid.
not_available I never killed someone before.
not_available I can't live with this.
not_available I don't know how to help you.
not_available Do you want to pray? Maybe that would do something.
not_available David's not up yet? So where's Emily Previn? She's in there.
not_available So she's not gonna have an open casket.
not_available I couldn't do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I was supposed to take the kids to dinner so Vanessa could have the night off.
not_available But instead, I was here.
not_available Until 9:00 last night.
not_available Skin was fricking pouring off that woman's face! I get all this shit from Vanessa, and I wasn't able to restore the poor lady! Nobody could have.
not_available But, here, you think you can do it? Here's some tools.
not_available I want to watch you swim in that skin.
not_available Go ahead! All I said was okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just wish I could've done her the way she wanted.
not_available If it'll make you feel any better, I don't think there are even gonna be any mourners.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hello? It's me.
not_available I thought you were still here.
not_available I had to get back home.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Listen, what happened last night, that was wrong.
not_available I don't know why I went to you, but obviously I wasn't thinking right.
not_available Obviously.
not_available I'm in a relationship.
not_available I know that.
not_available I'm not an idiot.
not_available I just thought you and I could be friends but I was just kidding myself.
not_available Look, I don't think that you and I should see each other anymore.
not_available David? Yeah, I'm here.
not_available Sure, whatever you want.
not_available I knew you would understand.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That was intense.
not_available You're practically like jelly.
not_available You don't need this.
not_available Maybe not, but I love it.
not_available You're gifted, you know that? Hello? Don't give me that bullshit.
not_available I want your ass there in half an hour.
not_available Okay, fuck you.
not_available You are officially dead to me now.
not_available Everything okay? I have a client at 2:15, and my watcher just cancelled.
not_available Your watcher? He likes to be watched by another girl while I do him.
not_available It's the easiest $100 in the world and this asshole just blew me off for a runway audition.
not_available God, I hate models.
not_available Fuck.
not_available If you're sitting in the corner depressed, pick up.
not_available Pick up.
not_available All right, be depressed.
not_available Listen, if you're in a jam This isn't a science project, honey.
not_available This is business.
not_available Please.
not_available You think I can't handle it? Like I said, it's pretty easy.
not_available Actually, it's like you're invisible.
not_available Just sitting and watching.
not_available I can do that.
not_available I sit and watch all the time.
not_available In fact, that's mostly all I do.
not_available I guess you've been in three
not_available way situations before.
not_available I mean, who hasn't? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fuck.
not_available I've never seen you this angry before.
not_available It's terrific! 
not_available No, my nephew made that.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Here, talk to me.
not_available This girl cheated on the SATs, and now she's gonna get away with it.
not_available Okay, what's this girl's name? When I realized what was going on, I just wanted to run and not take the test.
not_available But I did.
not_available I took it, like an idiot.
not_available And what was the point? It's all just some stupid game.
not_available I don't know what I want, but I don't want this.
not_available And this is your excuse to bail? Bail? What's that? Some hip lingo you think kids say? 
not_available You are so lame sometimes.
not_available Direct your anger at me, if you need to.
not_available By the way, you can fuck Parker McKenna, but if I were you, I'd wear a condom because I'm sure she has hepatitis, at the very least.
not_available What are you talking about? If you're referring to the conversation I had with Parker, that's all it was.
not_available A conversation.
not_available I have conversations with lots of young women.
not_available They approach me.
not_available Claire, I'm worried about you.
not_available Why? You're getting your life together, and it scares you.
not_available So you want to slip into the old habit of focusing on someone else's drama instead of concentrating on yourself.
not_available You need to stop doing that.
not_available You're right.
not_available And now is probably as good a time as any to talk about the sexual tension between us.
not_available What? 
not_available It exists.
not_available It's a part of transference and counter
not_available transference so we should acknowledge it's out there, and it'll never be acted upon because to do so would be irresponsible and destructive.
not_available Do you have anything that you would like to contribute? No, I don't.
not_available Okay.
not_available I bet you I could glue this together if I tried hard.
not_available I know people don't really glue things together anymore but I could probably fix this.
not_available You've reached the private line of David Fisher.
not_available Please leave a message after the beep.
not_available Hi, David.
not_available It's Ben.
not_available I'm calling to figure out what time's good for you on Saturday.
not_available And I had a really good time last night, especially the making out part.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Yeah, honey.
not_available You know exactly how I like it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Move your tongue around it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I am telling you I'm not going I'm the best man you'll ever know There's no way I could ever go Nate, I love you! Now that I've heard this song five times in a row, I can honestly say I dislike it.
not_available I'm here for the service.
not_available Look around, nobody's here.
not_available There's not gonna be any service.
not_available I couldn't even get a minister, and they get paid.
not_available I've taken care of that.
not_available Father Jack is on his way here right now.
not_available Just give me 10 minutes.
not_available For what? Federico? 
not_available Yes, Mrs.
not_available F? Could you come upstairs, please? Keith? David, I need you for a few minutes.
not_available Mom, I have a headache.
not_available Too bad.
not_available But I'm in the middle of a show.
not_available Just do what I say! And get out of those ragamuffin clothes.
not_available Why is this happening? I don't know.
not_available Our structures probably need new fencing.
not_available And our roofs had bad shingles.
not_available I had shingles once.
not_available She was supposed to have an open casket.
not_available I did the best I could, okay? I didn't see you down there helping me out.
not_available Leave it alone.
not_available We gather to mourn the passing of Emily Previn.
not_available I did not know Emily Previn.
not_available &gt;From what I gather, few, if any, people did.
not_available People might wonder what point there is in leading a life where you don't touch any other lives.
not_available But it would be arrogant of us to assume that.
not_available Every life is a contribution.
not_available We just may not see how.
not_available I'm glad to encounter Emily Previn, even if it is in death.
not_available Everyone comes into our life for a reason and it is our responsibility to learn what they have to teach us.
not_available Now, in accordance with Emily's wishes I will read from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.
not_available Strange, but somehow I feel like Emily won.
not_available She remains a fucking question mark right up to the bitter end.
not_available Basically all I know about her is that she kept Wheat Thins in her refrigerator.
not_available That's something.
not_available So, tell your mother I have to get back to work.
not_available Unlike some people.
not_available I'm sorry, Federico, but I have a headache.
not_available Am I not allowed to have a headache? 
not_available It's so good to see you.
not_available Hello, Father.
not_available How is everything at St.
not_available Stephen's? It's okay.
not_available Apropos of what I said earlier, I wanted to thank you, David.
not_available I'm really glad you came into my life.
not_available You will never know how much you taught me about myself.
not_available Really? How so? Another time, maybe.
not_available You look a little sad.
not_available I have a headache.
not_available Well, God bless.
not_available David, come over here.
not_available There's something I want to say to the three of you.
not_available Oh, Lord, our gutters are clogged.
not_available I think we need to see about removing the leaves.
not_available That's very funny, Claire.
not_available I know you think the plan is ridiculous.
not_available No, we don't.
not_available We just think it's weird.
not_available Did any one of you wonder why I felt the need to change the structure of my life? Did you even care? At first I didn't understand why I was so upset about Emily Previn.
not_available Then it hit me.
not_available I don't want to turn into her.
not_available Life is hard enough without not having people to help you.
not_available But, Mom, you have us.
not_available I do not.
not_available Nate, you've been walking around like a zombie for months.
not_available You're lying in bed during the day, God knows why.
not_available I have a headache.
not_available Claire, I can't even look in your direction without you acting like it's some incredible imposition.
not_available All I want is for us not to be strangers.
not_available I want some intimacy.
not_available Give me intimacy.
not_available Won't any of you have intimacy with me? Okay, I guess I have my answer.
not_available Mom, wait.
not_available I just think that intimacy should happen a little more organically than this.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then I'll simply wait for it like I have been.
not_available I just pray that it happens before I end up like Emily Previn.
not_available Now, if you'll please excuse me.
not_available When I saw you typing at your computer, you had the strangest expression.
not_available I was writing.
not_available It's called flow.
not_available You know all about flow, don't you? Let me ask you a question.
not_available Do you think you and I have as much intimacy as you want? I don't have as much of anything as I want.
not_available That's not really much of an answer.
not_available It wasn't really much of a question.
not_available Did you remember to lock the door? Yes, I did, for the second time.
not_available You've been acting strange tonight.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Well, you've been all jumpy.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Okay, something has been on my mind.
not_available Nate Fisher would you be my wife? My God, this isn't what I was expecting.
not_available Is that a no? 
not_available No, of course not.
not_available It is kind of an ugly ring.
not_available It's got these Greek letters on it.
not_available Delta Phi Delta.
not_available It's my grandfather's fraternity ring.
not_available I found it when I was cleaning up and that's when I got the idea to propose to you.
not_available So why today? I don't know.
not_available I just started thinking I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.
not_available Well, I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Promise? Of course I'll marry you.
not_available I love you.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available I love you.
not_available Yeah, let's get married! Yes! Let's get married! Come on! I love you, too.
