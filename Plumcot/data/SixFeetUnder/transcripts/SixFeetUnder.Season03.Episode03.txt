
not_available Hey, baby! Where you goin with that ass! Come here, were talkin to you! Slow down, bitch! Hey, we just want to have a good time.
not_available You know you want some of this! Bitch, you know its gonna happen! Hey, Callie.
not_available Its just us! Goddammit, Zach! Oh, shit! Callie! Callie! Callie! Its only a paper moon Sailing over a cardboard sea But it wouldnt be make believe If you believed in me Yes, its only a canvas sky Hanging over a muslin tree But it wouldnt be make believe If you believed in me.
not_available Perfect! Thats exactly how I want it to sound in Pasadena.
not_available Uch! Thats just horrible! Baritones, someone among you was singing a B
not_available flat,  of all inappropriate notes.
not_available And, um, well, there was a certain tenor whos sharp on the Gnot_available not_available a lot.
not_available I can only pray to Jesus you know who you are, Evan! Lose the emotion, Dennis! Thats touching, but no one cares! Okay.
not_available Sadly for our audiences who have paid $25 to hear, we do not have time to work on that tonight.
not_available But please, and I am begging you from a place of raw desperation, learn your parts this weekend.
not_available For them, if not for me.
not_available Dismissed.
not_available Hey, are you going to Evans open house tomorrow? No.
not_available Id love to, but I cant.
not_available I promise, it wont be one of those sloppy scenes where everybody ends up naked in the pool, and you have to deal with image of their soggy pubic hair in your mind for the rest of your life.
not_available Well, thats good.
not_available Yeah, its just, Im going away.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, Im sure hell have another.
not_available I hope so, because Id really love to go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, see you next week.
not_available Shhh! Shut up.
not_available My mom is a really light sleeper.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That wasIt was a really great one.
not_available It was? Mmm.
not_available How were yours? Good.
not_available Just good? Both? It was just onenot_available but it was good.
not_available It was very good.
not_available I think we can do better.
not_available Are you tired? 
not_available Its really late.
not_available I was thinking Id sleep over.
not_available I dont knownot_available I guess.
not_available Is that cool? Yeah, fuck it.
not_available Dont go to the bathroom, though, cause my mom gets up to pee like 500 times a night! Now I have to pee.
not_available Just go out the window.
not_available Thats what Nate used to do when this was his room.
not_available Just try to avoid the avocado tree cause we eat those.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Almost there.
not_available My ass is killing me! Sciatica? No! Its used to being nestled in a nice soft car seat for this trip! I just love the fresh air! It smells a lot like dog crap.
not_available We had a little dog years ago, a terrier we got for Nate when I was pregnant for David so he wouldnt be jealous of the baby, yknow? Yippie, he called him.
not_available But he had some kind of a rare heart defect, so, the day we came home with David, Yippie crawled under Nates old bed and died! Thats how my last husband went.
not_available Heart defect.
not_available Jogged 5 miles every morning, then one daynot_available poof! Oh, thats awful! Thats better than with my first husband.
not_available Melanoma at 25.
not_available Then it was in and out of the hospital for 10 years.
not_available Chemo 3 times.
not_available That was hard.
not_available I really loved him.
not_available I really loved him.
not_available Im so sorry! When did you remarry? Wellnot_available there was one in between the two that died.
not_available He was just a dog.
not_available He tried to sleep with every single one of my girlfriends.
not_available He probably live to be a hundred! And screwing other peoples wives the whole time! Son of a bitch! Oh, Im so sorry.
not_available No, its okay.
not_available It is funny.
not_available I just never thought of myself as lucky having only buried one husband before.
not_available Lucky, unlucky.
not_available I dont know.
not_available Im unlucky I ran through 3 husbands.
not_available Im lucky I got to retire early off the insurance.
not_available Im unlucky my son set fire to the house.
not_available Im lucky I never had a urinary tract infection.
not_available I dont even care if it works out fair in the end.
not_available Im sure it doesnt.
not_available I still have to haul my own ass out of bed in the morning.
not_available I went to thisnot_available I took a kind of seminar that was about thatnot_available Oh, EST? Lifespring? The Plan? The Plan.
not_available My daughter was into that for years.
not_available She was a group leader.
not_available She inspired thousands of people to change their lives.
not_available Now, shes hoarding firearms in a compound in Montana.
not_available No! Shes always been very susceptible to group mentality.
not_available Maybe I couldve given her a stronger sense of self, but, you know, I did my best.
not_available Some things are just genetic.
not_available Well, what are you going to do? Cant you get some kind of a de
not_available programmer to go in and rescue her? You know what? Shes an adult.
not_available I mean, its her life now.
not_available Maybe I screwed her up, maybe I didnt.
not_available My son turned out fine.
not_available How are your kids? Finenot_available I think.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I have a job interview in two hours, and I have to shower.
not_available What kind of job? As an accountant for a chain of dry cleaners.
not_available Ive always been good with books.
not_available Oooh, sounds fun! Oh, I know.
not_available But I need the extra income, and its good for me to get out of the house.
not_available Youre out of the house right now! 
not_available Thats true.
not_available I think itd be better to go to breakfast.
not_available The French Marketplace has a 3.
not_available 99 special.
not_available She was running from a group of boys who were whistling, and she got scared that they werenot_available following her into a parking structure.
not_available Sonot_available she ran into the street.
not_available The car was speeding, it was darknot_available Im so sorry.
not_available Did they catch the boys? They were the ones who called the ambulance.
not_available They were her friends.
not_available Im sorry.
not_available I dont quite understand.
not_available They were just playing around.
not_available They were all in a state of shock that a woman could be terrified by a group of men chasing her at night.
not_available Of course you dont think its your friends! When they saw her running, they tried calling her name.
not_available But it was too late.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Im here with your cake.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Just pass it in here.
not_available Innot_available where? Are you okay? I just need to have my cake in a safe, white place today.
not_available Did something happen? I had a very upsetting conference call with Kate Hudsons people.
not_available Its unbelievably demeaning to have these little girls in their $800 shoes who grew up watching music videos telling me what a movie is.
not_available Ive been in this business for 20 years.
not_available Ive worked with Stallone, Ellen Barkin, Melanie fucking Griffith! My work is everything to me! I havent even had a life! No, Im on the fuckin set, dealing with everyone elses crisis! Roping in the director, firing the writer, wrangling the star! And who takes care of me? Who even wants to take care of me? That sounds really hard.
not_available Uch, its so bright out here! Careful, Lisa! These sheets are new from Pratesi! Do you have your cake towel? Its in here.
not_available Okay, Ill come back later for the cake plate.
not_available I still need my poopy shake at two.
not_available Right.
not_available Lisa, honey? Your husbands car was parked again in the driveway last night.
not_available I dont think he understands how much of a problem this is.
not_available He came home so late, Im sure he just thought you wouldnt need to get out.
not_available What if I did, though? You wouldve called us.
not_available No, I dont want to bother you in your private time at home! No! 
not_available Ill tell him.
not_available Its not that challenging to find street parking! Is it a snake? Or some kind of tropical vine? Its kind of a combination of Maori Ta Moko and also Japanese Kanji for, like, inner wisdom, I think.
not_available This, right here.
not_available Oh, my! I thought you were going to an interview.
not_available I decided that job wasnt really me.
not_available Well, theres eggs and bacon in the fridge, and I think there are still some frozen waffles.
not_available Yeah, theyve been there since like 1992.
not_available Thats not true! Theyre perfectly fresh.
not_available Ill take a waffle.
not_available Lets saynot_available youve just met someone, a month or so ago, and after a few weeks of exchanging messages, you finally get together for a nice activity, like a hike, for example, and you have a delightful time, and you think the other person did too.
not_available How long would you wait to call the person to set up another date? Who called who first? Is this another boyfriend? No, it is not! And I dont appreciate that tone.
not_available I did originally.
not_available Wait.
not_available Its his turn.
not_available Its really bad to be, like, begging for it.
not_available The waffles are in the toaster.
not_available Nice to meet you, dear.
not_available You dont want to eat those.
not_available I can make you some toast.
not_available Thats okay.
not_available Ill grab something on the way to work.
not_available Oh, do you want to see A Clockwork Orange tomorrow night? Ive never seen it, and Russell says its like mandatory viewing for all humans.
not_available I cant.
not_available Were playing at The Snell.
not_available Really? What time do you guys go on? We probably wont start till, like, 11not_available But it may not be that fun for you.
not_available I have these other friends coming who you dont knownot_available So, cant I meet them? I dontnot_available think you really want to.
not_available But Fridays awesome, if you want to see the movie then.
not_available No, its only tomorrow.
not_available Fridays Eyes Wide Shut.
not_available  Do you want to see that? I did.
not_available Okay, sonot_available well do something else.
not_available Private balconies, invigorating pool and Jacuzzis, gourmet cuisine, and an array of activities are just some of the pleasures awaiting our guests at the romantic refuge that is Los Lomos.
not_available I hope theres shuffleboard.
not_available Im serious! They had it at this place in Santa Barbara my parents used to take us when we were kids.
not_available I really had a knack for it.
not_available Its the only thing I could ever beat Nate at.
not_available The picturesque village nearby offers visitors sophisticated restaurants, art galleries, antique and specialty shops.
not_available I just want to sit by the pool and drink Pina Coladas all day.
not_available If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in thenot_available Whoops! Does that count? 
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available But I stopped! You owe me a dollar! 
not_available I stopped! All right, 50 cents.
not_available I should get a dollar every time you say the word calorie or ccarb.
not_available  How often do I say those? A lot! More than I sing.
not_available I dont think so.
not_available Whatcha doin? 
not_available Pumping.
not_available Thanks for helping me feel even sexier than I already do at this moment.
not_available Youre crazy.
not_available You couldnt be more beautiful.
not_available Youre like a fountain of life.
not_available Is she still sleeping? What, Carol slip in here and give her some cognac? Hardly.
not_available She missed her early nap because I had to use the blender all morning.
not_available Where did you park? 
not_available In the street.
not_available And she couldve totally gotten out this morning.
not_available Of course.
not_available The reality is, she has trouble driving in reverse, so it makes her nervous having cars in the driveway.
not_available she just doesnt want people to think she drives an American car.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Lets do our part for peace.
not_available Hi, homos!  Thats my son! You cant have him!  Fudgepackers!  Pillow biters!  God, I thought this was a family place!  Butt pirates!  Twinkle toes!  Faggoty
not_available ass faggots!  Heres some shade for you right here, honey.
not_available Oh, dont worry about him! He can sleep through a dirty bomb! 
not_available You dont have to get up.
not_available Please, I need the exercise.
not_available All weve done since weve gotten here is eat, and the foods not even that good.
not_available Oh, thats too bad.
not_available But I heard the girl who does the aqua hip
not_available hop class is terrific! If you can get yourself into the pool at 7:30 in the morning.
not_available Thanks for the tip.
not_available Im Sheila, by the way.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey, smile! So you ready for your Pina Colada? God, no.
not_available Then theyll really know were gay! We cant have that.
not_available I just think people here are a little uncomfortable with it.
not_available Oh, yeah? Like who? Wasnt that lady over there nice to you? Yes, we have an aerobics date tomorrow morning, and then afterwards were all going to the beauty parlor.
not_available Ill just take a beer.
not_available Not Lite.
not_available Hey, would you mind taking a picture of us? 
not_available No problem.
not_available Smile! Oh, no, Im glad you called.
not_available I was on the verge of getting an impulse haircut! Those never work out.
not_available Who do you use? I have to find someone new.
not_available I just go to Supercuts.
not_available You cant do that! Bettina! A womans hair is the gateway to her sensuality.
not_available Not the hair on her head, honey! What do you think? 
not_available I think you should try it on.
not_available No, no, its for you.
not_available thats not exactly my style.
not_available Sweetie, I say this with a heart full of love, but your style could use a tiny shot of adrenaline.
not_available I like a classic look.
not_available Try it.
not_available Just for fun.
not_available Niiiice! I dont know.
not_available Isnt it a little trendy? Are you kidding me? Its perfect! And 30% off! Okay, now try the gold silk number.
not_available Im so psyched for Valerie Doane.
not_available Her sculpture is amazing.
not_available You didnt hear? Shes not coming this semester.
not_available What do you mean? Thats the whole reason I took this course! Yeah, I know.
not_available You and everybody.
not_available But she got some kind of travel grant, so shes in Israel and now we have some other guy coming.
not_available That sucks! This place is fucking lame! Its just one class.
not_available I know, but nothings turning out to be as good as it looked in the catalog.
not_available Whos this other guy? Oliver Something Something.
not_available Its Olivier Castro
not_available Staal.
not_available Hes supposed to be awesome.
not_available Really? Cause I heard he was kind of on his own trip.
not_available Well, Valerie Doane is incoherent.
not_available I took a seminar with her at BAMF.
not_available It was garbage.
not_available Was that him? This is the wrong room! Are you here for Form in Space?? This is the right room.
not_available Its supposed to be a studio class.
not_available The catalog said lecture.
not_available  Well, thats bullshit.
not_available I dont do lectures, so this is going to be a studio class.
not_available If anyone needs a lecture for whatever reason people have for these things, then go now.
not_available I wont be offended.
not_available Oh, you can just talk.
not_available Umnot_available I need a lecture to balance out my course load.
not_available Okay.
not_available Were going to make art in this class.
not_available And in the end, Ill put lecture on the forms for people who need lecture and studio on the forms for people who need studio.
not_available And thats it.
not_available If this upsets your sense of order, then you can go now.
not_available I wont be offended.
not_available But go now, so we dont have to deal with ambivalence in this room.
not_available Ambivalence is poison for art.
not_available If I ever see anyone tormented over some decision, this way or that way, I will be offended and I will throw you out, for the sake of the class.
not_available Good.
not_available That was a bad vibe.
not_available Okay, there are no easels in this stupid room, so everyone get on the floor! Get on the floor! Do you have your drawing pads? We thought this was a lecture class.
not_available Take one and pass it.
not_available If you have a pencil, youre lucky.
not_available If you only have a pen, youre luckier.
not_available All right, you have five minutes to draw a picture of the day in your life that was the most horrible.
not_available Go! Wait, what do you mean, a picture of the day?? Go, I said! She juiced yet? Yeah, just about.
not_available Hey, you file that certificate? Claires gonna do it tomorrow.
not_available Stupid kids.
not_available Doesnt it seem like she really sort of panicked, though? Maybe something happened to her beforenot_available I dont know.
not_available You know, Vanessa gets scared all the time.
not_available Even when shes out with the kids, she gets it.
not_available Ask Lisa.
not_available Im not sure Lisa gets it that much.
not_available I mean, she doesnt wear high heels or tight skirts or anything.
not_available Vanessa says she gets it even when shes wearing her big fat sweatpants.
not_available But, you know, shes pretty hot.
not_available Lisas hot.
not_available Yeah, L
not_available Lisas hot.
not_available I just I dont want to talk about your wife like that.
not_available When does it stop sounding weird that someones your wife? Vanessa felt like my wife already when we were 16 years old.
not_available Hey, listen, Nate, the first year of marriage, for most people, is the hardest, especially with a baby on top, too.
not_available That can be tough for anyone.
not_available Its great.
not_available It is! Im totally into it! Alright, Im just sayingnot_available yknow, even if sometimes youre not.
not_available thats normal.
not_available Im into it.
not_available Come in.
not_available Are you feeling better? Youre a little late with this.
not_available I had to go and get more Psyllium.
not_available Oh, God! The babys here.
not_available Im sorry.
not_available We havent quite figured out the childcare thing.
not_available I tried to call Nates mom, but I guess she was hurt when I got so angry about the peanut butter, but it really could have made Maya sick Sweetie, Im sorry.
not_available You know I love your little girl, and Nates fine.
not_available But I just, I cant get into all this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Lets talk about dinner.
not_available Marlos assistant said she is only eating raw foods at the moment.
not_available I really feel that you are not being sensitive to me at all.
not_available Im sorry.
not_available I thought you wanted to talk about dinner.
not_available God, Lisa! I mean, Ive obviously had a very difficult morning, and youre all about your own agenda.
not_available I didnt meannot_available Youre rushing me through the menu so you can go deal with your baby.
not_available Shes fine.
not_available I dont have to deal with her at all right now.
not_available Well, I really felt it earlier when I was in a lot of pain, but the baby was crying, and that was clearly your priority.
not_available No one was watching her.
not_available That is not my problem! When I hired you for this job, you were totally unencumbered.
not_available And now, now theres Nate and his dirty car and the her! And her needs, and Nate and the baby have not affected my cooking at all.
not_available They have affected your ability to support me emotionally! And you live in my house! What do you suggest I do? Put Maya up for adoption? Oh, Ive discussed this with my therapist, and shes very concerned by the way that I allow you to treat me, because Oh my God! not_available I require, and I fucking deserve, a lot more attention, and you know what? I will not feel ashamed about that! If I had known you were hiring me to be your fucking wet nurse, I wouldve asked for health insurance! Where are you going? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa, goddammit! The moment was of when my friend ODed.
not_available Write down on a piece of paper your favorite artist.
not_available In fact, everyone do this.
not_available Is it Kandinsky? Lets see.
not_available Because youre using Kandinskys language here.
not_available Its the same with most of these drawings.
not_available We despise ourselves so much that we consider our own point of view as trivial, but thats bullshit! Thats your father talking, or whatever bad teachers you had before me.
not_available You, with the red hair, who did you write? Hopper? No.
not_available I wrote Modigliani.
not_available Were you lying? No, but I also wrote Nan Goldin, because Im really more into photography When did you see the Hopper show at MOCA? 
not_available Last week.
not_available Okay, thats exactly what Im saying.
not_available She sees 50 paintings by Hopper, she starts to draw like him, because its easier than drawing from the eye inside.
not_available Yeah, but artists get influenced by art.
not_available Thats part of the process.
not_available Until you locate the inside eye, its all bullshit.
not_available Its like a coloring book.
not_available Every work you make has to be a surprise to the Earth, a seeing that never happened before.
not_available Because its what happens when exactly what is inside of you confronts exactly what is outside of you.
not_available Okay, next.
not_available Definitely! And the black suit, and the cocktail dress.
not_available Oh, Im not buying anything.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Nothing was perfect.
not_available Nothing in life is perfect.
not_available Well, that makes it easy to stay within a budget.
not_available If you dont buy this black suit, Im gonna buy it for you! That is the sweetest thing Ive ever heard! But Id just return it and give you the money.
not_available Fine! Im gonna go back for the sandals.
not_available Where did you find this? Oh, just leave that there.
not_available Theyll take care of it for you.
not_available I know, but it seems so rude.
not_available Wonderful color for you! How much? Too much.
not_available What are you doing? Its one of my little pleasures.
not_available Its only fair.
not_available If theyre gonna charge $350 for a piece of fabric that costs $20 to make, they should lose a few! Do you want one? I certainly do not! It would be a great help to me if you tried to look a little less suspicious.
not_available Fortunately, women our age are invisible, so we can really get away with murder.
not_available What? I dont want to go to this stupid fiesta barbecue.
not_available Oh, come on, itll be fun.
not_available Whats fun about standing around a pool with a bunch of straight people shaking maracas? Theres gonna be a mariachi band.
not_available Why cant there be just one other gay couple? Some lesbians from the Bay Area? Hey, that kid in the pool was gay.
not_available The 11year
not_available old? Oh, David, relax! Youre letting this matter too much.
not_available Well, Im sorry, but sometimes I just get exhausted by the running commentary in my head all day long about how to be.
not_available Is this shirt too tight?  lls that gesture too flamboyant?  Who am I offending just by being here?  Maybe youre beyond all that, but I wouldve thought youd at least understand.
not_available It would just be nice on vacation to not have to deal with that.
not_available So dont.
not_available Offend people! Who cares? We paid for our room, right? I cant just turn it on and off.
not_available Well, maybe you should try.
not_available No one gets a break from their reality, ya know? Mexican food gives me the runs.
not_available And what about what Frank said? It makes me feel like I have the runs.
not_available No, about us being less isolated.
not_available Im not doing a limbo contest.
not_available Thats Hawaiian.
not_available Well, good.
not_available But if there is one, youd be a fool not to enter it.
not_available You know youd win that thing.
not_available It makes you look 20.
not_available Get it.
not_available Do I want to look 20? Okay, it makes you look 30! For $15, I could buy a bag of groceries.
not_available Oh, yeah? But a bag of groceries doesnt make you want to look at yourself! Excuse me? Excuse me? Id like to get this.
not_available Flirtation.
not_available  Let me see if we have any left.
not_available Its very popular.
not_available We may be out.
not_available Oh, she found it! No, no, sorry, wrong one.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available Were all sold out.
not_available Oh, all right then.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Bye.
not_available David! Salsa! Come on! Well, what do we want to do for dinner? Go to that cheesy town? Its just a bunch of outlet malls and chain restaurants.
not_available The room service menu looked like heaven.
not_available Good, lets go.
not_available And if we dont have to drive, we can get really drunk! Whats going on? I quit.
not_available We have to move.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoanot_available what? I would rather live on the street and beg for rice with a bowl than spend one more night under this roof! All right, what, what happened? She just unleashed so much insanity at us.
not_available Its not good for Maya to be around that kind of hostile dementia.
not_available If thats what Id wanted for her, Id be living with my mother! Im not sure Mayas really that in touch with Shes very absorbent! Okay.
not_available I kind of wish we could have talked this through before you quit.
not_available Did you actually quit? Yes, I actually quit! We have to leave tomorrow morning! So, what were you thinking, that wed go stay at my moms, I guess? Well, yeah, for now.
not_available Its not the worst thing that could ever happen, is it? No.
not_available Its not the best thing that ever happened either.
not_available Im sorry.
not_available I snapped.
not_available My humanity just rose up.
not_available Come here.
not_available Its alright.
not_available OH MY GOD! These walls are like paper.
not_available So fucking what? Were on vacation, dammit! YEAH, WERE GAY IN HERE! COME ON, COWBOY! BRING IT ON HOME! WAHOO! WERE HAVING SOME HOT MANON
not_available MAN LOVE ACTION! HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! Hold it, hold it, hold it.
not_available You sing, I sing.
not_available BABY, EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT/UPTIGHT, OUT OF SIGHT IM A POOR MANS SON FROM ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS THE ONLY SHIRT I HAVE IS HANGING ON MY BACK BUT IM THE ENVY OF EVRY SINGLE GUY CAUSE IM THE APPLE OF MY MANS EYE HE SAYS BABY, EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHTnot_available Oh, youre losing your pillow.
not_available Oh, dammit! Would you be careful? Sorry.
not_available Lisa, youre carrying too much.
not_available Its fine.
not_available I just didnt realize how tall it was.
not_available I dont know how much of Davids furniture you need, but he has some lovely pieces stored in the garage.
not_available We dont really have anything, just that rocking chairnot_available Its a much better space than Carols.
not_available Its bigger.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Theres no kitchen.
not_available I told Lisa, youre welcome to cook in the house whenever youd like.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It wont be for too long, Ruth.
not_available Im happy to have you.
not_available Ruth, you can pick her up.
not_available Thats nice lipstick, Mom.
not_available Why, thank you, dear.
not_available Its new.
not_available When youre done, put down your charcoal.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is it.
not_available Can you see why this is good? Because its in her own language.
not_available Yes, but the way I tell if something is good isnot_available does it make me want to throw up? This drawing instantly makes me feel nauseous.
not_available You can tell if something is truthful, even if you dont understand it, if it affects your body.
not_available Your liver and your bowels are more important as an artist than your eyes, because they are so far away from your brain.
not_available I dont know.
not_available I think it seems kind of obvious.
not_available Because youre embarrassed by yourself.
not_available In the beginning, if you hate something, its good, because you dont recognize the beauty of your own truth.
not_available Youre used to being a normal, pathetic human who does only what other people want.
not_available But what the other people really want is to fuck you and to make money off of you and to hang you in the living room with the fancy security system.
not_available Like this! Who did you make this to please? Me? Your mother, your boyfriend? Does anyone feel sick from this? No! So who the fuck cares? Im a friend of Callies.
not_available And I was there, the nightnot_available she died.
not_available I wanted to speak, because I really loved her, and I wanted to talk about who she was to menot_available and to us.
not_available Which is this brave, brazen, totally heroic person.
not_available This rock climbing, body surfing, back talking, truthor
not_available dare champion.
not_available I never even once saw her scarednot_available before.
not_available I guess what I really want to say to her isnot_available we were just pretending to be this thing that were not, I dont think, and then she was this thing that shes notnot_available Im sorry.
not_available But when she saw that it was us, she had this look like, How could this be you?  Mrs.
not_available Mortimer? Im sorry, butnot_available I just didnt know what to say.
not_available What? The mother, Mrs.
not_available Mortimer, yknow? I justI dontI didnt know what to say to her.
not_available You didnt really have to say anything.
not_available I didnt.
not_available Yeah, but, likenot_available hug her? Dont hug her, yknow? I freeze up.
not_available You cant think about it.
not_available You just have to really be there with them.
not_available Justnot_available be present.
not_available I dont think I can.
not_available Sure you can.
not_available No.
not_available Downstairs, yknow, its just a body.
not_available But up here, like this young girl, yknow, shes someones sister and someones daughter, and I cant help but to think, Well, what if it was Julio? Or Vanessa, even? Yknow, and I just cantnot_available You dont ever think, What if it was Maya? What if it was Lisa?  I dont, actually.
not_available Not them.
not_available I cant bring them in here with me, ya know? I just want them to be whats good about life.
not_available That way I can come here and deal with what isnt.
not_available That way I can come here and deal with what isnt.
not_available Well, youre lucky, then.
not_available So howd it go last night? Awesome.
not_available I mean, we screwed up a lot, but no one noticed.
not_available It was fucking loud.
not_available Everyone was walking around with, like, cocktail napkins in their ears.
not_available So, listen, I kind of want to talk about this whole seeing other people thing.
not_available Im not that into it.
not_available I meannot_available it makes me feel weird, you know, its likenot_available if people are into each other, then that should be pretty much enough, yknow? At some point, yeah.
not_available What do you mean? Like when it gets really serious or whatever.
not_available Well, when does that usually happen for you? It depends.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, how about, like, after a couple of months? You mean like us, now? Yeah.
not_available I dont know.
not_available I mean, do you? Well, yeah, thats what Im saying.
not_available Its just not really my thing to like sleep around.
not_available Im not sleeping around.
not_available I just mean, Im kind of a like oneata
not_available time sexual person, I think.
not_available Sonot_available what do you think? I dont think Im there.
not_available Just not at this exact point in time.
not_available Well, why not? Is it cause you like someone else better? No! So totally not! Its justnot_available it kind of has to be more organic for me, like not some kind of contract or whatever.
not_available It has to evolve.
not_available But Im not saying it wont.
not_available It so totally could.
not_available Well, not for me.
not_available Not when its like You cant come hear me play because theres some other girl thats gonna be there.
not_available  Yeah.
not_available Sonot_available thats like it for you? I guess.
not_available Well, can I have a hug or something? No.
not_available Im just gonna go.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Nothing.
not_available Just watching this.
not_available Okay, but you can watch with us.
not_available Isnt Maya sleeping? Yeah, but she doesnt mind the TV, if its low, and I have a million things I need to ask you.
not_available Like what? Like, when do you want to do the child
not_available proofing? And how should we deal with Maya while I look for a job? Because I dont even know how to start thinking about Then dont.
not_available Not yet, just take a break.
not_available Were not paying rent.
not_available Yeah, but we cant stay here forever.
not_available Not forever, but we can relax for a few days, cant we? Oh, also I need to talk to you about vaccinating.
not_available Ive downloaded a ton of information from the Internet, and Im still really against it, but..
not_available you havent really weighed in.
not_available God knows your mother wants it.
not_available Okay, print it out.
not_available Ill take a look at it later tonight.
not_available Are you coming? Uh, okay, yeah.
not_available I do, I want to hear it! Elton Johns Rocket Man.

not_available  Miss my life.
not_available  Its lonely out in space.
not_available  Thats me! You sound good.
not_available Yes, I happen to have a very nice voice.
not_available Well, did I ever say you didnt? Well, practically.
not_available I just dont like it when you sing at me.
not_available And I think its gonna be a long, long time Till touchdown brings me round again to find.
not_available Im not the man they think I am at home Oh, Im a rocket man Rocket man, burning out a fuse up here alone.
not_available Oh, shit! Were supposed to be going against traffic.
not_available There might be an accident.
not_available It looks like it might be picking up.
not_available Not much.
not_available Who knows when were gonna get home now? I knew we shouldnt have stopped for food.
not_available Its lucky we did.
not_available Were going to get home too late to make anything now.
not_available Its not my fault! You had to spend an hour at the Mikasa outlet store.
