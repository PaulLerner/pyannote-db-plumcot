
not_available Saison 5 Episode 7 "The Silence" We should have gone to Toscana Instead of seeing this stupid play.

not_available He's usually a very private person.
not_available I'm not going to go find him afterwards.
not_available And tell him what a brilliant director he is.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Why do people invite anybody to anything ? 
not_available I have no idea.

not_available Nonsense.
not_available Matryona will feed him.
not_available It's a shame.
not_available Three nights now without his mother.
not_available You are becoming tiresome.
not_available In the old days, at least you'd philosophize, But now it's always home and by, home and baby.
not_available That's all I ever hear from you.
not_available Let's go, Masha !

not_available Are you okay ? What's wrong ? I'm sorry to bother you.
not_available I didn't know who else to call.
not_available That's okay.
not_available What's going on ? Who is it ? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available David, I can't find the sports section.
not_available Have you seen it anywhere ? 
not_available No.
not_available The delivery guy probably forgot to put it in again.
not_available He stinks.
not_available Then I'm out of here.
not_available I'm gonna be late for Roger's.
not_available That's fine.
not_available I have everything under control here.
not_available Hand it over ! 
not_available You know I hope you've been noticing how much I've been watching my temper.
not_available I am really trying to be patient, 
not_available But those boys are not easy.
not_available Yes, I know they're not easy.
not_available And if I forget you remind me once a day.
not_available Would you listen to him ? He's just a sweet little kid, basically.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available oh yeah yeah ! Yeah, yeah.
not_available Durrell, what the hell are you doing now ? Watching TV ! 
not_available David, turn that off ! I can't find the remote.
not_available I can never find the remote ! Where did you find those ? Those tapes were in a locked box underneath pile of old Ralph Lauren sheets 
not_available Underneath our bed.
not_available Then you know where I found them.
not_available Durrell, from now on when something is in a locked box Underneath a pile of old sheets, that means it's private.
not_available Fine.
not_available Great.
not_available Can we get ready for school ? 
not_available We're gonna be really late again.
not_available Shit.
not_available I mean, shoot.
not_available Get dressed, you guys.
not_available Come on.
not_available Now.

not_available Hey, johnny, you coming ? 
not_available Yeah, baby.
not_available How about it, Claire ? Hang on, I just have to finish this one thing.
not_available There.
not_available Yeah, a bunch of us are going to doc's after work.
not_available The bar inhe mall ? Doc hannigan's ? That's just 'cause it's the closest place, And they have pitchers.
not_available Everyone from work goes there.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to Come on, Claire.
not_available You think your shit don't stink ? No, I think my shit stinks.
not_available Great.
not_available So you coming then ? Maybe another time.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available I guess we'll just have to talk about you all night.
not_available Yeah, baby.
not_available There's something nice about being alone.
not_available It's like finally I can just relax.
not_available I made George the focus of my life.
not_available First when we got married, and then even more so when he got sick.
not_available It's just not healthy, right ? One person's "healthy" is another person's "sick.
not_available " Some women have to make someone else the focus of their life Or they lose their minds.
not_available No judgments.
not_available It's an exciting time for me.
not_available There's a world out there I've been missing.
not_available Are you managing to keep yourself busy ? 
not_available Am I ever.
not_available There are so many cultural events in this city I've always wanted to participate in.
not_available Last week, I learned all about cabbala at the skirball center.
not_available And dutton's in brentwood is having a jay mcinerney reading the day after next.
not_available Now who's that ? 
not_available He's the guy who wrote "bright lights, big city.
not_available " I knew his old coke dealer.
not_available Sweet guy.
not_available It's the 20th anniversary of that book.
not_available I figured it was time for me to finally read it.
not_available Oh, Victoria, you get together is tomorrow night already
not_available Don't worry, everyone's invited.
not_available Do you need anything ? I could bring my famous potato salad.
not_available That's sweet, but please don't worry.
not_available Everything's taken care of.
not_available So it's between this one and this one.
not_available Which one do you like better ? 
not_available I like this one.
not_available Yeah ? But 
not_available This one's nice too.
not_available Exactly ! Oh, they're both great.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hello ? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So have you decided ? I'll come back sometime.
not_available I didn't have this appointment in the books.
not_available Maggie called me in the middle of the night.
not_available The deceased is a friend of hers from church.
not_available Maggie is a quaker ? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available George was a quaker ? 
not_available No no.
not_available She converted when she got married.
not_available What exactly are quakers ? They're very peaceful Yeah well, everyone knows that.
not_available Have you seen Rico ? 
not_available He said he had something important to do.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available Hello ? Obviously these are not the results we expected.
not_available But there's no reason to assume the worst.
not_available The blood test was positive, Which indicates potentially that the baby may have some sort of disorder Like what ? Such as down's or Spina Bifida.
not_available However, this test is extremely inconclusive.
not_available Over 95% of babies who test positive have neither of these two things.
not_available So what's the point of it then ? To get more information.
not_available Given these results I recommend we do an amniocentesis.
not_available I didn't even want to take the stupid test.
not_available Everyone said it would be fine.
not_available I want to schedule the amnio for as soon as possible.
not_available No need to panic yet.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing home ? I made up a story and got off of work for a few hours "Cause" I knew it was your day off.
not_available Day off, right.
not_available I went grocery shopping, cleaned up the kitchen And I'm the middle of my fourth load of laundry.
not_available It's been a real party.
not_available You don't look busy now.
not_available This is my first chance to get a breath.
not_available I'm reading.
not_available Rico ? Yeah ? What are you doing ? 
not_available Trying to relax you.
not_available I can relax myself.
not_available As long as you're here you can take out your stuff in the back closet Like you said you would three days ago.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sure.
not_available I don't know why you wouldn't go out with those people.
not_available Sometimes you think you're better than everyone else.
not_available hopefully I am.
not_available Well, you're not.
not_available Anyway, I'm exhausted.
not_available I had no idea doing nothing all day could be so tiring.
not_available When I was your age I had so much energy.
not_available Besides, I want to try to do some work tonight.
not_available Oh, what are you working on now ? Actually, nothing.
not_available I am totally dry.
not_available I haven't even been to my desk in weeks, Because every time I sit down and try to think Of how I want to express myself I just come up empty.
not_available It's like this giant abyss With total, like, stillness.
not_available It's kind of the loneliest feeling in the entire world.
not_available Oh.
not_available Well, uh, you'd better hurry up and change.
not_available Dinner will be ready soon.
not_available Those stupid telemarketers ! You know, I'm gonna become more involved In those organizations that get them outlawed.
not_available Hello ! Oh, hello, George.
not_available "Come over tonight" ? No.
not_available I don't see why this Fine.
not_available I'm very busy, But I'll try and stop by tomorrow afternoon.
not_available I'm sorry, George.
not_available I can't chat now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available Is he okay ? 
not_available I'm sure he's fine.
not_available Whatever's going on with him I'm not gonna get sucked into it.
not_available I have my own life now.
not_available Maybe he's just lonely.
not_available You seem a lot more sympathetic to him now Than you did when he was living here.
not_available It's always easier to be nice to people When you don't have to see them.
not_available You don't even know what a integer is.
not_available I do so.
not_available * yada yada yada * * yada yada yada * I mean, I have a basic idea of what an integer is.
not_available Integers are numbers * blah blah blah * Am I in trouble ? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available But maybe you should listen to your music in the other room.
not_available I'll just stay here and be quiet.
not_available Okay, where were we ? Integers
not_available David ? I thought you said you were gonna be quiet.
not_available I think something's burning.
not_available Fuck ! All right, it was wrong of me to say that.
not_available We don't use language like that.
not_available Can I get that ? 
not_available Of course, durrell, you live here now.
not_available You don't have to ask if you can get the phone.
not_available Hello ? Oh, hey.
not_available It's your lover.
not_available Do I have a lover ? From now on you can just say it's Keith.
not_available Yes, master.
not_available Durrell, I told you I don't like that joke.
not_available Give me my discman ! Ouch ! You're hurting me ! Both of you, out of here, now ! Just get out of this room ! You boy ! 
not_available You half a man.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm not gonna make it for dinner.
not_available Sissy and the kids are in town.
not_available I've got to take them to Geoffrey's in Malibu.
not_available Well, lahDiDah ! 
not_available What's that supposed to mean ? You know what ? Nothing.
not_available I'm just in the middle of five things here.
not_available You have fun you know and I'll see you later.
not_available I hate you, you pig.
not_available You smell like cow manure.
not_available What are you doing ? I was just cleaning things up.
not_available You were reading my private stuff.
not_available I thought we had rules about other people's private stuff ! She suffered from of self
not_available Esteem issues, dr.
not_available Benett ? Yes, a lot of those stem from her childhood traumas.
not_available But some stem from the size of her nose and her weak chin.
not_available Those are the ones i can do something about.
not_available Are you pleased with the results ? I am, but mary's going to be the real judge When she looks into the mirror for first time tonight.
not_available Oh, you didn't tell me what time i need to get off work tomorrow.
not_available Just come home whenever you want.
not_available No, I mean did you hear what time we're supposed to go in for the The amnio.
not_available I've been thinking I don't really think the amnio's such a good idea.
not_available Well, melnick seemed to think it was.
not_available She acted like we had to have it.
not_available no no, she said the results were very inconclusive.
not_available I think we should just move on and try not to think about it.
not_available But I thought we decided that we were gonna
not_available No, I didn't decide anything.
not_available I don't want an amnio.
not_available You know, they can cause miscarriage.
not_available What are we gonna do ? 
not_available Well, we wait for later, ultrasound, And then we get more information.
not_available But if there's a problem we should know about it now.
not_available Why ? 
not_available So that we can take care of it.
not_available What does that mean ? 
not_available You know what that means.
not_available I don't want to get rid of this baby.
not_available And I'm not going to no matter what.
not_available If we find out there's a problem, we'll deal with that then.
not_available Okay, if that's how you feel.
not_available Yeah, that's how I feel.
not_available Is it how you feel ? I don't know.
not_available So what's the big deal ? Durrell's in some assembly and he didn't invite us.
not_available So what ? So we're his parents, keith.
not_available We're supposed to go see him in school things.
not_available What did he say when you asked him why he didn't invite us ? Uh, he just mumbled something about killing us If we tried to go to it.
not_available Well, maybe we should listen to him and not go.
not_available i couldn't sleep all night Thinking about having all this porn in the house.
not_available Shit ! Just help me, you asshole.
not_available okay.
not_available What's his reason for not wanting us to go to the assembly ? This one we're keeping.
not_available Do you think it's because we're gay and he's ashamed of us ? He's not the one that's ashamed about us being gay.
not_available This is not about being gay, it's about porn.
not_available It's probably something as simple As he doesn't want us there to see him forget his lines And get that dumbass look that kids get on their face in those things.
not_available Maybe.
not_available We better get going.
not_available We've got other huge bag in the back.
not_available Federico Can you tell me if this mayonnaise has gone bad ? All mayonnaise smells bad to me.
not_available Making your potato salad, huh ? What's the big occasion ? I'm going to a party tonight
not_available At victoria adams's house.
not_available She was in "more for me.
not_available " 
not_available Oh yeah, I saw that show once or twice.
not_available It seemed sort of stupid.
not_available She's a friend of mine.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available So, uh, how are things with you now ? Now that you're, you know, single ? They're wonderful.
not_available I've been to a lot of interesting cultural events lately.
not_available In fact, if you want to, You could come to a jay mcinerney reading with me tomorrow.
not_available Oh I'll take a pass.
not_available I've got be with vanessa and the kids.
not_available I understand.
not_available Do you think this has too much dill ? You must be very happy now that you're back with vanessa.
not_available Vanessa's a very forgiving woman.
not_available Actually, she isn't.
not_available She never wants to sleep with me.
not_available No matter what I do or say i can't get her to look at me With that same hunger she used to have.
not_available It's so painful.
not_available The most horrible part is when I look at her, I still get so fucking hard.
not_available You know, masturbating can relieve some of the tension.
not_available There were long periods in my marriage to nathaniel When he was constantly masturbating.
not_available I want passion ! I want my wife to want me so bad that every time I walk by She wants to squeeze my ass and grab my
not_available Federico ? Uh, yeah.

not_available Oh, he's this brilliant therapist Who studied with gareth feinberg.
not_available Actually, you know what ? I think you met him once a long time ago.
not_available Anyways, so we ran into each other at a party a couple of weeks ago.
not_available And, you know, one thing led to the other.
not_available You know how that is.
not_available No, not really.
not_available Come on, don't judge me, dear.
not_available God, I wonder if anybody else saw us.
not_available What's the big deal ? Don't you and olivier have rules Like you and dad did ? Oh, if only olivier were that emotionally mature.
not_available No, he has some very antiquated ideas about relationships.
not_available Yeah, well, people are strange.
not_available Darling, let's try and have some nice girl time, shall we ? Isn't that why you called ? Yeah, I guess so.
not_available So, I've been thinking this baby is going to wreak havoc on your body.
not_available Let me give you the number of this brilliant gyrotonic trainer Who will just change your life.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available So that's the end of the walk
not_available Through.
not_available Don't worry about tomorrow.
not_available We will take care of everything.
not_available Uh, one more thing
not_available There isn't going to be another funeral in the other room ? No, of course not.
not_available I can assure you you won't hear anything During your silent centering time.
not_available Except a few grumbling tummies, I suppose.
not_available Oh, mrs.
not_available Burns, if you wouldn't mind signing Some of those forms I told you about Of course.
not_available "Silent centering time" ? Silent worship.
not_available We believe that god is within all of us.
not_available If we get together and are silent Hopefully we each hear something from god.
not_available What if you don't ? You make something up.
not_available At least I do.
not_available How do you
not_available How do you know god's not telling you what to make up ? Nate, is something wrong ? Are you sure you don't want anything ? I had an enormous sandwich for lunch.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available You didn't happen to read Paul krugman's editorial this morning, did you ? He had this marvelous take on bush
not_available George, why did you want to see me ? This, uh, period of being alone Has been very difficult for me, ruth.
not_available Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking
not_available I'm not getting back together with you.
not_available I know that.
not_available I just wanted to talk to you about getting a divorce.
not_available Well, of course that's what I want too.
not_available Apparently, we just have to live for six months In separate residences, then file some papers.
not_available I think we should get a quicker divorce.
not_available I've been doing some research, And if one of us flies to, say, haiti for the weekend We can take care of this thing a lot sooner.
not_available Is this really necessary ? 
not_available I think it will be healthier For our psyches if we just, you know, move on.
not_available You want to fly to haiti for a quickie divorce just for our psyches ? Ruth I'm engaged.
not_available Her name is joy solomon.
not_available I met her at a tea at dean kekalos's house.
not_available She's a women's studies professor, visiting this semester.
not_available We were both raised in missouri.
not_available I guess I should have expected this.
not_available Boy, I am some fool all right.
not_available Listen, I know how this must sound to you, but I'm in love.
not_available I think I should go.
not_available Do you want to talk about your feelings ? Strangely enough, i don't think I have any.
not_available Goodbye, george.
not_available First off, the chances are that everything's going to be okay with this baby.
not_available But even if it's not It could still be okay.
not_available How can you of all people say that ? When the doctors first told me that jesse was sick I was so scared.
not_available We had to give him all these shots That made him scream.
not_available And then there were all the useless operations.
not_available But, nate All the horrible things don't take away from what he gave me.
not_available the first time that jesse laughed ? He used to He used to get so excited to look at the moon.
not_available He was only two, But he was a person.
not_available An amazing person.
not_available And he was here such a short time, I feel just incredibly lucky that I got to know him.
not_available It made me a bigger person.
not_available And that's something all children do.
not_available You guys don't want your parents going to school things, right ? Not really.
not_available Mom always tries to get the teachers to validate her parenting.
not_available And dad always slobbers over mr.
not_available Janetti, the guy who teaches shop.
not_available I knew I was right.
not_available David thinks that we should go to durrell's assembly against his will.
not_available But you agree with me ? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available It sounds like durrell is trying to assert his individual identity.
not_available At least for now.
not_available Gradually he'll come to have some familial identity.
not_available The important thing is not to force it.
not_available Let him initiate at his own pace.
not_available I've got write these things down for david.
not_available Oh, don't worry.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Oh, um thanks.
not_available All right, kirsten, meet me at the elevator.
not_available First, I have to go potty.
not_available Yeah, baby.
not_available Hey, johnny, you coming ? Yeah, baby.
not_available But I'll meet you there.
not_available Uh, johnny ? 
not_available Hey, have a good night, claire.
not_available Oh, I was wondering, are you guys going to doc's ? Ruth ! I'm so glad you could make it.
not_available I really want you to meet my friend mitchell.
not_available And what is this ? 
not_available It's nothing.
not_available I just
not_available Your famous potato salad.
not_available Now I remember.
not_available I told you not to bring anything, you devil.
not_available Here.
not_available Let's just put it here with everything else.

not_available Nonsense.
not_available Let's just push this stuff aside.
not_available There.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Now start mingling.
not_available No one's gonna bite you.
not_available Well, maybe if you're lucky someone will.
not_available You know, I'm really not drawn to mechanical animals.
not_available Me neither.
not_available I'm actually not really drawn to live animals.
not_available So are you seeing anyone ? Oh, I was living with this guy for a while.
not_available What happened ? Uh, we broke up.
not_available And now I hear he's left town.
not_available Probably to go to some overpriced loony bin.
not_available He's kind of a nutjob.
not_available I don't know why I just said that.
not_available He's a great guy.
not_available He's really unique.
not_available And the whole thing was just
not_available I don't think I was ready for something real, Like something with challenges.
not_available And he was in a different place than me.
not_available He's a little older.
not_available I'm seeing an older guy.
not_available Actually, he's just a year and half older.
not_available Really ? What's he do ? Lawyer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available From the office.
not_available We're trying to keep it quiet.
not_available Oh my god.
not_available Who is he ? What ? Ted ? I've never seen you two together.
not_available Oh, well, we're trying to be cool about it.
not_available I mean it's still sort of new.
not_available See we hooked up at hong fu's birthday party in november, Then we didn't talk for like a month.
not_available Then we were both here a couple of weeks ago And ended up fooling around in the guys' bathroom.
not_available It's really rank in there.
not_available So now you're dating ? I think we will be soon.
not_available We just need to take it to that next place As soon as he deals with some of his intimacy issues.
not_available Sure.
not_available I get it.
not_available I really should watch more sitcoms.
not_available I keep meaning to, but i never know when they're on.
not_available I just did a spot on the new jennifer love hewitt show.
not_available Sweet girl.
not_available Well, uh, mitchell Yeah.
not_available Ruth ! You look so forlorn standing here all alone.
not_available Let's circle and see if we can find some nice quirky guy for you.
not_available Thanks, cindy.
not_available But I don't think so.
not_available Oh, come on, ruth.
not_available It'll be fun.
not_available No, it won't be fun.
not_available I am seven million years old.
not_available And I have this emptiness that won't go away.
not_available I've gone everywhere and I've done everything.
not_available I even went to the stupid skirball center.
not_available And I am still all alone.
not_available Everyone else gets to find someone just like that.
not_available So I'm done.
not_available That's it ! I just want to be left alone so i can shrivel up in peace.
not_available Please ! Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah, baby ! Yeah, baby ! Yeah, baby ! Claire ! 
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available I've been doing some research on you.
not_available Oh, really ? Yeah, I heard you're, like, this amazing artist, Had a show and everything.
not_available That's pretty impressive.
not_available Oh, I think you have me confused with someone else.
not_available Really ? I don't think so.
not_available So what are you, like, some guy who always knew he wanted to be a lawyer ? To tell you the truth, it was just the easiest path for me.
not_available I like being a lawyer.
not_available It's just one part of my life though.
not_available Sounds interesting.
not_available If you're really interested, Maybe some time I could show you the other parts.
not_available I should be getting back to the table.
not_available Do you want to join us ? I should get back to my friends.
not_available I don't care what those two freaks of nature said.
not_available I am going to this assembly tomorrow, and that's that.
not_available Why ? 
not_available Because it's important.
not_available Kids should look out into the audience And have someone rooting for them.
not_available You know when I was in seventh grade i was a sailor in "anything goes.
not_available " I know.
not_available You bring it up once a week.
not_available well, my mother came but my father didn't.
not_available Why not ? 
not_available Plane crash.
not_available He had to deal with a whole family that died.
not_available We had this ritual in my family That whenever one of us was in a thing at school We would always go to marie callender's for boston cream pie after.
not_available I hate boston cream pie.
not_available anyway, we went without him but it wasn't the same.
not_available I still say tate and enzo have a point.
not_available Of course you do.
not_available What's that supposed to mean ? Keith, you'll seize on anything Not to be a parent to these two kids.
not_available You're barely here.
not_available I have to work.
not_available When you are here, you hardly talk to them.
not_available I'm not allowed to.
not_available You made sure of that.
not_available I just don't want you to yell at them.
not_available That doesn't mean you have to avoid them.
not_available This whole thing sucks.
not_available I'm doing this all alone Without getting any credit for being a single parent.
not_available Fine.
not_available Then you can go by yourself tomorrow Because I think it's the wrong thing to do.
not_available Don't you feel anything for these poor kids ? Don't you have a soul ? 
not_available Of course I have a soul.
not_available That's a terrible thing to say about your partner.
not_available Yeah, well, it's a terrible thing to feel about your partner.
not_available That was amazing.
not_available That's nice, sweetie.
not_available That's okay.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available What do you mean ? Don't you wanna come ? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm good.
not_available Okay.
not_available So now my mother is fucking this guy once a week after his gestalt seminar.
not_available Don't you thin she's depressing ? Not really.
not_available What's depressing is her being with some asshole Who pontificates about art all the time.
not_available I think it's great your mother's having a good time.
not_available What about penelope ? Who's penelope ? A name for the baby if it's a girl.
not_available I don't really feel like talking about baby names right now.
not_available Well, is there something you want to talk about ? Yes ! I hate the name penelope.
not_available Penelope's pretentious.
not_available "Penelope thinks she's so great when she's not.
not_available " I don't even know anybody who'd want a penelope.
not_available You're really mad at me, aren't you ? oh, spare me.
not_available You want me to go to a doctor, make sure everything's all right with the baby.
not_available And if it isn't, you want me to kill it ? Jesus, you don't have to put it that way.
not_available Well ? 
not_available Yes, that's what I want.
not_available And I don't see what's wrong with that.
not_available We can try again.
not_available I was just talking with maggie, And she was telling me how difficult it is And how many sacrifices she had to make when her child was sick.
not_available How many financial problems she and her husband ended up having.
not_available And just how fucking hard it is.
not_available Did she regret having him ? 
not_available Look, that is not the point.
not_available Why not ? Because you and I aren't Maggie, she's better than we are.
not_available What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? And what about maya ? Bringing a sick child into the house Would be very difficult for her.
not_available It's not fair.
not_available I mean, did you ever think of her ? I think maya would love whoever this child is.
not_available She's a very loving person.
not_available Oh, unlike me ? Brenda ! YooHoo ! 
not_available Oh, shit ! Brenda, honey ! Honey ! Didn't you hear me ? Oh.
not_available God, no.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Oh, well, don't mind me.

not_available It's for the baby.
not_available You just popped in unexpectedly to drop off an expensive gift ? Uh, well, olivier was asking some questions About how come lunch took so long.
not_available I see.
not_available Oh, I need you to cover for me, honey, Just in case he calls you in one of his drunken rages.
not_available Well, why don't we just open this up So you can tell me why the baby won't like it ? Honey ? I'm really glad you decided to come.
not_available It means a lot to me.
not_available Yeah, well, I've always wanted to see The musical celebration of, uh, "biodiversity.
not_available " Now remember if you see durrell look in our direction Just scrunch down.
not_available What do you mean ? I didn't tell him we were going to be here.
not_available Why not ? 
not_available Because I'm scared of him.
not_available I thought the whole point of this was to give him emotional support.
not_available We are.
not_available He just doesn't know it.
not_available Let's keep it that way.
not_available Ooh, it's starting.
not_available * we are plants, we are animals * * we are people and we share this planet.
not_available * Oh, really, darling.
not_available I don't see what the big deal is.
not_available Thanks, mom.
not_available That makes me feel a lot better.
not_available Oh well, all couples have these kinds of disagreements.
not_available You think I didn't want to abort you and Billy ? But your father talked me out of it both times And the rest is history.
not_available Honey, the most important thing is that you and Nate are a team.
not_available You have to see each other as allies not as enemies.
not_available Well, how do I do that ? Well, honestly, by looking at it from his side.
not_available Do you really think he has a point ? 
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available I mean, life is so fucking hard even when it's easy.
not_available So why not try and make it less challenging if we can ? I, I understand.
not_available No, I can hold.
not_available Is someone there ? Hello ? How can I help you ? 
not_available I'm not sure.

not_available But I think I need to call you back.
not_available * but if I mine too much it'll cause water pollution and such * * I am an elm tree, don't overplant me * * I need to be surrounded by other trees * * or else I'll die of dutch elm disease * * I am a coral reef * * blow, Gabriel, blow * * blow, Gabriel, blow * * I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp * * but now I'm willing to trim my lamp * * so, blow, Gabriel * * blow ! * 
not_available David.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Why did you even have a bomb shelter ? That's not the point.
not_available The point is he barricaded himself down there Looking like some kind of mountain man.
not_available When they finally pulled him out and put him in the mental hospital, Well, that's when the really crazy stuff began.
not_available Please, stop.
not_available Please, just I knew he seemed a little too good to be true.
not_available But I didn't care.
not_available I was just so happy to meet someone Who said he wouldn't mind having children.
not_available Oh my god ! Children ? George means well I suppose, but he's not exactly great father material.
not_available What do you mean ? I cagive you his son kyle's phone number.
not_available He's sweet, but scarred for life.
not_available Maybe it's not in here.
not_available I can just call with it later.
not_available You seem How do I know you're not just some crazy person ? Do I look like a crazy person ? A little.
not_available I'm trying to protect someone like I wish someone had protected me.
not_available Well, maybe none of this is really true.
not_available Maybe you're just some bitter angry psychopath.
not_available I am not angry ! Oh ! Did you tell her how you feel ? Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi, Brenda.
not_available Hello, Maggie.
not_available Well, I guess I will take my seat.
not_available It's sort of a bad time, but I can talk for a second.
not_available What's up ? I came here to say that I felt I'd been a bit stubborn.
not_available That somehow this whole thing has come down to a choice Between my marriage and this child.
not_available And it seemed reckless to risk my marriage Over taking some stupid test.
not_available Great.
not_available But now that I'm standing here looking at you We've been so separate For a long time.
not_available It's like we're together, but we're not together.
not_available And ve been thinking that it's me.
not_available That it's my fears or my hormones.
not_available But I think that it's you.
not_available It's us.
not_available Listen, Bren No, don't touch me.
not_available Can we? 
not_available Don't.
not_available How can I make you feel better ? What do you want me to do ? Oh, god ! Just do what you want ! For once in your life, just do what you want.
not_available Not what you think people want Or what you should do.
not_available "Cause" I don't give a fuck anymore.
not_available Just
not_available Would you wait ? Oh, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available You know, I was an artist before I started working here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What ? 
not_available I was in art school, I mean.
not_available But I dropped out "cause" I was sick of it.
not_available And I thought I would have more time to just create.
not_available Except I've been a little uninspired, So I haven't really been doing much of anything.
not_available And now it sort of feels like maybe that's over, Which is kind of scary because that's how I've always defined myself.
not_available But then again, maybe it's kind of freeing in a strange way.
not_available Anyway, that's to answer your question from last night.
not_available Oh, I'm glad you told me.
not_available Why ? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know what Kirsten told you about anything.
not_available She hasn't told me anything.
not_available About what ? 
not_available Anything.

not_available What's the big fucking deal ? Wow.
not_available Well, you obviously still hate me.
not_available Why did you do this ? Huh ? Why did you ask me to move back in ? My goodness, what the Ruth ! When did you start locking this door ? George, I'm busy right now ! Go away ! What gives you the right to say those things to my fiancee ? It's none of your business ! It was my business when I had to clean up your goddamned mess ! Please, I want to be alone right now ! You don't want to live with me ! You don't want to let me go ! What the hell do you want ? 
not_available I don't know ! I'm completely out of control, doing crazy things ! And missing my Jay MCinerney reading at Dutton's in Brentwood ! Maybe I need help of some kind ! All I know is I hate you and I wish you would leave ! Come back here ! Ruth ! You dickwads went to my show ! Durrell, you know we don't use language like that.
