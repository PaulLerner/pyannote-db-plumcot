
not_available You stupid, stupid son of a bitch! You've got three beautiful girls and they are never gonna be able to take a drink! They are never gonna be able to have cocktail hour! You wanna know why?! 
not_available Suzanne, take it easy.
not_available You wanna know why? Because you are a fucking alcoholic! Suzanne! 
not_available What?! Should we get some help? # You light up my days # # And fill my nights # What? what's up? I just do not want to go to fuckin' Idaho.
not_available Oh, don't drive yourself crazy over it.
not_available I just don't want to go.
not_available You told them you were coming, you were gonna go.
not_available So just go.
not_available You know, I'd be fine if it was just the dedication of Lisa's ashes But? 
not_available I don't wanna be with the Kimmels.
not_available And I really don't wanna put Maya in that situation.
not_available Death death death.
not_available I feel like I'm done looking backward, I just wanna look forward, with you, with us.
not_available You do? 
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available What are you doing, little monkey, huh? You know, honey, half these boxes 
not_available are full of Lisa's clothes.
not_available Yeah, well, I saved them for Maya, so she can see them when grows up.
not_available Well, when you think about it, this ceremony does the same thing.
not_available You wanna go so that when Maya grows up you can say to her, "You were there." 
not_available I have colitis.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Yup.
not_available I do.
not_available There it is, colitis.
not_available Fuckin' Jesus, Mom! You're a seven
not_available letter whore.
not_available And it's on the triple word too.
not_available It's all about the seven letters for her.
not_available It always has been.
not_available She skips three turns, then mashes the shit out of you.
not_available Yeah, I'm your biggest problem.
not_available You are.
not_available You.
not_available You.
not_available You! You! You! You! 
not_available You! I quit.
not_available The hell you do.
not_available I'm going to miss this.
not_available I don't wanna go home.
not_available Play the game.
not_available Is "umurawi" a word? 
not_available What? It's all I've got umurawi.
not_available Aw, Fisher.
not_available Coming.
not_available Coming! Sorry, were you sleeping? No, but we were in bed.
not_available The people are coming, the people are coming, the people the people, the people! What time is it? 
not_available It's Miller time.
not_available Hey, whore.
not_available Hey, whore.
not_available Dude, come on, help me bring this over here.
not_available Where do you want it? 
not_available Over there.
not_available Guess Jimmy's the refrigerator magnet of the week again, huh? I get dizzy trying to keep up.
not_available Oh, I get it, 'cause you and Russell are like Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Happy Suburban Love Couple? Maybe we are.
not_available Maybe we're gonna buy a ranch house in a culde
not_available sac.
not_available Did you bring weed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, sweetie? Did we bring my CDs in? I got 'em, Baboo.
not_available Eh! Eh! Get out of my shit.
not_available You said you brought pot.
not_available I could get it for you, Stonehenge.
not_available Get it then.
not_available Cheesy and hot.
not_available I want a lot of flowers.
not_available I mean it, a lot.
not_available I don't want it to look like, you know, like like I didn't care because I do more than they'll ever know.
not_available More than anyone.
not_available Of course.
not_available Rob liked lasianthus.
not_available Didn't he, honey? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available They're sort of halfway between tulips and roses except they have no thorns and they're usually purple or white.
not_available They sound beautiful.
not_available Yeah, they are.
not_available We'll take purple.
not_available Shit! Okay, um okay, so, you what will you'll put him out there? And then what? You could say a few words, if you want.
not_available Oh God.
not_available "Hi, I'm Suzanne Wething.
not_available Some of you may have seen me kicking Rob in the parking lot at Jen's wedding.
not_available Actually, he was already dead from alcohol poisoning.
not_available So you can just all stop looking at me like that." I don't think so.
not_available Oh, what? It's no secret.
not_available Paige knows.
not_available Your sisters know, don't they? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Daddy was a drunk.
not_available Okay, what is it again, Waterbury what? "Waterford W Collection 11inch spire stem vase." 
not_available Terry doesn't fuck around, does he? No, when he registers, he registers.
not_available Maybe we should get married.
not_available So we can have people going on vase
not_available buying errands for us? No.
not_available So, we can say all those "forevers" and "no matter whats." You're in my will, I'm in yours.
not_available We basically are married, even if the law refuses to recognize it.
not_available But then again, I refuse to recognize most of the Bush Administration.
not_available I guess it all evens out.
not_available I still think some sort of ceremony in front of all our family and friends 
not_available would make it more real.
not_available I just don't think now's the time to go into bigevent
not_available planning mode.
not_available Why? I don't know, all the shit you've been through lately? I just don't think it's the perfect time.
not_available Well, it never is.
not_available Sometimes you just have to just pick a moment and do it, right? You mean like Nate moving in with Brenda and taking Maya with him? 
not_available If you ask me, that sounds crazy.
not_available You think? Well, fast.
not_available Life's so short.
not_available I don't know what fast is anymore.
not_available Here it is.
not_available $225? They're not getting this from us.
not_available Yes, they are, just bite the bullet.
not_available Right here, a garlic press for 30 bucks.
not_available You really want to be the guys who gave them the garlic press? They'll use a garlic press way more than they'll use a $225 vase.
not_available No.
not_available Jesus.
not_available I'm home.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hi, I wanna see my kids.
not_available When? 
not_available Today.
not_available What time? 
not_available 5:00.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Shit.
not_available Uh, let me let me drive them to karate tomorrow, and then I'll take them to lunch.
not_available You can't, we carpool with the Koehlers.
not_available If I change one week, everything changes.
not_available Vanessa, you can't keep me from seeing my kids.
not_available I'm not trying to keep you from seeing your kids.
not_available Why don't you come over tomorrow afternoon and play with them? Well at at the house? Yes, that would be better.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be there at 2:00.
not_available So, like, from 2:00 to 4:00? Make it 03:00 to 05:00 just to make sure we're back in time.
not_available Okay, see you then.
not_available And I was hauling this box of meteorites out to the car and I I thought, "Jesus, God, look at yourself moving these goddamn rocks again.
not_available How many times are you gonna keep doing this?" We're supposed to stay together because you don't wanna move your rocks? No we should stay together because we love each other.
not_available I love you, anyway.
not_available I do.
not_available I love you too, George.
not_available But this is my thought here, if you're going to be my husband and I'm gonna be your wife, it will have to be it can only be if some conditions are met.
not_available Shoot.
not_available Mainly, that you behave like a husband.
not_available And to me that means sharing yourself.
not_available I don't wanna have to feel bad every time I ask you a question.
not_available All right.
not_available And I want a healthy continuous flow of family around here, like making a space for Kyle and Becky.
not_available Becky? 
not_available My friend from the fabric shop.
not_available I set them up.
not_available Don't be mad.
not_available I'm not mad.
not_available Not to mention your other children, Brian and Maggie.
not_available I haven't even met them yet.
not_available All right, you'll meet them.
not_available And l I need to feel like you like me again.
not_available Ruth.
not_available You're my favorite person.
not_available You don't make me feel like your favorite person.
not_available Look I'll try.
not_available I will, I mean it.
not_available I'll I'll try.
not_available You poor thing.
not_available Yes, we'll be at the Black Forest Inn.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, Hoyt.
not_available No, 1170 is our flight number.
not_available How could we land at 11:70? 
not_available Yeah, I was kidding too.
not_available See, baby blue.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Bye.
not_available Secret, you could write 
not_available The guy is such a knob.
not_available I'll take you guys to the airport.
not_available You know what? 
not_available Orange.
not_available I've got a better idea, why don't you come with us? No, I don't think so.
not_available You don't have to come to the ceremony.
not_available Just come to Idaho.
not_available I really think I'd be in the way.
not_available Well, I really think it would actually make the whole thing livable for me, having it be the three of us.
not_available You really want me to come? Well, I asked you, didn't I? Come on.
not_available Oh, Byron.
not_available I can't.
not_available I have an appointment with Byron tomorrow.
not_available I think Byron will be fine if he misses a session.
not_available You've only been seeing him for like, a month.
not_available No, exactly.
not_available It's too soon to leave him hanging out 
not_available by himself in the middle of reality.
not_available What about my reality? # Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.
not_available # # Mister, look at your girl # # She loves it # # I could see it in her eyes # # She hopes it'll last forever # # Hey! # # Her offbeat dance makes me fantasize # 
not_available Come dance with me.
not_available This should be illegal.
not_available What? 
not_available This should be illegal! Yeah, I know.
not_available What should be illegal? People trying to get other people to dance! It doesn't work.
not_available # Move, she wants to move # # But you're hogging her # 
not_available You're right.
not_available # She wants to move # # She wants to move but you're hogging her # # You're guarding her # # Beat it! # What the fuck, Claire! What? 
not_available What are you doing? I just you just look so fucking beautiful tonight! Oh, do I? Wow, that must make it so hard for everybody.
not_available High much? Why are you being such a fucking bitch? The world's not your own private fucking chemistry set, Claire! Just stay away from me.
not_available Leave me the fuck alone! Okay! # Hey, mister, she wants to move # # Move # # She wants to move # # But you're hogging her, you're guarding her # # Beat it! Mister, look at your girl # # She loves it # # I can see it in her eyes # # She hopes it'll lasts forever # # Hey! Come on # # Fairies sweet magic for me # Yeah, uh
not_available huh.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Uh, no, I already have the number.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ugh.
not_available Barb called, left a message.
not_available There's some barbecue at Peg and Ed's in an hour.
not_available I should've told them I was coming tomorrow morning.
not_available They want you to go over now? Like in an hour.
not_available I'm just gonna call and say I can't make it.
not_available No, I'll get it, I'll get it.
not_available I was gonna pass it to you.
not_available Just you know, I'll just let them leave a message.
not_available Answer it.
not_available I'll be quiet! I'm just gonna check the message.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You should go to the barbecue.
not_available Yeah, I don't know.
not_available They just wanna see Maya.
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available I got a bunch of work to do.
not_available Hi, do you have a message for Room 13? It's for you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hello? Oh.
not_available Uh, no.
not_available I know how to spell it.
not_available Just the number.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Byron.
not_available Now, Terry, repeat after me.
not_available I, Terry, take you, Paul I, Terry, take you, Paul to be my lifetime partner, lover, and friend.
not_available to be my lifetime partner, lover, and friend.
not_available Cut it out.
not_available Cut it out.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Shh 
not_available Don't get me started.
not_available in sickness and in health, in sickness and in health, in times of plenty and times of want, in times of plenty and times of want, until death do us part.
not_available Hey.
not_available God, you scared the living crap out of me! What are you doing here? Anita and I crashed here.
not_available She left early this morning.
not_available But I fell into a K
not_available hole last night, and I'm climbing out right now.
not_available Who had K last night? I don't know.
not_available How was it, fun? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I might have been raped and I'll only recover the memory under intense hypnosis That's cool.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Tender.
not_available I can't find it.
not_available Did you look in the garage? 
not_available Excuse me? This meat is so tender.
not_available I think we got the marinade right, Ed! Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available It's great.
not_available Was it hard for you and Maya to find the time to get away? You didn't have anything else going on? Nothing as important as this.
not_available It's been hard lately.
not_available You think you finally get to the bottom of the feelings, and then there are more.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, Byron, just tell me what's going on.
not_available I'm on a bridge.
not_available Where? Los Feliz.
not_available I'm sitting on a ledge.
not_available Byron, you need to get down off that ledge right now.
not_available There are so many cars and each one of them has someone inside driving.
not_available And all those people, they all feel things every bit as deeply as you and I do.
not_available Byron, I want you to do something for me, okay? I'd like you to do something for me too.
not_available I'd like for you to honor your commitments, but obviously that's not something you think you should do.
not_available I'm sorry, I had a family matter come up.
not_available I needed to attend to it.
not_available Are you married? That's not really relevant to the work we're doing together.
not_available Was it something really important or did you just blow me off? I rescheduled with you.
not_available I left You left a message telling me when you would be available! If you had an emergency 
not_available I am having an emergency! Byron, please get off the bridge.
not_available You're the one who wanted me to cross the damn bridge! Yes, and now, I'd like you to get off the bridge, so that we can continue our work together, okay? Our work together is important.
not_available I'm not on a bridge.
not_available Where are you? I am in my living room.
not_available Why can I hear traffic? It's just my air conditioner.
not_available See, I was just pretending.
not_available Byron, that was very dishonest of you.
not_available If you do anything like that ever again, I'll have to stop seeing you, do you understand? Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good, I'm gonna hang up now.
not_available Okay, goodbye.
not_available Say cheese, Maya.
not_available Whoo, that was a good one, good job! Kick it back.
not_available Can you kick it back? Uncle Nate, Did you ever give David "Stiff"? Uh, what? 
not_available The book I gave you to give to him when we took Maya to LEGOLAND? Oh, yeah, yeah, I didn't, I'm sorry.
not_available I just I completely spaced.
not_available But uh but you know, I can see right where it is though, in my head.
not_available So when I get back, I'll give it to him.
not_available You could read it too.
not_available It's very informative.
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe I'll do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available You look tired.
not_available I am.
not_available If you want to go back to the inn, Maya can play with the kids.
not_available Hoyt said something about roasting marshmallows.
not_available Hey, careful, you guys.
not_available Dad, we're just havin' fun, aren't we? We're just havin' fun.
not_available Whoo, whoo! Why don't you go back, and get some alone time, and we'll bring Maya back in a couple of hours? We're, like, five minutes from Main Street.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available It's family.
not_available All right.
not_available Just give me a call when you pull up outside.
not_available Sure.
not_available Look at the camera, Maya.
not_available Look at me and give me a big smile.
not_available Yeah! Okay, okay.
not_available Man, you won again?! You should go on the pro tour, buddy.
not_available Ooh, yeah, ha ha ha! Wow.
not_available Look at you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, Julio finished 
not_available all of his homework.
not_available That's good.
not_available Who's coming over? You remember Kenny Simms? From high school? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Come on in.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm great.
not_available You look great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Rico.
not_available Hey.
not_available Am l I'm not early, am I? No.
not_available Well, I guess I'll go.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, guys.
not_available See you soon.
not_available Bye, Daddy.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available I'm sorry if I came at a bad time.
not_available No no no, you didn't do anything, no.
not_available It's all good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Your little boy is so cute.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is he um 
not_available Adopted? Yeah, about a year and a half ago, from Guatemala.
not_available My partner and I have had, like, you know, the most preliminary of adoption conversations.
not_available Which agency did you use? 
not_available Whole Family Center.
not_available And they're good people and they've got really strong connections in Guatemala with the bureaucracy, which is great.
not_available But they're kind of religious, if you know what I mean.
not_available Uh I think so.
not_available They don't work with gay couples.
not_available So 
not_available Oh.
not_available You might wanna try Rainbow Kids or some place like that.
not_available Thanks for the tip.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey! You came back! Where's Maya? She's playing with her cousins for a couple hours.
not_available Mm 
not_available Miss me? No, I was too busy having a totally surreal phone session with my client.
not_available Yeah, what happened? I can't tell you, you know that.
not_available Come on.
not_available How much do I unload on you about all the freaky people I have to deal with at work? 
not_available This is different.
not_available Not really.
not_available Yeah, really.
not_available Huh
not_available uh.
not_available Yeah, this is the whole, you know, client
not_available privilege doctor thing.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available It's very professional.
not_available How do I know this client exists anyway, huh? How do I know this isn't some hot guy you've got on the side? 
not_available I was kidding.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm not really worried 
not_available I know, I know.
not_available I wouldn't have moved in if I was worried.
not_available Mm You know, this is like the first time we've been together.
not_available What do you mean? The other times, we never really had a relationship.
not_available One of us was always escaping, or lying Or stoned 
not_available Or something.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Now, we're really here.
not_available You know, I drove back here to tell you I love you, that I miss you, and To make sure I didn't escape? Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available # Today is gonna be a beautiful day # This one's cool.
not_available Oh, yuck.
not_available If you like nostrils.
not_available Claire.
not_available No, I can't have this kind of documentation of my nose just lying around.
not_available Maybe if I just rip out my nose.
not_available There.
not_available That's better.
not_available Mm, mm.
not_available Nostrilly goodness.
not_available Stop.
not_available Mm 
not_available You're an idiot.
not_available Stop, stop it.
not_available # What can I do to make this plane go through? # Oh, I'm so much happier when I'm high.
not_available # Some day I'll get it right # # I swear I'll get it right # # Today is gonna be a beautiful day # I got your eyes.
not_available That's so scary.
not_available Oh, I wish you could see this.
not_available Well, get my camera.
not_available It's right over there.
not_available How's the light in here? 
not_available Good, we're good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If you pucker up.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The problem is not nuclear war.
not_available The problem is what's gonna cause nuclear war.
not_available I don't see us living through a nuclear war, George.
not_available Of course not.
not_available Not a whole lot of people will.
not_available No, I mean, in our lifetime.
not_available I don't see it happening.
not_available Ha! I married the glassishalf
not_available full girl.
not_available Which time? Oh, this time.
not_available Of course, yes.
not_available What was I thinking? This decaf is so cinnamony.
not_available Isn't it? 
not_available Hmm.
not_available I think when the next A
not_available bomb is launched, it'll be over God.
not_available Whose? 
not_available Exactly.
not_available The Fundamentalists, Islamic, Christian, and otherwise are all going to conspire to end the world the way all their holy books said it would with a big war.
not_available Yes, but all those theologies have a message of hope and brotherly love in them too, to counterbalance the irresistible force of self
not_available fulfilling prophecy.
not_available Whereas corporatism 
not_available We know, we know, Dad.
not_available You think it'll all be about oil, just like everything else.
not_available Oil.
not_available Close.
not_available Water.
not_available Oh! The apocalypse will be over water who has it, who wants it, and what they're willing to do to get it.
not_available But global warming, isn't it I thought that's supposed to melt the glaciers or something.
not_available If you like your water salty, I guess that's the good news.
not_available But what about rising sea levels or the disruption of the thermalhaline conveyor? 
not_available That's the Gulf Stream.
not_available Oh! Have you checked out the Pentagon report on the Guardian website? No.
not_available You have a computer here, right? Yeah, sure, downstairs in the office.
not_available We're done, right? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You have to see this.
not_available So show me, show me.
not_available This stuff was actually published by the Pentagon, and it basically says anywhere between two and 20 years from now, kablooey.
not_available Kyle loves online.
not_available George too.
not_available It's just so absurd! The idea that there are kids waiting for homes and people still have the nerve to say who's good enough and who isn't, based on are you gay or not? People are stupid.
not_available What a shock.
not_available There's nothing in here but fuckin' eggs.
not_available Yeah, I'm sorry, I thought we needed them and we didn't.
not_available Twice.
not_available What's this? Oh God, just throw that away.
not_available Trust me, don't even wash it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think we might have some Ricea
not_available Roni in here or something.
not_available Oh my God.
not_available What is it? It's a Chinese baby! What's it doing in the cupboard? Someone must have left her here for us.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know, someone Chinese.
not_available What? Couscous.
not_available It's all we've got.
not_available What are you doing down here? It's past midnight.
not_available Huh, it's fucking unbelievable.
not_available When you have all this information laid out in front of you like this, it's a wonder anyone can get up in the morning.
not_available No one's getting up in the morning at this rate.
not_available Come to bed.
not_available In a minute.
not_available Take a look at this site.
not_available Oh.
not_available The graphic is a little simplistic.
not_available It was obviously designed for the layman.
not_available But you can literally watch the world's potable water supply dripping away moment by moment.
not_available But that's that's just some people's opinion.
not_available It's not an opinion.
not_available It's a scientific hypothesis.
not_available But let's just say they're half
not_available right, which chances are they are.
not_available But even if they're only half
not_available right, we're not doing any of the things we should be doing in order to prevent it, much less reverse the trend.
not_available But it's all so pessimistic.
not_available If it happens, we'll die.
not_available But in the meantime, can't we be happy? Happy? 
not_available Yes, happiness! Don't you remember happiness? Ruth, I'm crawling my way to comfortable.
not_available I can't even think about being happy unless I'm doing something to help save this planet, or at least prepare myself and my loved ones for whatever it is that's coming next.
not_available We're talking about the end of life as we know it here! But you're obsessing about these 
not_available I don't think I'm obsessing.
not_available Well, you're down here instead of sleeping, dreaming good dreams.
not_available Come to bed.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll come to bed.
not_available Come to bed.
not_available Lisa is here with us right now.
not_available Not in this urn, but in all of us.
not_available Each of us here today, especially little Maya, shares a part in carrying Lisa's eternal life into the future.
not_available May this dedication of Lisa's humble ashes today be for all of us a reawakening to the sparkling and still vivid ways her spirit continues to live, grow, and flourish in the lives of those she loved.
not_available Let us pray.
not_available Our Parent, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name Stop it.
not_available I want the crying to stop now.
not_available I want it to stop.
not_available This is hard for Mommy too.
not_available We are not leaving here until this stops.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hallie, do you wanna go to the Cheesecake Factory or don't you? Because we are not leaving here until this stops.
not_available Do you understand me? We're not.
not_available Excuse me What do you want? 
not_available She's lost her father.
not_available Oh, shut up! You shut up! This is none of your business.
not_available See, she's fine.
not_available Aren't you, Hallie? You sure you two don't have time to get coffee or anything? No, we gotta get packed up and stuff, 
not_available but thanks, really.
not_available Yeah, you sure? Uh, yeah.
not_available She won't sleep on the plane.

not_available You're dating and it's gonna freak out the boys! I mean, look at you! 
not_available Look at me what? You straightened out your hair.
not_available You don't even look like you.
not_available I blew my hair dry, okay? I'm a grown woman, separated from my hus When did we officially decide we were separated? The day you left, Rico! You don't live here anymore! So, you can give me the goddamned keys or make me go to the expense of changing the goddamn locks! But you don't live here anymore and you can't tell me shit! And next time you come over, why don't you goddamn tell me first?! Should I get this to go for the car? I'll get a straw.

not_available When I went to school here, there were lines up and down the hall, people waiting to get in and develop their shit.
not_available People sleeping in here even.
not_available Now, every time every time I come in here, it's empty.
not_available Yeah, fucking digital.
not_available So is it weird for you to have me in your class? Is it weird for you to be in my class? Weird in a good way.
not_available You know, sometimes when you're strutting around up there pointing at shit, I just kind of stop hearing what you're talking about and like, stare at your legs 'cause they're really long.
not_available My legs are long, huh? Yeah, you're all tall.
not_available Do you like ceviche? Mm, I love it.
not_available You wanna go to Siete Mares after this? They have the most perfect, perfect ceviche.
not_available I'm kind of getting addicted to spicy stuff.
not_available Like if it doesn't hurt a little bit, it's not really worth eating.
not_available I'm familiar with that dynamic.
not_available So let's get some.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm almost done here.
not_available Hmm, that's interesting.
not_available Isn't it? Just the name, you know? Rainbow Kids, it's so fucking condescending.
not_available David, let it go.

not_available And put jalapeno in this time, sliced.

not_available I'll get the check.
not_available Yeah, I'm done.
not_available And more ginger, too.
not_available Please.
not_available Excuse me, did you say something? Hmm? What did you just say? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Bullshit, you said something.
not_available What did you say? 
not_available I said, "Please." To me? Uh, no, for you.
not_available Somebody had to.
not_available Who the fuck do you think you are? Seriously.
not_available I think I'm a member of the human race, which makes me want to treat my fellow humans with a certain amount of respect.
not_available That's who I think I am.
not_available Seriously.
not_available Jesus! Get off me! Hey, what the fuck? Hey hey hey Get the fuck off me! You fuckin' bit me! 
not_available Come on.
not_available What the hell are you doing? You tore my earring out, you cunt! Jesus, what the fuck's the matter with you? Holy shit! God damn it! I really do hate to bother you folks.
not_available It's no bother at all, Stan.
not_available It's just been something I couldn't get off of my mind after the service today.
not_available What is it? Well, when I was transferring the ashes into the urn, I couldn't help but notice there were a lot of bone fragments.
not_available It's the kind of thing you only see in much, much older cremains.
not_available You hardly ever see that now.
not_available Technology's improved so much.
not_available Now, I could be wrong, but the ashes that we interred Just say it.
not_available I don't think they're Lisa's.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin our descent into Los Angeles.
not_available Please return your seats and tray tables to their upright and locked positions.
not_available We'll also be coming through the cabin one more time in case you have anything remaining to discard.
not_available Here we go.
