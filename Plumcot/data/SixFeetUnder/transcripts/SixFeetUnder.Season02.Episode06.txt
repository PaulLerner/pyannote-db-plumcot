
not_available Over there.
not_available I just saw a fin.
not_available Right.
not_available In the most polluted port in America? 
not_available Nothing could live here.
not_available Really? That makes me sad.
not_available It looks so beautiful at night.
not_available Yeah, so is Burbank.
not_available You're gorgeous, you know that? 
not_available Shut up! So why haven't you ever talked to me before? I was intimidated.
not_available You're very intimidating.
not_available You're full of shit.
not_available Of course they pick a goddamn boat this year so nobody can leave before Parkinson's jerk
not_available off speech about what a fucking great company this is, right? Right.
not_available Like anything that self
not_available important fuck says could change the fact that we'll be filing for bankruptcy by the end of the year.
not_available You're new here, aren't you? Yeah, about six months.
not_available I'd start sending out my résumé now unless you're one of Parkinson's fucking inner circle.
not_available If you are, then fuck me, right? Do you wanna go and get another drink? 
not_available Please.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I guess I'm the asshole for telling the fucking truth! Shit! That's not fair.
not_available You suck! 
not_available Morning.
not_available God, you scared me! 
not_available You're up early.
not_available I slept like a fucking baby.
not_available Yeah, me, too.
not_available After the night we had? The sheer exhaustion factor alone.
not_available Yeah, I gotta say it was worth the wait.
not_available So does this mean the ebb is over? 
not_available For now.
not_available Want a coffee? 
not_available Wow, this is kind of racy.
not_available Hey, no! Is that your novel? 
not_available I don't know what it is yet.
not_available When do I get to read it? 
not_available When it's ready, if it's ever ready.
not_available Well, who's Christina? Is that your fictional alter ego? Your Holden Caulfield? She's more like my Humbert Humbert.
not_available You know, my Constance Chatterley.
not_available She's like Hermione in the Harry Potter books.
not_available What would you rather 
have Some overlyeducated gasbag like Trevor or a semi
not_available literate fuck machine like me? Come on.
not_available That's a no
not_available brainer.
not_available No pun intended.
not_available I have something for you.
not_available I know it's small, but it is a diamond.
not_available You think I care about diamonds? Will you marry me, Brenda Chenowith? Haven't we done this already? What? 
not_available I love you.
not_available Good.
not_available Something else? I thought we could announce it to my family at dinner tonight.
not_available I was gonna ask my mom to make dinner.
not_available Look, we have to do this sometime.
not_available And what about your family? 
not_available Are you kidding? They are way too consumed in their own divorce drama to even notice.
not_available Let's just not tell them and say that we did.
not_available And what about Billy? You know, I haven't really talked to him for a while.
not_available Why don't I make you pancakes from scratch like a good little wifeto
not_available be before I fuck your brains out and send you to work? How about we skip the pancakes? Shit, you're already dressed? Am I holding you up? No, not really.
not_available Well, maybe a little.
not_available You've got the best shower.
not_available Mine's just this weird bolt sticking out of the wall that sends out mist.
not_available It takes five minutes just to get wet.
not_available How come I always stay here? It's time for you to stay at my place.
not_available After that great recommendation? 
not_available It's nice.
not_available MGM built it back in the '30s to house starlets.
not_available Great parquet floors, unbelievable molding but some idiot did an '80s retro
not_available fit and ripped out all the good fixtures.
not_available I'll be happy to stay at your house, fixtures aside.
not_available You know, I never thought you'd call me back after that second date.
not_available Why? Because I never think the good guys are gonna call back.
not_available Who said I'm a good guy? Well, it's been three weeks.
not_available That's usually a sign.
not_available Check with me in three months.
not_available I'll tell you how you're doing.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Sit.
not_available Have some breakfast.
not_available Most important meal of the day.
not_available Good morning, dear.
not_available Apparently.
not_available How would you like your eggs? Surprise me.
not_available Now, this is good, yeah? All together for breakfast.
not_available Well, I see it's Good Neighbor Day at the Fisher house.
not_available David, was that a new friend I saw leaving this morning? Mom, please, I'd rather not discuss 
not_available What does he do? He's a public defender.
not_available You should have asked him in for breakfast.
not_available We'd all like to meet him.
not_available Yes, bring him next time.
not_available I would like to meet him.
not_available Where's Nate? We have an intake in 15 minutes.
not_available He called from the car.
not_available There was an accident on the 10 and he told me to ask everyone to be here for dinner tonight.
not_available He has something important to tell us.
not_available A big family dinner.
not_available It will be fun.
not_available Everybody had gotten off and the lights were on.
not_available You could see what a dumpy little boat it actually was And he just wasn't there.
not_available It's hard to believe right now, but time 
not_available I got dumped at a party in college once it was the Kappa Sig luau by some guy whose name I don't even remember.
not_available The sun was coming up, and I just sat there staring at this stupid pig carcass in my stupid Hawaiian
not_available print sundress.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Collins, have you thought about Matthew and I had been married for almost 20 years.
not_available Can you believe that? I met him when I was barely 20.
not_available And now he's dead and I'm just that much closer to it.
not_available I'm sorry, we don't allow smoking inside.
not_available Please put that out.
not_available It's against California State Law.
not_available We could be fined.
not_available Sorry.
not_available How long will it take? It depends on the kind of service you were thinking of.
not_available Length of visitation, should you choose an open casket My husband was dredged up from Long Beach Harbor with a propeller slice halfway down his body.
not_available Closed casket, then.
not_available How much? I can't spend a lot of money.
not_available We're probably looking at around $7,000.
not_available That seems like a lot.
not_available It's about average, maybe a little less.
not_available We'll take care of everything make it as easy on you as possible.
not_available I need to think about this.
not_available Of course.
not_available Let us know what you decide.
not_available I can show myself out.
not_available Shopping around for the best deal.
not_available Isn't that her right? She's wasting our time.
not_available Oh, dear, when did you get so dried out? You must be thirsty.
not_available The flowers are lovely, Sarah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I just cut them on my walk through the canyon.
not_available Don't worry, you didn't put me out one bit.
not_available This kitchen is exactly the same.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available You look well.
not_available So do you.
not_available I only just got your messages.
not_available I was in Madrid.
not_available I wanted to stay through Christmas, but I ran out of money.
not_available The reason I was calling was because What I want to say was that I forgive you.
not_available You're the only family, apart from the children, that I have left.
not_available I didn't want more time to go by with our not talking.
not_available We're sisters.
not_available We shouldn't be estranged.
not_available I took this course called The Plan.
not_available You did The Plan? You're shitting me.
not_available That is so great, Ruth.
not_available You, of all people.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? 
not_available No, it's very brave.
not_available I know it couldn't have been easy for you.
not_available I did it back in the '70s when it was still called "Transitional Focus." Before Ernst Vollhoffer was busted for tax evasion and sold it to the Canadians.
not_available That's when it became The Plan.
not_available I met Vollhoffer at a party once and he came on to me.
not_available But I'd just dropped acid for the first time and I thought he was some Mayan death priest who wanted to cut out my heart and throw it into a pit.
not_available So I blew him off.
not_available Catherine Collins has decided to go with the Unger mortuary.
not_available Well, I guess that's that.
not_available Unger is a Kroehner home, Nate.
not_available Yeah, so? So Kroehner charges about double what we do.
not_available That's the third funeral Kroehner has stolen from us since Mitzi Huntley came to visit.
not_available They are after us again.
not_available Look, now you're just being dramatic.
not_available This from a man who basically lives in denial.
not_available Look, Stan told me at lunch last week that Kroehner stock had taken a nosedive.
not_available Why would they be wasting their time with small potatoes like us? Maybe because you told Mitzi to shove her good
not_available faith gesture up her ass? I told you guys that Kroehner wasn't gonna let up, but nobody listens to me.
not_available Not now, Federico.
not_available We needed that funeral.
not_available How else are we paying for the fine from the DCA? That's $1,800 we don't have right now.
not_available I asked you to check the proof.
not_available No license number on a billboard opposite a retirement home makes us look like amateurs.
not_available We cannot afford to be vulnerable.
not_available I'm not comfortable starting on this woman's perm until I have a photo.
not_available Any idea when that's supposed to arrive? I have an inspector coming to my house this afternoon.
not_available It came in this morning and I put it in her file which you would know if you bothered to look.
not_available I'm calling Catherine, and I'm going to lowball Unger.
not_available Even if we cut our profits in half, we can show Kroehner we're willing to fight.
not_available Hey, Mom.
not_available Hello.
not_available Who are you? I'm your Aunt Sarah.
not_available Claire, the Goddess is clearly manifesting through you.
not_available It's very obvious.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I thought you were dead.
not_available The skin like milk.
not_available Treasure it while it lasts.
not_available Ruth, you told your daughter I was dead? Shame on you.
not_available I never told her any such thing.
not_available Claire, why would you lie about that? Whenever you talked about her, it just sounded like she was dead.
not_available I just assumed.
not_available Well, I've made a miraculous recovery.
not_available Tell me exactly what you were feeling when you made this.
not_available Boredom.
not_available Liar.
not_available There's anger and yearning passion, resentment of the status quo, some jealousy of it, as well.
not_available Not the most original perspective, but it's authentic.
not_available I love this! The 
technique Very precise, very adult.
not_available The death of romance in a regimented, artificial world.
not_available Lovely.
not_available Actually, I found it in the garbage.
not_available My dad threw it out after a funeral.
not_available I thought it looked cool, so I kept it.
not_available You're an artist, Claire.
not_available Please.
not_available I'm not saying you're any good, yet.
not_available But if you focus and live fully, you could become something.
not_available If you're lucky and don't self
not_available destruct.
not_available Right.
not_available You've got an eye.
not_available You see through the veil.
not_available It's a blessing and a curse.
not_available Okay.
not_available You need something red in your relationship corner like a red velvet pillow.
not_available Something bordello
not_available ey.
not_available You're resisting the carnal.
not_available That's your mother rubbing off on you.
not_available Put a plant in your knowledge corner if you want to grow into your potential.
not_available What is that, Feng Shui? You're kidding, right? You can drop the generic apathy crap.
not_available That's just laziness.
not_available You're more than that and you know it.
not_available Hey, baby, sorry I'm late.
not_available Rico, we are fucked.
not_available It's definitely mold.
not_available I told you so.
not_available See, this is why Julio's cold don't get any better.
not_available Maybe you've got structural damage in your chimney and water's leaking in.
not_available When the rain starts, it'll get worse.
not_available Okay, what can we do? I got to rip this all out and see what's going on inside.
not_available Maybe we can patch things up, maybe it'll be bigger than that.
not_available How much is it all gonna cost? 
not_available You got serious water damage here.
not_available It could be anywhere from $3,000 to maybe $7,000 if your roof is involved.
not_available Excuse me one second.
not_available We can get Ramon to fix it.
not_available Fix it? He didn't even spot it.
not_available You heard him.
not_available There's serious water damage.
not_available Any idiot would know that.
not_available Don't call my cousin an idiot.
not_available Okay, no, I'll call you an idiot because you were too cheap to get a real inspector initially.
not_available I'm an idiot? Maybe it wasn't the smartest idea to go to your sister and buy this pieceof
not_available shit house behind my back.
not_available Now you think about that.
not_available God damn it! 
not_available What happened? I just got snapped running a red light.
not_available We are living in a motherfucking police state, I tell you what! Any calls while I was at lunch? The Unger mortuary called to say the funeral we poached from Fisher &amp; Sons 
not_available is going back to them.
not_available You're kidding! We undercut them by almost $500.
not_available Well, now they've undercut us by nearly $1,000.
not_available Oh, my God, I love this! They're cute, but they are such bad businessmen.
not_available Well, they won't last.
not_available What have I got tomorrow? Your trainer at 9.00 then backto
not_available back performance reviews from 1.00 to 5.00.
not_available Cancel everything except the trainer.
not_available All right.
not_available I think I need to spend a little quality time with the fabulous Fisher boys.
not_available Ruth, do you have any tarragon? 
not_available All the spices are in that cabinet.
not_available Well, now I know what to get you for Christmas.
not_available Dean &amp; Deluca have these fantastic spices in test tubes.
not_available Very mad scientist.
not_available You'll love them.
not_available What are you making? 
not_available I'm not sure yet.
not_available I'm making Chicken Kiev.
not_available I bought all the ingredients to make Chicken Kiev.
not_available So we'll make Chicken Kiev.
not_available Have tarragon, will travel.
not_available Tarragon is not listed in the ingredients.
not_available Following instructions? Where's the creativity in that? Cooking is alchemy, not a science.
not_available It is if you want it to turn out right.
not_available Is there anything I can do to help? Smell.
not_available This vodka is from Poland.
not_available You will like it.
not_available Ruthie, why don't you join us? Thank you, but I'll wait till dinner is served to have a glass of wine.
not_available Okay, suit yourself.
not_available Where you learning to speak the Russian? It's a long story.
not_available Let's just say there was a man involved.
not_available Of course there was.
not_available Claire, when you are finished mixing the herbs in you want to form the butter into little logs.
not_available Eight of them.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available It's deliciously sensual.
not_available Wash your hands first, Claire.
not_available You wild woman.
not_available Nikolai is adorable and hot.
not_available The sex must be spectacular! Good for you.
not_available Oh, my God! You're all grown up, but your face is still 12 years old.
not_available David, you remember your Aunt Sarah? Yes, hi.
not_available I'm sure you couldn't forget her if you tried.
not_available David, have some vodka.
not_available Yes.
not_available This is so surreal.
not_available The engagement dinner.
not_available I feel like I'm in a training movie from the '50s about how normal people behave.
not_available Well, my family's anything but normal.
not_available Compared to mine, they're the fucking Cleavers.
not_available Just relax and enjoy yourself, all right? You look gorgeous.
not_available Everybody loves you.
not_available Not your mother.
not_available All you have to do is sit back and be the center of attention, all right? Come on.
not_available So, Linda, what do you do? 
not_available It's Brenda.
not_available Forgive me, I'm drunk.
not_available It's all Nikolai's fault.
not_available He's been plying me with vodka since the moment he arrived.
not_available I'm a massage therapist.
not_available She's an amazing massage therapist, and she's writing a novel.
not_available You are? I'm writing something.
not_available We'll see what it turns into.
not_available Have you ever read Charlotte Light and Dark? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, she's Charlotte.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available What is this, Charlotte light and who? It's this book about this girl who's being analyzed and she's smarter than the people who are analyzing her.
not_available And so she's constantly fucking with them.
not_available It's hilarious.
not_available You continue to be drawn to strong, complex women.
not_available Bravo.
not_available Mom, this dinner is delicious.
not_available I think it's a little sour, myself.
not_available No, it's one of the best you've ever made.
not_available It's great.
not_available Here, more vodka? 
not_available Please.
not_available I had a lover who was Russian.
not_available He once told me that vodka was to Russians what therapy is to Americans.
not_available Something habit
not_available forming and expensive that totally destroys your ability to lead an authentic life.
not_available Sorry, both my parents are shrinks.
not_available And that was very painful for you.
not_available But if it weren't for that, you probably wouldn't be writing your novel, right? Speaking of creativity, is everyone aware of the budding artist in the family? No, who? 
not_available You haven't seen Claire's work? Shame on you.
not_available She needs feedback even if it's just so she can learn to ignore it.
not_available Claire, I know so many creative people from all over the world.
not_available You must come stay with me in Topanga Canyon and meet some of them.
not_available Okay.
not_available What? Now's as good a time as any, I guess.
not_available The reason that I wanted us all to get together for dinner tonight is that Brenda and I have decided to get married.
not_available Good, married.
not_available This calls for a toast, yes? Absolutely! There you go.
not_available Something to toast with.
not_available To romantic 
love Both the inspiration and utter folly of it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That's really kind.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available So, Linda, I never would have taken you as the type to get married.
not_available Show us the ring.
not_available Yeah, don't blink.
not_available You might miss the diamond.
not_available Here you go.
not_available No, it's beautiful.
not_available It's lovely.
not_available Ruth, did you see? Yes, very nice.
not_available I'll go put on some coffee.
not_available Is there any more of that vodka left? Ruthie, what's wrong? Your son is going to marry.
not_available This is a beautiful thing.
not_available It's been a long day, that's all.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Just look at this mess.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm going to help you clean up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available God, there is so much emotion to navigate where family is concerned.
not_available Vicodin anyone? No, thanks, I'm fine.
not_available Okay, what's the deal with me going to Topanga Canyon? Mom totally freaked.
not_available No one ever told you? Oh, my! It seems I'm a terrible influence.
not_available David and I went to stay with Aunt Sarah one weekend and I kind of lost my virginity.
not_available How old were you? 
not_available Fifteen.
not_available How old was she? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available 20
not_available something.
not_available She was 32.
not_available Oh, my God, that's totally fucked up! Your mother has never forgiven me and she never will, no matter what she says.
not_available Granted, there was an awful moment when David was lost but he was found completely unharmed in the canyon the next morning.
not_available Damn, I miss out on all the best stuff in this family.
not_available Well, that was a disaster.
not_available Your mother hates me more than ever now.
not_available She does not hate you.
not_available Come on, Nate.
not_available Who cares if she does? I'm just glad it's over.
not_available On to the next.
not_available We have a whole lifetime of tense and uncomfortable family gatherings to look forward to.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, where have you been? We had kind of a family dinner.
not_available My brother's getting married.
not_available Are you drunk? 
not_available Yes.
not_available My mother's boyfriend kept pouring vodka.
not_available I'm gonna have such a fucking headache tomorrow.
not_available Your mom's boyfriend was there? So how come you didn't invite me? Because I knew it would be excruciating and I wanted to spare you? I wish you were here, or me there.
not_available Why? So we could have hot sex and then fall asleep together.
not_available You could always come over here.
not_available I'm too drunk.
not_available I shouldn't drive.
not_available Or I could come over there.
not_available I'm too drunk.
not_available I shouldn't drive.
not_available Take some aspirin before you go to bed, and vitamin C.
not_available Drink lots of water.
not_available I'll talk to you tomorrow.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Hey, Mom.
not_available Here, let me help you.
not_available You ready? You should have used your grandmother's ring.
not_available God knows your brother isn't going to use it.
not_available And who knows if Claire will ever settle down.
not_available That ring was for you.
not_available I didn't even know about it 
not_available You are the firstborn and probably the only opportunity for grandchildren that I will ever live to see.
not_available Mom, you never even told me about it.
not_available What I think this is really about is you don't like Brenda.
not_available That's not true.
not_available I just don't want you to get hurt.
not_available Is she pregnant? No, she's not.
not_available But she is the woman I love, Mom.
not_available You may not think she's the best person for me, but I do, and I need you to accept that.
not_available We're glad you came back to Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available You gave me the best price.
not_available That's the only reason I'm here.
not_available That other place wanted me to sign some waiver before I could see the body.
not_available Do you want me to do that, as well? Mrs.
not_available Collins, I don't think you want to go through that.
not_available Your husband's body experienced severe trauma.
not_available It's beyond restoration.
not_available Restoration? No, I don't want him restored.
not_available What's the point? Perhaps we should choose a casket.
not_available You think it's a day like any other.
not_available What you don't realize is that anything can happen.
not_available And then it does.
not_available It happens.
not_available And there's so much left unsaid.
not_available And it was all just wasted time.
not_available I just want somebody to help me understand.
not_available Just to help.
not_available Can you help me? The first line of C.
not_available S.
not_available Lewis' A Grief Observed 
is "No one ever told me grief felt so like fear." I'll get you a copy.
not_available I think it will help.
not_available It's going to be okay.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available What's wrong? Doesn't it ever get you down? Sure, all the time.
not_available You know, I keep thinking it's going to get easier, but it just doesn't.
not_available No, it doesn't.
not_available It just gets more familiar.
not_available Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Don't you two look sharp! Just as sharp as a couple of little tacks.
not_available Miss Huntley.
not_available What can we do for you? Well, for one thing, you can call me Mitzi.
not_available Stop being so goddamn formal.
not_available Now, how come y'all have not thanked me for this snazzy casket wall? Maybe I should thank you for selling our beautiful and highly profitable caskets.
not_available Seeing as how you've bought up, absorbed, and shut down every other competitor? What the fuck do you want? What the fuck do I want? I want you boys to come the fuck with me on a little fucking trip.
not_available What do you fucking say? What kind of fucking trip? Well, see, now that's a secret.
not_available We're very busy.
not_available Well, I suggest you get unbusy.
not_available I understand Fisher &amp; Sons forgot to put their license number on a recently
not_available printed advertisement.
not_available We've already been fined for that.
not_available So you can just turn around No, I'm not talking about the billboard.
not_available I'm talking about the two
not_available column incher in the funeral pages of the LA Times.
not_available It's run three weeks in a row now.
not_available So that is three fines that you can avoid if you just drop the attitude and come with me.
not_available Federico, hi, it's David.
not_available Nate and I are tied up for the rest of the day so we need you to pick up the Collins body from the Unger mortuary.
not_available You can't just expect me to drop 
not_available Federico, I need you to do this.
not_available Fine.
not_available Collins? You bad boy.
not_available That wasn't very nice of you, stealing a funeral from us.
not_available One that you stole from us first.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available This whole selfrighteous chiponthe
not_available shoulder thing kind of worked for Russell Crowe in Gladiator.
not_available But you don't have the special effects to back it up.
not_available You get a big kick out of yourself, don't you? And you are a big stickinthe
not_available mud, aren't you? Lighten up.
not_available The whole purpose of this trip is to have fun.
not_available Just ask Bobo.
not_available I said, now what's Mitzi doing hiding all the way in the back? Hi, darling, you know the Fishers? 
not_available Bobo.
not_available Good to see you guys again.
not_available Well, I need to mingle.
not_available I'm not being a very good hostess.
not_available She's quite a little spitfire, isn't she? So when did you all become members? Members? Nothing beats flying out to Palm Springs twice a month for a little golf.
not_available You know, I met Merv Griffin last time.
not_available Hell of a guy.
not_available We're never selling to Kroehner.
not_available Well, then you're idiots.
not_available No offense.
not_available It must have been fun having a sister growing up.
not_available "Fun" is not the word I would choose.
not_available God, I can't believe I never even met her before.
not_available It's for the best.
not_available Sarah has no boundaries and she's completely self
not_available involved.
not_available She would have only disappointed you.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You know that I think if you work hard you can be good at whatever you put your mind to.
not_available Yeah, sure, Mom.
not_available How long is my house gonna be like this? This is a big job.
not_available You got to be patient.
not_available Patient? Where was patient when you told us to buy a house full of mold? I'm not a licensed house inspector.
not_available You knew that.
not_available Besides, you should call that realtor and sue her for nondisclosure.
not_available Shit.
not_available I got to head down to Long Beach before rush hour.
not_available No, come on, baby.
not_available You got to stay here.
not_available You have to deal with this.
not_available I got to pick up a body.
not_available That's what pays the mortgage.
not_available Let David do it.
not_available What are you, his lapdog? Shut up! 
not_available Just shut up.
not_available Can you do that for once? 
not_available Rico, calm down, man.
not_available She's just stressed with the mess and two kids.
not_available Who wouldn't be? 
not_available Cut her some slack.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available He can be a real pain.
not_available Yeah, you don't have to tell me that.
not_available Don't you worry.
not_available We'll get this fixed just as soon as we can, okay? The house was built in '59 for Frank Sinatra.
not_available If these walls could talk.
not_available I don't even want to know what all happened on that coffee table.
not_available Come on.
not_available You see what you boys are missing? This is the life.
not_available Don't hurt yourself, Bobo.
not_available Would you be a dear darling and fix us up another batch of those frozen margaritas? Thank you, lovely.
not_available She's single.
not_available I'm engaged.
not_available Yeah, well, I'm married.
not_available There are swimsuits and towels and such in the cabana out by the pool.
not_available Pepper used to be captain of the USC swim team.
not_available Now he's trying to make it as an actor.
not_available God, they're a dime a dozen, aren't they? Why are we here? 
not_available To have fun.
not_available My God, boy, I don't even think you know what that is.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I understand exactly how exhausting and depressing running a small business like yours can be.
not_available Your only job today is to forget about all that.
not_available Enjoy.
not_available Well? We should at least try to have a good time.
not_available What's up? I was just leaving you some laundry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You got room for me in there, boys? I want you to know Matt Gilardi never got to come here.
not_available Is that supposed to make us feel better about how he harassed us? And how you're continuing to harass us? Please, you boys have got to get over this victim mentality.
not_available Finally, the sales pitch.
not_available That's considerably more money than we've ever offered you.
not_available You know, this was our father's business.
not_available It's not something we can just walk away from.
not_available David, nobody is asking you to leave.
not_available We like things just the way they are.
not_available We like our lives just the way they are.
not_available Honey, it may be tomorrow, it may be 10 years from now but y'all are going under.
not_available It is just evolution.
not_available Kroehner's got the size, resources, market share, lobbyists in Washington.
not_available What do y'all got? Your pride.
not_available Car's leaving for the airport in five minutes.
not_available Y'all better hurry.
not_available Should we have taken that offer? What? 
not_available Why are we doing this? Fighting so hard? Maybe she's right.
not_available Maybe this is a losing battle.
not_available Don't tell me you got seduced by a hot tub.
not_available So she dangled a fat check in front of us.
not_available So the fuck what? No, we can't give up, David, all right? We can't.
not_available We just can't.
not_available No medication? Have you told Brenda yet? Yeah, like a week ago.
not_available How'd she take it? 
not_available You know Brenda.
not_available She pretends to be stronger than all of us.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available I didn't think you were coming.
not_available Well, you know me.
not_available I can't sleep without you.
not_available You're the only thing in my life that works.
not_available Oh, shit.
not_available My client.
not_available I got to get this.
not_available Oh, God, I love you so much.
not_available I just love you.
not_available I enjoyed the sermon.
not_available So do you have to work today? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Good.
not_available I thought you had to prepare for a hearing tomorrow.
not_available I'm thinking about blowing that off.
not_available The guy's totally guilty.
not_available I'd rather spend the day with you.
not_available Hey, I didn't know you were here.
not_available That's a big
not_available ass lie.
not_available I saw you staring in church.
not_available Who's this? 
not_available This is Taylor.
not_available Taylor, this is my friend Ben.
not_available Hi.
not_available So how are you? You want to go over and say hi? 
not_available No, we'll be late for the movie.
not_available You guys not talking now? We had an argument.
not_available It's nothing.
not_available Taylor, come on.
not_available Got to go.
not_available I miss you.
not_available Me, too.
not_available Who's she? Her uncle's an old friend of mine.
not_available Roll onto your back, nice and slow.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Happens to me all the time.
not_available It's nothing I haven't seen before, so don't be embarrassed.
not_available Who said I'm embarrassed? Easy.
not_available Feels good.
not_available Like that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Harder.
not_available Oh, God! Yeah.
not_available Yeah, faster.
not_available Come on.
not_available So thanks.
not_available Can I make another appointment for next week? I don't think that's such a good idea.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't think I can see you again.
not_available Well, thanks again.
not_available Take care.
not_available I know your brother doesn't want me to, but I have to see him.
not_available I really don't think you should put yourself through that before the service.
not_available There's been no restoration.
not_available Seeing him like this could make it that much worse.
not_available I spent over half of my life with that man.
not_available I slept with him every night for 20 years.
not_available Please just let me see him.
not_available I have to see him once more.
not_available I want to see him.
not_available All right.
not_available Look at you now, you fucking pig! I'm glad you're dead! I'm fucking glad! And I hope it hurt like hell! He can't hit me anymore can he? Thank you.
not_available I could really love you, David Fisher.
not_available Not quite the response I was hoping for.
not_available I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available I like you a lot, Ben.
not_available But? But I'm in love with someone else.
not_available I see.
not_available And when exactly were you planning on telling me this? It's not that I haven't enjoyed being with you.
not_available You're a great guy.
not_available You're a catch, and he's not even available.
not_available I don't want to lie to you.
not_available I just thought it would be a good idea for me to get involved with someone else, you know, healthy.
not_available Great.
not_available So next you'll be saying you just want to be friends.
not_available Well, now I know why you never wanted to introduce me to your family.
not_available Organic herbs and spices from the Farmers Market.
not_available Is Claire here? 
not_available No, I don't know where she is.
not_available If I'm going to avoid traffic, I'm going to have to miss her.
not_available Damn.
not_available Tell her this is for her knowledge corner.
not_available She'll know what to do.
not_available I'm sure she'll appreciate that.
not_available Okay, Ruth, what the hell is going on? What's going on? You waltz in here after 20 years insulting my cooking, getting drunk with my boyfriend filling my daughter's head with all kinds of ideas and reminding my sons of traumatic events in their lives.
not_available Jesus Christ, the boy was gonna lose his virginity sooner or later.
not_available And Fiona is a great woman.
not_available Very compassionate He was molested! He was a horny 15year
not_available old who couldn't believe his good luck.
not_available I shouldn't be surprised you won't take any responsibility.
not_available You never have.
not_available Okay, that's what this is about.
not_available When mother died, someone had to step up.
not_available Someone had to take care of Nanny, but you just did as you pleased.
not_available You never let anybody help you.
not_available God forbid anything should interfere with you feeling sorry for yourself! If that's what you need to believe to justify your own selfishness What do you want me to say, Ruth? I want you to apologize.
not_available Fine.
not_available I apologize! Does that make it any better? No, because you had more fun than I did! Fun? The only man I ever loved died when I was 21.
not_available The children I so desperately wanted were impossible because my ovaries are dry as stone.
not_available And I'm a terrible artist but I surround myself with people who have talent that I will never realize.
not_available It's all hard, Ruth.
not_available We just made different choices.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't know about the ovaries.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I'm sorry about Nathaniel.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I got your flowers a couple of months later.
not_available I was in Peru.
not_available Let me finish mopping.
not_available How's the writing? 
not_available Good, really good.
not_available Somebody had a good day.
not_available It's just this woman who was screaming at the mangled body of her dead husband who used to beat her.
not_available Can you imagine hating someone that much and staying with them for 20 years? What makes you think people stay together because it makes them happy? Promise me if things ever start to go nutso, or you ever hate me that we'll deal with it.
not_available We won't just cover it up? Don't worry, I'll be long gone before you can hate me.
not_available I don't think I could ever hate you.
not_available Besides, we know what we're doing here.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available So what did you do today? Not much.
not_available A client.
not_available What do you think you're doing? Releasing your cock from the prison of your pants.
not_available Do you think that's wise? 
not_available Do you want me to stop? It's just me.
not_available Are you busy? I was just chatting with this friend of mine online.
not_available I found some things I thought you might want.
not_available What things? Just some things I've collected over the years.
not_available Are these all mine? 
not_available Yes.
not_available No way.
not_available Oh, my God, it's Blue Pajama Man.
not_available I totally forgot about him.
not_available I kept everything you ever did.
not_available Mom.
not_available Where's Nate? He had left home already.
not_available What about Dad? He was probably working.
not_available My God.
