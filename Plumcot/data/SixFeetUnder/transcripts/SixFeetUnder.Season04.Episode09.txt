
not_available Hey, I could see if they need anybody part time at the store.
not_available Okay, you know something, Norbert? I need money! My rent is three weeks overdue, and you're not helping! You could sell something.
not_available How about you just loan me some cashola from your trust fund instead? You could sell me your entire "Justice League of America vs.
not_available The Alien" series.
not_available A guy on eBay sold one last week for 500.
not_available For the whole series? That's bullshit! 
not_available Swear to God.
not_available Dude, the auction was rigged.
not_available And besides, I need more than that.
not_available You want to know what you could sell that would pay your rent for like the next three months? What? 
not_available "Blue Twister," 1941, issue number one.
not_available No fucking way.
not_available Can't do it.
not_available It's worth three grand easy.
not_available I know what it's worth, Norbert.
not_available I'll give you 
not_available You just told me it was worth three.
not_available So? How bad do you want to pay your rent? No way, I'm never selling it.
not_available In fact, I'm going to be buried with it.
not_available It's in my will.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Ahh! Larry? Larry? Larry, are you there? 
not_available Morning, fellas.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Morning, Nate.
not_available Rough night? A little rough.
not_available I miss sleeping in my own bed.
not_available I miss the boys, I miss Vanessa.
not_available Not me, slept like a baby.
not_available Dropped Maya off over Bettina's with Mom.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Maya's fine.
not_available If you want to know how my mother is, she suggested that you call her and ask her yourself.
not_available So, um when's she coming back? I haven't the slightest idea.
not_available Apparently, she still needs some space.
not_available Well, you do want her to come back home, right? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Well, with all due respect, why don't you just get off your ass, go over there, eat as much crow as you have to and bring her back home? Because that's just what she wants me to do and I'm not playing that game.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, that's the way I'd play it.
not_available You guys are more pathetic than I am.
not_available Woke up in the middle of the night and you weren't there.
not_available You were out here watching television again.
not_available Yeah, I watched "Jaws 3." I drank too much green tea.
not_available I kept having to get up to pee.
not_available I am so glad we're not doing that whole open relationship thing anymore.
not_available Me too.
not_available You are? Really? Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available You're not just saying that because I said, "I'm glad"? No.
not_available David, I have to come clean with you about something.
not_available What? I had sex with someone after we decided not to sleep with anyone outside the relationship.
not_available But we said we weren't gonna do that anymore.
not_available I know.
not_available I fucked up.
not_available So, who did you sleep with, Javier? No.
not_available Celeste.
not_available Okay, bullshit.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available Celeste is a woman.
not_available Isn't she? She is.
not_available But I've slept with women before.
not_available You know that.
not_available You're serious? You slept with Celeste? It was just once.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available You were walking by and you just happened to fall into her vagina? It just happened.
not_available I'm sorry it happened, but it did and I felt I should tell you.
not_available You haven't secretly decided to switch teams, have you? No, no way.
not_available Okay.
not_available Wow.
not_available But okay.
not_available Edie? Oh, what are you doing here? Uh, Hello? I'm Edie's friend, Anita.
not_available I just needed to talk to her.
not_available Is she, like, home? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, can I come in? 
not_available She doesn't want to talk to you.
not_available Why the fuck not? She's just kind of over you for the moment, that's all.
not_available Oh, I see.
not_available Why? Because you were a lesbian for about two whole minutes and then suddenly you weren't.
not_available On top of that, she said you got all, like, grossed out by her pussy.
not_available That was totally not cool.
not_available Okay, for the record, I was not grossed out by her pussy.
not_available Okay, pussy, per se, does not gross me out.
not_available I just didn't know what exactly to do with it.
not_available It wasn't personal, it just didn't do it for me, you know? I'll pass that along.
not_available No, we weren't related.
not_available We used to work at Hi De Ho together.
not_available Is that a grocery store? It's a comic book store in Santa Monica.
not_available Oh.
not_available Did he have a family, someone locally or out of state, we could contact? We're pretty much it.
not_available I guess that's why he designated me to be the executor of his estate.
not_available We were all in the West
not_available Co Blue Twister Society together.
not_available Blue Twister? The guy who could turn into a human tornado? Yeah, or shoot smaller tornadoes from his fingertips with the strength of an F
not_available 5.
not_available That's the strongest tornado there is.
not_available His name was Alan Talbot and he was a scientist doing research in a machine he had invented called the vortexicon.
not_available It was a prototype for a nuclear
not_available powered particle accelerator.
not_available Something went horribly wrong.
not_available And he turned into the Blue Twister.
not_available I just read it when I was a kid, I had no idea he had a society.
not_available It was kind of an unofficial fan club.
not_available Anyway he wanted to be buried with this.
not_available It's issue number one from 1941.
not_available It's extremely rare.
not_available Extremely valuable.
not_available The last thing he said before the bookshelf fell on top of him was that he wanted to be buried with it.
not_available We were on the phone together when it happened.
not_available He made this noise like And then I hung up and called 911.
not_available We're very sorry for your loss.
not_available Oh, honey, that's terrific.
not_available Marcie's lawyer poked so many holes in the case, 
not_available the feds dropped all the charges.
not_available Oh wonderful! Well, I don't like lawyers, but you give him a blowjob if you have to.
not_available Okay, sweetie.
not_available I'll talk to you soon.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available Uh, that's a relief.
not_available It certainly is.
not_available You wanna help Grandma fold laundry? 
not_available No.
not_available No? That's okay.
not_available You just sit there and be your adorable little self.
not_available We should get out and do something today.
not_available Okay, what? 
not_available I came up with the zoo.
not_available Now, it's your turn to come up with something.
not_available We could go to the park.
not_available You've been here for two weeks, we've been to the park almost every single day.
not_available Maya loves the park.
not_available We've been through this already.
not_available Getting on your nerves, aren't we? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Would you like us to leave? 
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Are you sure? Believe me, if I wanted you to leave, you'd know it.
not_available Think big, Fisher.
not_available Think different.
not_available Something the sky's the limit.
not_available I'm tired of coming up with all the ideas in this marriage.
not_available This isn't a marriage.
not_available It's starting to feel like one.
not_available I don't suppose you want to go home and make up with your hubby? I'm not ready.
not_available What if I told Nate to take Maya back to day care for the next couple of days? 
not_available That's a start.
not_available What would you like to do? No, you're missing the point.
not_available What would you like to do? George is always talking about his travels and I thought we'd have adventures together.
not_available So far he hasn't taken me anywhere.
not_available So? Let's go on a road trip.
not_available Now you're talkin'.
not_available Where do you wanna go? Someplace exotic.
not_available God, I love you! What, you can't handle that? 
not_available Come on.
not_available You can't, can you? God, come on, Bren.
not_available I just came over here to To what, fuck my brains out? You know what? You're right.
not_available I can't handle this right now.
not_available I need to know what you feel for me, Nate.
not_available Do you feel anything? 
not_available Yeah, of course I do, Brenda.
not_available God, look.
not_available I just spent the past year dealing with losing somebody, okay? Losing everything that I committed myself to.
not_available You know, it wasn't even that good, when I'm perfectly honest with myself, so I don't want a But you want me to be available for sex without No, I don't want anything, okay?! This is too fuckin' intense for me! 
not_available I have a daughter now.
not_available That is so lame.
not_available What is lame about having a daughter? 
not_available Using it as an excuse.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I could be part of both your 
not_available No, you couldn't.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Yeah, fine, go.
not_available Look, I'm sorry 
not_available Just go go go.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, Vanessa, it's me.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Julio! No no no, wait! 
not_available Hi, Papi.
not_available Hey, Julio.
not_available I wasn't done talking to Mommy.
not_available She doesn't want to talk to you.
not_available Oh, she doesn't? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available How's my little man, huh? 
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah yeah.
not_available When are you coming home? 
not_available Soon soon.
not_available Papi's been really busy at work.
not_available I love you, Papi.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Oh, I have to.
not_available I can't stand another minute of this.
not_available Hey, baby.
not_available People are waiting.
not_available How do I get out? 
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available You can't believe what? You can't believe I had another condo at stake? 
not_available Please don't be angry with me.
not_available I wasn't angry Nice.
not_available So, where are we going? 
not_available Rosarito Beach.
not_available Mexico? That's not too far, is it? Four hours tops.
not_available Uh, it's your trip, you're driving.
not_available Okay, then you're the navigator.
not_available I did all the research.
not_available Wow! I got a map from the internet, and list of all the haciendas, and I made us a reservation.
not_available It's the off
not_available season and everything is reduced.
not_available Yeah, what the fuck.
not_available Let's go to Mexico! It's not like I have to cross a bridge every day.
not_available I never have to cross bridges, but I think about crossing them constantly.
not_available You're talking metaphorically.
not_available No, I'm talking about literal bridges.
not_available Did anything bad ever happen to you on a bridge? No.
not_available Did anything bad ever happen to someone you love on a bridge? No, but, they collapse all the time.
not_available If you Google "bridge collapses" you get like, And you're worried that if you cross a bridge, it'll collapse? 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's a phobia, Byron.
not_available I know that.
not_available I want you to try something for me.
not_available I want you to imagine that you're walking down the street and you come to a bridge But I wouldn't, I would go around it.
not_available This time you can't go around it.
not_available Going around it is not an option.
not_available I
not_available I don't like this.
not_available It's just a short bridge.
not_available Just imagine, you're walking across it and it doesn't collapse.
not_available Now, you're on the other side, safe and sound.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available You're not? No, halfway across, I jumped off.
not_available Byron, are you taking any medication at the moment? of Prozac.
not_available Okay, well, I have to check in with my supervisor, Dr.
not_available Kee, okay? So, we'll be right back.
not_available I don't think he's suicidal.
not_available I think he's phobic and I think he has O.C.D.
not_available I think you might be right.
not_available We'll up his Prozac and see if that helps.
not_available I'd like to address his behavior.
not_available You want to force him to walk across a bridge? No.
not_available Yes, gradually.
not_available You've got a real knack for this, Brenda, but you can't just force someone who's phobic 
not_available to face their fears.
not_available Why not? Because you have to be more patient than that.
not_available Someone like Byron might never get over his phobia.
not_available Then what is the point of continuing his therapy? Well, maybe it's the one thing that keeps him from jumping off a bridge.
not_available I think we can do better than that.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, did you hear? 
not_available Hear what? Professor Pope? Just got in a car accident.
not_available She's dead? No.
not_available No, she just suffered internal injuries, she's gonna be out for at least a month.
not_available But she's going to be okay? Yeah, well, I mean, that depends on your definition of "serious internal injuries." If she punctured her gall bladder, she'll be fine.
not_available Apparently, we don't even need our gall bladder.
not_available But, if it's her liver or her lungs or something more vital, then it's not so good.
not_available What if it was her labia? Wouldn't that be totally tragic for her? Why are you looking at me like I'm some kind of retard? Because I swear, Russell, sometimes you are.
not_available And for your information, labia are not internal organs.
not_available Hello, everybody, my name is Billy Chenowith.
not_available And I'll be your sub for the rest of the semester.
not_available You know him? 
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available until then, you guys are unfortunately mine.
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, God, I feel so guilty.
not_available Why? For being alive.
not_available Oh, Nate.
not_available I just wanted Lisa gone.
not_available I just wanted her out of my life.
not_available But you didn't make it happen.
not_available It should've been me.
not_available Oh God, no no.
not_available Nate, too many people love you and need you your family, Maya.
not_available I need you, I need you so much.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available You're so full of holes, you're this gaping bottomless pit of need, you neurotic, tedious, selfabsorbed bitch! Hey! Move it! 
not_available Fuck off, you stupid bitch! He turns waste into black gold oil and gasoline.
not_available The amount of waste out there is enormous.
not_available each year in the United States alone.
not_available It takes the nation's dump trucks 323 million trips to carry all that trash.
not_available But some say there is more than rubbish in the landfills.
not_available Brian Appel's company believes there are riches, a renewable energy resource.
not_available We open this valve and the oil comes out from here.
not_available They're turning waste into fuel and they've invented Uh
not_available oh.
not_available It's already proving itself at their pilot plant in Philadelphia.
not_available Oh, that's okay.
not_available That's okay, that's okay.
not_available Life is a series of accidents one after another.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, now we know the reason it was so cheap.
not_available It's a dump.
not_available It's not a dump.
not_available It's rustic.
not_available It just needs a little maid service, that's all.
not_available At least we can see the ocean.
not_available Well, there's that.
not_available Ooh! I made a terrible decision and brought us to a horrible place.
not_available Oh, come on, it's Rosarito.
not_available I mean, we're in a foreign country, Fisher! Horrible and terrible are two of the most underrated qualities when traveling in a foreign country.
not_available Horrible and terrible often lead to fun and adventure.
not_available Really and truly? 
not_available You know the saying, "You can't make chicken salad out of chickenshit"? I don't believe I've ever heard that one.
not_available Well, I'm here to tell you, you can and I have.
not_available So I was in Patagonia for a while.
not_available It's unbelievable how cheaply you can live down there, and then I got amoebic dysentery, Yeah, and my grant money finally ran out, so I figured, time to head back to the States.
not_available That's when I got the call from Dean Perelli about filling in for Carolyn Pope.
not_available The fact that Carolyn Pope is tenured blows my mind.
not_available What can I say, shit definitely rolls uphill.
not_available What, you don't think she's any good? Hmm, uh, well, 
not_available she's strictly academic.
not_available Mmm.
not_available Muffin? 
not_available Mmm.
not_available How's Brenda? Hmm.
not_available We haven't spoken in almost a year.
not_available I guess you could say we're officially estranged.
not_available What's going on with you? 
not_available Mmm.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I guess I'm depressed.
not_available I don't think it's clinical, but I just can't seem to have a normal healthy relationship with another person.
not_available Right.
not_available Get in line.
not_available Nobody has normal healthy relationships.
not_available My theory, which I have yet to put into practice, is to pick someone slightly less crazier than you are.
not_available Society propagates this vision of people hooking up and staying together forever.
not_available In reality, how often does that actually happen? I think it all comes down to basic animal chemistry, and if you get the chemistry wrong, it's like, bleach and whatever that shit that makes bleach explode.
not_available Right, I think it's ammonia.
not_available Ammonia.
not_available Yeah, I hear you.
not_available You know, I think, like, you start out with whatever your fucking parents and their sick
not_available fuck gene pools stick you with, right? But if you see enough shrinks for long enough, and you get your cocktail right, then you can get over yourself, have a life.
not_available I wonder if there's a cocktail that can make you compatible with someone else? 
not_available I sure as shit hope so.
not_available Hmm.
not_available Dig in, guys.
not_available These are mushrooms? 
not_available Giant portobellas, the best.
not_available The filet mignon of fungi.
not_available If you wanted a filet mignon, why not just eat a filet mignon? Do you know how many units of caloric energy it takes to make a single calorie of beefsteak? Uh, no, but I have a feeling you're about to tell me.
not_available of fossil fuel for every calorie of beef protein.
not_available The meat industry along with most of the agri
not_available business in this country is completely and utterly unsustainable.
not_available You're saying we shouldn't eat meat? 
not_available Meat isn't the problem.
not_available It's how far away from the table the food, whatever it is, is produced.
not_available If it's produced locally, it's not just fresher, it's less wasteful.
not_available I used to work at a food co
not_available op in Seattle and we used to hunt for chanterelles.
not_available I remember reading somewhere that mushrooms are grown in dung.
not_available Everything organic is grown in dung.
not_available What do you think fertilizer is? These, I believe, were grown in sheep dung in Ventura.
not_available Evening, gentlemen.
not_available David, would you care to join us for dinner? George grilled up some giant portobella mushrooms.
not_available And they were fertilized in sheep dung.
not_available Uh no thanks.
not_available I'm going home to my husband.
not_available You guys have fun.
not_available I know it's a period piece and a presidential bio
not_available pic, but look, what most people don't realize is that William Howard Taft aside from being the fattest president ever was also, like, this underdog and a rebel.
not_available He was kind of like the Eminem of his day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh yeah, Sean Penn would be totally awesome, but is he gonna be willing to put on 150 lbs.? Yeah, all right.
not_available Yeah, listen, man, I gotta go.
not_available I'll check you later.
not_available Hey, Bren.
not_available Hey.
not_available I haven't seen you in a while.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What can I do for you? 
not_available I need a little something.
not_available What you want? You want some brownies, kahuna, catch of the day? What do you recommend? 
not_available The catch of the day is this pale green shit from up in Mendocino.
not_available It's very sticky, very nice, not too skunky.
not_available Mmm, sounds good.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available # Traffic sings the songs # # Inviting me in to dodge the bullets from an empty gun # # If I had a car I'd drive # # Straight into the window of a bank I owed money to # # Pretty pictures in a magazine # # Everybody is to make
not_available believe.

not_available He shouldn't be handling the ball.
not_available These are two guards, you know? And that's the problem here.
not_available Yeah, I hear you.
not_available That's right.
not_available What, we don't eat dinner together anymore? I thought you were working late.
not_available Well, I'm not.
not_available I'm sorry, I just ate the last piece.
not_available But you want me to fix you something? No, I think I'll go to Fat Burger alone.
not_available You guys want to play 300 bridge? No.
not_available Not me.
not_available I'm gonna turn in early, I'm beat.
not_available Yeah, I think I really gotta give Maya her bath.
not_available What the hell was that? Okay, whoever the fuck you are, we can see you! Yeah, and we've got a gun! And a phone, so if you don't step out from behind those drapes We're gonna fill 'em full of holes! Don't shoot! No shooting! It's you? 
not_available You don't have a gun.
not_available No, but unless you got a good fucking reason for breaking into our place of business I'm calling the cops! What the hell is going on down here? Where's Maya? 
not_available In the playpen on the sun porch.
not_available Run for it! Ow! I think you broke my arm! What the fuck are you doing in my house? Get up.
not_available You broke in here to steal your dead buddy's comic book? It was his idea! Shut up! It's worth four grand.
not_available Maybe four and a half.
not_available And he wasn't my buddy.
not_available I didn't even like him.
not_available That's it.
not_available I'm calling the cops.
not_available Don't bother, Rico.
not_available I don't care whether you liked him or not, his last wish was to be buried with this thing and that's exactly what we're gonna do.
not_available So, put it back! Now, get the hell out of my house before I change my mind 
not_available and call the cops.
not_available Right.
not_available I think you broke my fucking arm, dude.
not_available Nicely done.
not_available Thank you.

not_available Hey, don't forget your bag of tea.
not_available # Leave your baby down # 
not_available This water isn't very hot.
not_available It's a lukewarm tub.
not_available Have some of this? I don't like tequila.
not_available You know that cold, rubbery lobster dinner we just ate? It was probably seething with bacteria.
not_available A couple of swigs of this and we won't be fighting all night over who gets to ride the porcelain bus.
not_available We've been in here over 10 minutes and it's not getting any warmer.
not_available I have half a mind to complain to the manager.
not_available Go for it, Fisher.
not_available Do you speak English? 
not_available Yes, how may I help you? The heater in the Jacuzzi doesn't seem to be working very well.
not_available I'm sorry, we turn it off after sunset during the off
not_available season.
not_available My friend and I are paying guests of your motel, and we would like the heater on in the Jacuzzi.
not_available Whether or not it's the off
not_available season is none of our concern.
not_available You can turn the damned thing on or give us a full refund.
not_available We can't give you a refund for the room, you've already checked in.
not_available Then we'll check out, and I'll call the credit card company and have them refuse payment.
not_available I'll turn the heater on in the Jacuzzi but only for one
not_available half hour! Thank you very much.
not_available I don't know what you did in there but this baby is cooking like a lobster pot! Gimme some more of that.
not_available Ayayay
not_available ay! # 'Cause now it's all night # Wow.
not_available What do you think? I just remembered the first time I ever realized what Dad really did in this house.
not_available I had this dog Yippie.
not_available I found him underneath my bed and he was already dead, so I wrapped him up in a blanket and I brought him downstairs to the prep room.
not_available I thought maybe Dad could fix him, you know, bring him back somehow.
not_available Then I realized there were all these bodies down there and they're all dead.
not_available And Dad was fixing them, but he wasn't bringing anybody back.
not_available He was just making them more presentable.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I always thought they were so sad and alone in the dark down there.
not_available They just needed someone to come and sit with them.
not_available Yeah, I thought that, too.
not_available Sometimes I still do.
not_available That's you.
not_available Oh.
not_available That's me.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Where's Dad? He's not here.
not_available Is this for class? No, I'm not sure what it's for yet.
not_available Maybe it's just for me.
not_available I love that little coffin refrigerator.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I mean, I still always think about acting out, but now when I get in the car and take a drive, instead of picking up a hooker, I, uh I just go to the Krispy Kreme.
not_available So, now I'm addicted to Krispy Kreme and I'm 40 lbs.
not_available heavier.
not_available Even my wife doesn't want to excuse my French, fuck me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Someone here tonight reeks of marijuana.
not_available It's not AA.
not_available No, but it's still against the rules.
not_available I think you should leave and come back when you're straight or sober.
not_available You're right.
not_available I'm sorry, but I really need to be here.
not_available I'm I need to be here.
not_available I'm really scared about what'll happen to me if I leave, so please don't make me leave.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, buddy boy.
not_available # Make a little dream worthwhile # Yippie's dead.
not_available Can you fix him? I'm sorry, kiddo, but I can't.
not_available I'll tell you what we can do, though.
not_available We can give him a real nice send
not_available off.
not_available # If you take a little time to smile # # A smile is meant to give away # # Give 100 every day # # If you took a little time to say # Now, we need something of yours to put in with him.
not_available He has my blanket.
not_available Something more personal.
not_available I know.
not_available Why don't you climb in with him? That way he'll never be lonely.
not_available Nate, I'm sorry.
not_available But I have to take something with me.
not_available Being alone for all eternity sucks like you wouldn't believe.
not_available I need something really personal, like a piece of me.
not_available I've decided it should be Maya.
not_available No.
not_available Nate, you know what Dad used to say? We all have to go sometime.
not_available Who are you supposed to be? 
not_available Death Man.
not_available I wanted to be The Grim Reaper, but the folks at Marvel already had a copyright on it.
not_available Sorry, kiddo, they're all coming with me.
not_available I could stay if you want me to.
not_available Yes.
not_available Nobody stays.
not_available Including you.
not_available Sit.
not_available Ooh, I'm allergic to dogs.
not_available Now, there's the man I married.
not_available Who wants the end piece, hmm? Honey? Buddy boy.
not_available He liked a lot of things.
not_available His comic book collection, of course.
not_available "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.
not_available Every movie that Halle Berry was in, except "Monster's Ball." For some reason, he didn't like "Monster's Ball." It's like, these guys hit 15 and got stuck in some kind of time warp.
not_available It's kind of scary, isn't it? It's just depressing how alienated they all look.
not_available Well, from us maybe, but Iook at them, they're a community.
not_available This is who they are.
not_available visit him in the Cloud City.
not_available Her name would have maybe have been Linda.
not_available Are you crying? 
not_available No, no.
not_available Okay, you know something? You're acting like a serious freak.
not_available Maybe, I am a serious freak.
not_available I don't know what the hell is going on with me.
not_available I love this.
not_available I feel like Butch and Sundance.
not_available Isn't this beautiful? We're on a beach full of horse apples, Fisher.
not_available You want to know what I think? I think you should just move on.
not_available You do? 
not_available How long were you two together? Since high school.
not_available That's a long time.
not_available I know a lot of mammals mate for life, but most primates don't.
not_available We're human beings, not primates.
not_available We share 98.8% of the same DNA as a chimpanzee.
not_available We're more closely related to them than they are to gorillas.
not_available Maybe your time with her is over.
not_available You're young enough, just go find another one.
not_available Oh my God, you guys folded my undies.
not_available That is so fucking sweet.
not_available Is she still living here? Evidently.
not_available I thought Edie and Anita were supposed to be here.
not_available They were supposed to be, but they're not.
not_available I think it's because of me.
not_available I thought we were gonna take pictures.
not_available Dude, nobody brought a camera.
not_available Here feed the pigeons.
not_available This sucks.
not_available You want to go see a movie? Not really.
not_available You wanna get something to eat? 
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available Yeah, me neither.
not_available We could drive over to LACMA, check out the Arbus exhibit.
not_available Why don't you go ahead, and then report back to us.
not_available Okay, maybe I will.
not_available Later.
not_available So I heard something.
not_available What did you hear? 
not_available It was from Edie and Anita.
not_available Oh? They said something about you never having an orgasm.
not_available Actually Edie did a piece on it last night at Nuts and Jolts.
not_available She did? "A straight girl wanted to eat my pussy but then she changed her mind." 
not_available She said that?! Verbatim.
not_available It was kinda cool, though.
not_available Oh God, I am so fucking embarrassed right now.
not_available Nah, don't be.
not_available Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
not_available No, listen, really, don't be.
not_available Is it true, though? Yes, I changed my mind.
not_available No, I meant about the orgasm.
not_available Because if it is, it's totally cool.
not_available Believe me, most of the women that I've been with have had a hard time.
not_available But I heard about this new technique, and I've been looking forward to trying it out.
not_available Would you like me to try it out with you? Okay.
not_available # Drama queen # # Craving fame and all that's decadent # # Lying through your teeth again # # Suicidal # 
not_available I was watching that.
not_available Too bad.
not_available You trying to pick a fight with me? 
not_available Maybe I am.
not_available If this is about Celeste, I thought we were okay with that.
not_available We were, now we're not.
not_available You can't just be okay with something and then not be okay with it for no reason.
not_available Maybe I've had time to think it through and it's not digesting well.
not_available Well, take a Tums, why don't you? I fucked Sarge.
not_available Who? The veiny guy from La Habra who didn't secretly want me to have women's breasts! Wait, when did you fuck the veiny guy from La Habra? After we agreed not to fuck anybody outside the relationship! Then, why would you ask me not to fuck anybody outside the relationship, if you were gonna turn right around and fuck somebody yourself? I don't know! Because I didn't want you to fuck anybody else, and I wasn't planning on fucking anybody either! Well, how is that fair? I knew that I could do it without it meaning anything.
not_available Believe me, I can do it without it meaning anything too! What's that supposed to mean? It means that I wouldn't do it if it meant anything, because I love you.
not_available You are not getting off that easy.
not_available Look, I fucked Celeste, you fucked veiny guy from La Habra.
not_available Tit for tat, we're even.
not_available Okay, you don't get to say the word "tit" to me, ever.
not_available I'm taking a shower.
not_available Yeah, well, don't blow anybody while you're in there.
not_available Wow.
not_available Pretty good, huh? 
not_available Oh my God.
not_available You know what it's called? It has a name? "Grinding the corn." "Grinding the corn"? What's the "corn"? You know, with like, a mortar and pestle? Only you push the pestle against the rim of the mortar not in the bowl.
not_available Oh.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi, Maya.
not_available Come in.
not_available Is he going to be okay? It's not my fault, is it? Of course not, Fisher.
not_available There was probably something wrong with it.
not_available I think I'd like to go home now.
