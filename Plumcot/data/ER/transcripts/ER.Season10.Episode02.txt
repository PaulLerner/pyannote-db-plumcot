not_available See? Din't even hurt.
not_available What should I tell Weaver? 
not_available Whatever you want.
not_available Someone has died.
not_available Who? 
not_available Someone named Kovac.
not_available A Dr.
not_available Luka Kovac.
not_available You're gonna go back there? Why? 
not_available Because I left him there.
not_available Left him where? At the clinic in Matenda.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 10x02 "THE LOST" You sober? I'm sorry? 
not_available You look sober.
not_available I make it a rule to always land in Kinshasa drunk.
not_available It's my third.
not_available Steve Davidson.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Shell? Xerox? No? You give me a second, I'll figure it out.
not_available I would say Coke out of Atlanta.
not_available Am I right? The new bottling plant.
not_available Sorry, no.
not_available May I have another Dewar's, please? Could I get you something? Okay, I give up.
not_available Who are you with? I'm just here on a personal matter.
not_available Well, there's not much competition for the seats, is there? I guess the "see a brutal genocide" tour package didn't sell very well.
not_available So, what about you? Why are you going to the Congo? I'm with the embassy.
not_available Financial liaison.
not_available Furthering the American investment interest abroad.
not_available Spreading the democratic ideals one Big Mac at a time.
not_available So a personal matter, huh? A friend of mine was murdered.
not_available I'm gonna go bring him home.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available If you need to see a familiar face while you're in Kinshasa 
not_available you give me a call.
not_available Thanks.
not_available John! John.
not_available So, what happened? We don't know.
not_available What about Patrique? He's still missing.
not_available Was the Red Cross able to recover Luka's body? Excuse me.
not_available Ten thousand people have been killed in the last two weeks.
not_available There are many bodies in Kivu.
not_available How much longer do we have to wait? It's the Congo.
not_available Could be days.
not_available How are you feeling? Terrible.
not_available Who are we waiting for? I 
not_available Please.
not_available No more talking.
not_available Gillian? Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Please.
not_available Can you tell us what happened? 
not_available No, I'm afraid not.
not_available After numerous attempts we were able to negotiate a passage into the Mai Mai
not_available held territory to evacuate wounded noncombatants.
not_available The Mai Mai provided us with a list of the known dead.
not_available That's it? 
not_available They also provided us with some personal items to identify remains.
not_available Can we get the body back? Are there ways that that can be arranged? Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available When the fighting stops, we'll make every effort to identify remains.
not_available How long will that take? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Days? Weeks? Months? Someone from the negotiating team might know more.
not_available Can we speak with them? They're in Kisangani.
not_available Debbie? 
not_available And Gerard.
not_available Have you tried Bob Chase from the American Embassy? He has contacts with the Congolese army.
not_available He may be able to help you.
not_available Who's Debbie? She's with the Red Cross field office in Kisangani.
not_available You'd like her.
not_available She's your type.
not_available What's my type? We shouldn't have left him out there.
not_available He didn't want us to stay.
not_available Should've stayed anyway.
not_available Then you'd be dead too.
not_available Gillian, we have to go, or we won't get back before dark.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available What should I tell Weaver? Whatever you want.
not_available Can I tell her you're coming back? I don't know.
not_available Don't do anything stupid.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Like getting yourself killed.
not_available He wasn't an American citizen? No, but he'd been living and working in the States for years.
not_available You might have better luck at his embassy.
not_available It's tough to make inquiries on behalf of citizens of another country.
not_available Does Croatia have an embassy in the Congo? Croatia? No.
not_available He was a close friend? Yeah.
not_available We've worked together for years.
not_available The Mai Mai believe that foreigners are looting the Congo's natural resources.
not_available They see us as the enemy.
not_available It is very dangerous for Westerners.
not_available Can some sort of exchange be set up for the dead? I mean, aren't those things normally done? These guys don't know about the Geneva Convention, doctor.
not_available Most of them don't know about shoes.
not_available Nothing? 
not_available He said to be patient.
not_available What? Excuse me.
not_available Can you tell me, is Mr.
not_available Davidson working today? What did Bob Chase tell you? That we'd have to be patient.
not_available I'm sure that he knows better than I.
not_available There have to be other channels that we could pursue.
not_available Have you tried the U.N.
not_available offices or the Red Cross? Yeah.
not_available We've been bouncing around from office to office all day.
not_available Well, I'm sure they're trying everything they can.
not_available Look, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I am not suggesting this but my experience has been that there's not much in this country that can't be bought.
not_available What's he saying? 
not_available Well, he's just a little concerned that you're gonna walk around Kinshasa with $20,000 in your pocket.
not_available What does he expect me to do with it, stick it in my shoe? Well, it may not be safe to carry that much cash in the Congo.
not_available It's not safe to carry that much cash anywhere.
not_available But I don't think the Mai Mai take traveler's checks.
not_available You can't afford to put $20,000 on your credit card? FAC.
not_available Government soldiers.
not_available Heading west, away from Kivu.
not_available They're retreating.
not_available The Mai Mai will come again soon.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Refugees from the fighting.
not_available More come every day.
not_available The hospital is worse.
not_available I'll put these in your room.
not_available Give me that big one.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Still working bankers' hours, I see.
not_available Hello, doctor.
not_available I'm so sorry about Luka.
not_available How are you holding up? 
not_available Doing what we can.
not_available I brought you some things.
not_available Sterile gloves, needles, catheters, syringes IV ceftriaxone and Cipro.
not_available DPL sets, suture kits, old pulse ox.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Microscope.
not_available Tried to get a portable x
not_available ray, but it wouldn't fit in my carryon.
not_available Where did you get all of that? 
not_available My hospital in Chicago donated it.
not_available Do they know they donated it? 
not_available Yeah, more or less.
not_available You busy? Tenyear
not_available old with an abdominal GSW and gross hematuria.
not_available I'm not a surgeon.
not_available Dominic's been assisting and he never finished the sixth grade.
not_available We still have enough amoxicillin? Are you feeling all right, doctor? I'm just tired.
not_available I'll need help.
not_available Set me up with lidocaine, a suture kit and a scalpel.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available Base to mike one.
not_available Luka, Patrique, are you there? Luka, are you there? Over.
not_available Mike one to base.
not_available Luka, the fighting is getting heavy east of you.
not_available Copy.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Have you had any problems? No, no.
not_available Patients are improving.
not_available I'm gonna revise the flap on the little girl in a few minutes.
not_available You warned Patrique what he's in for, right? He's tough.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available I should go, save the batteries.
not_available Over.
not_available Okay.
not_available Be safe.
not_available Clear.
not_available Yeah, you too.
not_available Out.
not_available Doctor? Doctor? There she is.
not_available Debbie.
not_available Hey.
not_available Gillian.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available He was a friend of Luka's.
not_available I'm very sorry, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The ICRC in Kinshasa said that you were part of the negotiating team that you might have some information about what happened to Luka.
not_available No, sorry.
not_available They just gave us the list and a few personal items.
not_available Steve Davidson, American Embassy, said maybe you could get us into Kivu.
not_available I'm trying to recover Dr.
not_available Kovac's body.
not_available And I've brought a substantial amount of cash along to spread around if you think that might help.
not_available How much cash? 
not_available Twenty thousand dollars.
not_available That's a lot of cash.
not_available I work for the Red Cross, doctor.
not_available Our safety is dependent on our neutrality.
not_available If the armies or militia involved in this mess knew we gave money to the enemy money used to buy weapons or food, we'd be dead.
not_available And I don't mean dead in the water.
not_available I mean "head mounted on a sharpened stick" dead.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to offend you.
not_available You didn't.
not_available I was led to believe that money can be helpful in situations like this.
not_available So, what'll it take to get his body back? 
not_available Time.
not_available How much time? 
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available Thanks, Debbie.
not_available Sure.
not_available I told you she was your type.
not_available What? Not at all.
not_available Hey! Richie Rich.
not_available We've been negotiating to get back into Kivu for more of the wounded.
not_available I could use a doc to help transport them.
not_available Somebody in the camps might know something about your friend.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She's definitely not my type.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Luka.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Doctor.
not_available Please, we have to go.
not_available What? 
not_available You have a fever.
not_available Malaria? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Why did you wake me? The Mai Mai are in Masenga.
not_available They are burning the village.
not_available You were pretty hard on him.
not_available Who? John.
not_available He's cute, don't you think? 
not_available Not again.
not_available What was the last one? The surgeon from Atlanta? Turned out he had a wife and five kids.
not_available So? 
not_available You need medicine.
not_available I took Pansidar.
not_available We have some IV quinine left.
not_available Save it for the boy.
not_available He's getting better.
not_available I'm not that sick.
not_available I'll go get it.
not_available No! Save it for the boy, okay? Oh, my God.
not_available You guys burned the clinic to the ground? You guys You guys keep burning down hospitals.
not_available Where you gonna go when you get shot? Where are you gonna go when your mothers get sick?! Dr.
not_available John! He says many people died here.
not_available They took the bodies to Kasese.
not_available He thinks they're still there.
not_available Doctor.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available Early.
not_available Where is everyone? 
not_available They left.
not_available Where did they go? 
not_available They didn't want the Mai Mais to find them with us.
not_available With me, you mean, huh? 
not_available They should go too.
not_available They are worried about you.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available Why? You need medicine.
not_available I told you to save the quinine for the boy.
not_available I gave him one bag and kept the other for you.
not_available Give me your arm.
not_available They should go while they can.
not_available No! You too.
not_available Go.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Leave me the radio.
not_available Take them to safety.
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available We don't have the radio.
not_available We must've left it at the camp.
not_available When Charles come, he'll look for us at the clinic first.
not_available It should be safe now.
not_available The Mai Mais would have already stolen everything and left.
not_available He's dead, doctor.
not_available I know you wanna get him back but Kasese is 10 miles from here.
not_available I stopped in Matenda because it was on the way.
not_available Give me a vehicle.
not_available After we've triaged, I'll have it back.
not_available No, okay? No.
not_available And don't make me regret bringing you.
not_available She won't do it.
not_available What's her complaint? She's afraid she might be pregnant.
not_available She was raped.
not_available They all were.
not_available There are more injured down there.
not_available I'm gonna examine you, okay? Gillian! What? 
not_available Gillian! I know you, don't I? They were at the clinic when we left.
not_available The boy had pertussis.
not_available The Mai Mai came.
not_available I think they have gone.
not_available Keep walking.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Do you want a beer? Beer.
not_available It's warm, tastes like formaldehyde, but it's wet.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available What is that thing, a radio? iPod.
not_available Digital music player.
not_available Fancy.
not_available What are you listening to? Les Nubians.
not_available The Nubians.
not_available No Dixie Chicks? 
not_available No Dixie Chicks.
not_available You don't like the Dixie Chicks? So they just left him there? In the jungle? The Congolese were afraid to be found with Luka and Patrique.
not_available And that's all he knew? That's all he knew.
not_available Do you ever get worried that these guys are gonna get bored and start shooting? I don't think about it.
not_available If I did, I'd probably never leave Seattle.
not_available You know I consider myself reasonably well
not_available informed.
not_available But before I came, I hadn't heard a thing about the Congo.
not_available Nobody at home gives a damn what happens out here.
not_available There's no oil here.
not_available Millions of people are slaughtered and we're too busy eating Happy Meals.
not_available What are you doing here? You don't seem the type.
not_available What's the type? Macho adrenaline junkies and "save the world" peacenik freaks.
not_available Which one are you? Which do you think? I don't know what I'm doing out here.
not_available I've been seeing this woman.
not_available She's great.
not_available But it ain't good for her or for me.
not_available It's simpler here.
not_available People need help.
not_available I can help them.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I think I'm tired.
not_available You should get some rest.
not_available I'm getting you up early.
not_available We'll take the Rover to Kasese while they load the trucks.
not_available See what we can find out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is she still in there? Yes.
not_available You speak English? Please, I speak no French.
not_available Do you know what are they going to do with us? They're waiting for someone to come and tell them what to do.
not_available Can you tell them I'm a geologist? I'm not involved in the war.
not_available I'm only here for rocks.
not_available Another truck with soldiers.
not_available They are coming.
not_available Can you see? No.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available They are coming back.
not_available Damn, Gillian, how can you smoke this early in the morning? So, what made you change your mind? About what? About coming out here.
not_available You've come a long way.
not_available I figured I could help you get the last few miles.
not_available Here we go.
not_available What was this place? A school, I think.
not_available He says the bodies from the clinic are inside.
not_available You don't have to.
not_available We can just go.
not_available Are you religious, Patrique? No.
not_available I was raised in the Church.
not_available Catholic.
not_available I used to go twice a week with my mother.
not_available It was beautiful.
not_available I liked the music, the singing.
not_available Do you still go? 
not_available No.
not_available I stopped when my children were killed.
not_available I couldn't believe in a God that will allow such a cruel thing to happen.
not_available It's really hard to feel the Holy Spirit's presence on a day like today, huh? I'm sorry, Patrique.
not_available I shouldn't have let you stay.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Gillian, stay outside.
not_available It isn't him.
not_available What? 
not_available This isn't Luka! What? Ask him! Was he there when these men were killed? This man.
not_available This man.
not_available Did you see this man? Where is this man? What's he saying? What's he saying? 
not_available He says that Luka is a priest.
not_available A what? 
not_available A priest.
not_available No, no.
not_available Don't you
not_available No, no, no.
not_available No.
not_available Please, please.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Luka.
not_available Is he alive? Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available How you feeling? Terrible.
not_available Where am I going? Home.
not_available Where's that? America.
not_available Got a medical transport plane in Kinshasa waiting to take you back.
not_available Expensive.
not_available I know somebody who knows somebody.
not_available Give this to Abby when you see her.
not_available You're not coming? I think I'm gonna stick around for a while.
not_available If she asks just tell her Tell her I was lost, and now I'm found.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, back to work.
not_available You really don't like the Dixie Chicks? Everybody likes the Dixie Chicks.
not_available Everybody? 
not_available Everybody with any taste.
