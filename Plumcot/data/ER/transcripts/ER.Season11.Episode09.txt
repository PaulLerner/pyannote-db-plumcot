not_available Yeah, I tried that.
not_available He desats.
not_available Hard to breathe.
not_available Carol?

not_available You're his doctor.
not_available Now he's got crackles in the apices.
not_available Is Renal coming to take off the fluid?

not_available Don't lie.
not_available He's not better.
not_available Look at him.
not_available BP's stabilized, 119/85.
not_available Pulse down to 115.
not_available He's had lupus cerebritis? Two years ago.
not_available It calmed down after a steroid burst.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'd like to get a head scan to make sure the cerebritis isn't back and there's no internal bleeding.
not_available I have a discharge and then I'll take you.
not_available I could take him.
not_available Do you know where it is? Can his wife come with us? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Put him on a portable monitor and O2, and call me if you have any questions.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Would you like to color? Are you excited about Santa coming tonight? Why not? 
not_available Santa's not coming for me.
not_available Mattie, that's not true.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought you had a plane to catch.
not_available Hey, Mattie.
not_available How you doing? You know, when I was a kid, I used to fight with my brother all the time.
not_available Did he get hurt? Yeah, he got hurt.
not_available I got hurt.
not_available Kids get hurt sometimes, by accident.
not_available I was mad at him for not playing with me.
not_available So I threw his book out.
not_available And he went to get it, and got hit.
not_available Mattie, it's not your fault Harry got hurt.
not_available It is.
not_available I tried to help him but I couldn't.
not_available I had to go get my mom.
not_available Your mom wasn't there? She was at work.
not_available You and Harry were alone in the car? 
not_available We live in the car.
not_available Don't tell my mom.
not_available I'm not supposed to say that.
not_available My father's a doctor.
not_available He knows what he's asking.
not_available Without the G
not_available tube and IV, he would've died weeks ago.
not_available Oh, so now lifesaving technology is bad? 
not_available If someone doesn't want it.
not_available How do you know he doesn't? 
not_available He's not even in his right mind.
not_available After he sleeps, he's lucid.
not_available Each time, every day, he begs me to help him.
not_available Removing the support's not enough.
not_available It would take him days to die of dehydration and he'd be in misery.
not_available Put him in a nursing home.
not_available So he can be somebody else's problem? Who doesn't know or love him? 
not_available He won't even know that he's there.
not_available You're not Chinese.
