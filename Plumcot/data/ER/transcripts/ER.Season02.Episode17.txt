not_available Couple of millimeters, easy to miss.
not_available We both see it.
not_available Today's x
not_available ray tells us where to look.
not_available But you can't change the fact that he misdiagnosed the kid.

not_available Girls, there's plenty of me to go around.
not_available There's only one way to settle this.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Best out of three.
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Hugo needs to be cleaned up and we're really busy here.
not_available Can you do it? No.
not_available That's a nurse's job.
not_available My mother was a nurse.
not_available Great.
not_available That's great.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Yes.
not_available Can you talk to that lady? 
not_available Who is she? The mother of the junkie that ran the red light.
not_available Ma'am? I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available You worked on my son? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available They told me you saved his life.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Did they tell you what happened? 
not_available Yeah, some idiot crashed into him.
not_available No, he ran a red light.
not_available There were eyewitnesses.
not_available He was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.
not_available My son doesn't use drugs.
not_available Tell it to the police.
not_available Police? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available His tox screen was positive.
not_available You reported him? 
not_available It's required by the law.
not_available The test was wrong.
not_available You're son was drunk, coked out of his mind.
not_available Got behind the wheel, put three people in hospital and killed a girl.
not_available Dad, did you hear what I said? Dad? I'm losing you.
not_available I'm losing you.
not_available Can you hear me? You gotta call me when you dock, okay? A hematologist is gonna be down.
not_available He's gonna wanna run some more tests.
not_available A hematologist? What is that? 
not_available It's a blood doctor.
not_available Why do I have to see him? You are severely anemic, and we need to find out why.
not_available I'm not understanding you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Berenson is gonna explain it all to you when he gets here.
not_available What is the treatment for anemia? 
not_available I couldn't tell you without more tests.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available How serious is this? I wouldn't even hazard a guess.
not_available Dr.
not_available Berenson is gonna explain all this to you when he gets here.
not_available I've got another patient.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available All set? 
not_available Where are we going? Surprise.
not_available He came in for a sore knee.
not_available Anyone could have missed that.
not_available He could lose his leg.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Kathy Snyder, hospital counsel.
not_available I asked her to come down.
not_available I guess I'm looking at my first malpractice suit.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available It's my understanding that the patient and his family are unaware that the tumor was visible on the earlier x
not_available ray.
not_available There's no legal obligation to make them aware of it.
not_available So we don't say anything? What good will it do? Will it change the treatment? 
not_available No.
not_available You comfortable with that? I don't see any advantage in telling them.
not_available There is none.
not_available So where's the kid? 
not_available He's been moved to Exam 4.
not_available His grandfather know about the cancer? 
not_available I haven't told him.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Not a good idea.
not_available You should disengage from the case.
not_available Kathy's right, Doug.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available My case, my responsibility.
not_available Raise your arms, Hugo.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Use a lot of soap down there.
not_available I'm a mess.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available Scrub really hard.
not_available When you're done, we'll get you clean clothes.
not_available Can I keep my lucky shoes? 
not_available If you use more shampoo.
not_available We need a nurse in 2.
not_available Oh, I am so sorry.
not_available They need the beds changed.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Hey.
not_available I've been looking everywhere for you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm hiding out.
not_available You want some juice? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I hear you got in a slap fight with a patient.
not_available And lost.
not_available Oh, man, I just want this morning to end.
not_available What happened with Chloe? She wants to play Mommy again.
not_available I called my lawyer and the police.
not_available Police? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What if she tries to take her? I don't know, maybe I can buy her off.
not_available Does she know you're adopting her? 
not_available No, and I'm not gonna tell her.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available What? I thought your eyes were brown.
not_available For 15 extra bucks, they can be blue.
not_available Does it look dumb? No.
not_available I like blue eyes.
not_available Now what? Oh, my God! Call security to Daycare.
not_available Looking good, Hugo.
not_available We'll call you a cab, they'll take you to a shelter.
not_available What about my shoes? What about them? 
not_available I need some tape.
not_available Here.
not_available Patient in 3 needs a nurse.
not_available I'm busy.
not_available Excuse me, any scissors? This particular patient is puking his guts out.
not_available What do you want me to do? Get him an emesis basin.
not_available That's a nurse's job.
not_available Can you find another nurse? 
not_available They're all busy.
not_available What? 
not_available Excuse me, I cut my finger.
not_available Oh, Hugo, you're gonna need stitches.
not_available That's a P.A.
not_available job.
not_available Jeanie, Hugo.
not_available Hugo, Jeanie.
not_available Watch it, watch it.
not_available Sir.
not_available Sir, please, I need your help.
not_available Come on.
not_available Where's Susie? Calm down
not_available Don't tell me to calm down! Where is she? She's taking her first steps.
not_available I didn't want you to miss it.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Susie.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available That's my girl.
not_available Oh, yeah, that's my big girl.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bowman? Can I see you out here, please? Dr.
not_available Ross, right? You're the same one who took care of Brett a few months ago.
not_available That's right.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I'm afraid that the news isn't good.
not_available His leg is broken? No, his injury alerted us to a much more serious problem.
not_available He has an osteosarcoma.
not_available It's a bone tumor in his leg, above his knee.
not_available A tumor? 
not_available It's a form of cancer.
not_available How bad is it? 
not_available Well, we need to determine that.
not_available There's an oncologist on his way down here.
not_available He's a friend of mine.
not_available He's one of the best in the country.
not_available And he's had great success with these kinds of cases.
not_available My boy has cancer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bowman.
not_available Hi.
not_available Did Dr.
not_available Greene talk to you? No, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Oh.
not_available So he explained the situation? He did, but I don't understand.
not_available Brett was in here four months ago, he was okay.
not_available This cropped up so fast.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What exactly did Dr.
not_available Ross tell you? Well, my boy's got cancer.
not_available That is what we're talking about, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's happening with the Bowman case? Excuse us.
not_available Doug's handling it.
not_available I just talked to the grandfather.
not_available Doug didn't tell him he missed the diagnosis.
not_available Hospital counsel advised against it.
not_available You're not gonna tell them the truth? It's not gonna change the diagnosis, and we're under no legal obligation.
not_available What about an ethical obligation? 
not_available You weren't originally on the case.
not_available And you're not on it now.
not_available They have a right to know.
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available We made a decision.
not_available That's final.
not_available Lucky the kid came in.
not_available Can you take him, Frank? I'd like to, they don't have insurance.
not_available Are they friends of yours? No, they just need a break.
not_available Sorry, there's not much I can do.
not_available Okay, I guess I'm gonna have to send my referrals elsewhere.
not_available It's not that I don't want to help.
not_available How about waving your professional fee? I could, but chemotherapy's expensive.
not_available Ballpark, how much? 
not_available 12,000.
not_available That doesn't cover surgery.
not_available How about I give you 5000, I work in your clinic on my days off.
not_available If you do this for every patient
not_available Would you do it? Would you do it? Okay.
not_available One day a week, four to five months ought to just about cover it.
not_available Deal.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Jerry, have you seen Susan? 
not_available Not for a while.
not_available Hope nothing happened upstairs.
not_available What's so funny? Right after Jeanie stitched up Hugo's finger, he tripped on the way out.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Now she's got to stitch up his head.
not_available Susan, is everything all right? 
not_available It's great.
not_available What happened? 
not_available It was amazing.
not_available What? 
not_available Susie took her first steps.
not_available Two little steps.
not_available You have crumbs.
not_available Hazards of the hirsute.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Yes.
not_available I want to thank you for everything you've done for my grandson.
not_available We'll be leaving as soon as we talk to the oncologist.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bowman.
not_available I think there's something you should know.
not_available Just follow my finger.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Extraocular movements are intact.
not_available We were dollying in for a close
not_available up, and we hit a sandbag.
not_available Eyepiece smashed right into my eye.
not_available Oh, so you're a cameraman

not_available You know, I thought I read somewhere that women find baldness a sign of virility.
not_available Who told you that, some bald guy? 
not_available Hugo needs a ride back to the shelter.
not_available Call him a cab.

not_available Hugo will wait.
not_available The nurse will be right with you.
not_available I wait here the whole damn day, and all you can say is you're sorry? I have your tests.
not_available I called in a hematologist to come.
not_available See, now that is exactly what the damn medical student said three hours ago! 
not_available This had better be worse than anemia.
not_available I'm afraid it is.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ledbetter, your blood smear shows evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia.

not_available Why? I went out to lunch to celebrate and had a little champagne.
not_available You drank during rotation hours? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's bad enough you failed to answer your pages but the use of alcohol on call is inexcusable.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's grounds for expulsion.
not_available But But I just matched.
not_available Another basket of treats for our fallen med student? I'm afraid so.
not_available I'm gonna have to beg off for tonight.
not_available Our friendly in
not_available house attorney wants me to file an incident report.
not_available I was thinking about canceling too.
not_available No, don't.
not_available You go.
not_available Have a good time.
not_available Don't let that goatee go to waste.
not_available Did you hear about him and Benton? Hear about it? I saw them practically duke it out in the trauma room.
not_available Benton's right.
not_available If it was my kid, I'd want to know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carter, I've got another basket.
not_available Leave it outside.
not_available What have we got? Pâté, smoked oysters pickled quail eggs Are you all right? I really screwed up.
not_available I neglected my patient, got really out of control.
not_available What you did was incredibly stupid, and you're in big trouble.
not_available But Hicks can't expel you without a hearing.
not_available Will I lose my match? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Oh, God! I'll see what I can do.
not_available Note says, "Love, Nana and Poopie.
not_available " 
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need some help.
not_available What is it? My partner backed over a bum in the parking lot.
not_available Are you okay, sir? I didn't see you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hugo, are you all right? 
not_available What happened? I was fixing my shoe.
not_available You forgot to call me a cab.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available He was sitting on the curb, and I didn't see him.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Listen, just stay out here and don't hurt anyone else.
not_available Cut the kid some slack, Shep.
not_available It looks like a fractured tib
not_available fib.
not_available My friends were right.
not_available This is a dangerous place.
not_available Oh, Hugo, I'm so sorry.
not_available Me too.
not_available It's our fault.
not_available Go check on your partner.
not_available We'll take care of Hugo.
not_available Hey, and go easy on him.
not_available I told you not to say anything.
not_available Well, I didn't agree with that.
not_available You took it upon yourself to tell the family the ramifications of which affect Doug, me your colleagues and the entire hospital.
not_available If Ross had caught it four months ago, that kid might not be losing his leg.
not_available That wasn't your decision to make.
not_available I tell the truth and break some code? This isn't about truth or any kind of code.
not_available This is about your guilty conscience.
not_available You didn't have the guts to speak up about Vucelich so you blow the whistle on Doug.
not_available The truth is a lot easier to tell when it's not your own career on the line.
not_available Hey, where's your partner? The moron? He's upstairs drinking cocoa.
not_available You really shouldn't ride him so hard.
not_available The department throws me a rookie.
not_available I guess it's their way of punishing me.
not_available They giving you a hard time? They say they would have done the same thing.
not_available You don't believe them? What are they supposed to say? 
not_available Nobody blames you, Shep.
not_available I led Raul into that fire.
not_available You saved three kids.
not_available And I killed my best friend.
not_available Hey, how's it going? I saw 48 kids that day.
not_available That's about 12 minutes a kid.
not_available I only gave the Bowman kid about 10.
not_available I guess I should have given him a couple more.
not_available Benton was out of line.
not_available He just told the truth.
not_available Now you have to pay for it.
not_available No, it's the kid who has to pay for it.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I think I lost my contact.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Kathy? What are you doing here? 
not_available Same as you, I suspect.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Are you sure it's not still in your eye? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Open wide.
not_available You have one blue eye and one brown.
not_available Yeah, well, for 15 bucks they throw in the tinted pair.
not_available I'm gonna need my glasses if I'm gonna find this.
not_available Do you have lens insurance? 
not_available No.
not_available Then we better keep looking.
not_available This is so embarrassing.
not_available Wait.
not_available Don't move.
not_available It was caught in your goatee.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What do you want for dinner tonight, honey? Want some smushed carrots? I have to talk to you.
not_available There's nothing more to say.
not_available Can't I just look at her, please? Stay away from us.
not_available She's so beautiful.
not_available She's so big.
not_available Is she crawling yet? 
not_available Chloe, I mean it.
not_available I know I can't change what's happened, but let's not fight, okay? I saw a lawyer today.
not_available She said I could file for visitation rights.
not_available I'm adopting her.
not_available She's my baby, Susan, and I want her back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hi.
not_available Soup of the day to go.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available Hey, Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Rough day.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Yeah, well, not according to everybody else.
not_available I broke the code.
not_available Are you okay? It's kind of like that Boys Club camp.
not_available Did my mother tell you everything about me? You were what, 12? 
not_available Ten.
not_available Yeah, 10.
not_available She said a kid ripped off the equipment fund showed you the money, you turned him in.
not_available And nobody spoke to me all summer.
not_available I thought they broke your nose.
not_available I told her I took a curve ball.
not_available She knew.
not_available Yeah, well, I guess you never learn.
not_available "Good night, room.
not_available Good night, moon.
not_available Good night, cow jumping over the moon.
not_available Good night, air.
not_available Good night, bears.
not_available Good night, chairs.
