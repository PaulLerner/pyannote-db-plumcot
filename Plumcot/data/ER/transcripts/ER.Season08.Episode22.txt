not_available I don't know.

not_available Think you're jumping to conclusions? 
not_available You seen smallpox before? No, that's my point.
not_available It could be anything.

not_available Are you 100 percent certain? You wanna risk exposure to the city? Whoa! How bad is it? 
not_available Killed half of Europe.

not_available This is just routine.
not_available Then you better tell them why the doors are locked.
not_available Carter, wait.
not_available Do you know that family sat in Chairs for 45 minutes? 
not_available Should have been isolated.
not_available They would, had I seen them.
not_available Pretty hard to miss.
not_available We're down three nurses.
not_available I told you.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available If it's smallpox, it could get septic.
not_available Hope I'm not right.
not_available You'll need help.
not_available Don't come if you're worried about exposure.
not_available I've already been exposed.
not_available Who's in charge? I got a cop telling me I can't go.
not_available Why are you detaining us? 
not_available I'm about to explain.
not_available If I don't get a cigarette, I'll go postal.
not_available Ma'am, please!

not_available It did in '95.
not_available What the hell is going on, huh? 
not_available Does this place even have a license? Sorry.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available As you may have noticed there are guards posted at all the exits.
not_available This is because we have a potential public health concern.
not_available I would like to emphasize the word "potential.
not_available " Because at present, we don't have any conclusive evidence.
not_available City authorities are on their way to assist.
not_available However, until we have more information we ask that no one enter or leave the department.
not_available What do you mean we can't leave? 
not_available This is purely a precaution.
not_available When I know more, you'll know more.
not_available Thank you for your patience.
not_available I want out of here! I'm getting out! My wife is expecting me! Don't you understand? What kind of authorities are you talking about? That helping? Do I look like her? 
not_available Not as bad.
not_available Was anybody sick around you? 
not_available I don't think so.

not_available Where? Central Africa.
not_available Craig works for the State Department.
not_available When did you get back? 
not_available Two weeks ago.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, we need to keep you both in isolation.
not_available Why? 
not_available You could be incubating the virus.
not_available You probably both are.
not_available You said 10 to 14 days.
not_available We need to know where you've been, who you've been with since your kids developed a fever.
not_available The kids were in school.
not_available They could get sicker? We need skin biopsies and smears to send to the CDC biocontainment lab.
not_available They could die? 
not_available We're being careful.
not_available Nothing's confirmed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Is she tachycardiac? I don't know, but you're freaking them out.
not_available Slow down.

not_available Oh, come on! Were you really here last Tuesday, Stan? Yeah, sure I was.
not_available You know, they say this could be very serious.
not_available I've had gastritis, hepatitis, pancreatitis.
not_available A little pox is not gonna bother me.
not_available You got a temperature too? 
not_available Probably just a flu.
not_available It's not smallpox.

not_available It's just gotta be a mistake.
not_available County.
not_available How in the hell long is it gonna be? 
not_available Sir, I don't know.

not_available Does she have a blown pupil? 
not_available No.
not_available Then she can wait.
not_available She's an older trauma patient.
not_available Do you know where you are? 
not_available Looks like a hospital.
not_available A crappy one.
not_available I'd say she's pretty lucid.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available David Torres, Public Health.
not_available We can take over now.
not_available The crisis or the patient care?

not_available c.
not_available It's 80 degrees outside.
not_available Welcome to the hot zone.
not_available May I see the infected kids, please? No, the infection's in the bloodstream, which makes the lungs leak fluid.
not_available But she's been responding to oxygen.
not_available We never should have been there! You could have stayed home.
not_available And your children don't see you for a year! If there was an outbreak, we'd have heard.
not_available Craig, we were targets.
not_available A maniac is using this as a weapon.
not_available There are a lot of unknowns.
not_available There's something wrong with Bree.
not_available Pulse ox is down to 83 on 15 liters.
not_available What does that mean? That means she's not getting enough oxygen.
not_available Come with me, Adam.
not_available You're fine.
not_available I just need room to work on your sister.
not_available Etomidate, atropine and sux.
not_available What is that? Medication to sedate her.
not_available We may put a tube down her throat.
not_available Abby, wait! 
not_available We don't want to infect Pratt's patient.
not_available We need a pediatric intubation tray.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll go around.
not_available Keep her on 100 percent non

not_available We're gonna need another room.
not_available And a decontamination area.

not_available Why don't you calm down? We don't know if it's smallpox.
not_available Bag him.

not_available You can't.
not_available I work here.

not_available Especially when the mother is sitting there.
not_available It was worth a shot! 
not_available Well, you were wrong.
not_available Well, now we'll never know.

not_available What do you need? Have to use the bathroom? Yes! Not that it's any of your business.
not_available How bad is it?

not_available This morning, a 5year
not_available old girl came in with a rash that looked like smallpox.
not_available She died quickly.
not_available Her older brother is still critical.
not_available We don't know what it is, and we don't know how they got it.
not_available But it's here and it needs to be contained.
not_available This is not about denying your civil rights.
not_available This is about protecting you.
not_available If we let you go, you could carry the disease home to your own families.
not_available So please stay here.
not_available Help us.
not_available And we'll all get through this.
not_available Yeah, okay, good.
not_available Let's talk in two hours.

not_available An orthopox? 
not_available Right.
not_available So it is smallpox.
not_available Not necessarily.
not_available They're still running the PCR.
not_available How much longer? Make yourselves comfortable.
not_available Look at the bright 
side Only two critical patients and we're closed for paramedics.
not_available So, what now? 
not_available Well, we can watch ourselves on TV.
not_available So far, the only suspected cases of smallpox are at County General in Chicago.
not_available 50 cc's of urine output in the last hour.
not_available Well, I guess that's something.
not_available His kidneys are working.
not_available I cannot wait to leave.
not_available I'm gonna take a two
not_available hour shower.
not_available I'm gonna sleep for 24 hours.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He's stable.
not_available We know it's some form of orthopox, so we need to limit contact.
not_available Haven't we been doing that? 
not_available You've been doing a great job.
not_available The department would like to thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Unfortunately, the two of you are gonna have to remain in this quarantine area.
not_available Why? We're not infectious.
not_available Just a precaution.
not_available Why don't you just follow protocol and give us the vaccine? As soon as we get final confirmation on what we're dealing with.
not_available It's smallpox.
not_available The U.S.
not_available hasn't seen this since 1949.
not_available Due to the unknown origin of this outbreak, we're being extra cautious.
not_available Won't be much longer.
not_available Thanks, guys.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available How much does this suck? "The department would like to thank you, but we can't bring you a fan." Is it me? It's like a sauna in here.
not_available I'm soaked.
not_available Do you have a fever? No! 
not_available Sit down.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Take your temperature.
not_available I'm not infectious.
