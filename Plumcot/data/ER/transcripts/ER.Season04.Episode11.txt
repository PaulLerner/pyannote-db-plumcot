
not_available ER Previously on ER 
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning.
not_available You were involved in a very serious automobile accident 10 days ago.
not_available Do you understand? And I think it would be great if she were to marry me.
not_available God! 
not_available What? WHORE I don't have to defend my wasted life in medicine.
not_available Do you have a son? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available When the SPG Attendings start backing you up next week we'll make your job a lot easier.
not_available You're preaching to the choir.
not_available Less work is fine with me.
not_available If you're reinstated, you'll let the matter drop? Yes.
not_available "Think Warm Thoughts" I'll be back by 6.
not_available Have you seen my gloves? I got an idea.
not_available Why don't we set a date? I gotta be at the clinic at 9.
not_available Quit joking with me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I'm halfway out the door and you wanna talk about that? 
not_available Right.
not_available We got a lot of time.
not_available Oh, what are these? What is up with you? What is that? 
not_available Doug.
not_available I just wanted to get a quick size.
not_available I'll get you a rock that'll knock your eye out.
not_available Doug, I don't need a ring.
not_available Sure you do, to make it real.
not_available A ring doesn't make it real.
not_available It's real because we say it's real.
not_available You do wanna marry me, don't you? 
not_available Of course I wanna marry you.
not_available But I did the whole ring and the setting the date.
not_available Blahblah
not_available blah.
not_available That's not what I want.
not_available I am so happy right now.
not_available This is so perfect.
not_available Why can't we just be two people who are getting married? Cheap date.
not_available Talk about prepared for anything.
not_available I've been wanting to use these on you.
not_available Hey! You haven't already? 
not_available I got this, Kerry.
not_available Go inside.
not_available No.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I hope this isn't an omen for my day.
not_available When Anspaugh sees those figures, he is gonna wanna bury your children.
not_available It's not the first
not_available month figures I'm worried about.
not_available Go inside.
not_available It's freezing.
not_available Synergix taking over makes sense.
not_available If you can't convince Don Anspaugh of that, I'm telling you I can.
not_available We could just disappear.
not_available Go to St.
not_available Barth's.
not_available Let them all freeze to death.
not_available Go in the car.
not_available Think hot thoughts.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah? That is the filthiest thing I have ever heard.
not_available With the possible exception of 
this Kerry Weaver, you are a bad, bad girl.
not_available Lizzie, is this your Mustang? Yes.
not_available I'm leasing it.
not_available There's nothing like a good, American
not_available made muscle car.
not_available If I'd known this was your car, I'd sniff the tail pipe.
not_available Excuse me? I thought we were talking about sex.
not_available Is Allison Beaumont ready for the O.R.? We were talking about sex? Lizzie, does she know what's happening this afternoon? I'll get her consent for the surgery.
not_available Allison's ready for whatever.
not_available Good attitude.
not_available But she's been rather down about her vocal
not_available cord paralysis.
not_available Remind me and I'll tell her about collagen injection.
not_available I've told her about medialization therapy.
not_available She'd like usMy headand
not_available neck consult doesn't do that.
not_available But David Kotlowitz is right across town at Northwestern.
not_available Insurance won't cover it.
not_available Collagen injection is standard.
not_available Couldn't it be worked out? Medialization is permanent.
not_available I'll explain it to Allison.
not_available You stay focused on the fibular transfer.
not_available Damn it! Do something about this crazy cracker! 
not_available Give us all a break, Carlene, please.
not_available I'm in pain, for your information.
not_available You need to put a sign on this thing.
not_available It just took my money.
not_available Will you sit down and be quiet? 
not_available I'm thirsty.
not_available A water fountain's down the hall.
not_available Forget it.
not_available You know, I do want my 75 cents back, though.
not_available I put some money in there too.
not_available Nice try, Carlene.
not_available I've been sitting here for 45 minutes! Ain't no nurse ask me what's wrong! Got any more gum? 
not_available Nicotine gum.
not_available Quitting? 
not_available Never should've started.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You shouldn't have.
not_available Dr.
not_available Swift.
not_available How are you doing? You're the SPG Attending? 
not_available To lighten your load.
not_available I saw you in that documentary.
not_available You got a lot of face time.
not_available Mark, you looked a little haggard.
not_available Are you letting this job get to you? Help me! 
not_available Oh, look at that idiot.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, help me! We need some help in here! 
not_available I'm okay.
not_available You look it.
not_available I'm tired of your mouth.
not_available Just take it easy, all right? So looking ahead to your third year, you stand at the crossroads.
not_available You have an opportunity in clerkships that will be both challenging and inspiring to you.
not_available I hope I did justice presenting what is rewarding about Emergency Medicine.
not_available Now, with the time we have left, anybody have any questions? Don't ask me about the heat.
not_available I have no idea why this room is freezing.
not_available Do people come into the ER with objects stuck in their rectums? That's not the kind of info people are here for.
not_available I wouldn't mind hearing.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Sometimes it happens.
not_available What's the weirdest thing you ever took out of there? Bowling trophy.
not_available Now let's move on to something more substantive.
not_available Yeah? Did you ever kill anybody? 
not_available Okay.
not_available That's substantive.
not_available The answer is yes.
not_available An elderly man.
not_available I was a surgical intern.
not_available And while tapping his chest I accidentally lacerated his liver and he died in surgery.
not_available You left Surgery for Emergency Medicine? How come? In the Emergency Department you're seeing a lot of different people and doing a lot of different things.
not_available You're making a difference right on the spot.
not_available Can you make a career out of that? Do you see yourself still in ER 10, 15 years from now? 
not_available Fifteen years? Fifteen years.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, sure.
not_available Why not? Next question.
not_available If we have this impact in a limited role, why not overall management.
not_available You can take off your tap shoes, Dr.
not_available West.
not_available From when we met, I assumed your goal was to take over the ER.
not_available I'm surprised only by your timing.
not_available Can I have a moment with Kerry? Certainly.
not_available It's a part of my nature to move quickly when something feels right.
not_available I gotta say, Don, I've been just blown away by these numbers.
not_available What do they say in the trenches? 
not_available I haven't heard any complaints.
not_available Mark would support them taking over? 
not_available It'd change how you do business.
not_available We haven't discussed it.
not_available The feelings of the staff are something I'd need to find out before telling the board.
not_available I thought it was a Ponzi scheme.
not_available But I've been with SPG a year and a half, and I'm having a great time.
not_available No kidding? 
not_available Beats my schedule.
not_available Let's see the other leg.
not_available Regular hours.
not_available And when 6 p.
not_available m.
not_available comes and that door hits me in the butt, I live a real life.
not_available Your knees are fine.
not_available What about my ankle? Want a portable? 
not_available Call Radiology.
not_available No.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Walk for me.
not_available Take a few steps.
not_available SPG uses practice guidelines.
not_available And here I've been skating by on medical judgment.
not_available Know how much money is wasted on X
not_available rays? If you're quitting, detoxify your body.
not_available Colon irrigations.
not_available Hello, Allison.
not_available Your laptop coming in useful? Looking for love on the Internet.
not_available There's a form of new technology where I'm way behind.
not_available I could be e
not_available mailing plenty of folk.
not_available Correspondence will always mean lovely stationery and writing on it by hand.
not_available I'm a blabbermouth.
not_available Two
not_available hour phone calls.
not_available Let me explain what we' re doing today.
not_available I have a consent form for you to sign.
not_available We' re taking you back to the O.
not_available R.
not_available to revise your fibular transfer.
not_available Why
not_available ? Type it out, Allison.
not_available Vocal
not_available cord surgery? Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano would like to talk to you about various options.
not_available But right now our main concern is with your leg.
not_available I'll come back again this afternoon, okay? I want my voice back, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I would have no life for the next six years.
not_available Surgery demands that commitment.
not_available But not everybody's willing to make that sacrifice.
not_available Got some hard thinking to do.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You were on the PBS documentary.
not_available Yes.
not_available I am.
not_available I was.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Laura Brown.
not_available It got me thinking about Emergency Medicine.
not_available You should come to a session of mine.
not_available Actually, it's next on my list.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, great presentation.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Take care.
not_available Thanks.
not_available She'll be something.
not_available So we're both stuck, eh? Romano shanghaied me.
not_available This is a total waste of time.
not_available You can't tell kids about it.
not_available Most won't know until they're in it, and then it'll be wrong for them.
not_available I got a bunch of stiffs in my session this morning.
not_available They just ask if you killed anybody.
not_available What do you say? Just med students.
not_available Can I ask you something? 
not_available We're a little swamped down here.
not_available Can you see some patients? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available The board may consider granting SPG an overall management contract.
not_available It's happening pretty fast.
not_available Think so? Attending coverage is one thing.
not_available But hopping into bed with them? It might make life easier
not_available I don't know.
not_available I want to keep decision
not_available making when it comes to patient care.
not_available You won't have to give that up.
not_available This is about Synergix taking over functions like billing, collectionsWhat's Anspaugh's take on it? 
not_available He's for it.
not_available It's something to think about.
not_available Christmas cookies! Freshly
not_available baked for everybody.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Homemade? 
not_available I don't want the holidays to be over.
not_available The best part of winter's finished.
not_available Not if you don't want it to be.
not_available Isn't he nice? He's so nice.
not_available These are so good.
not_available I need medical attention.
not_available How long am I supposed to wait? It's a busy day.
not_available Be patient, all right? You don't look busy, Miss Chiquita Banana, eating cookies.
not_available Nobody minds if you're in here where it's warm! But why can't you just be quiet and? 
not_available I can't understand you.
not_available Why don't you talk slow? In English? 
not_available Yeah? Can you believe me walking out after that thing fell on me? Look I'm sorry I gave you a hard time over a lousy 75 cents.
not_available I got over it.
not_available My name's John.
not_available Think I can give you a call sometime? I gotta tell you up front, because I believe in that and if it makes a difference, then so be 
it I spent time in prison.
not_available One mistake, had nothing to do with violence.
not_available But I got a good job now moving furniture.
not_available And I think me and you could have some fun together.
not_available Prison, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Randi.
not_available Randi.
not_available Your fasting blood glucose is 110.
not_available Excellent.
not_available You're watching your diet? 
not_available And exercising too.
not_available I wish everybody was that good about controlling their diabetes.
not_available That's just Mikey.
not_available Don't be scared of him.
not_available He likes it in there.
not_available It's warm.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, Mr.
not_available Roussakoff.
not_available Mom, what are you doing here? 
not_available Doug came to see me this morning.
not_available What? 
not_available To ask for your hand in marriage.
not_available What? He said he wanted my permission.
not_available He was very polite.
not_available Tell me this is a joke! 
not_available It's not a joke, Ma.
not_available How long have you been with him? 
not_available Eight months.
not_available Did you plan to tell me? 
not_available When the time was right.
not_available So you intend to marry him? 
not_available At some point, yes.
not_available See, even you know this will never happen.
not_available We'll talk about it later.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available I took care of you the last time he broke your heart! 
not_available He's not gonna break my heart.
not_available Men like him don't change! What did you say to him? 
not_available I told him nothing.
not_available I came to see you.
not_available Do you know where Mark is? Yeah, he's right here.
not_available I've been talking to him about SPG
not_available This concerns another matter.
not_available Not a good idea to put the space heater in the bed with you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, may I have a moment? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's up? Mark, I haven't wanted it too widely known around the hospital My son Scott was treated for B
not_available cell lymphoma 10 months ago.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available He's fine.
not_available The chemo was successful.
not_available But I just got a phone call from his school.
not_available He's complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available I told them to send him here by taxicab.
not_available It's better to be safe.
not_available He didn't get along with his previous doctor.
not_available I'd like you to look after his care personally when he arrives.
not_available I'm sorry to hear he's sick.
not_available How old is Scott? He's almost 13.
not_available He's handled it all quite well.
not_available I'll stay out of your way.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Page me when he arrives.
not_available Mark.
not_available Can you? Was he talking to you about SPG? 
not_available No.
not_available His son is coming in.
not_available Really? 
not_available I didn't know they had any kids.
not_available He has a daughter too.
not_available I can clear Curtain 3.
not_available Do they need a Trauma room? I think he just wants me to see him.
not_available Right.
not_available Of course.
not_available Let me know if I can help.
not_available Sure.
not_available Jeanie, can you hang with me? 
not_available Yeah, what's up? Anspaugh's son is coming in with abdominal pain.
not_available I doubt he'd want me anywhere near his son.
not_available The boy was treated last year for B
not_available cell lymphoma.
not_available So he's probably not too happy to come here.
not_available There he is.
not_available Just another friendly face.
not_available Hey, Scott? Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Just have an upset stomach.
not_available Yeah? Why don't you let us check you out.
not_available This is Jeanie Boulet.
not_available Hey.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available Well, we just wanna be absolutely sure.
not_available Okay? So listen, it's no big deal.
not_available Tell my dad it's no big deal.
not_available The whole school was looking at me when I got in this damn cab.
not_available Listen, Scott, we're freezing our butts off out here.
not_available Why don't you just come in and just talk to your dad, okay? I can walk.
not_available I don't need that wheelchair.
not_available All right.
not_available Doug, pick up.
not_available It's me.
not_available Hello? I don't know where you are.
not_available But when you get this you call me right away.
not_available You can run, but you cannot hide.
not_available This last room on the left.
not_available You doing okay? 
not_available I just have a stomachache.
not_available All right.
not_available Scott.
not_available Scott, I'm here, son.
not_available Where's the wheelchair? 
not_available He wanted to walk, which is fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's one of our best doctors.
not_available He's gonna take good care of you.
not_available Why can't I have a stomachache sometimes? Have you been vomiting? 
not_available Just once.
not_available Crappy seafood restaurant last night, Dad.
not_available That's why I'm sick.
not_available Gone to the bathroom? 
not_available My bowel's not obstructed.
not_available Been able to pass gas? 
not_available Yes, I said.
not_available Let me feel your belly.
not_available Tender? Okay, let's get a CBC, Chem
not_available 20 and abdominal series.
not_available No, damn it! No needles! You better not even try to stick me with another needle! Hear me? All right.
not_available All right.
not_available No needles.
not_available Not right now.
not_available I'm trying to locate Dr.
not_available Kotlowitz.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Corday from County General.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I just wrote you a note.
not_available I'm sorry you came all this way.
not_available I'm going on a consult.
not_available David Kotlowitz.
not_available Elizabeth Corday.
not_available If I can have a minute, I'd like to persuade you.
not_available I'll give you two.
not_available Walk with me.
not_available That's terrific.
not_available My heart goes out to Miss Beaumont.
not_available It was a devastating accident.
not_available Allison's quite lucky to be alive.
not_available She has extraordinary spirit.
not_available Which is why I asked you simply to see her.
not_available Examine her.
not_available And agree to do a free medialization thyroplasty.
not_available Well, her insurance won't cover it, apparently.
not_available So 
not_available yes, that is what I'm asking.
not_available And why would I do that? If you meet Allison, you'll want to do it.
not_available Well, I'm headed to your part of town, but I don't have privileges at County.
not_available But any bureaucratic matters, I'm sure Dr.
not_available Romano can help straighten out.
not_available You're speaking on Romano's behalf? No.
not_available I'm speaking on Allison Beaumont's behalf.
not_available It's not frostbite, but we should put it in some warm water.
not_available What is that? 
not_available It sounds like a Tamagotchi.
not_available A what? Some kid must've dropped it.
not_available A white one! I collect them.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's a pretend pet you take care of.
not_available What? It's probably hungry.
not_available Whoever left it behind must not care too much.
not_available Can I have it? No, I gotta take it to lost and found.
not_available When the kid gets back, it'll be dead.
not_available What do you mean, dead? 
not_available I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
not_available No! Can you tell what's wrong with it? I just saw a report on TV.
not_available I don't know.
not_available If someone comes by looking, just say you never saw it.
not_available Scott.
not_available What? I understand you not wanting to be stuck.
not_available I made a $10 bet with your dad that I could stick you and you'd never feel it.
not_available So? 
not_available So I'll cut you in on the deal.
not_available You let me draw some blood, and you got it.
not_available Stop talking to me like I'm a kid.
not_available I've had so much chemo that my veins have been sclerosed.
not_available So you just get the hell out of here.
not_available We gotta find out what's causing your stomachaches.
not_available If you don't want it easy they'll hold you down while you yell and scream.
not_available And they'll draw it the hard way.
not_available Sit down, turn your head.
not_available I promise you won't feel it.
not_available How about I stick you? The smell.
not_available It makes me sick.
not_available It's in.
not_available How'd you do that? Because I'm the best.
not_available Now you know.
not_available Hey, Cynthia? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know about these? 
not_available It's a virtual pet.
not_available Mark got one for his daughter.
not_available Wait.
not_available Someone left it in Exam 1.
not_available Did anyone call about it or anything? It won't stop.
not_available I think it pooped.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You see that pile there? 
not_available You're supposed to clean it up.
not_available How? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Want me to call Mark? 
not_available Disgusting.
not_available I can figure it out.
not_available Wait 
not_available You know what? I liked toys when we were kids.
not_available My Barbie van was awesome.
not_available Oh, my God! Oh, my God, look! 
not_available It stopped.
not_available I'm so happy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If someone calls, it's in lost and found.
not_available Actually, why don't I just take care of it for a while.
not_available Anne Reilly? This is Mrs.
not_available Reilly.
not_available I'm her Meals on Wheels person.
not_available One of them at least.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Susan McFarlan.
not_available Some days she's confused.
not_available But today, she was definitely more out of it.
not_available She usually has her hair combed.
not_available She complain of anything specific? No.
not_available But I took a peek inside.
not_available I don't think she's been eating.
not_available There were untouched plates of food.
not_available At least a couple of days' worth.
not_available Do you think she's had a stroke? 
not_available We'll check her out.
not_available Hi, I'm Carol Hathaway.
not_available Hello.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Anne Reilly.
not_available You look so pretty today.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available How are you feeling today, Mrs.
not_available Reilly? 
not_available Fine.
not_available What month is it? Well, it's August.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll have to wait before we can get her a room.
not_available Can you stay? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Reilly we'll talk again soon in a few minutes.
not_available You look just the same.
not_available Oh, just like when you were a baby.
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe 10 more of those would make a difference.
not_available I had a hard
not_available enough time getting this one.
not_available I'm one of those people that's always early.
not_available What presentations did you hear besides Benton's? None.
not_available I mean, what? Dermatology? Can't see myself sitting in an office all day popping pimples.
not_available No.
not_available For me, it's either Surgery or Emergency Medicine.
not_available Or Internal Medicine because they have the sickest people.
not_available But I doubt it's for me.
not_available Think you can sell me on the ER? 
not_available I haven't been selling well so far.
not_available Never boring, is it? There's always something? No, sometimes it's slow, but you're usually thankful for the break.
not_available I can't wait.
not_available Jeanie's gonna wait up in Radiology with Dr.
not_available Anspaugh's son, okay? 
not_available She should stay with him.
not_available Did you lose something? I thought I brought an extra pack of gum.
not_available Going through them pretty quickly.
not_available I brought you an extra pack.
not_available In here somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle.
not_available It's not like I need it.
not_available The nicotine.
not_available It's just Do you think Dr.
not_available Anspaugh's son will be okay? He's had cancer once.
not_available We have to worry about recurrence.
not_available I never saw him as much of a family man.
not_available His wife was only 42.
not_available What are you doing? There's just a few pills missing 
not_available Yeah? Well, I mean, shouldn't there be some more? My pills are in your bathroom in your bag.
not_available This is an old pack.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you thinking? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I mean, you know.
not_available I don't wanna get pregnant.
not_available I know.
not_available We wanna be careful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, bingo.
not_available You are great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You're so grown
not_available up now.
not_available She's tachy at 108.
not_available BP's low, 90/70.
not_available There's skin tenting.
not_available Tenting? She's dehydrated.
not_available When I pinch her skin, it stays pinched.
not_available Let's get her a gown.
not_available Start an IV and send off for a CBC, Chem
not_available 20.
not_available You want to cath her urine? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And get a chest film.
not_available We're gonna change you into a gown so we can do some more tests.
not_available Does she have any family? 
not_available She mentioned a daughter.
not_available I don't know where she is.
not_available Carol, Doug on two.
not_available I'll get this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Doug? Guess who stopped by.
not_available My mom.
not_available What are you on? Drugs? No.
not_available I just would've liked to have told her myself.
not_available How do you think she's reacting? Doug, I gotta go.
not_available I'll call you back.
not_available WHORE I'll take it from here.
not_available Could you escort Susan to Chairs and please find Mark? Okay.
not_available Can you stay a little while longer? Yeah, I don't have any classes today anyway.
not_available Great.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Reilly did someone hurt you? 
not_available Detective Weller.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available This is Carol Hathaway.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm waiting for Detective Muncie.
not_available But I'd like to talk to the victim.
not_available What's her name? 
not_available Anne Reilly.
not_available In here.
not_available Her mental status is altered.
not_available She's not responding to questions.
not_available Could that be from the trauma? 
not_available Maybe, or she could have Alzheimer's.
not_available She's also dehydrated.
not_available We need to fluid
not_available resuscitate her first.
not_available And also still do a rape kit.
not_available Were her hands bound? There is some bruising, but no signs of duct tape like the other one.
not_available She also had a lowerleft
not_available rib fracture and multiple contusions.
not_available One to the back of her head.
not_available You're assuming it's the same rapist.
not_available I don't want two like this.
not_available So you're making some public announcements? It's a departmental decision.
not_available You guys gotta stop this person.
not_available That's what we intend to do.
not_available I'll start with the girl.
not_available She's very fond of Mrs.
not_available Reilly.
not_available She doesn't know about the rape yet.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll show you.
not_available Carol? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yosh told me he moved Mrs.
not_available Reilly so he could see clinic patients.
not_available He can't handle them all by himself.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross came in.
not_available He's helping him.
not_available I think he thinks you're mad at him.
not_available Is this the abdominal series? 
not_available This is Scott Anspaugh.
not_available Any relation? 
not_available I'm his son.
not_available We'll take some pictures of your belly.
not_available KUB or upright first? We'll start with the KUB.
not_available The tumor's back.
not_available What'd you say? I don't need X
not_available rays to know.
not_available Don't move.
not_available If it's bad news, you can worry about it then.
not_available Think about something else.
not_available Like what? Rainbows and dandelions? What do you like? What's your favorite thing? John Woo movies.
not_available His Hollywood movies or the Hong Kong stuff? What do you know about John Woo? 
not_available How much time do you have? Hey, you're still around? I sat in on a Pedes introduction for the heck of it.
not_available Pedes.
not_available Very rewarding field.
not_available I wanted to talk to you before you left about a favor.
not_available Sure.
not_available When you're on duty can I come by and hang out? 
not_available My words didn't determine your career? You're good.
not_available You're not that good.
not_available I have a shift tonight.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available If you'd like, I was thinking we could get some dinner first.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd like.
not_available Yeah? But on one 
condition I buy.
not_available The ER is your treat.
not_available Dinner will be mine.
not_available Do you like Thai food? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available Well, I didn't sugarcoat it.
not_available I didn't expect you to.
not_available Weed out the losers early.
not_available Thanks, Pete.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available It's "Peter.
not_available " You called me "Pete.
not_available " Nobody's ever called you Pete? 
not_available No.
not_available "Pete Benton.
not_available " It sounds so natural.
not_available Peter.
not_available Just Peter.
not_available Petey? Peter.
not_available Kotlowitz! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, perfect timing.
not_available Robert Romano! 
not_available What are you doing here? You know each other? You've got quite a protégé.
not_available She's convinced me to waive my fee and perform a Silastic medialization.
not_available It still needs to be ironed out.
not_available You wanna operate on my patient? 
not_available She's ideal, yeah.
not_available Unless there's a problem with that.
not_available It'll be a chance for us to put our heads together.
not_available You'll be in touch with me, right? 
not_available Oh, let me walk you out.
not_available If you have a moment, stay with me.
not_available Rocket, good to see you.
not_available Take care.
not_available What's the matter? Shut the door.
not_available What did I say about that procedure? If the fee's the barrier
not_available It's not the only one! Kotlowitz can't operate here.
not_available And we are sure as hell not going to move her for vocal
not_available cord surgery with her leg as it is.
not_available Anspaugh's granting him privileges.
not_available He's a great fan of Dr.
not_available Kotlowitz.
not_available So now you're planning my patient's treatment with the Chief of Staff.
not_available He was in the hall.
not_available This is great news for Allison.
not_available I will decide what is in her best interest.
not_available This is in her best interest.
not_available It's an unnecessary trip to the O.R.! No.
not_available It's not.
not_available I don't know what's between you and Dr.
not_available Kotlowitz.
not_available I couldn't give a
not_available Allison wants her voice back.
not_available And it's incumbent upon us to bring that about.
not_available Are you questioning my commitment to this patient's best interests? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Because that is not something you wanna be doing, Lizzie.
not_available Okay.
not_available This time, just make sure that he takes all of the antibiotics.
not_available All of the medicine until it's gone.
not_available Okay? All the medicine until it's gone.
not_available Even if he's feeling better.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I'm Sherry.
not_available Hi, Sherry.
not_available Now You've been here before.
not_available Are you still going to the prenatal clinic? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm going to have a baby.
not_available What can I do for you? They cut my food stamps.
not_available It was 65 dollars.
not_available Now it's 49.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available So, what do I stop buying? Let's "Milk is $1.79.
not_available Eggs, $1.69.
not_available Peanut butter, the cheapest one " Who wrote this for you? Nurse Hathaway helped me make my food chart.
not_available Did they say why they cut your food stamps? Okay.
not_available Well, Sherry, there are a lot of agencies that can
not_available That can help you out.
not_available I'm gonna I'm gonna get some numbers.
not_available I'll call them.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Three
not_available centimeter laceration to the vaginal wall at 2 o'clock.
not_available Am I going to be all right? 
not_available Yes, Mrs.
not_available Reilly.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Is the baby going to be okay? The baby'll be fine.
not_available Contusions to the labia majora bilaterally.
not_available Scant purulent discharge.
not_available Do you want cultures? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available GC and chlamydia.
not_available How about HIV? Well, we need to find out who has legal consent.
not_available Any word on family? 
not_available I haven't heard yet.
not_available I didn't have nearly as hard a time with you.
not_available I don't think I did.
not_available You're doing very well, Mrs.
not_available Reilly.
not_available Won't be much longer.
not_available Let's give her a gram of ceftriaxone to cover for STDs.
not_available Oh, wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available I'm not going to have a baby, am I? No.
not_available But you are in a hospital and we'll take very good care of you.
not_available Oh, I know you will, darling.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Reilly? Do you know why you're here? You remember anyone coming into your apartment recently? People don't stop by much anymore, do they? Okay, Mrs.
not_available Reilly.
not_available You can just relax now, right here.
not_available Let's give her another 500 cc's.
not_available And let the detectives know that she'll be a little longer.
not_available She's not gonna be any help.
not_available She doesn't remember.
not_available It's probably a blessing.
not_available A woman came in with her daughter looking for her Tamagotchi.
not_available I told her that you'd found it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I had to steal time away all day to feed it and play with it.
not_available Why does it have wings now? Oh, my God.
not_available He's dead.
not_available Oh, like a little angel! How can he be dead? When he bleeped, I took care of him.
not_available I guess they just die sometimes.
not_available But if he was sick, I would've done something.
not_available You did your best.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available But Hello, Jeanie.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, how are you? I'm well.
not_available I wanna thank you for your help today.
not_available Well, I can imagine what Scott's been through.
not_available Can I ask about the abdominal films? There's a partial obstruction.
not_available We've admitted him.
not_available It could possibly be adhesions from the previous surgery.
not_available We're gonna wait and see.
not_available Scott's faced a lot of adversity already in life.
not_available But whatever comes, he can handle it.
not_available I like him.
not_available Well, I just wanted to say thank you.
not_available We can get a cab over on Michigan.
not_available Or we can walk off the coconut curry.
not_available Are you crazy? It's 10 degrees.
not_available Come on, John.
not_available It's three blocks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't want you to think that I'm cursed with indecision.
not_available I just need to be excited.
not_available Hey, I understand.
not_available Are you like that? Am I like that? Well, you know Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait, wait! Hey! What's going on? Wait! Hey! Hey! Wait, wait, wait! 
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available We saw this guy over here.
not_available I don't know if he's dead.
not_available I sent my buddy to get help.
not_available I'm barely getting a pulse.
not_available What should we do? 
not_available Go get a cab.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Taxi! Taxi! 
not_available Hurry it up! Lizzie.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Go ahead and schedule the Silastic medialization.
not_available Really? 
not_available I'll work it out with Anspaugh.
not_available Can I tell Allison? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I'll do it right now.
not_available It'll lift her spirits.
not_available I Personal feelings shouldn't get in the way.
not_available It was good that you stayed focused on the patient.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm no good at apologizing.
not_available Let's let that be the last thing said about it.
not_available And you and I, we're all right? Lizzie, you and I are a match made in heaven.
not_available I got a homeless guy here with hypothermia.
not_available Get me warming blankets.
not_available Heated humidified O2? And could you pop a couple of liters into the microwave too? Is the ER always this exciting? 
not_available Pretty much.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? This guy was unconscious over by the medical school.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I don't wanna give him an arrhythmia.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Good.
not_available You are? 
not_available I'm Laura Brown.
not_available I'm observing Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Second
not_available year med student observing.
not_available BP's 80 palp.
not_available Pulse is 52.
not_available Let's get a core temp, CBC and a 12
not_available lead.
not_available Let's prep for a pleural lavage.
not_available Come on.
not_available Every second counts.
not_available Pleural lavage? 
not_available Active core rewarming.
not_available It's 10 degrees outside.
not_available He's a Popsicle.
not_available We still on for dinner? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I just wanna finish this up.
not_available Get an Attending to cover for you.
not_available I want to see this through.
not_available I'm heading over to Greek Islands.
not_available If you finish, join me.
not_available Warm saline.
not_available If it's not too hot 
not_available run in another liter bolus.
not_available Worried about shock? No, not if we provide circulatory support with a cardiopulmonary bypass.
not_available A bypass in the ER? 
not_available Sure.
not_available It's an excellent way of warming the blood.
not_available Or we could do dialysis.
not_available I wanted to check on her.
not_available I'm leaving.
not_available She was awake a while ago.
not_available She was more coherent, which means the fluids are working.
not_available But she doesn't know why she's here.
not_available I want to say goodbye to her.
not_available It's inconceivable what the police are saying.
not_available I don't know if I can go back to that building.
not_available Am I a horrible person? I consider Mrs.
not_available Reilly my friend.
not_available I want to be a friend to her.
not_available You are a good friend.
not_available You brought her here.
not_available But I'm afraid to bring her meals now.
not_available They'll catch this man.
not_available You just go home and get some rest.
not_available Tell her I'll call her, all right? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Man, it's cold! Did I miss Swift? 
not_available His shift ended 15 minutes ago.
not_available Oh, shoot.
not_available Are you ready to celebrate? I got reservations at Rosebud.
not_available Or we can stay in.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Sounds better to me.
not_available Are you tired? 
not_available No.
not_available Anspaugh say something about the proposal? His son came in today.
not_available He's got a partial bowel obstruction, history of B
not_available cell lymphoma.
not_available And Anspaugh went to Mark Greene to take care of him.
not_available Well, he knows how busy you are.
not_available Maybe he's forgotten I'm a doctor.
not_available Sometimes I almost forget.
not_available That's the best reason yet to let SPG take the load.
not_available Yes.
not_available What'll it be? Your place or mine? Your place has room service.
not_available Damn it.
not_available It presented like a classic case of hypothermia.
not_available Except for his temperature, which was three degrees below normal.
not_available What's wrong with him? Well, he's drunk.
not_available That's it? There's no bypass? 
not_available No.
not_available Not a total wash, though.
not_available Here's how to administer a banana bag.
not_available We give these to all drunks everyone that comes in drunk, to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy.
not_available The yellow color is the result of adding a multivitamin to the fluid.
not_available No bananas
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Remember me? I'm Laura Brown.
not_available I was in your lecture today.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available I was observing Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available But this looks more interesting.
not_available We're putting a chest tube in before he goes to surgery.
not_available He has a hemopneumothorax, which is a bleeding, collapsed lung.
not_available What kind of animal does that? 
not_available She's feeling better.
not_available I wonder about the human species.
not_available I'd personally volunteer to castrate this guy.
not_available Make a copy of these wound
not_available care instructions.
not_available We're ready to wrap this up.
not_available You bet.
not_available Thanks for coming in today.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available It's amazing what you've done here.
not_available Really? Well, five shifts a week, the clinic It makes a difference.
not_available I'm sorry I yelled at you over the phone.
not_available I'm actually glad you spoke to my mom.
not_available It's a relief.
not_available I don't know what I was waiting for.
not_available The other shoe to drop.
not_available Dumb, huh? You off? Have to wait on a Psych consult.
not_available Might take a while.
not_available I'll wait.
not_available Finally got an I.D.
not_available on our ice man.
not_available He lives in a shelter on Price Street.
not_available They're picking him up.
not_available I thought your student was gonna stick around.
not_available She went to go watch Benton operate.
not_available I think she got bored.
not_available Well, we're not here to entertain, Carter.
not_available You know, she seemed so interested.
not_available I was supposed to inspire those students.
not_available But I didn't.
not_available Inspire them? How? 
not_available Through our passion for what we do.
not_available Passion? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You come here every day.
not_available Sometimes you're really cooking, and sometimes you're not.
not_available But you're here every day doing your work.
not_available One day you'll look up and maybe 10 years will have passed.
not_available It'll be the sum total of what you've done that counts.
not_available Not the passion.
not_available Wanna review some of these charts? Yeah.
not_available She's an awfully sweet girl, Susan, isn't she? She was very worried about you.
not_available She reminds me of my daughter.
not_available I feel so silly.
not_available Such a nuisance, having to bring me here for a little bump on the head.
not_available This darn thing's caught.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available You feel so useless when you get to be my age.
not_available I've already gotten a bit forgetful.
not_available The other night, I came home and left my keys hanging in the front door.
not_available I don't think that has anything to do with age.
not_available I do the same thing.
not_available I left my keys in the door.
not_available I left my keys in the door and a man walked into my apartment.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Reilly? Then he put his hand up over my mouth.
not_available Then he made me get down on the ground.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Reilly? Oh, my God! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available You're gonna be okay now.
not_available I left the keys 
not_available in the door.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Oh, my God! It's okay.
