not_available Who's this Clemente guy, anyway? That's it.
not_available I'm done arguing with a television set.
not_available It's believed to suppress radical formationDid you just call me a television set? Is he gonna be the new department chief? 
not_available We're forming a search committee.
not_available The guy must be angling for it, right? You gonna eat your eggs? They're cold.
not_available What about your waffles? I'm not hungry.
not_available I got a stomachache.
not_available Wanna bring them home with you? Mr.
not_available Coogy might wanna eat them later.
not_available He doesn't like waffles.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Could we get the bill, please? I'm sorry.
not_available Our machine's still out.
not_available Would you like more coffee? Uh, no, thanks.
not_available It should be just a couple minutes.

not_available You want your picture? 
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available This way.

not_available You can't come back here, sir.
not_available Hey! Hey.

not_available I'm gonna broom him.
not_available You can't fire him, he's a volunteer.
not_available A very involuntary volunteer.
not_available I need kids we can count on.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll talk to him.
not_available Okay, okay, okay, kids, gather round.
not_available It's showtime.
not_available Yo, Lockhart, Barnett, come on, fall in.
not_available You too, Pratt.
not_available All right.
not_available In order to bring this ER into the 21 st century we'll be introducing new equipment and new procedures on a regular basis.
not_available Now, first up my lovely assistant will demonstrate the patient communication board.
not_available No more pens and paper.
not_available This will make everyone's life easier.
not_available From now on, intubated patients can point, circle or mark any questions or requests they have.
not_available Beautifully done.
not_available Next up, will be the Freedom Splint.
not_available The federal regulations are discouraging the use of wrist restraints which, by the way, should be checked every 10 minutes.
not_available What's so funny, Barnett? Uh, I just find that hard to believe.
not_available There's quite a few cases of patients unattended for a few hours who have lost hands to ischemia.
not_available Therefore, we are gonna start using the Freedom Splint.
not_available Any volunteers? Volunteers.
not_available Any volunteers? Hey.
not_available Thank you, Jerry.
not_available All right.
not_available The Freedom Splint is less restrictive and should be used before any hard or soft restraints.
not_available The splint is very helpful in preventing obtunded or combative patients Ah.
not_available from pulling out tubes, picking at wound sites and disrupting lifesaving medical equipment.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Sexy.
not_available Woo
not_available hoo.
not_available Thank you, I think.

not_available Hey, X
not_available ray, you and me, tag team.
not_available You distract him, I shoot him.

not_available Who's Vincent? 
not_available Guy she was with.
not_available She's a kidnap victim.
not_available Her abductor started shooting.
not_available We returned fire.
not_available You shot her? No, I had a clear shot.
not_available But the guy's gun must've discharged when he went down.
not_available Is Vincent dead? Seventy
not_available three's bringing him in.
not_available Guy got popped a bunch of times, once in the head.
not_available He shot one of our guys.
not_available Got this?

not_available Yeah, I puked all night.
not_available Keg party? Pass out, wake up with a bad hangover and a Magic Marker facial? Something like that.
not_available Okay, well, you don't have a fever, so it's probably not viral.
not_available Your BP's a little low, which means you're maybe dehydrated.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Um If I have to puke again? 
not_available Ah.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Uh, you got anything a little bigger? Well, if it isn't the hatchet lady.
not_available Which beloved employee are you axing today? Stick a sock in it, Frank.
not_available I'm sending Haleh her last check.
not_available You want to include a note? Haleh was Eve's idea.
not_available I was just following orders.
not_available That's what Himmler said.
not_available You got a letter here somewhere from your jailbird boyfriend.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Probably marrying his cellmate.

not_available Go now! Never seen him move that fast.
not_available I can't move my hand.
not_available May have bruised the nerve.
not_available What's this? Penetrating axillary trauma with neurovascular deficit.
not_available You wanna clamp the bleeder? 
not_available If we can visualize it.
not_available I'm getting dizzy.
not_available Don't let me die.
not_available You won't die.
not_available Don't let me die.
not_available Hey, you with the 23rd? 
not_available What? Yeah.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available My father and brother are with the 17 and the 109.
not_available Really? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available You know Joe Butchitelli? Yeah, he helped me through the academy.
not_available He's your brother? No, he gave me my first orgasm.
not_available What? It was a milestone.
not_available How's the pulse ox?

not_available Systolic's down to 70.
not_available Hey, shooter's here.
not_available Thinking about a chest tube? Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? 
not_available Chest tube.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're processing the film.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't wait.
not_available Just do it now.
not_available Right.
not_available Betadine and Steri

not_available She's stable.
not_available Tony Gates.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available BP's at 100 palp.
not_available Should've needled the chest.
not_available No time.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available He shot through our windshield, almost blew Gates' head.
not_available I saw my life flash before my eyes.
not_available I think we were on a beach.
not_available Stop.
not_available Can we focus here? I lost the radial pulse.
not_available Needs two chest tubes and central line
not_available Yowza, look at that head shot.
not_available He needs a couple of chest tubesIsn't that your patient? 
not_available I can do that with my eyes closed.
not_available It's probably best if you didn't.
not_available I'll call you if I need help.
not_available Yeah, you'll call me.
not_available His head could roll off, you wouldn't call me.
not_available 110/70.
not_available Is that good? 
not_available Couldn't be better.
not_available Okay, just sliding off the vest.
not_available Damn.
not_available Okay, we need to lift your arm to take a look.
not_available All right.
not_available Got it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm bleeding out.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Jimmy, look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Is Marty Stats still the desk sergeant at the 23? What? Yeah.

not_available What's happening? 
not_available Sterile gloves, please.
not_available What's happening?

not_available Did they find Coogy? Who is that? 
not_available Um, her stuffed animal.
not_available He's a puppy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Great.
not_available Hang on.
not_available I got her mom.
not_available Okay.
not_available Vaseline gauze dressing on that.
not_available Hi, Mrs.
not_available Carlyle, this is Abby Lockhart.
not_available I'm treating your daughter.
not_available Uh, yes, she was shot in the chest.
not_available But we're doing all we can for her, and she's doing well.
not_available She's a very brave little girl.
not_available Uh, sure.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Two hundred cc's in the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available It's your mom.
not_available Mom? I miss you too.
not_available I am.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I will.

not_available Okay.
not_available Hi, I'll give you back to the police now.
not_available We have to treat your daughter, but we'll see you in a couple hours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Carlyle? Officer Yau.
not_available It's okay, Sydney.
not_available You're safe now.
not_available Your parents are coming to get you, and nobody can hurt you here.
not_available What about Vincent? Don't worry about him anymore.
not_available How's the chest tube output? 
not_available Less than 500 cc's.
not_available Small hemothorax.
not_available Should be able to manage her conservatively.
not_available Hey, nice lid.
not_available You get a free bowl of soup with that? Pressure's down, 80/50.
not_available Okay, call for type
not_available specific and, uh, run in 500 of saline.
not_available No, let's not do that.
not_available Hi, there.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available We'll put a little glop on your belly.
not_available Then, we'll take this camera to look inside, okay? Are you the little princess I heard was coming this morning? I'm not a princess.
not_available Um, she's hypotensive.
not_available Hypotensive can be a good thing.
not_available What are you talking about? Leave her systolic at 80, right, Dr.
not_available Dubenko? Right.
not_available Permissive hypotension.
not_available Landmark papers by Bickell and Mattox.
not_available With vascular injury, you need a low pressure to stabilize the clots.
not_available You usually blast away blood and fluids.
not_available And then you raise the pressure and blow out the clot.
not_available Lots of sub
not_available Q air in the chest wall, but the belly's dry.
not_available Okay.
not_available We never allow the pressure to drift this low, so I'm checking with Kovac.
not_available Abby, the chief of surgery agrees with our plan.
not_available We're gonna make you brand
not_available new, all right, sweetie pie? Okay, I'm in.
not_available Hooking it up.
not_available Sounds like tension pneumo here.
not_available Okay, 0 silk and Xeroform next.
not_available Five centimeters in the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Pressure's up, 120/70.
not_available Excellent.
not_available He just needs a little blood to his brain.
not_available Nice work.
not_available I heard Gallant's home on leave.
not_available I didn't get a chance to see him last time.
not_available Actually, he gets home today.
not_available Hopefully he'll be here longer this time.
not_available Well, tell him to stop by.
not_available I'll buy him a beer.
not_available Hey, this guy just looked at me.
not_available Fourby
not_available fours and Elastoplasts.
not_available He's got spontaneous eye
not_available opening.
not_available We're on your side! Son of a
not_available Stop! You have tubes in your chest.
not_available Push four of Versed.
not_available Stop it! You're hurting me! No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Neela.
not_available God! 
not_available I'm trying.
not_available You okay? Yeah, his head injury isn't as bad as it looks.
not_available No, it's a clean frontal
not_available lobe injury.
not_available No vital functions are affected, but he'll have ongoing impulse
not_available control problems.
not_available Where? Where's Sydney? 
not_available Safe from you.
not_available I didn't hurt her.
not_available I took care of her.
not_available You raped her.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I need to see her, please, okay? Sydney! 
not_available Shut up.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I didn't do anything wrong.
not_available Sounds like the lung is back up.
not_available You think you know me, but you don't.
not_available She loves me.
not_available Not much blood from the chest.
not_available It's all in the belly.
not_available She needed me.
not_available She wanted me.
not_available Looks like hemoperitoneum.
not_available And a grade
not_available four hepatic injury.
not_available Grade
not_available four? A.
not_available k.
not_available a.
not_available chopped liver.
not_available I know what you're thinking.
not_available You want me to die.
not_available I want you to shut up.
not_available Tachy at 120.
not_available HemoCue is eight.
not_available Can you transfuse another two units? 
not_available How soon can he go up to the O.
not_available R.? 
not_available No vacancy.
not_available I can turn over a room in 20 minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available You've got 10.
not_available Have the blood bank stay ahead four units.
not_available Maybe you should just let me die.
not_available A little more exposure? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Suction? 
not_available I got your blood.
not_available Great, thanks.
not_available Give it to her, and get over here.
not_available More fourbyfours? 
not_available You read my mind.
not_available You visualize the brachial? 
not_available I'm working on it.
not_available Eve was complaining about you today.
not_available I don't even know who that is.
not_available The nurse manager.
not_available Tall, blond? Oh, yeah, that amazon? She doesn't like me.
not_available Hey, show some respect.
not_available This is her turf, you're lucky to be here.
not_available You wanna do your community service in some smellyass soup kitchen? Well, do you? 
not_available No.
not_available Better get your act together, then.
not_available Okay.
not_available There it is.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ease up on the gauze.
not_available Whoa, Ray! 
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available Proximal pressure.
not_available I'm telling you, I hear one more complaint about you, and your ass
not_available One hell of a pep talk.
not_available Let's get a gurney in here.
not_available How much saline has she had? 
not_available Very little.
not_available It's TKO.
not_available BP's 80 palp.
not_available Why aren't you giving her fluids? Permissive hypotension.
not_available We don't wanna disrupt hemostasis.
not_available When's she going to the O.
not_available R.? 
not_available We're waiting.
not_available You can't do permissive hypotension without a plan.
not_available Give her a liter wide
not_available open.
not_available No.
not_available I've had experience with this, it works.
not_available I don't want our Residents in the position of using unproven therapies on critical patients.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, we need you back in here.
not_available Get her pressure up to 100 systolic.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available Just a minute, please.
not_available All right, well, CT's calling about your patient, Darrel Insley.
not_available Yeah? So, what did Big Darrel do now? He stopped breathing.
not_available And why the hell would he do that? Don't give a fluid bolus unless the M.A.
not_available P.
not_available drops below 70.
not_available BP's down to 60 palp.
not_available The packed cells? 
not_available Units three and four.
not_available Hang another two.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jansen? Vincent? Can you hear me? Sux and etomidate, 8
not_available 0 tube.
not_available Can we get him upstairs? 
not_available No O.
not_available R.
not_available for 10 minutes.
not_available At least move him to pre
not_available op.
not_available He'll bleed in the elevator.
not_available Our job is to save lives, not judge them.
not_available Death is the easy way out.
not_available He deserves to rot in jail.
not_available I'm in, bag him.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Exploratory laparotomy.
not_available Here? Now? Sterile drapes, cutdown tray, masks and gowns.
not_available Scrub in, Neela.
not_available You wanna save this guy? It's the only way I know how.
not_available Sydney? Come on, honey.
not_available Come on, baby.
not_available Hey, Luka! Sydney? Come on, Sydney.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's stay awake.
not_available Say hi to your mom and dad, huh? Sydney? Somebody get Kovac in here now.
not_available Tachy to 150.
not_available BP not registering.
not_available Starting CPR.
not_available I can't get a pulse.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Help.
not_available She's going down.
not_available Squeeze in saline, give me two units packed cells.
not_available You did type and cross her? 
not_available I did.
not_available Where's she bleeding? I don't know.
not_available Chest tube slowed to 300 cc's.
not_available Belly's clean.
not_available Stay ahead of a patient like this.
not_available My Attending felt otherwise.
not_available I'm the Attending now.
not_available Prep the chest.
not_available If she's not back with a saline bolus, crack her.
not_available I was just talking to her.
not_available Go ahead and intubate.
not_available Okay.
not_available Got it.
not_available Here goes nothing.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, looking good.
not_available Dry as a bone.
not_available Okay, moist fourby
not_available four's.
not_available Let down the weitlaners.
not_available Did you save my arm? Bleeding is controlled.
not_available Got this from here? Piece of cake.
not_available Dry Kerlix, please.
not_available What's his damage? Oneandahalf
not_available centimeter scalp lac.
not_available Am I gonna have a scar? 
not_available Oh, nothing anybody will be able to see.
not_available What if I shave my head? 
not_available Not a good idea.
not_available Not with that helmet.
not_available Two to three staples ought to do it.
not_available I got this.
not_available I never fainted before.
not_available Probably the best thing you could've done today.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Eve was gonna give you the boot.
not_available Now she'll probably let you stay, just out of pity.
not_available Hold still.
not_available Ow! 
not_available Yeah, that's gonna burn a little.
not_available It got a little tricky, but he's a tough kid.
not_available He's gonna be just fine.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available I'll come find you guys when I have more details.
not_available Got a thing for the boys in blue, huh? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I know half of them.
not_available My dad was a cop, retired.
not_available My brother.
not_available Fiancé.
not_available You're engaged? 
not_available No, I was.
not_available A few years ago.
not_available He was killed on the job.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I still have a thing for that uniform, though.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can I ask you a question? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Under what circumstances would a prisoner be transferred across states? Your ex? 
not_available He wrote me a letter.
not_available He's being moved from Canyon City in Colorado to Cook County.
not_available It could be a lot of reasons, but I can check it out for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sam, this man is looking for Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available She is with a patient.
not_available That's what I told him.
not_available Dad, please.
not_available Can we just go? 
not_available Zoe.
not_available Excuse me, uh, I wanna talk to this doctor right now.
not_available Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait.
not_available Unless I can help you.
not_available She wrote this prescription for my daughter and I wanna know why.
not_available Doesn't your daughter know? 
not_available She won't tell me.
not_available Dad, you're making a scene
not_available Shh.
not_available If your daughter won't tell you, sir, there's nothing we can do about it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yes, there is.
not_available You can get this damn doctor for me right now before I hit this whole place with a malpractice suit.
not_available I got lawyers, lady.
not_available Yeah? Well, I've got Jerry.
not_available So unless you wanna be carried out of here like a dirty diaper, take a seat.
not_available Come on, Zoe.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, I abhor violence.
not_available Yeah, I know that, but he doesn't.
not_available So give him your best tough
not_available guy face.
not_available Here we go.
not_available From the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis.
not_available What kind of retractor do you need? 
not_available The human kind.
not_available Lots of exposure.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Linea alba.
not_available Straight through it to the pre
not_available peritoneal fat.
not_available Retract the deep fascia.
not_available Got it.
not_available Neela, you got a call on line one.
not_available It sounds urgent.
not_available Take a message.
not_available You need scissors? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Poke a finger through the peritoneum and tear it open.
not_available It's from a Lt.
not_available Strickland.
not_available He's calling from a Camp Claiborne in Iraq.
not_available Okay.
not_available Stand back.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I can't take it, Jerry.
not_available Get a number.
not_available Okay.
not_available Suction.
not_available Lap pads.
not_available Not responding to fluids.
not_available She's in P.
not_available E.A.
not_available Brady to 60.
not_available 10 blade to Abby.
not_available Rib spreader to me.
not_available I'm not used to doing this on kids.
not_available They're much the same, just everything's smaller.
not_available Pleura is dry.
not_available Check the pericardium.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's full of blood.
not_available Really full.
not_available Damn it.
not_available She's in tamponade.
not_available Too much pressure on the heart.
not_available She collapsed her ventricles.
not_available Pick up a Metz.
not_available Where's Clemente? Three lap pads around the suprahepatic space.
not_available Three around Morrison's.
not_available And the liver is packed off.
not_available Eight units in, pressure's up to 90 systolic.
not_available That'll do.
not_available O.
not_available R.'s ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available It helps to compress the liver up against the diaphragm.
not_available That was brilliant.
not_available Another five minutes we'd have been taking him to the morgue.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sorry about your floor.
not_available Ready for another unit.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available Cardiac tamponade.
not_available Impossible.
not_available It was a peripheral wound.
not_available A bullet's trajectory can go anywhere.
not_available She had a hemothorax.
not_available She was only bleeding in the chest.
not_available She's bleeding in the pericardium.
not_available Pressure kept her heart from filling.
not_available Impossible.
not_available There was no indication of tamponade.
not_available Didn't you check for effusion on ultrasound? Of course, but there was sub
not_available Q air.
not_available I couldn't get a clear view.
not_available She needed volume to fill her ventricle and you withheld fluids.
not_available Based on what we knew, permissive hypotension was reasonable.
not_available It killed her.
not_available Um, her parents are coming here to take her home.
not_available They think she was rescued.
not_available Can we keep her alive until they get here? Okay.
not_available Let's cross
not_available clamp the aorta.
not_available She's not bleeding in her belly.
not_available She's gone.
not_available This will help perfuse her heart and brain till we get more blood in.
not_available Vascular clamp.
not_available Vascular clamp! Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available What's the word on that little girl? They're working.
not_available The guy you brought in pulled through.
not_available Wish it was the other way around.
not_available Well, at least child molesters don't last long in prison, right? Are you a Hawks fan? Excuse me? 
not_available Chicago Blackhawks.
not_available Hockey.
not_available I have two tickets to Friday's game against the Kings.
not_available You interested? You, me, hot wings, cold beer? Sorry.
not_available You more a theater gal? I figured as much.
not_available I also have tickets to the opera and the philharmonic.
not_available What? You moonlight as a scalper? 
not_available No.
not_available Actually my cousin does.
not_available I appreciate it, but I don't get much time off.
not_available Yeah, I know that story.
not_available You know what, we'll just stay home.
not_available We'll stay home, order a deep
not_available dish, you can quiz me on renal pathophysiology.
not_available What do you know about it? Not enough, that's why I need your help.
not_available It's one of my fourth
not_available year electives.
not_available Fourth year of what? 
not_available Medical school.
not_available You know, I just do this for the free coffee.
not_available Look, maybe some other time.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I have to deal with something urgent.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll see you around.
not_available Doc.
not_available You have that lieutenant's number? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did he say what it was about? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Don't you have something sarcastic to say, Frank? No.
not_available Hey! Hey, is this you? Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Great.
not_available You mind telling me what these are for? You see the patient's name below mine? That's who the prescription is for.
not_available Unless you're Zoe Butler, I can't tell you anything.
not_available Look, if you treated my daughter, I need to know why.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available There are confidentiality rules.
not_available Confidentiality? She's a little kid.
not_available You didn't have my permission to treat her.
not_available You know what, I wanna see your supervisor.
not_available Let's go.
not_available He won't tell you anything different.
not_available In these situationsWhat situations? Is she pregnant? Is she using drugs? What? 
not_available I'm her father.
not_available I have a right to know.
not_available Dad, please.
not_available If you want information, it has to come from Zoe, not from me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Barnett.
not_available I've got this.
not_available You her boss? 
not_available Ray.
not_available Yeah, um Mr.
not_available Butler, my name's Ray Barnett, and the thing is
not_available I, uh, need to speak with you in private.
not_available Neela
not_available Ray.
not_available Let me deal with this.
not_available No.
not_available I can handle this.
not_available You can't.
not_available Yes, I can.
not_available How? By talking? Telling him his daughter has a sexually transmitted disease? 
not_available If you do, it's a breach of confidentiality.
not_available I wanna do the right thing.
not_available You wanna violate her privacy too? What you did is a crime, Ray.
not_available If you tell him the truth, you'll go to jail.
not_available You know that, right? The best thing you can do is just let it go and allow me to deal with this.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Asystole.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available See if you can find a hole in the right ventricle.
not_available Did she have a highdose epi? 
not_available Five minutes ago.
not_available If there's cardiac injury to occlude, we'll get ventricular filling.
not_available Pulseless V
not_available fib and asystole for 25 minutes.
not_available Still not perfusing with open compressions.
not_available I'm giving her another chance.
not_available All you're giving her is more abuse.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Just stop it.
not_available Three forty
not_available nine.
not_available I'll sew up the chest before the family gets here.
not_available Camp Claiborne.
not_available Hello, I'm trying to reach a Lt.
not_available Strickland, please.
not_available Your name and to what this is regarding, please.
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available I'm returning his call.
not_available One moment, ma'am.
not_available Come on.
not_available Miss Rasgotra? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Lt.
not_available Strickland.
not_available I understand you're a friend of Michael Gallant.
not_available Yes, yes, I am.
not_available I have some bad news, ma'am.
not_available There was an incident outside of Mosul.
not_available Insurgents struck a convoy at the airport.
not_available Hello? I'm afraid, I can't Lieutenant, can you hear me? I can't tell you 
not_available Lt.
not_available Strickland, are you there? several casualties.
not_available Michael's unit had a heavy patient flow.
not_available He will be unable to make it home on leave as anticipated.
not_available The CASH is incommunicado right now so he asked me to pass this information on to you.
not_available But Michael's all right? He's not injured or anything.
not_available No, maream.
not_available A little homesick and sand
not_available weary, I imagine, but he's fine.
not_available Uh, thank you, lieutenant.
not_available I appreciate the phone call.
not_available Yourere welcome, maream.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Hey, does this look like a subdural to you? Right here.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Ninety
not_available five percent of the time, controlled hypotension would've worked.
not_available Make sure you tell that to her family.
not_available Come on.
not_available There's no reason she should've had tamponade.
not_available All I know is that she did.
not_available And if she'd been given fluids, she would have survived.
not_available That's not a certainty.
not_available We would've seen the signs.
not_available We could've drained the pericardium.
not_available Look, I did what I thought was in her best interest.
not_available Even when two doctors disagreed? 
not_available Dubenko agreed with me.
not_available You'd do the same even if he hadn't.
not_available That's your style.
not_available Do whatever you want, regardless of what anyone else thinks.
not_available You don't like my style? What is that? 
not_available We were all here a long time before you.
not_available We work together.
not_available You're the new guy.
not_available You need to fit in, not us.
not_available What is this, a social club? If you can't, then we have a problem.
not_available I take risks to save my patients.
not_available Especially if you suck in the Residents.
not_available They need to be taught fundamentals.
not_available I'm about cutting
not_available edge medicine.
not_available Not esoteric unproven studies! I see a problem, I fix it, bam! What? 
not_available Maybe, you should fix that.
not_available Ah.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Does this happen often? Only after five or six beers and a bar fight.
not_available People just seem really wired after what happened here today.
not_available You picked up on that too, huh? Maybe we should have a critical incident debrief
not_available Yeah, that's a great idea.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, we'll have a critical incident debrief in Exam 3 after shift.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why do you think? This was a tough shift for people.
not_available It helps if we can get a chance to decompress before we go home.
not_available Yeah, well, that's why God created beer, right? This thing's mandatory? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Pass it on.
not_available What do you think? Kovac versus Clemente in a street fight? Kovac has size but I have a feeling Clemente's kind of squirrelly.
not_available I think you need help.
not_available What are you doing? Nothing.
not_available What happened to your nose? Kovac.
not_available He hit you? No, but I bet he would've liked to have.
not_available You know, the last time I got one of these was when Tina Marino caught me with her cousin.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Let me see.
not_available I think you need to be packed.
not_available It's tapering off.
not_available Yeah, that's not working.
not_available Lockhart, I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm really sorry about the little girl.
not_available Me too.
not_available I was trying to save her, despite what Dr.
not_available Kovac might think.
not_available I know.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm really, really sorry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Put your head back.
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available Have you found someone to replace Susan as chief of the ER? We're still looking at candidates.
not_available Is, uh, Clemente the favorite? He's certainly up there.
not_available Why? I'm just not sure he's the right person for the job.
not_available Yeah, well, if you think of somebody better, feel free to give me a call.
not_available Uh, what about me? You? I didn't think you wanted to be chief.
not_available Luka, it's really not your style.
not_available Maybe it's time for me to change my style.
not_available I've been here for a long time.
not_available I know the people, I know the department.
not_available I just wanna put my name into the mixture.
not_available Mix.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll let the committee know you're interested.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Eve's waiting for you guys in Exam 3 for the big powwow.
not_available She said it was mandatory.
not_available So did Clemente.
not_available They want us to express our feelings about what happened today.
not_available Well, today sucked.
not_available Good night.
not_available Great.
not_available Was it mandatory for everyone except the Attendings? Edna Cassleman, 56 found down in the park, altered, no sign of trauma.
not_available Thank you, Edna.
not_available Tell Eve I'm with a patient.
not_available Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Well, it can't be that bad, can it? It's not that.
not_available Michael's leave has been postponed.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Can I come by the house tonight, pick up my amp? Yeah.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I really don't feel like sticking around for this damn thing.
not_available I'll ditch if you do.
not_available I've got dinner reservations at Gibson's if you wanna grab a drink or five.
not_available Wow, I like the way you think, roomie.
not_available Your treat, right? 
not_available As long as you stop calling me that.
not_available Okay.
not_available How's the nose? Seems to be working.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The hell with this.
not_available Go home.
not_available See you later.
not_available Eve, I thought it was a great idea.
not_available I really did.
not_available This department needs a lot of work.
not_available This department needs a kick in the ass.
not_available Her parents show up? No.
not_available They should be here soon.
not_available After all she's been through maybe she's better off.
not_available I'm not sure anybody's better off dead.
not_available We, uh, recovered this in the parking lot.
not_available She was asking for it earlier.
not_available I gotta go check in on Officer Howe.
not_available I hear he's driving the nurses upstairs crazy.
not_available How much trouble will we get in for not showing? I'm not working until Saturday.
not_available Things will have blown over by then.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available I'm working tomorrow.
not_available Great.
not_available Now I'll get punished for both of us.
not_available Whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Security! Someone, call security! Security! Mr.
not_available Butler! Mr.
not_available Butler, stop it! You ever come near my daughter again, and I'll kill you.
not_available You hear me? Ray 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Ray.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available each other.
not_available Three wide
not_available pinpoint across the Chicago area.
not_available I'm gonna go ahead and widen the view out.
not_available Big storms across central Illinois.
not_available This is along the
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wanna come in? You didn't, uh You didn't go to the debriefing.
not_available Did you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was just me, Eve and Clemente.
not_available You hungry? Want some pizza? I can warm it up in
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mad about something? What do you think? Yes? Well, I didn't need to go to the debriefing
not_available Yeah, I don't care about that.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available I'm talking about you and Clemente.
not_available And whatever it is that is going on between the two of you.
not_available If you wanna get into a pissing match with him, fine.
not_available Leave me out of it.
not_available He was wrong.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available And that's the most important thing, isn't it? He was wrong and you were right.
not_available And while you were arguing about it, the little girl died.
not_available As if she hadn't suffered enough.
not_available God.
not_available She was 10 years old, Luka.
not_available And he had her for months, and I just I just can't stop thinking about what she must've gone through.
not_available And I can't stop thinking about how afraid she must've been.
not_available And I can't stop thinking about why we couldn't save her.
not_available I just
