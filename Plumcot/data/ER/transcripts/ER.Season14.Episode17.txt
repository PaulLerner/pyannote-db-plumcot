not_available Now all you guys need to do is finish operating on her so Rebecca and I can get out of here.
not_available All right? Come on.
not_available We'II, "uh " We'll get a helicopter or something.
not_available Something to take us somewhere.
not_available All we did was open her up.
not_available We haven't repaired anything yet.
not_available No, it's working.
not_available Right, doc? It's working.
not_available It's working, right? Yep.
not_available Yep, it's working.
not_available If we can fix the liver, we have a chance.
not_available Then keep going.
not_available Because she's gonna make it.
not_available Come on, keep going.
not_available Pick up some needle driver.
not_available You broke both your bones in your lower leg, your tibia and fibula.
not_available Shoot.
not_available I was gonna take pantomime class next week.
not_available We're gonna take him into Trauma and do a reduction under fluoro.
not_available Uh, what? They put the bones in place using x
not_available ray guidance.
not_available Does it hurt? 
not_available We'll put some good stuff in your Iv.
not_available How about some etomidate? 
not_available Twelve mics.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available I'm gonna call Charlie and tell him I need the rest of the day off.
not_available My dad doesn't get me.
not_available I'd give my left testicle to go to clown college in Florida.
not_available All the greats study there.
not_available He's just looking out for you.
not_available He doesn't like clowns, and he doesn't like circuses.
not_available I feel like he found me on a doorstep.
not_available Every kid says that at some point.
not_available I don't wanna sit around miserable all day working for retirement.
not_available Sounds pretty insightful.
not_available You must have given this a lot of thought, huh? I pay attention.
not_available That's all.
not_available All right.
not_available Here's what we're gonna do.
not_available Watch that monitor back there and look at the x
not_available rays while I manipulate your leg, okay? Impressive.

not_available Did her heart stop again? It's a retro
not_available hepatic injury.
not_available She's torn the liver off the vena cava.
not_available What? 
not_available Someone's gotta spell that out for me.
not_available We need to isolate the liver.
not_available The main blood vessel from the liver has been torn.
not_available It connects to an even bigger vein.
not_available It's very complicated.
not_available Well, you can do that.
not_available Come on, doc.
not_available You can do that.
not_available Two
not_available oh silk and an SH needle.
not_available Come on, doc.
not_available Vascular clamp.

not_available Who's still in there? 
not_available Neela, Morris and Gates.
not_available They're playing along.
not_available Come through here, please, and exit to the street.
not_available Have you seen my son?

not_available If you had minded your own business, everything would've been okay.
not_available This is about Rebecca.
not_available Don't do anything you're gonna regret.
not_available A little late for that now, you think? What was that? It's my patient.
not_available I gotta get him upstairs.
not_available No way.
not_available No way.
not_available His leg, it's broke in four places.
not_available Yeah, that's not my problem, is it? Look, the kid can't move.
not_available He can't get blood to his foot.
not_available He'll lose his leg.

not_available Then nobody gets hurt.
not_available How about that? We can't get you anything until you let me come in and talk.
not_available I don't wanna talk to you.
not_available Daniel, this is the hard way.
not_available Let's make this easier, huh? Yeah, yeah, you wanna see hard? Keep running your yap.
not_available Daniel 
not_available Lf we could wake her up, we would.
not_available Shut up.
not_available This sucks, I know.
not_available I know losing someone 
not_available We had plans.
not_available We were gonna get our house back.
not_available We were gonna put a patio in the yard.
not_available She wanted to plant a garden.
not_available You should say goodbye to her, Daniel.
not_available It's time to say goodbye.
not_available The sooner you do this, the sooner she can let go.
not_available Then you can go see your mom.
not_available My mom? She died five years ago.
not_available Pancreatic cancer.
not_available I was with her when she took her final breath.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available So you've been through this before.
not_available I get it.
not_available Doc, I won't do it again.
not_available You don't have a choice, Daniel.
not_available Okay? Because she is not waking up.
not_available Okay, now, you have done everything.
not_available Everything that a man would do for his family, even today.
not_available You were trying to get your life back.
not_available I get it.
not_available Anyone can understand that.
not_available I never meant to hurt anybody.
not_available I know, so why start now? Even if we could get her back her brain has been deprived of so much oxygen she would be bedridden, unable to talk or function.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available It's true.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available It's true.
not_available Is that what you want? Or what she would want? When I stop these compressions she's gonna leave us.
not_available And you'll do what's right.
not_available You remember when we met at the coffee shop that night? That wasn't the first time I'd seen you.
not_available The day before, I was walking down Hill Street and I noticed you going into the bookstore.
not_available So I went in and hid behind a bookshelf and watched you work all day.
not_available I remember you were reading "Goodnight Moon" to some kids.
not_available And I thought, "How can I get a girl like that?" You know? I'm so s I tried to fix it.
not_available I tried to make it better.
not_available It wasn't supposed to go like this.
not_available Daniel.
not_available Why don't you hand me the gun? And I can tell the police it's over.
not_available I'm sorry for putting you guys through this.
not_available You tried, doc.
not_available I know you tried.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Just pass it to me.
not_available Daniel.
not_available Daniel?
