not_available Hi.
not_available Dad, this is Cynthia Hooper.

not_available It's nice of you.
not_available Here, let me take that.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I got it.
not_available How was your flight? 
not_available It was great.
not_available Especially the landing.
not_available I've never seen the Pacific before.
not_available Do you have luggage? I think I packed too much.
not_available You look like your dad.
not_available I can't believe they lost my bags.
not_available Your mom will be disappointed if you don't stop by.
not_available The new hospital looks nice.
not_available Best facility in the country.
not_available I couldn't let you do this alone.
not_available It's sweet, but what about your shifts? I left a message for Kerry Weaver.
not_available Mark, this is family.
not_available I know it's your family, but Mrs.
not_available Greene.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Greene, please.
not_available Be careful, please.
not_available No, don't make me stop.
not_available I thought sailors loved the cancan.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available There you are! Oh, I'm so glad! You okay? 
not_available Look what I did.
not_available I'm so mad at myself.
not_available Well, accidents happen.
not_available All I can do is cancan, and the corpsman says I can't cancan.
not_available Cancan.
not_available What meds is she on? Morphine and a benzo.
not_available Ativan? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Sayers is tapering her off.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sayers? Is that her orthopod? 
not_available He's the neurologist.
not_available Why does she have a neurologist? Can I fill in your son? A mother has to have some secrets, right? Could you get him? 
not_available I'll see who's on call.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Cynthia Hooper.
not_available Nice to meet you, Mrs.
not_available Greene.
not_available You're getting married? 
not_available No, we're not thinking about that now.
not_available At least you're not a sourpuss.
not_available I hope not.
not_available His first wife had a real sour streak.
not_available Mark, as much as I hate to say it, I'm afraid Rachel's got it too.
not_available You can visit tomorrow.
not_available We gotta say good night.
not_available Okay, baby.
not_available Night
not_available night.
not_available Sweet dreams.
not_available I love you.
not_available You too.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Good night.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Good night, Mrs.
not_available Greene.
not_available Bye, sweetheart.
not_available I want to speak with Dr.
not_available Sayers, on call or not.
not_available Your mother's heavily medicated.
not_available That's not my mother.
not_available Did she hit her head when she fell? For the fifth time, I have no idea.
not_available She didn't mention it.
not_available Maybe something slid off the shelf and hit her.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sayers says it's normal.
not_available I disagree.
not_available Looks like a little low
not_available density to me.
not_available What would that mean? She wasn't acting like this before? 
not_available You mean being emotional and all? No, I mean being loony and out of control.
not_available She wasn't that bad.
not_available It's the morphine.
not_available That's what Dr.
not_available Sayers said.
not_available With her blood pressure, I don't want to take any chances.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Greene? I have Dr.
not_available Sayers for you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sayers is a straight shooter.
not_available I respect the man.
not_available Your mother's getting first
not_available rate care.
not_available They owe her that.
not_available Don't you worry about this.
not_available Mark is gonna get to the bottom of it.
not_available No, it doesn't look like artifact to me.
not_available That's not good enough.
not_available I want the MRl done tomorrow morning.
not_available What a nice, quiet neighborhood you live in.
not_available Got beer in the house? Look.
not_available You may find a couple in the garage.
not_available May I please use your bathroom? My eyeballs are ready to float.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Through there.
not_available Nobody says that anymore.
not_available "Yes, ma'am.
not_available " "No, ma'am.
not_available " It makes you feel better just hearing it.
not_available Yes, ma'am, it does.
not_available Oh, I feel so much better.
not_available Thanks for the shampoo.
not_available Is this too weird? No.
not_available Me in my old bed.
not_available You in my mom's bathrobe.
not_available Not weird at all.
not_available I can take it off.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Do you think your dad minds that I'm here? I think he likes me.
not_available Of course he likes you.
not_available What's not to like? He's really beating himself up over your mom.
not_available That'd be a first.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Just being here brings out the adolescent in me.
not_available Flip over.
not_available I'll do your back.
not_available So this was your bed growing up? From age 8.
not_available We moved it from Jacksonville, to Norfolk to Corpus Christi, to D.C.
not_available So that's why you curl up when you sleep.
not_available Your feet are hanging over the edge of the bed.
not_available All through high school.
not_available And during high school you would lie in this very bed And think about Kate Jackson.
not_available Kate Jackson? Not Farrah Fawcett? No.
not_available Farrah Fawcett's too scary.
not_available And Holly Fecteau.
not_available The girl next door.
not_available Who would one night sneak into this room pick up the covers and slide into the bed, next to you.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available We're late.
not_available I told you to give me a shout.
not_available You took so long to get cleaned up.
not_available You don't just turn off a router and walk away.
not_available There he is.
not_available Who? Dr.
not_available Sayers.
not_available Dr.
not_available Sayers! You've caught me, sir.
not_available It's addiction when you're running late and stop for your morning fix.
not_available This is my son, Mark.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available You get a few hours sleep? A few.
not_available I'd like a triple grande, non
not_available fat cap.
not_available Gentlemen? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'll take a tall latte.
not_available Coming up.
not_available We're Navy, but we're still California.
not_available And one of those almond buns too.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Coming up.
not_available I know you're concerned.
not_available Her history of high blood pressure
not_available And she has an upgoing right toe.
not_available It suggests stroke.
not_available CT didn't confirm that, and I didn't detect hemiparesis or hyperreflexia.
not_available That's why I wanted the MRl.
not_available I was waiting to complete a neuro exam before more tests.
not_available Mark, if that's better
not_available Dealer's choice.
not_available My concern is giving your mom time
not_available Time could be her worst enemy.
not_available It's why we moved it up.
not_available I'd like to be present for the neuro exam.
not_available You're tapering her off the narcotics, but, frankly, I'm
not_available Present arms! Mrs.
not_available Greene, we're going to begin the first sequence.
not_available Okay.
not_available This will take about a half an hour, Mom.
not_available It's important that you don't move or speak.
not_available Just take shallow, easy breaths.
not_available This first sequence will take Beginning now.
not_available Where did my dad go? He said he'd be back after lunch.
not_available Went back to his garage.
not_available He's building a wheelchair ramp for my mom when she comes home.
not_available It's all he's worried about.
not_available It'll come in handy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hang in there, Mrs.
not_available Greene.
not_available You're doing well.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Just relax.
not_available No! 
not_available I'm here, Mom.
not_available I'm here.
not_available Mark? I can't stand it! Mark, get me out! All right, stop it.
not_available I'm getting her out.
not_available Oh, please! Oh, please! It's okay.
not_available I'm here, Mom.
not_available I'm here.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't move your leg.
not_available I can't stand it! What's the matter with me, Mark?! It's normal.
not_available It's a normal reaction.
not_available I was all alone! Yes.
not_available I was all alone! You're not alone now.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm here for you, Mom.
not_available You're a good boy, Mark.
not_available Stay with me, please? I'll stay.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available I'll stay.
not_available Just like always? Just like always.
not_available How's that ramp coming? Taking a break.
not_available What did the doctor say? Just presumptive diagnosis.
not_available Doctor's best guess.
not_available Her symptoms present like a deep
not_available tissue disease in the frontal lobe of the brain.
not_available MRI and second CT don't indicate stroke or injury.
not_available Sayers is thinking multi
not_available infarct dementia.
not_available What's that? Small infarcts, too small to detect in the brain tissue.
not_available It could manifest as disinhibition and it fits with her history of hypertension.
not_available Can you explain that in English? What's an infarct? A series of very small strokes.
not_available What can they do about it? 
not_available Not much.
not_available Take a waitand
not_available see approach.
not_available Do you still box? 
not_available No.
not_available You always had the footwork for it.
not_available I hated the whole thing.
not_available You made that clear.
not_available What do you think about this waitand
not_available see for your mother? I think the whole thing stinks.
not_available Dad? Dad? Greene residence.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available Hold on just a second.
not_available What was that? Stanley? Stanley what? What's this regarding? Well, she may know, but this is her son and she'll be tied up this week.
not_available I don't think she's gonna keep her appointment, whatever it's for.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll pass it along.
not_available It's like a foreign language.
not_available You have to grow up in it.
not_available Hey, good morning! My luggage didn't come, did it? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Dad, do you know a Stanley Black? 
not_available No.
not_available Where does Mom go every Thursday? 
not_available What do you mean? On her calendar, 2:00 is marked on Thursday for the last few months.
not_available Could be her women's group at the Family Services Pavilion.
not_available Which group is that? Spouses of retired officers.
not_available Wives get together.
not_available Is that for bridge, service projects, or what? It's your mother's group.
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Who wants breakfast? I'll make eggs.
not_available You already got one burning.
not_available You take that one, instead of sneaking mine when I'm not around.
not_available You counting cigarettes now? I'll pass on breakfast, thanks.
not_available I didn't start that.
not_available He was in a good mood before.
not_available What were those three items that I asked you to remember earlier? There were three.
not_available Yes.
not_available One was a phone book.
not_available Were they important? 
not_available Not really.
not_available But do you remember? A phone book an apple and? Banana? No? Do I lose points for guessing? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available Let's move on.
not_available I'm going to tell you a saying.
not_available It's something that you've heard before.
not_available I want you to tell me what it means.
not_available Okay.
not_available "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw bricks.
not_available " Have you heard that one? Yes, I have.
not_available I've heard it.
not_available And what does it mean? I should get this.
not_available We've lived in lots of different houses, haven't we, Mark? Never a glass house.
not_available "People in glass houses shouldn't throw bricks.
not_available " Well, people shouldn't throw bricks.
not_available Even if it's close quarters, and it usually is.
not_available You've got to get along with the other families.
not_available They're all in the same boat you are.
not_available The children are probably the ones throwing the bricks.
not_available And how do the mothers stop them if the fathers aren't around? It's always the mother's fault.
not_available Even if she doesn't wanna have the children in the first place.
not_available That was a trick question.
not_available But I think I've got it, sneaky.
not_available If you live in a glass house there are no bricks to throw.
not_available Right? Right? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've got Corey
not_available Bloom Acta Neurologica Scandinavia McLaughlin, Sandison and Flostein.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm off at 12, but you're welcome to stay if you need to.
not_available I will.
not_available Hey.
not_available I thought you were asleep.
not_available I woke up.
not_available Sorry I got ahead of you.
not_available Don't you dare apologize.
not_available I thought you were with me.
not_available You are the most considerate man that I've ever been with.
not_available Every single time doesn't have to be about me.
not_available Still, I I don't know where you get it.
not_available You know, being so generous? If I had whatever it is that your mom has and if I just said everything that was on my mind I would thank both of your parents for raising a son who's such a good lover.
not_available You bring it out in me.
not_available You lie.
not_available It has nothing to do with me.
not_available You take care of people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's me, the caretaker.
not_available It's not a bad thing.
not_available I'm like a magnet for needy people.
not_available It's like they find me wherever I go.
not_available Like I did? No.
not_available Yeah, Mark.
not_available I lean on you.
not_available I mean, it must be a drag.
not_available No.
not_available It's just all this stuff with my mom.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're just overwhelmed right now.
not_available Very still, Mom.
not_available Very still.
not_available What's this one for? We want to rule out encephalitis.
not_available It may be why you're not feeling like yourself.
not_available Isn't that why they scanned my belly? That was to rule out Paraneoplastic Syndrome.
not_available Almost done.
not_available How many more rule
not_available outs are left? Are you getting tired? The other doctor said I could go home.
not_available He signed off on the knee.
not_available They still have to do an EEG tomorrow.
not_available It doesn't have to be done.
not_available If it's Jakob
not_available Creutzfeldt, I don't wanna mess around.
not_available How about a brain biopsy while we're at it? I know I'm pushing you for a more aggressive approach than you're used to.
not_available I can be thorough without being aggressive.
not_available All done, Mrs.
not_available Greene.
not_available Can I go now? 
not_available Probably in another day or two.
not_available If my mother were in the ER, I'd be terrible support for her.
not_available I don't have the temperament for ER.
not_available I don't have the temperament for passive treatment.
not_available Is your mother sick too, doctor? No, my mother's fine.
not_available Your indulging me in a few tests is not enough.
not_available I want a second opinion.
not_available I'll ask the head of Neurology.
not_available No.
not_available I'll find a civilian.
not_available She's been seeing this shrink.
not_available What for? The guy wouldn't tell me without a release.
not_available I'm gonna meet with him at the hospital tomorrow.
not_available Sorry, son.
not_available Are you a retired naval officer? No, my father is.
not_available We're meeting him here.
not_available I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
not_available Give me a break.
not_available It's club night.
not_available You need to be with a retired officer.
not_available He's on his way.
not_available He's late.
not_available You'll have to wait for him.
not_available You're wrong, pal.
not_available We're seated.
not_available We'll have a draft and a margarita.
not_available You got it.
not_available What are you buying me? 
not_available I beg your pardon? You're as stubborn as your old man.
not_available Don't tell me you're as cheap as he is too? Admiral J.
not_available Jackson, retired.
not_available You better be Dave Greene's son or I just got myself into a hornet's nest.
not_available That's right.
not_available Mark Greene.
not_available This is Cynthia Hooper.
not_available How do you do? Your dad just called to say he'd be late.
not_available So, what are you drinking? Not a drop more.
not_available I'm late for dinner as it is.
not_available Pleased to see you again, though.
not_available We met your senior year.
not_available You were considering Annapolis.
not_available My dad was considering Annapolis.
not_available Well, you can't blame your old man for trying.
not_available Turn down a flag billet for your family you want your son to make the grade.
not_available What's a flag billet? 
not_available Admiral.
not_available His dad was in line.
not_available Middle of his command tour.
not_available He took himself out of the running.
not_available Why? Didn't he wanna be admiral? Long story.
not_available Put their drinks on my tab.
not_available You're sure you don't wanna stay? Admiral J., nice to see you, sir.
not_available Sorry I have to run.
not_available I could relive the Korean conflict for you young folks.
not_available How's Ruth? 
not_available She'll be home tomorrow.
not_available She will? That's what I said.
not_available Lucy and I'll drop by when she's feeling better.
not_available Nice seeing you, meeting you.
not_available Same here.
not_available What can I get you, Dad? 
not_available Not a thing.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available Why'd you say Mom's coming home? She's had her last test.
not_available No, she hasn't.
not_available Yes, she has, Mark.
not_available Syphilis? What? You tested your mother for syphilis? Are the results back? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I stopped the whole damn thing.
not_available Whatever gave you the idea? I need an explanation.
not_available What the hell do you think of your mother? The symptoms fit.
not_available What the hell do you think of me? Settle down, Dad.
not_available Why don't you use your inhaler? Is your oxygen in the car? 
not_available Some damn nerve.
not_available If the test is so unthinkable, what's your fear? You're accusing me? 
not_available No! He didn't mean it like that.
not_available I need a diagnosis.
not_available You need someone to blame, like always.
not_available Take it easy, Dad.
not_available Don't you patronize me.
not_available There's no need for you to meddle.
not_available Should I get your oxygen? 
not_available Insults your mother.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available Go back to Chicago and leave us alone.
not_available I mean she's going home! Good.
not_available I'll tell that psychiatrist she's been secretly seeing not to come to the hospital.
not_available What the hell are you talking
not_available ? She's going to a shrink, not a sewing circle every Thursday.
not_available Why would she do that? 
not_available Mark, come on.
not_available Or is that me meddling? Making too much trouble? When her life with you is so picture
not_available perfect! All right, Dad.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available Where's your albuterol? Shall I get the oxygen? Yes, go! 
not_available He's not breathing.
not_available Get him on the ground.
not_available Call 911 for him.
not_available All right.
not_available Let him down easy.
not_available Your dad's peak flow improved to 250.
not_available Has a pH of 7.38 on 10 liters.
not_available His PO2's 65.
not_available His PCO2's down to 48.
not_available It won't get better.
not_available He's a heavy smoker.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We've got him on Captain Greene, do you feel better? I feel fine.
not_available I know you've been under stress with your wife admitted upstairs.
not_available That's right.
not_available That may have brought on the attack.
not_available We'll keep an eye on you here in the ER for a few hours.
not_available Why don't you come back later? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Kind of gave us a scare.
not_available Is Cindy with your mom? Drove her home.
not_available She was asleep on her feet.
not_available You're not going to bother your mother with this? No.
not_available She doesn't need to know.
not_available I'm sorry if I upset you.
not_available About that test for your mom? 
not_available It's canceled.
not_available No.
not_available Draw the blood.
not_available You need to know.
not_available I was treating her depression with Paxil.
not_available She failed to mention her hypertension.
not_available I should let you know I'm getting a neurological consult from a colleague at UCSD.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hemmings.
not_available She was with her when I arrived this morning.
not_available But I told her I agree with Dr.
not_available Sayers' diagnosis.
not_available Multiinfarcts dementia in co
not_available morbidity with her depression.
not_available I know it's not the diagnosis you're hoping for.
not_available It's not about what I hope for, it's about my mother's care.
not_available I'm sure you've heard about how stubborn the men are in my family.
not_available I know it's confidential.
not_available Your mother signed a release.
not_available You can know about her psychiatric treatment.
not_available If I wanna know about my mom, I'll ask her.
not_available Be sure you want the answers.
not_available In her current state, she's liable to tell you.
not_available Mark.
not_available Mark! What's wrong? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You were gone for a long time.
not_available I guess I needed it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hemmings called.
not_available She wants to push up your meeting to 3:00.
not_available It's the neurologist I called in.
not_available She's an old friend? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Went to med school.
not_available She wanted to know if I'd be coming along.
not_available I figured you'd want to talk about your mom privately.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's about her condition.
not_available Hey, take turns or you'll both get a time
not_available out.
not_available Thank you, Josh.
not_available They say girls are more mellow.
not_available Please confirm that.
not_available Don't ask me.
not_available You have Rachel.
not_available Not full
not_available time.
not_available I remember when Rachel was born.
not_available We were third
not_available year.
not_available I was so envious of you and Jen.
not_available You? You were the most driven student in class.
not_available Yeah, but you were the most together.
not_available You knew you wanted a family and you went for it.
not_available And now you've lapped me.
not_available Twice.
not_available If I knew you were on maternity leave, I wouldn't have called.
not_available It was my pleasure.
not_available I was a little taken aback when I found out that your mom's a patient of Andrew Sayers.
not_available He's hot stuff.
not_available Gaining a national reputation.
not_available I haven't been that wowed.
not_available I'm really surprised at you, Mark.
not_available Josh, no.
not_available Please.
not_available We don't throw sand.
not_available I thought the ER would be a brief detour.
not_available I thought for sure you'd end up in family practice.
not_available Really? I was that boring? You know I didn't think that.
not_available We were 25.
not_available I was busy showing how independent I was and you were going to be the family man.
not_available Now here I am, and you're a cowboy.
not_available I still haven't given up on the idea of having a family.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cynthia sounded sweet.
not_available Still know how to cut to the quick, don't you? You wanna hear about your mom? Do I? Your mom may not fully return to the way she was.
not_available That's gonna take some getting used to.
not_available How's she doing? She was asleep when I arrived.
not_available I owe you an apology.
not_available No.
not_available It's your mother.
not_available But still, I 
not_available It wasn't personal.
not_available You don't have to explain.
not_available My dad was in the Navy too.
not_available Chip on my shoulder's easy to read? Plain as rank.
not_available Strong, hardworking father
not_available Never there.
not_available But you followed in your dad's footsteps? I wish I could tell you it got me closer.
not_available Give me a hand! 
not_available What's going on? We gotta move your dad.
not_available I got a mass cal coming in.
not_available They had a chopper crash.
not_available A CH
not_available 46.
not_available Holds a platoon? Just had her crew aboard and one injured.
not_available How many? Three! 
not_available Evac's landed.
