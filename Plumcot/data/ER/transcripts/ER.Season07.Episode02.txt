not_available Regina, did you have any ultrasounds? 
not_available My doctor said everything was okay.
not_available Who's your doctor?

not_available I should have stayed home.
not_available This is not your fault.
not_available This happens.
not_available Ok, we are giving you medicine to stop de contractions.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Order another lamp.
not_available It's on its way down.
not_available What's his pulse?

not_available He went to call a priest.
not_available We want to baptize our baby.
not_available There's a priest on call with the hospital, unless you had someone specific in mind.
not_available No, we're just in town for a few days.
not_available My doctor said I could travel during my second trimester.
not_available This probably would have happened whether you were traveling or not.
not_available We tried for almost two years to get pregnant and finally gave up.
not_available And then suddenly, I was.
not_available Look at him.
not_available He's hanging on.
not_available I counted 10 little fingers and 10 little toes.
not_available He looks perfect.
not_available He's just a little small.
not_available Even if your baby was a few weeks older and somehow managed to survive
not_available I know that that's what you say because that's what you've seen but maybe he's meant to be a miracle.
not_available Sometimes you have to help a miracle along.
not_available And sometimes you have to let go.
not_available What took so long? 
not_available They had us holding.
not_available Are we still in Trauma 1? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available How bad is it? 
not_available I'm not sure I should discuss this.

not_available Your patient has an abscess around L4 and L5.
not_available Who? 
not_available Patterson.
not_available I was in Radiology.
not_available Bored? 
not_available What? Poaching my patients? There can be improvement in the first 24 hours after a stroke.
not_available In Glenda's case, I'm afraid there's too much brain damage.
not_available She won't recover? 
not_available Maybe slightly.
not_available Dr.

not_available She's not competent.
not_available She's confused.
not_available Does she have an advance directive? What do you mean? 
not_available Like a "Do Not Resuscitate" order.
not_available I don't think she'd want a ventilator.
not_available Suction.
not_available I'll put in an airway.
not_available Are you a family member? 
not_available No, she's her They're together.
not_available Do you have power of attorney? No, I guess I should 
not_available Sats are climbing.
not_available Let's keep her on 50 liters by mask.
not_available She's okay? 
not_available For now.
not_available But we'll have to intubate her unless a family member directs us not to.
not_available Or a spouse? 
not_available One recognized by law.

not_available Is this about Mr.
not_available Fletcher? I'll tell you what.
not_available When they're ready, page me, all right? Maureen Conway, Financial.
not_available We can't admit Mr.
not_available Fletcher.
not_available Why not? He's got Medicare.
not_available Which he sold to a bankrupt HMO.
not_available That's not his fault.
not_available But in nine months, they have not paid claims Mr.
not_available Fletcher has run up $200,000 in unrecouped charges.
not_available He needs a new dialysis shunt.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano left strict orders.
not_available Stabilize in the ER and then transfer.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Do you have an M.D.? 
not_available No.
not_available You're gonna tell me how to treat my patients? I've got a pheochromocytoma, How do you suggest I treat him? Do whatever is necessary.

not_available We took Regina to get cleaned up.
not_available Believe it or not, a shower can help.
not_available She did everything right.
not_available She read that damn Expecting book.
not_available It's important that she knows it's not her fault.
not_available What happened? Did he die? 
not_available No.
not_available You wait here.
not_available Did they find something? Neonatology examines every preemie.
not_available They might do something? 
not_available Wait.
not_available Note how the thinness makes thermal regulation impossible.
not_available The eyes remain closedWhat are you doing? We heard you had a micro
not_available preemie.
not_available This isn't showand
not_available tell.
not_available No, it's a teaching hospital.
not_available As you can see, the heart, limbs and palate are fully formed.
not_available We might be able to see the heart beating.
not_available Okay, put him down.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Put him down.
not_available He is not a science experiment.
not_available He isn't.
not_available But I need to examine every birth for congenital anomalies.
not_available You examined him.
not_available Now go.
not_available When I'm finished.
not_available The father is standing outside thinking that you are saving his baby.
not_available How long would you like to torture him? Are there any questions? No? Good.
not_available Transfer him to the fifth floor.
not_available No.
not_available You can't keep him here.
not_available I'm not sending the parents upstairs with the mothers.
not_available The NICU then.
not_available He's staying here with his parents so they can have some privacy.
not_available In the ER? 
not_available Yes.

not_available I know this is difficult.
not_available Don't be afraid to touch him.
not_available He's not suffering, is he? 
not_available No.
not_available We got multiple MVAs coming up.
not_available Find someplace else.
not_available This is a Trauma Room.
not_available I don't care.

not_available An Attending for a week and already you're stealing the fascinomas, huh? 
not_available You can have him.
not_available I wasn't asking permission.
not_available We have a problem with a patient.
not_available Why do you say "we"? 
not_available Financial won't let me admit him.
not_available Don't let those geeks push you around, Peter.
not_available Show a little backbone, before you come crying.
not_available Otherwise they'll never respect you.
not_available They're blocking him on your orders.
not_available That's different.
not_available Let's take a look.
not_available I've cleared him for surgery.
not_available I can have him out in 24 hours.
not_available 28 admissions for renal failure? 
not_available He frequently misses dialysis.
not_available Street him.
not_available I am done carrying these parasites.
not_available That's an EMT ALA violation.

not_available None of your business.
not_available More important things to do? 
not_available I don't like you.

not_available I'm hurt, Mr.

not_available What about my pain pill? I need my pill! 
not_available The nurse is gonna bring it.
not_available She's too slow.
not_available I need a new nurse.
not_available Put him on a bus to Milwaukee.
not_available He's fluid
not_available overloaded.
not_available This guy knows exactly what's gonna happen if he misses his dialysis and he still blows it off.
not_available He's not gonna stop abusing the system till we draw the line.
not_available What's this? 
not_available This is for his bus ticket.
not_available You serious? New state, new Medicaid and a new set of doctors to piss off.
not_available He lives in Chicago.
not_available Cry me a river.
not_available Oh, man Please call back immediately.

not_available She didn't grant her partner power of attorney.
not_available I'm trying to find a legal way to fulfill her wishes.
not_available 27 years should count for something.
not_available She has a chance of survival.
not_available But what kind of life? Intubation is an appropriate step.
not_available The only one who can change that is the next of kin.
not_available She is the next of kin.
not_available They lived their lives together.
not_available We should treat them like a couple.
not_available I agree.
not_available The law doesn't.
not_available If her sats drop below 80, tube her.
not_available No.
not_available What? If you want to manage it this way, then you should manage it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine.
not_available Give me the chart.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I just
not_available I need a picture.
not_available I understand.
not_available Should we use the name? 
not_available You don't want to? No, I think we should.
not_available There's only one boy's name we could agree on.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Julian.
not_available It's a nice name.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How much longer? I don't know.
not_available It could be a few minutes.
not_available It could be a few hours.
not_available Let's take him outside.
not_available What? We'll take him to a lake or a park.
not_available If he's gonna die, I don't want him to die in here.
not_available We have to wait for the priest.
not_available Is he coming? 
not_available I'll check again.
not_available Abby.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I paged you three times.
not_available We had a 22
not_available week birth here.
not_available You had a patient upstairs who needed you.
not_available Did she deliver? 
not_available Yes, she delivered.
not_available Shoulder dystocia.
not_available Is the baby okay? Well, apart from a broken clavicle, he'll be fine.
not_available She was scared and asking for you.
not_available If you take shifts as a nurse, I need you to work as a nurse.
not_available You cannot let these women grow dependent on you and then walk out.
not_available I was taking care of this woman and her baby.
not_available There are other people down here who can do that.
not_available Janet, I'm sorry, it was my call.
not_available I asked Abby to stay.
not_available These parents are distraught.
not_available There's nothing we can do but they need support, and Abby's been with them since the birth.
not_available Just don't ignore my page.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available No.
not_available You're doing the hard part.
not_available Is he still breathing? 
not_available Agonally.
not_available Let me know when you pronounce.
not_available Okay.
not_available Last time I got heated blankets and an extra pillow.
not_available What's open? 
not_available Depends on what you have.
not_available Revision of an AV graft, left forearm.
not_available Fletcher? 
not_available How did you know? Dr.
not_available Romano warned me you'd try to bring him.
not_available It's my call.
not_available Just give me a room.
not_available I'm sorry, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'll be out in less than an hour.
not_available He actually said he'd fire me.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, well, please hurry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The priest talked that woman down.
not_available He's gonna baptize this baby.
not_available How long has it been? 
not_available Five hours.
not_available He's really hanging on.
not_available Maybe the mother is right.
not_available Maybe he is a miracle.
not_available In 10, 15 years we might be able to help.
not_available They wanted to try.
not_available We could intubate him.
not_available Abby 
not_available I know.
not_available It's his time on Earth, and all you can do is make it a good time.
not_available I think he stopped breathing.
not_available Here we go.
not_available That's not a respirator? 
not_available No.
not_available It provides pressure to her lungs so she doesn't have to work so hard to breathe.
not_available Her father died of lung cancer.
not_available I remember Glenda and her brother fighting outside the ICU.
not_available Danny couldn't let go, and Glenda couldn't watch her father suffer like that.
not_available You know, all those tubes.
not_available After her first stroke, Glenda made me promise to never let her die like that.
not_available We'll do everything we can to reach her brother.
not_available He doesn't know her like I do.
not_available I love her.
not_available I don't want to lose her, but I know what she wants.
not_available His breathing just slowed down and then it just stopped.
not_available Please, if you could do anything Is there a heartbeat? No.
not_available You want to call it? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is that it? The time of death is
not_available Wait! His chest moved.
not_available Is he still alive? Got a heartbeat.
not_available Yes, but your sister has an aspiration pneumonia.
not_available If we put her on a ventilator, she may never come off it.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available She suffered a massive stroke from which she probably will not recover.
not_available Mr.
not_available Walton, I cannot give you percentages.
not_available Extremely unlikely.
not_available Your sister's wishes are not to be kept alive by artificial means.
not_available Judy.
not_available Would you like to talk to her? Yes, if we don't intubate her, she will die, but the chances ofThe chances of a meaningful recovery are extremely
not_available I understand.
not_available Yes.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Hey, you.
not_available Malatucci.
not_available Malucci.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Have you seen the OIG officer down here? Who? Deputy inspector general.
not_available Regulates our Medicare compliance.
not_available Short, battleax, humorless? 
not_available That's her.
not_available Curtain Two.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Benton told you you needed surgery? He brought me upstairs.
not_available Why didn't he operate? 
not_available Nurse wouldn't let him in.
not_available He tried to tell me they didn't have a room ready.
not_available Mr.
not_available Fletcher, we're ready for you.
not_available Sandy.
not_available Hello, Robert.
not_available What an unexpected visit.
not_available I'm investigating a possible EMT ALA violation.
not_available What patient? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Fletcher.
not_available Some sort of spot audit? We got a call you were bouncing him.
not_available From whom? 
not_available Anonymous.
not_available Anonymous does not equal reliable.
not_available I was just coming to take Mr.
not_available Fletcher to surgery.
not_available Is that true, Dr.
not_available Benton? I'm sure Dr.
not_available Romano's found a room.
not_available This is a consent form.
not_available I'll explain it.
not_available I know the drill.
not_available Tell me you don't have policy to redirect all non
not_available paying Medicare HMO patients.
not_available How could we? We're a county hospital.
not_available Good.
not_available Always a pleasure.
not_available I'm sure.
not_available I think you should know that I will be auditing all of your patient transfers from the last month.
not_available Audit away.
not_available No skeletons here.
not_available I hope so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, I felt I had to
not_available Not a word, Peter.
not_available Not a single word.
not_available You're not gonna leave a scar, are you? The hack that first put this in left a
not_available Shut up.
not_available I'd have had better exposure and direct visualisation without beaming a gigavolt of radiation into the man.
not_available A gigavolt? 
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available I could have completely evacuated all the infected tissue.
not_available These guys are going in half
not_available blind.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Next spinal abscess is all yours, I promise.
not_available Where is this place, anyway? 
not_available You'll see.
not_available These are houses, Mark.
not_available Oh, Mark! It's beautiful! See, I have some taste.
not_available Can you afford it? I've been living cheap.
not_available Besides, I'm gonna have a roommate.
not_available That's awfully presumptuous of you.
not_available I could take out an ad.
not_available You will not! I love it! Check out the refrigerator.
not_available It's nice and cold.
not_available Look at this deck! I knew you'd love that.
not_available When can we move in? When can you pack? 
not_available It has an icemaker.
not_available These floors are gorgeous! 
not_available Check it out.
not_available What? 
not_available The icemaker.
not_available It's lovely.
not_available You have to open it.
not_available It has a special ice feature.
not_available What? Does the ice come in different
not_available shaped cubes or something? Oh, my God.
not_available Mark I'm a little nervous.
not_available So Let me say it.
not_available Elizabeth, I love you.
not_available I was hoping you'd give me the joy and honor of being your husband.
not_available Is that a yes? Yes.
not_available Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and Earth? I do.
not_available Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his son, who was born of the Virgin Mary suffered and died, but rose and now sits at the Father's right hand? I do.
not_available Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life? Regina and Joseph, is it your will that Julian should be baptized in the faith of the church which we have professed? Yes.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available Hi.
not_available Could I get a coffee with cream, no sugar, to go? Sure.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available You back already? No, not for another week.
not_available What, are you just hanging out? 
not_available I have a diversion meeting at 9.
not_available You look much better.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, I like your hair.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Some nice scrubs.
not_available You picking up some extra shifts? No.
not_available I was suspended.
not_available Didn't kill anybody, did you? 
not_available No.
not_available I wanted to.
not_available My ex
not_available husband was supposed to pay my tuition.
not_available He didn't pay it, so I'm on the bench, but it didn't seem like that today.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, I got that.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hey, it's a cup of coffee.
not_available Sit down.
not_available It's the least I can do after acting like a complete jerk.
not_available When? Three months ago.
not_available You know, you might have saved my life.
not_available If you hadn't stopped me when you did, I could be dead now.
not_available I'm working on my steps here.
not_available You're up to nine already? More or less.
not_available I forgive you.
not_available Do you mind? Sorry.
not_available I really have to quit again.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Keep it.
not_available Long day? Yeah.
not_available nine hours.
not_available I just finished the death kit.
not_available Wow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't know why I do this.
not_available I should go be an accountant.
not_available That's an option.
not_available If I could balance a checkbook.
not_available What about you? A lot of waiting.
not_available A lot of meetings.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You get kind of meeting
not_available ed out.
not_available Aren't you gonna ask? What? What I was doing there this morning? You only go for one reason.
not_available I figured I'd keep going and eventually you'd stand up and share.
not_available It's not that interesting.
not_available I'm a drunk.
not_available How long have you been sober? 
not_available Five years.
not_available So you could sponsor somebody.
not_available Yeah, I guess.
not_available Have you? 
not_available No.
not_available Because I'm supposed to find a sponsor.
not_available Don't look at me.
not_available No? No, I'm barely holding my own life together right now.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Because it would be great to have somebody at the hospital.
not_available You did start me on my recovery.
not_available Men and women aren't supposed to sponsor each other.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're not gonna make me ask a stranger, are you? I mean, the only person I met at the meeting was the coffee guy.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I will work the steps with you until you find a permanent sponsor.
not_available Fair enough.
not_available I'll start by setting a good example.
not_available I don't think cigarettes are gonna do it for me tonight.
not_available No? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm getting a hot fudge sundae.
not_available Would you like one? 
not_available I got enough vices.
not_available No.
not_available I think part of the rules should be that you have to splurge with me.
not_available Is that how it works?
