not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Med student.
not_available Why didn't you say anything? No one listens to me.
not_available No one even remembers I was in the room.
not_available I've been ordering my own scans since I've been here.
not_available What's that about? 
not_available It's about me making the rules.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available That's stupid.
not_available Congratulations, Jake.
not_available Your ER rotation is officially over.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 11x14 "JUST AS I AM" Good evening.
not_available Can I help you? Room 415? 
not_available End of the hall.
not_available Helen? Helen, it's Kerry.
not_available I don't wanna leave it like this.
not_available The things that we said.
not_available Is this how you wanna leave it? If it is, tell me and I'll go away like we never even met.
not_available I heard it was supposed to be sunny and warmer today.
not_available I heard partly cloudy and chance of rain.
not_available Winter.
not_available Do you know that most snowflakes are less than half an inch? I didn't know
not_available Know why they're white? The complex structure of snow crystals results in countless tiny surfaces from which visible light is efficiently reflected.
not_available The little sunlight that's absorbed, is absorbed uniformly over visible wavelengths, thus giving snow its white appearance.
not_available What's wrong with you? Alex had a school report.
not_available Luka and I got kind of into it.
not_available Yeah, I guess so.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you know how much longer I'll have to wait? 
not_available That's nasty.
not_available Another skater ripped into me.
not_available This morning? 
not_available Skating club.
not_available We only get the ice from 5:30 to 7:00.
not_available We'll get you checked in in a couple minutes, okay? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Winter.
not_available So it's already an every night kind of thing? Since he started his surgical rotation.
not_available Dubenko's working him hard 
not_available and my place is closer to the hospital.
not_available So sleeping over is a convenience.
not_available No, we do like each other.
not_available And do you know his real name isn't Jake? It's George.
not_available It's actually kind of a funny story.
not_available It's not "funny" funny.
not_available But
not_available Sorry.
not_available Tibial plateau fracture.
not_available Ortho's taking him to the O.R.
not_available Make sure he's NPO.
not_available Got it.
not_available Cellulitis following cat bite.
not_available Admit to Medicine.
not_available Already did.

not_available Going up to the ICU.
not_available Last glucose? Fivethirty
not_available four.
not_available And they just brought back a 60year

not_available Pick's disease with agitation.
not_available I'm officially out of here.
not_available Thank you, Luka.
not_available Hasta la vista, suckers.
not_available Ray, when you get home, take the back stairs.
not_available The front ones are frozen.
not_available You didn't shovel? You're kidding, right? Oh, and the kitchen window 
not_available I couldn't get it to close all the way.
not_available Meaning? Meaning there's snow in the kitchen.
not_available Bit of a buildup.
not_available Might wanna turn the oven on and keep the door open.
not_available So it'll melt.
not_available It's just a suggestion.
not_available She used to be my roommate.
not_available Let's get back to medicine.
not_available Atypical chest pain 
not_available waiting on a second troponin.
not_available Got it.
not_available How come Weaver's on? How come Weaver's on? 
not_available She does two shifts a month to keep up her skills and stay in touch with the department's needs.
not_available Our lucky day.
not_available Ice skater bleeding in the waiting area.
not_available Frank, let's get her a wheelchair.
not_available Okay.
not_available Someone might wanna grab the trauma at the back door.
not_available Carter, take Neela with you on that chest pain.
not_available Susan, fifty
not_available something woman, dyspnea, Curtain 4.
not_available Abby, Jane, you're with me.
not_available It must be awkward for Dr.
not_available Lewis being chief while having Dr.
not_available Weaver back.
not_available Are you kidding? Weaver comes in, takes charge, runs all the cases.
not_available Lewis loves it.
not_available It's like having a day off.
not_available Not so, however, for the rest of us.
not_available Altercation at someone's allnight turnedout
not_available badly birthday party.
not_available Good morning, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Half inch of snow, traffic grinds to a halt.
not_available Multiple stabs to the back with a screwdriver.
not_available You think he dropped a lung? 
not_available Probably not.
not_available Sats are 100.
not_available Abby and I got this.
not_available There's a woman with Pick's disease.
not_available Why don't you grab that.
not_available And take Jane with you.
not_available It's a good teaching case.
not_available I'm sure Jane has seen her share 
not_available of combative patients with dementia.
not_available Not with you as her teacher, right? Start by reviewing the key elements of the history, physical, genetics 
not_available differences from Alzheimer's.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available We're on it.
not_available If it's any consolation, I'm a blank slate when it comes to Pick's disease.
not_available I know we studied it maybe first year.
not_available No, I think it was second year.
not_available No, it was first year.
not_available What did she say about Alzheimer's? Man, talk about your short
not_available term memory loss.
not_available Lousy son of aYou stupid fat piece
not_available Nice language.
not_available Equal breath sounds.
not_available Pulse ox, 98.
not_available First HemoCue? Thirteenpoint
not_available eight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's roll him.
not_available We're gonna roll you onto your side, sir.
not_available No head injury.
not_available Guess he's sleeping it off.
not_available Regular or Phillips head? What? Stabbed with a screwdriver, right? 
not_available Yes.
not_available At least 20 wounds.
not_available All superficial.
not_available I'd say regular.
not_available SonoSite.
not_available Mr.
not_available Scanlon, what is Hamman's sign? A crunching sound heard with pneumomediastinum.
not_available Listen for it.
not_available X
not_available ray's back.
not_available What's the normal intrapleural pressure? It's negative
not_available Negative 10 to 12 millimeters of mercury.
not_available And what's intraalveolar pressure? 
not_available Fluctuates.
not_available Minus three with inspiration plus three with expiration.
not_available How does this guy end up with a pneumothorax? Penetrating trauma allows air to enter the pleural space, raising the pressure 
not_available collapsing the alveoli.
not_available Well done, Mr.
not_available Scanlon.
not_available Fantastic.
not_available BP, 124/82.
not_available Let's get him a floor bed.
not_available He needs the ICU.
not_available He's stable.
not_available He's Swiss cheese, needs observation.
not_available He'll never get an ICU bed.
not_available He doesn't need one.
not_available No pneumo, crit and vitals are stable, no blood in the pericardium or Morrison's.
not_available Could be an occult solidorgan injury, or delayedYou gonna bludgeon us with the differential? 
not_available Occasionally I can be thorough.
not_available How about a Tele admit? 
not_available Maybe after four hours.
not_available Four hours? Kerry, that lady with dyspnea Sharon Williams, she's asking for you.
not_available Says you were her doc.
not_available Okay.
not_available This Swiss cheese is stable.
not_available Let's get him admitted to a med
not_available surg bed.
not_available And don't listen to any of Dr.
not_available Dubenko's suggestions.
not_available So, Dr.
not_available Lewis 
not_available Don't start.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available No problem.
not_available We humble surgical servants shall leave this in your capable hands.
not_available Jake, do not move Mr.
not_available Screwdriver without a Foley, an NG, three crits and a four
not_available hour chest film.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, and suture all the lacs.
not_available All 20 of them? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Sharon Williams, BP, 124/70.
not_available Pulse ox, 90.
not_available No history of asthma or emphysema.
not_available Thanks, Haleh.
not_available Sharon Williams? You're Dr.
not_available Weaver? Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Of course you're Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available You were in months before? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And when was that? 
not_available Oh, God, let me think.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I can't quite remember.
not_available You know, I'm actually feeling much better now.
not_available I probably didn't need to come in.
not_available Well, as long as you did.
not_available I don't
not_available This whole thing is silly.
not_available I don't know what I was thinking.
not_available I'm much better.
not_available I'm breathing fine.
not_available Why don't you let me examine you and we'll make sure of that.
not_available Okay.
not_available You said you experienced shortness of breath? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Any cough or fever? No.
not_available Have you had any prolonged periods of immobilization, like a plane or a car trip? No.
not_available Lungs sound good.
not_available Oxygen level is fine.
not_available We'll check a few tests and see what's going on.
not_available Haleh, EKG, PA and lateral chest, D
not_available dimer.
not_available Sure.
not_available And I'll be back to check on you later.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver? Yeah? Is there something you need? No, no
not_available Well, yes.
not_available It's not really important.
not_available What's not important? Well, I was wondering.
not_available The doc
not_available Daughter of a friend of mine is thinking about medical school.
not_available Do you like what you do? 
not_available Very much.
not_available Did you always wanna be a doctor? From when I was a little girl.
not_available So you were lucky then, weren't you? Getting the opportunity to do it.
not_available Miss Williams, is everything all right? Oh, I'm fine, Kerry, really.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I don't wanna take up any more of your time.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Sharon Williams.
not_available Let's flip her records from the last time she was in.
not_available Sure.
not_available Can you wiggle your fingers? Can you wiggle your fingers? 
not_available Why don't you just give it a try for me.
not_available Why don't you just give it a try for me.
not_available Charlotte, the dinner party.
not_available The dinner party.
not_available They're gonna be here early.
not_available It's okay, Mom.
not_available What will we do? It's okay.
not_available Mom, it's okay.
not_available This morning, I hear her crashing around in the kitchen.
not_available You got a bathroom around here? Chuny? 
not_available Mrs.
not_available Devon, you can come with me.
not_available You can come with me.
not_available You can come with me.
not_available There is no dinner party.
not_available She was in the kitchen.
not_available Thought she was cutting chicken.
not_available She was cutting her own hand.
not_available We'll take care of that.
not_available When did her symptoms start? Two years ago.
not_available She was only 58.
not_available We've been able to keep her at home.
not_available But now I've got three kids.
not_available What am I supposed to do? Labs back yet on that syncope? 
not_available No.
not_available Still waiting.
not_available Call them again and ask nicely.
not_available Nicely? We're never "nicely." Pratt, Pick's disease? Jane? Similarities with Alzheimer's but earlier age of onset and faster progression of symptoms.
not_available Mainly causes damage to the frontal lobes of the brain resulting in disinhibition.
not_available The patient can be extremely rude, which we've seen.
not_available And then can become extremely loving, which we have not seen.
not_available Often has a tendency to repeat statements spoken to them.
not_available I'd actually say it's more than often
not_available Thank you, Jane.
not_available Good job.
not_available Good job.
not_available Yes, and let me see, was that Dr.
not_available Pratt's extremely efficient teaching? Or was it eMedicine? 
not_available She learned about it, didn't she? She learned the facts, not necessarily how to handle the patients or the family.
not_available She will.
not_available The woman's got lacerations.
not_available We'll suture once the Ativan kicks in.
not_available Dr.
not_available PrattAnd the family? 
not_available Daughter's lining up a nursing facility.
not_available You should help with that.
not_available Isn't that a social worker thing? Just dive in, see what you can do.
not_available Hey, Sam, did that screwdriver
not_available stabbing guy get sent upstairs yet? Dr.
not_available Dubenko wanted a few things taken care of first.
not_available In what possible universe would I say the words, "Let's polka"? In your sleep, two nights ago.
not_available I'm not making this up.
not_available You don't think I was surprised? 
not_available I don't talk in my sleep.
not_available How do you know? 
not_available Even if I did, I wouldn't say "polka." I wouldn't even say "dance." I don't dance.
not_available Maybe once when I was a kid I did the limbo.
not_available Yeah, maybe it was the limbo.
not_available See, and you were making it up.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Mr.
not_available Scanlon.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Kerry.
not_available I'm mixing up some Ancef.
not_available I'm just gathering up supplies I thought you were gathering up a med
not_available surg bed for the guy with the holes in his back.
not_available I'd like very much to do that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, that patient, Sharon Williams there's no record of her being here before.
not_available I asked her about it and she got pretty nervous.
not_available Wants to leave AMA.
not_available Now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Gathering supplies? 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Okay? I know.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available That woman who was here, did you see her leave? Yeah, just now.
not_available Kind of bolted.
not_available Do you want me to try and catch her? Miss Williams, please wait.
not_available Your test results aren't back yet.
not_available I don't need them.
not_available Shouldn't be much longer.
not_available I don't need them.
not_available You could have a blood clot in the lung or fluid around your heart
not_available Stop, please.
not_available I don't have any of those things.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available I've never been to this hospital before.
not_available My name's not Sharon Williams.
not_available It's Helen Kingsley.
not_available I'm your mother.
not_available Did you say Kovac? 
not_available His wanting Saturday off is a problem.
not_available Well, however you want to handle it.
not_available Kerry, they can take Sharon Williams for a chest x
not_available ray now.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available You can cancel her labs too.
not_available Cancel all of it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Kerry, about earlierCould you follow up this migraine in 2? I know the screwdriver guy should be upstairs
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Dubenko wanted serial crits.
not_available UA showed 10 red cells.
not_available We need to work that up? 
not_available Probably just from the Foley.
not_available So he doesn't need a CT? 
not_available Frank, I'm gonna take a break.
not_available What? Break? They say it isn't good for your arteries.
not_available But I guess you'd know about that.
not_available But I like it anyway.
not_available How did you find me? The letter you sent.
not_available Well, that was four years ago.
not_available Why all the pretense? Why didn't you just write back? 
not_available I wanted to see you first.
not_available That poor little ice
not_available skater girl.
not_available Her leg looked awful.
not_available She's young.
not_available She'll heal.
not_available What you do is so important.
not_available I guess I was scared.
not_available I'm here in Chicago for a week, so You're still in Indiana? 
not_available Terre Haute.
not_available That's next door.
not_available You could have come to Chicago a hundred times.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I looked for you.
not_available I hired an investigator.
not_available I finally found the right address.
not_available You knew where I was and still you waited so long? I can't explain it.
not_available I know it wasn't fair.
not_available I'm truly, truly sorry.
not_available Oh, please
not_available Please, don't go yet.
not_available So have you always lived in Indiana? South Carolina, originally.
not_available I'm here in Chicago with my choir.
not_available Your choir? There's a Christ Crusade and we were chosen to sing in the Festival Chorus.
not_available That
not_available That sounds like quite an honor.
not_available When's the concert? Tomorrow afternoon, Community Baptist on Dearborn.
not_available As a matter of fact, they're gonna be looking for me.
not_available I got a rehearsal.
not_available I'd like to talk to you again, Kerry 
not_available if you want to, that is.
not_available Yeah, I would.
not_available So I can call you after I'm done? You have the number of the hospital? 
not_available No.
not_available Just wait one second.
not_available There's a separate number for the ER.
not_available Here you go.
not_available There you are.
not_available So you'll call? 
not_available A couple hours.
not_available Great.
not_available Pressure's only 72 palp.
not_available Left pupil is 6 mm and sluggish.
not_available Hang 80 of mannitol.
not_available Multiple rib fractures with sub
not_available q air.
not_available Glove up for a chest tube.
not_available Our drunk vs.
not_available screwdriver is having some more trouble? 
not_available This isn't the screwdriver guy.
not_available I heard he was still down here so naturally I assumed there was some emergent situation.
not_available No.
not_available This would be motorcycle vs.
not_available tree guy.
not_available Blunt head, chest.
not_available Looks like a fractured spleen.
not_available Mr.
not_available Scanlon, your patient's bleeding in the head and belly.
not_available What's your plan? Quick head CT before going to the O.R.
not_available for an ex
not_available lap.
not_available Good call, if you want him to bleed out in the scanner.
not_available Betadine and Steri
not_available Drape.
not_available What's MonroeKellie hypothesis? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Abby? I don't know.
not_available CPP equals M.A.P.
not_available minus ICP.
not_available Cerebral perfusion pressure equals mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure.
not_available Spleen's a bigger threat to the M.A.P.
not_available Two units is on the infuser.
not_available Guide wire's ready.
not_available Stop what you're doing.
not_available Have you even read about this procedure? I supervised Jake putting in a chest tube last week.
not_available Good.
not_available I'm sure you told him you always insert a finger and feel lung tissue before Before inserting the tube.
not_available Why is that, Mr.
not_available Scanlon? First, break up any adhesions.
not_available Second, if there's a diaphragmatic injury you could be in the abdominal cavity.
not_available Chest tubes don't work well in the stomach.
not_available Line is primed.
not_available Kerry, I think we can take this from here.
not_available Yes, I'm sure you can.
not_available That was fun.
not_available Would you like to tell me why she's so pissed off at the two of you? Man, and I thought I knew how to pimp.
not_available When did your neck pain start? Came from Cleveland yesterday to help my brother move.
not_available I was lifting a chair.
not_available She had a MRI last year.
not_available Three slipped discs in her neck.
not_available Any neural findings? 
not_available Motor and sensory intact.
not_available The pain goes down into her arm, don't forget.
not_available Some morphine? 
not_available Makes me sick to my stomach.
not_available Demerol's the only thing that works when she gets like this.
not_available We could try Toradol.
not_available Allergic.
not_available Demerol.
not_available Okay.
not_available We will be right back.
not_available Neck pain with radiculopathy consistent with herniated disc syndrome.
not_available Allergic to Toradol? 
not_available May as well say she's a Demerol addict.
not_available There's no objective test for pain.
not_available Shouldn't we believe her? 
not_available Give her the Demerol and get her out.
not_available See what I mean? She's on every case.
not_available Looks good.
not_available Did Dr.
not_available Pratt show the two
not_available layer repair? Where is Dr.
not_available Pratt? I think he's looking for supplies.
not_available Looking for supplies.
not_available Didn't she have her daughter with her? That's where he is.
not_available He's
not_available He's with the daughter.
not_available He's helping her locate a skilled nursing facility.
not_available CVP is 10, M.A.P.
not_available is 80, and we're transfusing to an SCV O2 of 70.
not_available Once the crit is 30, consider dopamine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, is there a good reason why you left your student unsupervised? 
not_available Other patients.
not_available I've got a 75year
not_available old man with urosepsis a woman in pulmonary edema and a kid with anaphylaxis from a peanut allergy.
not_available And my student should be supervised by an intern.
not_available Except that I asked you to do it.
not_available You gotta stay on these Residents.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt isn't the problem.
not_available You know that break you took? You may wanna take another one.
not_available Frank, have I gotten any calls? 
not_available Nope.
not_available You've been here the whole time? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I'm going out.
not_available Carter, would you take over this bowel obstruction in 4 retinoschisis in 2, Mr.
not_available Langstaff with pyelo, waiting on an admit to Medicine a 72year
not_available old female with nausea.
not_available And I need an LP on the fever in 6.
not_available You're signing in a spinal tap? So much for every case.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Bye.
not_available Has it already been two hours? I just thought I'd catch some of the rehearsal.
not_available It was beautiful.
not_available It stopped snowing.
not_available I gotta get my coat.
not_available A lot of people brought their families.
not_available I have two children.
not_available Two other children.
not_available Carl's 26.
not_available He does something with the county court system that I don't understand.
not_available And Laurie's a year out of college, free spirit bouncing around.
not_available And I'm divorced.
not_available I always had this image of you living somewhere with this happilyever
not_available after family.
not_available Ending the marriage was more difficult than I imagined.
not_available The Church saved me, gave me back my life.
not_available Except for the part of my life that's taken up with my business.
not_available I own an auto
not_available parts store.
not_available That's unusual.
not_available I know, nobody can quite believe it but it was part of the divorce settlement.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Why do you need it? 
not_available You don't know? Congenital hip dysplasia.
not_available In common parlance, it's a birth defect.
not_available Birth defect? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Something I gave you? 
not_available Well, there's really no way to know.
not_available It's not that clear
not_available cut.
not_available Helen? I was thinking about what you said about how I could have been in Chicago a hundred times, why this time? I think it's because I just recently got the news that your daddy died.
not_available His name was Cody Boone.
not_available He should have been a character in some old western TV show.
not_available We were 15
not_available Well, I was almost 15.
not_available And that was in South Carolina? Myrtle Beach.
not_available My daddy had a miniature
not_available golf course.
not_available Cody worked there after school.
not_available So what happened? Nothing fancy.
not_available I got pregnant.
not_available All the parents pitched a fit.
not_available Rightfully so.
not_available And abortion wasn't legal.
not_available Oh, I never would have done that.
not_available Back then they had these homes for girls in my condition.
not_available There was one up in Indiana where my aunt lived so they sent me up there.
not_available That's where you were born.
not_available Did you ever want to keep me? Oh, of course.
not_available Cody and I had a whole plan.
not_available He was gonna quit school, get work.
not_available There was a room over his parents' garage where we could live.
not_available But in the end, you're 14, 15, you got no money so I came to believe that the best thing for you would be to be with people who could care for you and do things for you.
not_available It was true, right? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What I mean is
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available I had two loving parents.
not_available I was happy.
not_available But even with that, it somehow always felt like rejection.
not_available Does that make sense? They took you so fast.
not_available I never held you.
not_available Never even saw you.
not_available And nobody ever told me anything about the birth defect.
not_available When I was a little girl, I used to wonder if that's why I was given away.
not_available Not quite perfect.
not_available All Jesus' children are perfect.
not_available And my father, Cody, he didn't go with you? 
not_available I never saw him again.
not_available Ever? But when you heard he died? Kind of pushed a button, huh? I guess I'd always thought about him over the years although not as much as I thought about you.
not_available That would be work.
not_available She's concerned.
not_available So am I.
not_available I understand, Mr.
not_available Bulowski.
not_available The pain is still in her neck.
not_available And still in my arm.
not_available I understand that too.
not_available I thought that you were going to help.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available She complained that she was still in pain.
not_available You explained to her that she already had her Demerol? 
not_available So she suckered you for a second shot.
not_available One could look at it that way.
not_available Jerry, I'm back.
not_available I didn't even know you'd been gone.
not_available Don't take this the wrong way, when I said to take a break I didn't mean literally.
not_available I didn't think I'd be gone long.
not_available We're getting slammed.
not_available Morris is out sick.
not_available We're boarding 10 ICU patients.
not_available We've got charts in the rack for four hours, 12 patients on the board 
not_available and we're 50 behind in triage.
not_available You're back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you going out again? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes? I irrigated the obnoxious bald guy.
not_available Got him moved into Trauma 2.
not_available I can take that.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Kerry.
not_available I was looking for some obnoxious guy who needs suturing? He was here, but
not_available Yeah, we put him next door.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
not_available Do you work here? My head is throbbing, throbbing, throbbing.
not_available No one will even give me an answer.
not_available Mr.
not_available Screwdriver, so nice to see you again.
not_available Okay, Kerry.
not_available I take full responsibility for this patient still being in the ER.
not_available You don't think Dr.
not_available Dubenko deserves just a soupÃ§on of that? He ordered an NG, a Foley, three serial crits and a four
not_available hour chest film.
not_available I hear everything, Mr.
not_available Scanlon.
not_available She pretty much does.
not_available So do we have some hope that this gentleman will be sent upstairs in, let's say, our lifetime? 
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available When you're done with him, do the guy next door.
not_available Does she have multiple personalities? 
not_available You're not on, bro.
not_available No, Dr.
not_available Morris has failed to be on and I was unceremoniously told to bring my ass back in here.
not_available Have you seen Neela or Carter? 
not_available No.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, got your first case.
not_available The wellfed, well
not_available drugged Bulowskis in Curtain 2.
not_available Review the chart and kick their asses out of here.
not_available They're both good facilities.
not_available Locked doors so patients can't wander and the nursing staffs are trained in handling dementia patients.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Jane.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Devon's daughter, the Pick disease.
not_available I was just going over some of the facilities with her.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Pratt, is he even remotely involved with this patient anymore? Yeah.
not_available We're swamped, you know? One of the docs is out so he's been busy, but he's involved, sort of.
not_available Wound edges are everted nicely.
not_available Excellent approximation.
not_available Jane does good work.
not_available You waiting on a Unasyn piggyback? 
not_available Yeah, thanks.
not_available Don't worry, I got this.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, I get it, Mrs.
not_available Devon.
not_available Please, do not play with the Kleenex box, all right? All right.
not_available You know what? Winter.
not_available You really are leaving, aren't you? You know that patient who was here this morning? Sharon Williams.
not_available She wasn't really a patient.
not_available Yeah? Do you remember when I was looking for my birth mother? Oh, my God, you found her? 
not_available She found me.
not_available Kerry, I'm so happy for you! Is it weird? It's a lot to take in, I mean there are certain things that she's told me and there are a lot of things I still have to tell her.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I'm gonna go home and change and I'm gonna go have some dinner.
not_available Don't worry about this place.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available I'll try to stop by later.
not_available Susan, thanks.
not_available So you said you had pictures of some relatives? I want to hear about Africa.
not_available Okay.
not_available We lived there when I was little.
not_available The adoption people said the family
not_available Your family.
not_available were involved in the Church.
not_available Were they actually missionaries? 
not_available More like wannabe missionaries.
not_available My mom worked to set up new schools and my dad was a civil engineer.
not_available He taught me how to build a canal, not that I've had much use for that.
not_available Well, did you like living over there? I was different simply for being white.
not_available No one seemed to even notice the crutch.
not_available And then, my parents were older, their health wasn't so great so we moved back to Minneapolis when I was 12.
not_available And they both passed away when I was in college.
not_available So they never got to see you become a doctor? They would have been so proud of you.
not_available I'm proud of you.
not_available My biggest regret is that they never got to meet their grandson.
not_available You have a family? My son.
not_available Henry.
not_available He's named after my dad.
not_available There he is.
not_available Oh, my heavens! What a little doll.
not_available He's 13 months.
not_available That's a handful.
not_available Between him and a full
not_available time job, no wonder you need a nanny.
not_available Is your husband a doctor too? I'm alone now.
not_available There was an accident.
not_available Oh, my God, Kerry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Was it recent? 
not_available Last year.
not_available Oh, Kerry.
not_available My dear Kerry.
not_available We are tested.
not_available But the Lord gives us strength.
not_available I can only imagine how difficult this has been.
not_available But you have to have faith.
not_available Paul wrote in Romans 
8 I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
not_available Are you waiting? 
not_available What? Oh, no.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available This is my Uncle Jackson.
not_available Loved stealing cars.
not_available Just had a real passion for it.
not_available Do you have any pictures of my father? Just one.
not_available When I was away in Indiana, Cody drove all the way up to see me.
not_available Didn't even have a license yet.
not_available For the life of me, I don't know what we thought we had to smile about.
not_available This is my family, Helen.
not_available This woman's name is Sandy Lopez and she's not my nanny.
not_available She was my partner.
not_available Your partner? My lover, my wife, the mother of my child.
not_available She was a firefighter and she died last year.
not_available You're gay? Yes.
not_available I wanted to tell you earlier but I was afraid.
not_available My mom and dad died before I came to accept it so I never got a chance to tell them.
not_available So they never knew you made this choice? It's not a choice.
not_available It's who I am, who I was born as.
not_available Will you pray with me? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I am not gonna do this.
not_available Kerry, please.
not_available Kerry! I didn't mean to offend you.
not_available I was so glad to find you.
not_available And my being gay changes that? 
not_available This is who I am.
not_available It's wrong, Kerry.
not_available I knew this was a mistake.
not_available It's not what God created.
not_available Why are people like you always saying things like that? Why are people like you so dismissive of people of faith? Because you have no faith that God knew what he was doing that God created me too.
not_available God did create you and he loves you.
not_available What is it about us that is so much more threatening than all the really terrible things in the world? 
not_available Don't dismiss me so easily.
not_available I mean, people are starving people are being shot at, men are flying planes into buildings yet the faithful are saying, "Watch out for those lesbians.
not_available They're gonna destroy our God
not_available gifted lives." Well, the world isn't perfect.
not_available It's what we make it.
not_available You just finished telling me how perfect it was.
not_available That neither life, nor death, angels nor rulers can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
not_available I know the words, I was raised in the Church.
not_available Then you know its healing mission.
not_available Except that the welcome sign's not out for everyone, is it? Do you hate all faith? 
not_available No.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available I hate that my own faith now excludes me tries to tell me I'm a sinner because of the people I love.
not_available It's the people you've chosen to love.
not_available I have made a choice, to stop living a lie about who I am.
not_available I was alone in my soul.
not_available Do you know what that feels like? My hotel is nearby.
not_available I think I'll walk.
not_available They won't budge.
not_available I called Cleveland Memorial she goes there twice a week.
not_available She's in their turkey files.
not_available We're not gonna cure her habit today.
not_available Just kick her out.
not_available Weaver's gonna be pissed.
not_available Watch and learn.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Bulowski I understand you're experiencing pain.
not_available It's better, but I think one more shot would really do it.
not_available You've already had two.
not_available Hey.
not_available Well, the problem is that when you use it regularly as I think that you do, it doesn't work as well and you can grow dependent on it.
not_available Are you saying that my wife is some drug addict? 
not_available You don't know what real pain is.
not_available I'm not sure that's fair.
not_available What do you know? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Bulowski.
not_available You think it's fair that my wife has this kind of pain? You said you would bring her another shot.
not_available I'm not talking to you! 
not_available Jerry, call Security.
not_available You like stringing people along? That it? You need to calm
not_available Will you get the hell away from me! Come on! Get him off of me.
not_available Beth! Come on! Where the hell are you? Beth! Beth! Get them off of me, Beth! Beth! Beth get
not_available What the hell am I doing? I got her.
not_available Who's winning? Neela was about to deck somebody with a bedpan.
not_available I've always wanted to see that.
not_available Hard to let go of a dream, isn't it, Jerry? So are we under control? 
not_available Yeah, I'd say so.
not_available Thought you were gone for the day.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Charlotte? Charlotte? It's okay.
not_available She's gonna be back, Mrs.
not_available Devon.
not_available Hey, where's her daughter? 
not_available She had to pick up her kids.
not_available What's she doing? Is the roast
not_available ? Is the roast going to be ready? Don't worry.
not_available The roast is gonna be just fine.
not_available She's folding napkins for her dinner party.
not_available The literature says that you shouldn't play into this delusional thinking but I don't really get the point in this case, do you? You got this? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available What's going on with Picks disease? Found a bed for her tonight.
not_available Her daughter managed a placement but they won't take her until tomorrow.
not_available Hey, I just wanted you to know that I'm willing to have Jane assigned to me anytime.
not_available I bet.
not_available She's good.
not_available Yeah, no kidding.
not_available Hey, so did you hear? They're bringing in a fisherman versus horse.
not_available Versus horse? 
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available You'd think it'd be versus fish but, you know, who am I? 
not_available Go.
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available Hey.
not_available Aren't you in a little early? An hour.
not_available With Sam on days and me on nights just trying to steal a moment when I can.
not_available Good night.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good evening.
not_available Can I help you? Helen? Helen.
not_available They tell you the coffee's free, you just got to pay for the room, that's all.
not_available You think about a day like this for a long time.
not_available You play out every scenario in your head.
not_available Except for this one.
not_available Is it because I gave you up? 
not_available No.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Is it because I didn't come looking for you for so many years? You don't get to paint the whole picture yourself, Helen.
not_available Feel guilty because you gave up a child and then get all warm and fuzzy because it turned out all right, she had a good family, became a doctor.
not_available If you're disappointed, it should be with the limits of your faith not in the way that I've lived my life.
not_available I gave birth to a child who I abandoned for all the right reasons, they told me.
not_available But I thought about you.
not_available And I came to realize that by giving you up I'd broken my own heart.
not_available Faith is the only thing that gave me hope gave me courage.
not_available I can't abandon it too.
not_available Can you accept me for who I am? I can love you, whoever you are.
not_available I don't want love without acceptance.
not_available It was so good to finally meet you.
