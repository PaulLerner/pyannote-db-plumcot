not_available About what? Messing with a married woman.
not_available He stopped moving.
not_available He surrendered.
not_available I'm keeping her.
not_available What do you do after a day like today? I tend to drink, but I'm not the best role model.

not_available Wendy, can you help me with Mrs.

not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, Jerry, what's going on? Some serious gangbanging in the wee hours.
not_available Cops did a sweep right under our carpet.
not_available Trauma 1 or 2? 
not_available Take your pick.

not_available Miss Hathaway? 
not_available Abraham Zimble, the mobile notary.
not_available Oh, thank you so much for coming.

not_available Your beeper's going off.
not_available Morning.
not_available Look, it's not what you think.
not_available But it's what I've seen, isn't it? The hell's that supposed to mean? 
not_available I've overlooked a lot of your behavior.
not_available Now a medical student? All right, Mark, look, wait
not_available There are rules.
not_available You can't go break them all the time and expect me to do nothing.
not_available You don't get it, do you, Doug? You could be out on your butt for this.
not_available And I could be too for not reporting it.
not_available Mark, wait
not_available Okay, that's fine.
not_available I told you, you're gonna have to wait.
not_available Don't make me say it again.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He's busy.
not_available Forever.
not_available My name is Jeanie Boulet.
not_available We haven't met.
not_available I'm a new physician assistant.
not_available I start my ER rotation today.
not_available Who died and gave you their bad luck? You'll need one of these.
not_available They're a lousy fit, but it's all we've got.
not_available Hey, next time you stay, I'll go to X
not_available ray.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.

not_available Just came in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jeanie Boulet, new physician assistant.
not_available Kerry Weaver, Chief Resident.
not_available First day? You'll find it's a vaguely friendly crowd.
not_available My first day was certainly a bundle of open arms.
not_available What do you think? Looks like a comminuted fracture of the distal femur and a midshaft humerus
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Fifty percent apposition, Know your way around an x
not_available ray.
not_available Good.
not_available I was a physical therapist.

not_available Is he gonna live? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Trying a little rehabilitation there, Chuny? 
not_available Mark? I gotta talk to you.
not_available This is not the time or place.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Could you ask him to squeeze my finger?

not_available I said no, Doug.
not_available Get the hell out of here.
not_available Okay, Carter, sixth intercostal space at midaxillary line.
not_available Then puncture the pleura.
not_available We got a cop, hurt, pulling up to the back.
not_available How bad? 
not_available His hand.
not_available Carol, why don't you check it out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Her son is up in the O.R.
not_available She's been hysterical all morning.
not_available Put her in the Surgery waiting room.
not_available And leave Randi alone? She'll kill me.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Valdez Is it calming down a bit? 
not_available Sort of.
not_available Have you seen Mr.
not_available Zimble? Who? 
not_available Bald guy.
not_available A lot of papers.
not_available In the cafeteria.
not_available Have you seen Jerry? 
not_available He's upstairs.
not_available I'm gonna kill him.
not_available Whatever, but help me with this first.
not_available Grabarsky, what happened? 
not_available Dumb son of a bitch bit me.
not_available Your stupid dog bit me first! That's what she's supposed to do, idiot! Where do you want him? 
not_available Nowhere near me.
not_available Piss off, culera.
not_available What did you call me? Huh? What did you call me? What did you call me? What did you call me?! What is the matter with you? 
not_available Here, tough girl, hold the dog.
not_available You! Now, lie down and shut up! Grabarsky, I need to look at your hand.
not_available Hold on to Peggy for me.
not_available I'd love to.
not_available Randi, page Bernstein for me, please.
not_available Gee, I'd love to.
not_available Come on, Peggy.
not_available Al? Al, are you all right? 
not_available Yeah, some moron bit me.
not_available I'll take him.
not_available Look out, look out.
not_available Carter, you wanna take him up? 
not_available I should check in with Benton.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Lounge in 20 minutes.
not_available So, what's it look like out there? 
not_available I think the worst is over.
not_available Never say the worst is over.
not_available Oh, my God! Mr.
not_available Zimble? Went to get a doughnut and the cashier was picking him up off the floor.
not_available I'll get Rico.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zimble? Passed out right into his Cream of Wheat.
not_available Who's Mr.
not_available Zimble? 
not_available My mobile notary.
not_available What? My escrow closes today.
not_available Have to sign by 5.
not_available You bought a house? 
not_available Well, I got a great deal.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zimble? I could never buy a house.
not_available It's too scary.
not_available It's not that bad.
not_available You get over it.
not_available I didn't know you bought a house.
not_available I haven't
not_available Mark, shut up and help save this guy.
not_available Yes, thank you, Carol.
not_available I think I will.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zimble, there you go.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hi.
not_available Can I help with anything? 
not_available We've managed.
not_available Jeanie, how are you? 
not_available Fine, thanks.
not_available Pulse ox falling, 82 on 50 percent.
not_available Hang those two units.
not_available I didn't realize you were starting.
not_available I finished.
not_available BP! 
not_available 91/50.
not_available Pulse 112.
not_available Must be great to be done with classes.
not_available Definitely.
not_available Are you gonna miss rehab? 
not_available What the hell you yapping for?! All right, then assess the patient, all right? Penetrating trauma to zone two of the neck can result in tracheal compression secondary to hematoma formation from subclavian or internal carotid injury which is probably why you're doing a bronchoscopy.
not_available Anything else I can help with? 
not_available Yes, we've used the last blood gasket.
not_available It would be extremely helpful if you would go and make some more.
not_available You mean actually go and make them up? Syringe, label, alcohol wipes, little plastic bags.
not_available Right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sort of.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hi.
not_available What a day.
not_available Benton is in the foulest mood I've ever seen which is saying quite a lot.
not_available Greene yelled at Ross right in the middle of a trauma, in front of everybody.
not_available About what? 
not_available No clue.
not_available Hey, are you off tonight? I've got two tickets to the Blues Traveler.
not_available It'll be great.
not_available No, it won't.
not_available I mean, I don't think I need to talk to you privately.
not_available What? 
not_available Later.
not_available Wait.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? 
not_available Harper, wait a minute.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available No, it's something.
not_available Yeah? So tell me.
not_available What's going on? Just tell me.
not_available Harper, just
not_available I slept with Doug Ross.
not_available Last night.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Carter, let's go.
not_available Hey, yo, señoritas, could I get a little medical attention here, please? Hello? Hello? What is his problem? 
not_available Peggy had a little snack.
not_available You gonna let me go? 
not_available Give him to Benton.
not_available Just went up to Surgery.
not_available This is brutality and neglect.
not_available He's young enough for a pediatrician.
not_available Ross is doing a consult with Bernstein.
not_available Jeanie About time.
not_available I hate to bleed to death all over your pretty floor.
not_available Gonna add another scar to your collection there, Jorge.
not_available I have to clean these bites with peroxide.
not_available It's gonna hurt.
not_available Stop it! 
not_available Come on, you're a big boy.
not_available Oh, my ear! 
not_available Nice work.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Just don't tell my parole officer.
not_available What kind of bicycle do you have? A mountain bike, except now it's trashed.
not_available He's not getting another one.
not_available Just flipped out from under you? 
not_available I hit a curb.
not_available He was unconscious for five minutes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross told me.
not_available Touch my finger.
not_available Now touch your nose.
not_available Again.
not_available Good.
not_available He seems in pretty good shape.
not_available You have nothing to worry about.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Kid's fine.
not_available No need to be admitted.
not_available Five minutes ago he was disoriented.
not_available He's alert and oriented.
not_available CT's negative.
not_available He could go squirrelly again.
not_available He should have frequent neuro checks for 24 hours.
not_available His mother can wake him up.
not_available Family situation is questionable.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Connor left his wife and child.
not_available She's extremely distraught.
not_available I don't know that she would do it.
not_available There's no medical reason for this kid to spend a full day in the ICU.
not_available Send him home.
not_available End of consult.
not_available Where's Randi? 
not_available She's on a break.
not_available I bet it was assault.
not_available She's obviously good at it.
not_available I bet she's good at murder too.
not_available Murder? 
not_available They would never have let her out.
not_available My money's on grand theft auto.
not_available Assault.
not_available Theft.
not_available Kidnapping.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Benton? He's with a patient in 2.
not_available Jerry, with all the commotion you probably missed lunch.
not_available You should just order in a burger and fries or something.
not_available Eat here at the desk.
not_available I got a 12year
not_available old, Joseph O'Connor, in Curtain Area 2.
not_available I want you to admit him to Pedes ICU.
not_available Sure.
not_available The chest x
not_available ray suggests that you may have an aortic aneurysm.
not_available We need to do an arteriogram to rule it out.
not_available I don't feel the pain in my chest anymore.
not_available Well, that's because you're medicated, but that could be deceiving.
not_available How are you feeling, Mr.
not_available Lake? 
not_available Much better.
not_available BP's 150/90.
not_available Heart rate's 96.
not_available That's very good.
not_available We'll keep the drip while we study your aortic arch.
not_available What about the surgery he's talking about? This Dr.
not_available Vu 
not_available Vucelich.
not_available Do you know him? No, Dr.
not_available Lewis isn't on the surgical team.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich is one of the best cardiovascular surgeons in the country.
not_available He's doing very advanced work on aortic aneurysms.
not_available So he's the best one to help me? Well, we're not even sure that you're going to need his help, Mr.
not_available Lake.
not_available Which is why I called Dr.
not_available Vucelich for a second opinion.
not_available Well, you'll be going to X
not_available ray in a few minutes.
not_available It's premature to discuss your condition before we've seen the films.
not_available Okay? Dr.
not_available Benton, could I speak to you for a minute? Why are you stepping in on my patient? 
not_available Could be surgical.
not_available The chance to cut is a chance to cure, right? Look at the arteriogram and let Cardiology decide.
not_available And Vucelich.
not_available He's agreed to consult.
not_available What are you doing? Trying to use my patient to get in on his research study? He's doing clampand
not_available run surgeries on aortic aneurysms.
not_available The big cheese has you jumping through hoops to find one? 
not_available I've never even met him.
not_available Peter, Susan, is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Peter, if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna need a few stitches.
not_available On my way to Radiology.
not_available I'll meet you in the suture room.
not_available Anytime.
not_available It's just my ear.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available If we get a chance I'm usually kind of glad to avoid the morning
not_available after stuff.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You don't need to apologize.
not_available I was there too.
not_available I know.
not_available If Mark hadn't come outWe would've already had this, kind of, awkward kind of, yikeswhatdidwe
not_available do conversation.
not_available So I'll see you around.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Yeah, I'll see you around.
not_available Maybe this job is too stressful.
not_available Being a notary? 
not_available If it's causing this heart attack.
not_available You might have just fainted.
not_available I don't know.
not_available This business can be rough.
not_available Ninety
not_available eight percent of my clients are homebuyers, like you.
not_available So many papers to sign.
not_available They never stop to read them.
not_available I tell them to, but they don't.
not_available It's so hard to watch.
not_available They get nervous, frightened, tense thinking about the mortgage every month and the down payment which just wiped out their entire life savings.
not_available Little beads of sweat break out.
not_available Cheeks get flushed, their fingers clammy.
not_available Any minute they could lose their job or get disabled in a horrifying industrial accident.
not_available Within five years there's that balloon payment.
not_available Husbands and wives are screaming.
not_available Women are crying, grown men throwing up.
not_available Very stressful.
not_available Can I have a glass of water? You had Radiology rush these up to Dr.
not_available Vucelich, right? Yeah.
not_available Type lll dissection, by the DeBakey classification.
not_available Yeah, but
not_available Gosh, that's only four centimeters, right? No signs of pericardial tamponade.
not_available Aortic valve is normal.
not_available When you examined him, did you appreciate the murmur of aortic insufficiency? 
not_available No.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available Looks like he doesn't need surgery after all.
not_available Oh, well, I'm sure Vucelich won't mind coming down anyway, will he? I heard he's a pretty easygoing guy.
not_available It's still a good time to meet him.
not_available Don't forget your charts.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich, please.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Hey.
not_available Wanna talk? Sure it's the right time and place? 
not_available Fine, forget it.
not_available You don't have to worry 
not_available about what you saw this morning.
not_available I worry about what I see every morning.
not_available You fight with Kerry Weaver over half your cases call in curbside consults, fast
not_available track patients.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available The job.
not_available That's not what Bernstein thinks.
not_available He doesn't know squat about ER.
not_available He knows about your cases.
not_available Because you're telling him.
not_available He reads the charts.
not_available He's head of Pediatrics.
not_available I didn't seduce her, Mark.
not_available It doesn't matter how it happened.
not_available Harper's third
not_available year.
not_available There are rules.
not_available Stupid rule.
not_available What difference does it make? You get caught breaking them, you're out.
not_available I get caught not reporting them, I'm out.
not_available Report me.
not_available I don't care.
not_available You don't care about anyone, do you? I didn't do this alone, Mark.
not_available She's 21 years old.
not_available What about Carter? You care about him? He and Harper are going out, or didn't you know? 
not_available It's got nothing to do with Carter.
not_available No, it's all about you.
not_available It's always all about you.
not_available Thanks for dropping by, Peter.
not_available I was gonna have Jeanie do it.
not_available But seeing as you're here, why don't you just talk her through it? Do a local block by depositing one percent xylocaine behind the auricle from the inferior to the superior pole knocking out the greater auricular and lesser occipital nerve.
not_available Irrigate with normal saline, close with interrupted 6
not_available 0 nylon suture dress with antibiotic ointment, wound check two days suture removal four days, update the tetanus.
not_available He's nothing if not thorough.
not_available Gotta drop these off at Radiology.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Breaking and entering.
not_available Give her more credit.
not_available I think she bashed in her boyfriend's car, found a knife and carved him up.
not_available Do we have to be that specific? Wanna guess as to why Randi was in jail? Do you think you should mock what must have been a demoralizing dehumanizing, debilitating experience? Excuse me, can someone direct me to a Dr.
not_available Benton? Yeah, who are you? 
not_available I'm Carl Vucelich.
not_available And I was supposed to consult on a patient of his.
not_available Harmon Lake.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich, I'm Susan Lewis, and Harmon Lake is actually my patient.
not_available Excellent, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Then perhaps you'll let me show you what's on this film.
not_available So You can see here that the aneurysm is clearly four centimeters.
not_available Which is borderline.
not_available It should be treated medically.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich.
not_available You're Benton.
not_available I don't think we had a chance to meet.
not_available Why the hell did you cancel my consult on Harmon Lake? Well, Dr.
not_available Lewis and I looked at the arteriogram.
not_available It showed the aneurysm to be at four centimeters.
not_available Yes? Which is within the limits when you manage medically.
not_available I didn't want to waste your time.
not_available Thirdyear resident? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You better push those limits if you want to remain invested in Surgery.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich, I'm still responsible for Mr.
not_available Lake.
not_available He should be admitted to ICU and started on oral antihypertensives.
not_available I talked to Mr.
not_available Lake and he agreed that surgery was a better option which relieves you of your responsibility.
not_available Benton, you' re coming up.
not_available It's time you learned something.
not_available Should I come? 
not_available John Carter.
not_available Fourthyear Surgical sub
not_available I.
not_available He's my student.
not_available Sure, why not? I like a crowd.
not_available Well, here a croup, there a croup.
not_available Ross! Start her on a Vaponefrin nebulizer.
not_available What the hell do you think you're doing admitting Joseph O'Connor when I asked you not to? 
not_available I feel he needed observation.
not_available I don't care what you feel! He's not at risk for intracranial hemorrhage.
not_available We'll know in 24 hours.
not_available I sent them home.
not_available You don't have the right to do that.
not_available I have every right.
not_available I am the Chief of Pediatrics! He's my patient and I will take responsibility for him, Bernstein.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available And I will no longer take responsibility for you.
not_available You harass my clinic, you harass my residents.
not_available You deliberately defy my orders.
not_available Now, your Pediatric fellowship is up as of December 31 st.
not_available Well, let this serve as notice you will not be renewed.
not_available You're out of here.
not_available How long since we clamped him? 
not_available 59 minutes.
not_available I better hurry up, boys.
not_available Under an hour and I got a new record.
not_available Now, Dr.
not_available Benton, do you know why we're in a hurry? Prolonged lack of blood supply to the spinal cord can lead to paraplegia.
not_available Is that where the Lazerol comes in? Mr.
not_available Carter, you've read my research study.
not_available On the 21
not_available aminosteroids, yes.
not_available You can tell Dr.
not_available Benton all about it.
not_available I'm sure Dr.
not_available Benton already knows all about it.
not_available We could always hear it again.
Repetition big part of learning.
not_available Release the distal Statinsky and backfill the graft.
not_available Mr.
not_available Carter? Lazerol helps prevent transverse myelopathy from lack of oxygen as well as preventing edema of the neurotissue post
not_available op.
not_available Assuming the drug is effective.
not_available Hopefully that's what my study will do.
not_available We have perfusion.
not_available Time? 
not_available 60 minutes, 28 seconds.
not_available Damn.
not_available How do they come up with these drug names? Some guy walking around New Jersey going, "Prolixin, Zoloft, Lazerol"? Come on, I came up with that last one.
not_available And a darn fine one it is, Carl.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, well, well These two to Cardiology, this one to Ortho.
not_available No problem.
not_available Miss Hathaway.
not_available Mr.
not_available Zimble, how are you? You should not put this off forever.
not_available I might have to leave.
not_available I haven't been putting it off.
not_available We've been pretty busy.
not_available Perhaps you don't really want this house.
not_available Of course I want this house.
not_available Oh, dear, you need some help? 
not_available Too late.
not_available Here, let me get that.
not_available Stay put, Junior, I'll be right back.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Me too.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I bet you're missing rehab just about now.
not_available Been missing it since I got here.
not_available There's extra scrubs in the lounge.
not_available I've still got stuff in my locker upstairs.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Do you wanna talk? I'd love to, but I've got sniffles in 7 and bed
not_available wetting in 6.
not_available You got a second? 
not_available Sorry, I'm on a break.
not_available Can we at least talk about this? Yeah, okay, sure, if you want.
not_available If you need to.
not_available I'm sorry, John.
not_available It was an exceptionally bad day and it just happened.
not_available It's not going to happen again.
not_available You don't owe me an explanation.
not_available We only went out a few times.
not_available Never even kissed.
not_available Once.
not_available You know, you didn't have to tell me.
not_available It's not that big of a deal.
not_available John.
not_available John, wait.
not_available Do you remember that little boy with AIDS yesterday? He was so small and helpless.
not_available But I held him down, listening to him cry squeezing out every last ounce of life he might have had.
not_available It was the worst day of my life.
not_available I didn't know where to go with that.
not_available Where I ended up Where I needed to be was with somebody who'd been through that with me.
not_available I hope you can understand that.
not_available Grand mal seizure in the mall, lasting about two minutes.
not_available Any ID? 
not_available No, and no one with her.
not_available Normal saline IV TKO, two of Narcan and an amp of glucose onboard.
not_available Let's move her on the count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Vitals are stable.
not_available BP 100/70, pulse 110.
not_available Resps 18.
not_available On our arrival she was comatose, GCS 5.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Carpe diem.
not_available See you, Doris.
not_available CBC and Chem
not_available 7.
not_available She has gingival hypertrophy.
not_available Dilantin level? 
not_available Yeah, she's probably epileptic.
not_available Babinski's downgoing.
not_available Pupils equal, round, reactive.
not_available Corneal reflex normal.
not_available DTRs 1
not_available plus, equal bilaterally.
not_available Small occipital contusion.
not_available You want a CT? 
not_available No, let's see how she responds.
not_available Crosstable C
not_available spine.
not_available We should check if the police have any identification.
not_available I'll call Child and Family Services, just in case.
not_available Lydia, why don't you clear out Curtain Area 2? Put her in there.
not_available Busy day.
not_available Peter.
not_available Peter! Know that I didn't try to come to County.
not_available I applied to practically every other hospital in the county.
not_available This is the only ER rotation that was open.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine.
not_available Peter, stop.
not_available You gonna be like this the whole time I'm here? Can we at least pretend to be civil? Professional? Okay, fine.
not_available I've got some post
not_available op notes to check on.
not_available You're cutting him off, just like that? 
not_available It's hardly "just like that.
not_available " We've been dealing with this Ross situation since last summer.
not_available He's a little bit more than a situation.
not_available Not to me.
not_available Ross runs roughshod all over that ER.
not_available He takes over the care of an outpatient.
not_available Never shows up to the Pedes Clinic, where I can at least supervise him.
not_available He's assigned to the ER.
not_available Where no one is supervising him.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Pediatrics is not gonna pay for him so much as one day into the new year.
not_available You guys deal with his behavior.
not_available He's off my service.
not_available He's a good doctor.
not_available But he's a loose cannon.
not_available Not sure I could handle him any better.
not_available He's a good doctor.
not_available I know it's personal, and you're friends.
not_available I'll supervise him.
not_available His fellowship runs through December.
not_available Gives him over a month to find a job.
not_available We need him in the ER.
not_available We need a lot of things in the ER, Mark.
not_available But be realistic.
not_available Have you looked at your budget? I'm due in surgery.
not_available I got M&amp;M; in 10 minutes.
not_available This won't take that long.
not_available What you saw this morning was private.
not_available No one should've seen it.
not_available Believe me, I wish I hadn't.
not_available But you did, and I'm concerned with what that means.
not_available I know this is the '90s and there are rules in medicine now.
not_available They exist to protect a medical student from feeling they have to comply with the suggestions of one of their supervisors.
not_available This wasn't a suggestion.
not_available It was a choice, as much mine as his.
not_available But I don't want my career defined by having gone to bed with someone.
not_available Especially since no one will care about the reason.
not_available You don't care about the reason, do you? No, I don't.
not_available My job demands that I care about the ramifications.
not_available If this were to get out, it would more than likely be misinterpreted affect my recommendations, possibly even my internship.
not_available So I have no intention of discussing this, either now or in the future.
not_available And I hope no one else will either.
not_available Will you scream at Radiology? I need those films.
not_available Robert Potter Bradley.
not_available 10 years old.
not_available Broken finger.
not_available Thank you, Jerry.
not_available There, there.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Honey, just settle back down.
not_available We're right here with you.
not_available What happened? She woke up agitated, disoriented, trying to boot the side rails and 
not_available Doesn't seem to like the IVs.
not_available Can't say I blame her.
not_available Can't say I do either.
not_available Who'd have thought we'd ever agree on something? Her labs just came back.
not_available That's right.
not_available You're okay.
not_available Just settle down.
not_available Just settle down.
not_available We're gonna take care of you.
not_available We're gonna take care of you, honey.
not_available You're all right.
not_available CBC and lytes are normal, but her Dilantin level is only five.
not_available Sub
not_available therapeutic.
not_available Epileptic seizure caused by her not taking her medication.
not_available Let's give her Dilantin, seven mgs per kilo at 50 mgs a minute IV.
not_available Coming up.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available You're okay.
not_available You could've gone into Pediatrics.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I don't want a nurse.
not_available I'm not a nurse.
not_available I want a doctor.
not_available I work with doctors.
not_available Now, move along.
not_available You're a nurse? 
not_available I'm a physician assistant.
not_available Is that better than a nurse? 
not_available It's just different.
not_available I don't want a nurse.
not_available I'll examine you and take your history.
not_available Now, let's march.
not_available Come on.
not_available Is everything okay? Is he a doctor? 
not_available No, he's a nurse.
not_available Thanks, Malik.
not_available I got him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Preston.
not_available Gunshot wound to the right shoulder.
not_available Distal pulses and sensation in the right arm.
not_available BP 100/60, pulse 120.
not_available Resps 24.
not_available And the wheelchair? 
not_available Frank Davelle, nasty scalp lac.
not_available I thought this was a double MVA.
not_available Let Mr.
not_available Davelle wait in the suture room.
not_available Harper! Get in here! All right, on three.
not_available Here we go, people.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available How you doing there, Mr.
not_available Preston? Hell, he shot me! I can't believe he shot me! Shouldn't we order a CBC, type and cross four units packed cells? Crosstable Cspine, chest, shoulder x
not_available rays? Yes again.
not_available Does it hurt anywhere else? 
not_available My neck.
not_available I'm gonna sue his ass.
not_available That's very American of you.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Your armpit.
not_available Fresh dressing.
not_available Can you feel this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, squeeze my hand.

not_available Whatever.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Harper, I need your help.
not_available Why don't you help me logroll him? Doug? Hey, Carol, what's going on? Nice try, but the film's upside
not_available down.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Generally this has not been a good day.
not_available Specifically, this has not been a good day.
not_available Although it felt so good yelling at Bernstein.
not_available For about five minutes there I felt completely liberated.
not_available And now? 
not_available And now, I've been here a few years.
not_available It's the longest commitment I've ever made to anything or anybody.
not_available So It's time to move on.
not_available Carol, Shep's on the phone.
not_available Speaking of moving on You call me if you wanna talk, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available The pool was your idea.
not_available You should ask.
not_available She'd kill me.
not_available I think Wendy should ask her.
not_available Yeah, she'd never kill Wendy.
not_available What? 
not_available What is wrong with all of you? Can't put your mouth where your money is? Hey, Randi, what did you do time for? Malicious mischief, assault, battery carrying a concealed weapon and aggravated mayhem.
not_available What? No, Shep, I'm telling you.
not_available No.
not_available Carol, quick, some guy just crashed in 3.
not_available Defib.
not_available Set up for intubation.

not_available My mobile notary.
not_available A what? 
not_available Notary.
not_available She's buying a house.
not_available He told me I shouldn't wait forever.
not_available I'm a big procrastinator myself.
not_available Maybe he knew he was gonna die.
not_available He's not going to die.
not_available Give him another amp of epi.
not_available God, we were so close.

not_available 78.
not_available How's the compliance? 
not_available He's in the bag.
not_available I can't believe I just did that.
not_available Neither could I.
not_available Oh, it's a good thing I did.
not_available Carter.
not_available Carter, I gotta talk to you.
not_available Carter.
not_available I didn't know about you and Harper.
not_available All right? I'm sorry.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, nobody meant to
not_available Nobody meant to hurt you, Carter.
not_available Nobody
not_available It happened because she was hurt.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available It was a mistake.
not_available You understand that? And if you were smart, you little piece of
not_available If you were smart, you'd give her another chance and you'd listen to her.
not_available I have.
not_available And now I'm having to listen to you? I'm really happy that you both have made your peace with this.
not_available But I'm gonna need a little more time, if that's okay with everybody.
not_available How is she doing? 
not_available Pretty well.
not_available She's coming around.
not_available Are you deaf? Chuny, let's get these restraints off and call for a sign language interpreter.

not_available Okay, now look.
not_available Isn't it incredible? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available I mean, I know it needs work.
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available I thought I'd paint it maybe gray with a green trim, or yellow.
not_available And I know there's no stairs, because they're in the back yard but I can just nail those back on.
not_available And also I can nail back on the shutters.
not_available You should see the inside.
not_available Sorry.
not_available The bedroom is the biggest bedroom I have ever had in my life.
not_available Which isn't saying a lot, but still.
