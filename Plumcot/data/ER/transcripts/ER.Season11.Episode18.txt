not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available I was thinking that maybe we shouldn't be quite so together here.
not_available I thought everybody knows.
not_available I didn't tell anybody.
not_available Dad's taking me to Florida.
not_available You can take whatever you want.
not_available I don't care.
not_available But he's not going anywhere with you.
not_available We'll catch the whales in the fall, kiddo.
not_available I'm going the other direction.
not_available What? All right.
not_available I know what you want me to say and
not_available And I can't say it, okay? But things with Wendall didn't work out.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's weird.
not_available She's actually not really even speaking to me.
not_available E.
not_available R.

not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? What? 
not_available You have to get up.
not_available Get up, get up.
not_available What? What? What? 
not_available It's 7:32.
not_available Yeah? Rounds are at 8.
not_available I hit the snooze.
not_available No, you shut the alarm off.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I thought you were gonna go home and change.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it's gonna look weird.
not_available No, it won't.
not_available You're back in the ER.
not_available People will thinkWhat are they gonna think? That I don't do my laundry? That I sleep in the park? What? Abby needs to take a few pass
not_available ons.
not_available She's late.
not_available Brushing up on your Spanish, huh? It helps me relate to the community.
not_available Oh, yeah? What's her name? 
not_available Okay, one left.
not_available Asthma going to the ICU.
not_available Get an art line.
not_available Got it.
not_available Meaning? 
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Teach the residents how to do it? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available That's the board.
not_available Alex has soccer after school.
not_available I thought you could drop him off.
not_available Isn't the carpool picking him up? Yeah, but he needs to work on his corner kick.
not_available He's still pretty mad at me.
not_available Well, think of it as an icebreaker.
not_available Maybe we should give it a little more time.
not_available I'll see you tonight.
not_available All right.
not_available Have a good nap.
not_available Morris! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available I came in to work on our manuscript revisions.
not_available We'll see if I have the time.
not_available They're due by 5 p.
not_available m.
not_available Today? 
not_available We don't wanna miss the deadline.
not_available You two are publishing? "Oligoanalgesia in Long
not_available Bone 
Fractures A Retrospective Review." Accepted in the annals next month if we can make a few changes.
not_available Some substantial changes.
not_available Go to the doctors' lounge.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available Consider it done.
not_available You're working with Morris? Yeah.
not_available You know, he's thorough, good with statistics.
not_available And the only resident desperate enough to write it up? 
not_available You got it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis would you let me run a trauma today? 
not_available Do you think you're ready for that? In a couple of months I'll be an R2 supervising the interns.
not_available It might be good to get practice.
not_available Need a bed.
not_available Hypothermia.
not_available All yours.
not_available Elena Tabajas, 39.
not_available Passed out at the immigration building.
not_available Tachy at 120.
not_available She's cold.
not_available Some kind of a protest.
not_available You need to call Benjamin Coe.
not_available He's my lawyer.
not_available What? 
not_available Don't do anything until he's here.
not_available CBC, chem panel, EKG, a liter of saline, O2 at 2 liters, and get a rectal temp.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available We're giving you warm IV fluid.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available It will help.
not_available No.
not_available What? 
not_available I'm on a hunger strike.
not_available They want to deport my son.
not_available Elena, you're cold and dehydrated.
not_available Maybe now the INS will give us a new hearing.
not_available Do you know the risks of refusing our care? Do you know that you could go into a coma and die? I don't want to lose my son.
not_available Okay.
not_available Cancel all the orders.
not_available No fluid bolus? No labs, no EKG? You heard her.
not_available Nothing.
not_available No one is going to remember what I was wearing.
not_available No, people notice.
not_available Watch out.
not_available Watch out.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available Yup.
not_available Morning, Jake.
not_available Hey, Liza.
not_available How's the ER? 
not_available Good.
not_available This is Abby, my girlfriend.
not_available Liza's the night clerk on Surgery.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available We're kind of late, so 
not_available Me too.
not_available Hey, stop by sometime.
not_available Did you say "girlfriend"? What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Takes me right back to junior high.
not_available What do you want me to call you? 
not_available How about introducing me as "Abby"? You don't want people to know we're going out.
not_available We're late.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, look, this is important.
not_available Well, let's just talk about it later.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I guess it can wait.
not_available You look ridiculous.
not_available What was I supposed to do? They only had small and extra large.
not_available What's up, homey? 
not_available Sorry about being late.
not_available Nice scrubs.
not_available You should coordinate outfits every day.
not_available Yeah, it's cute.
not_available Maybe we can find you some matching stethoscopes or Victim of assault for Abby and low blood sugar for your boy toy.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available It's rough when everyone knows you're an item.
not_available That could work.
not_available What? "This is Abby.
not_available She's my item." Ninety
not_available six point one.
not_available Do you want a warm blanket? 
not_available Please.
not_available I am thirsty.
not_available Some orange juice? Only water.
not_available Elena? 
not_available I'm Benjamin Coe from Legal Aid.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available How's she doing? Malnourished and dehydrated, heading for a coma.
not_available Maybe we'll see some movement now.
not_available This should get the INS to grant us a new hearing.
not_available Her son's an illegal alien? 
not_available Undocumented immigrant.
not_available They can just send the kids back? Well, Elena has her green card.
not_available She came here in '89.
not_available Her brother brought Santiago up through Mexico seven years ago.
not_available How did the INS get involved? 
not_available Santiago got into trouble.
not_available Attempted robbery.
not_available They locked him up for two years in juvie.
not_available Once he did time, they transferred him to Immigration.
not_available He won't last in El Salvador.
not_available The police there round up gang members.
not_available Sometimes they get beaten to death, sometimes they just disappear.
not_available If he goes home, they'll kill him.
not_available I brought her durable power.
not_available What's that? Says she's competent to start a hunger strike and refuse nutrition even if she's unconscious.
not_available We can't give her an IV? That would be felony assault.
not_available If you try to treat her, I'll call the police.
not_available We need a kitchen.
not_available The staff break room can accommodate a refrigerator
not_available No, I mean a commercial kitchen.
not_available The HIV daycare program should be able to provide a hot lunch.
not_available I'll mention that to the architect.
not_available So, John, if you're okay we're ready to go to the contractors for a bid.
not_available I'm thinking 150 million is in the ballpark? That's a nice ballpark.
not_available A leadership gift from the Carter Foundation would help get it rolling and we've drawn up a list of potential corporate donors.
not_available We were hoping that you could make some calls on the hospital's behalf.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Your personal involvement would be very useful in contacting the
not_available We weren't happy with the idea of corporate sponsorship.
not_available So we would be interested in covering the construction costs.
not_available The entire thing? Plus an endowment to supply the center's annual budget to treat uninsured patients.
not_available This is an incredibly generous offer.
not_available We would appreciate a naming opportunity.
not_available Of course.
not_available Do you have some suggestions? I do, actually.
not_available But I would like to discuss it further with a few family members first.
not_available To the side.
not_available Up and down.
not_available How many times were you punched? 
not_available Just once.
not_available Then he grabbed her purse.
not_available Where did this happen? Twenty
not_available third.
not_available Wabash.
not_available Well, it
not_available It was near the corner.
not_available Did you file a police report? What's the point? They might catch the guy.
not_available We didn't get a good look at him.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm going to take you to X
not_available ray.
not_available Wanna look this way? Can
not_available ? Can I stay with her? No, I'm sorry.
not_available Chuny, maybe Rebecca would like some coffee? Can I have tea? 
not_available Sure.
not_available You wanna come with me? Stay out of trouble, sweetie.
not_available Okay, Roberta.
not_available I just have a couple more questions for you.
not_available Birdy.
not_available Everybody calls me Birdy.
not_available Who do you live with? Just my sister and me.
not_available Been that way for 50 years.
not_available Is there anything you wanna tell me? 
not_available Like what? Like sometimes people are injured by their friends or their family members.
not_available It
not_available It was a kid, just some punk.
not_available Are you sure? And you feel safe at home? Of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm gonna order x
not_available rays.
not_available I left a voicemail for the caseworker at the INS.
not_available Can you talk to her? And say what? Hey, Frank? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Just tell them how sick she is.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, I converted the tables to a TIFF file.
not_available You removed the Pvalues? 
not_available Oh, crap.
not_available They want differences expressed as relative risk.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Well, page Social Work again.
not_available I need a facial series in 4B.
not_available For Birdy? You know her? 
not_available She and her sister panhandle on Wabash.
not_available I give them a buck once in a while.
not_available It's a travesty what we let happen to the elderly.
not_available Hey, Wendall, I have a consult for you.
not_available Hungerstrike lady? 
not_available That's mine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Elena Tabajas? 
not_available I read about her.
not_available You did? She was in the newspaper a few weeks ago.
not_available Trying to get asylum for her son? A few weeks.
not_available I had pancakes for breakfast.
not_available I'm starving already.
not_available I don't know what to say.
not_available Well, I've been looking for some time for the right thing to donate to.
not_available It seemed only fitting.
not_available Have you thought about any future role in the outpatient center? Yeah.
not_available I'd like to sit on the board.
not_available And I suppose I might see a few patients.
not_available You agree it's better to recruit someone with more experience as director? Definitely.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I don't want to run the place, Kerry.
not_available Too much paperwork.
not_available Good.
not_available I've identified four outstanding candidates.
not_available Well, I'd be happy to look over their CVs but I've actually been talking to Todd Becker.
not_available Todd Becker from Stanford? 
not_available Well, he's at Columbia now.
not_available He's set up a network of clinics in Harlem and the South Bronx.
not_available He'd be perfect.
not_available Why are you doing this? 
not_available Oh, he'd be a great director.
not_available No, I mean the whole thing.
not_available The center, the 150 million.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available City needs it.
not_available There's no prevention, there's no primary care.
not_available The whole system's broken.
not_available Well, that's not new.
not_available Why now? For 11 years I've been here patching up people who fall through the cracks and it hasn't been enough.
not_available I wanna do more.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Tier
not_available two trauma.
not_available MVC? 
not_available Fell down a flight of stairs.
not_available Chest and hip pain.
not_available Good vitals.
not_available You guys get started.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available So you'll send me that file? What's that? 
not_available The guy from Columbia.
not_available Todd Becker.
not_available You're gonna love him.
not_available I promise.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you? I'm okay.
not_available I'm gonna finish an eval before Psych gets here.
not_available Trauma panel, C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Type and cross for two.
not_available Did you fall down a flight of stairs? 
not_available From the very top.
not_available Was there carpeting? 
not_available Cement.
not_available I slipped while I was mopping.
not_available Pulse ox, 92.
not_available Decreased breath sounds here.
not_available What's this gonna cost? 
not_available That's what insurance is for.
not_available I don't have any.
not_available Workers' comp will cover it.
not_available I'm a temp.
not_available Once a month, they pay me $50 to clean the warehouse.
not_available You're in County.
not_available We'll take care of you.
not_available Put your right leg down, please.
not_available I
not_available I can't.
not_available Looks like posterior hip.
not_available I should go home and rest.
not_available ItIt
not_available It just feels like a bruise.
not_available You have a collapsed lung, your hip is out of joint 
not_available and you could be bleeding internally.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Jake, chest tube on the left.
not_available Got it.
not_available Ray, you take the hip.
not_available Etomidate.
not_available Please! JustJust
not_available Just take all this stuff off of me.
not_available Ma'am? Ma'am.
not_available Head trauma.
not_available She's not thinking clearly.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available Keep going with that.
not_available You'll thank us later for this, ma'am.
not_available I spoke to Psychiatry.
not_available They support her competency to refuse nutrition.
not_available Even if she's unconscious? 
not_available Even then.
not_available So we're all in agreement.
not_available No treatment, right? Dr.
not_available Lewis, she's seizing.
not_available Probably hyponatremia.
not_available You need to let this happen.
not_available Her only intake has been water.
not_available Her serum sodium is too low.
not_available Got a vein.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Keeping her alive.
not_available She doesn't want to be treated.
not_available Sam.
not_available A patient takes an overdose we tie them down and pump their stomach.
not_available But we let this woman die? Yeah, what's the difference? 
not_available She isn't suicidal.
not_available She wasn't depressed.
not_available She's motivated by desire to achieve an end, not by a desire to kill herself.
not_available Same outcome.
not_available We have to respect her autonomy.
not_available We have a duty to act in her best interest.
not_available Heart rate's up, poor air exchange, getting dusky.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, what do you wanna do? How about oxygen? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Five liters.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available It's a comfort measure, it won't save her.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available You may not like what she's doing but she has the right to do it.
not_available How long can this go on? After 30 minutes, there's a very high risk of brain damage.
not_available She's bleeding.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Can somebody find out if the INS has called? She bit her tongue.
not_available Yankauer.
not_available What is that? Stop.
not_available Ativan, two milligrams.
not_available Neela! We have a document stating she did not want to be treated for the consequences of her fast.
not_available Neela, get out of the room.
not_available It could have saved her life.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're off the case.
not_available Your sedative's gonna wear off in about two minutes.
not_available 32 French.
not_available It won't budge.
not_available Keep going.
not_available I can't get this.
not_available Try the Whistler technique.
not_available I don't know that one.
not_available All right.
not_available Your arm goes under the bad knee, over the good one.
not_available Stabilize the ankle with your right hand.
not_available Pass the chest tube? 
not_available Check the tract, wait.
not_available Chuny, would you come over here and help me? Matter of fact, I'll stabilize the pelvis.
not_available Ray, you get in the position I was just in.
not_available Okay.
not_available I can feel lung tissue.
not_available She's starting to wake up.
not_available Okay, listen.
not_available Arms level.
not_available Stand up straight.
not_available The femoral head will slip over the acetabular rim.
not_available Was that it? 
not_available I heard a pop.
not_available You got it.
not_available Good job, Pratt, Ray.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's fix the lung up.
not_available There's some resistance.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just give it a little more muscle.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Nice.
not_available What are you doing? Pull your pants up.
not_available Sterile gloves.
not_available Oh, that's a bummer.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, do you think you could? 
not_available Hell, no.
not_available Ray? 
not_available No.
not_available I need to do a post
not_available reduction exam.
not_available Chuny? 
not_available That would be sexual harassment.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you very much, everybody.
not_available 0
not_available silk, please.
not_available Yes, Roberta and Rebecca Chaddock.
not_available All inpatient records and ER visits for the past year.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anybody to present? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Elder assault, possible abuse.
not_available Social Services on it? Yes.
not_available And I'm reviewing all the old charts.
not_available Good.
not_available Abby, I'm all yours.
not_available I was just filling in Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I can come back.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available Why don't you two go see the patient and you can bring me up to speed later.
not_available Okay.
not_available My head hurts.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's from the seizure.
not_available Elena, I don't know how much longer your body can take this.
not_available Do you have to do that again? We're trying to respect your wishes but I would hate for you to do this unnecessarily.
not_available It's not unnecessary if it helps save Santiago.
not_available What if they don't give you a hearing? Want your son to live with your death on his conscience? I wasn't there when he was little.
not_available My husband was killed in the war, so I came here.
not_available I sent Santiago money for seven years.
not_available When he was 12, I got tired of waiting for the papers to come through.
not_available He was old enough.
not_available So my brother Alfonso snuck him in.
not_available You've done everything you could.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Let us treat you.
not_available I'm so tired.
not_available We'll let you rest.
not_available I can't believe she has to go through this.
not_available She's a mother trying to save her son.
not_available I'd throw myself in front of a train for Cosmo.
not_available Where's Chuny? Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available We need a BOA kit.
not_available His wife's having a baby? Okay? 
not_available Should I get a gurney? She's crowning.
not_available We need a bulb syringe and some towels.
not_available Okay, now push it for me, mama.
not_available Okay? Come on.
not_available Push it! Push.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available What? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Get off me! Hey, get off me! What the hell's the matter with this dude? Puje means push.
not_available You said puta.
not_available What does that mean? You called his wife a whore.
not_available Okay, here we go, honey.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available I'm getting coffee.
not_available Chuck's on line two.
not_available Sounds like Cosmo's sick.
not_available With what? No, I'm at the hospital now.
not_available I'll take it in the lounge.
not_available I've got the doctor right here.
not_available Wait.
not_available I've prepared the graphs.
not_available This is not a good time.
not_available Four hours before we have to turn it in.
not_available Did you include the 95
not_available percent confidence intervals? Catch me later.
not_available Hey, Chuck.
not_available No, she'll be right with you.
not_available Any vomiting? He's alert? Good eye contact? Okay.
not_available Well, just call me when his fever comes down.
not_available Okay, listen, I gotta go.
not_available All right.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye, Chuck.
not_available I've got the INS.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available She's dying.
not_available No, but there's something you can do.
not_available You can give her son a new hearing.
not_available She may not make it another day.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sure.
not_available I know she didn't want to be overfed, but I gave her Ativan.
not_available Ativan doesn't have any calories.
not_available Would you shock an endstage cancer patient with a DNR? 
not_available What you did was just as wrong.
not_available She was suffering.
not_available She was unconscious.
not_available I couldn't just watch her die.
not_available Then you should've left the room.
not_available It doesn't seem right.
not_available It's not.
not_available It's just the rules.
not_available Preand post
not_available reduction hip.
not_available No fracture.
not_available And the lungs expanded nicely.
not_available Good.
not_available What happened to you? Had a rough delivery.
not_available Hip lady's labs.
not_available Crit's okay? 
not_available Yeah, but calcium's 12.4.
not_available What caused the bump? 
not_available It's a long differential.
not_available But the top two causes are? 
not_available Hyperparathyroidism.
not_available And cancer.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You see these rib fractures here? There's lesions underneath that may have weakened the bone.
not_available Metastases.
not_available That isn't where the malignancy started.
not_available No.
not_available You have to go back and find the site of the primary tumor.
not_available Damn.
not_available Well, that sucks.
not_available She's a nice lady.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I hear that's a risk factor for cancer.
not_available The nose is slightly cracked and the knee is bruised.
not_available Nothing serious.
not_available Oh, she's a tough one.
not_available You two have been mugged several times in the past year.
not_available Occupational hazard.
not_available How come you have to panhandle? Because they aren't hiring at Hooters.
not_available Well, I'm serious.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available Don't tell me you haven't been smacked in here.
not_available What about Social Security? We have rent and heating bills, electrics, medications.
not_available We should have Adult Services make a visit.
not_available Again? They went out last summer.
not_available The place was pretty messy.
not_available Well, we would have cleaned it up if we knew they was coming.
not_available You didn't have much food in the cabinets.
not_available We like to eat out.
not_available Is there anything we can do to help? We do just fine.
not_available I could request another home visit.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available I'll be back with your discharge instructions.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Still tachy at 120.
not_available She can have some more water.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, navicular fracture has his thumb spica.
not_available Is that the hungerstrike lady? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's gotta be a better way.
not_available She's got no money no political influence.
not_available This is it.
not_available Ortho clinic in a week.
not_available You got it.
not_available She should at least get to see her son.
not_available If they know she's dying, maybe they'd let him visit.
not_available Maybe he can get her to eat.
not_available Worth a shot.
not_available He'd better get here fast.
not_available Thyroid feels good.
not_available You say I got holes in my bones? It's in two of the ribs.
not_available I should drink more milk.
not_available I need to do a breast exam next.
not_available What for? Well, your bone lesions could have been caused by the spread of a tumor.
not_available You mean cancer? Possibly.
not_available Have you felt this before? A mass? 
not_available Upper outer quadrant, five centimeters.
not_available Five? When did you first notice it? A couple years ago.
not_available Why didn't you see a doctor? I've been fine.
not_available Yeah, you could have caught this before it spread.
not_available Surgery might not be as effective at this advanced stage.
not_available You wanna cut me? I don't think so.
not_available An operation might be part of the treatment plan.
not_available Where are my clothes? 
not_available Okay, take it easy.
not_available You're all hooked up.
not_available I never should've come.
not_available You have to stay.
not_available I don't want you cutting into me.
not_available Okay, relax.
not_available Relax, please.
not_available No! 
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No! You don't cut into cancer! 
not_available Okay.
not_available We're not going to.
not_available I know what happens when you
not_available Settle down.
not_available It spreads.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Graham.
not_available It spreads.
not_available And you die.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Wound check in two days.
not_available We'll see you then.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Hey, hold on.
not_available Why don't you guys have a nice dinner tonight.
not_available You are so sweet.
not_available Was that a 20? No wonder your patient
not_available satisfaction scores are so high.
not_available You waiting on a run? 
not_available Sort of.
not_available See you later.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Keep moving.
not_available Boxers would stick out more.
not_available It could be tighty whities.
not_available Thong.
not_available Maybe Abby can settle this.
not_available Settle what? Boxers or briefs? Actually, he goes commando.
not_available A hunger strike? 
not_available It's been 41 days.
not_available Damn.
not_available All I heard was she was protesting.
not_available She's weak.
not_available Lost a lot of weight.
not_available Can't you make her eat? 
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available Do you want to go in? Elena? Elena? 
not_available Someone's here to see you.
not_available Take a step back.
not_available Is that necessary? 
not_available He's still in custody.
not_available Can you give them a minute? As long as he keeps his distance.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I haven't seen him in six months.
not_available How long can she last? 
not_available It's hard to know.
not_available A few days at most.
not_available You should be helping her.
not_available We're trying.
not_available No, you're not doing anything.
not_available You're doctors.
not_available You're supposed to help.
not_available Please let these people help you.
not_available People think that about cancer? It's an urban myth.
not_available Not to her.
not_available To her, it's a reality.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Superstition.
not_available Yeah, well.
not_available There's no screening, no early detection in her community.
not_available She only sees friends diagnosed late.
not_available Look.
not_available Check this out.
not_available Guy with colon cancer he comes and he presents with bowel obstruction.
not_available Gets surgery, mets are everywhere.
not_available They do the colostomy, they close him back up.
not_available Dead in six months.
not_available Exactly.
not_available All his friends say, "He was fine till he got the surgery." How you doing, Mrs.
not_available Graham? Had the chance to think about what we discussed? I don't want no surgery.
not_available They put a thin needle into the lump and pull out some cells.
not_available What happens then? Well, based on the findings, we can recommend the appropriate treatment.
not_available Like what? Well, you know, that really depends on the tumor.
not_available Could be radiation.
not_available Could be chemotherapy.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I don't want that.
not_available Look, I'm sorry, ma'am, but is this about money? You know, because with cancer, you qualify for state aid.
not_available It's not about money.
not_available Look, if the biopsy shows a certain kind of tumor your options are very good.
not_available You could take medication once a day and survive for years.
not_available You're telling me I got cancer in my bones and all I got to do is take a pill? If it's the right kind of tumor.
not_available I'll take the pill then.
not_available Good.
not_available First we have to do the biopsy to make sure it'll work.
not_available No.
not_available No needles, no surgery.
not_available I've had it for two years and I been doing fine.
not_available We can't help you if you don't let us.
not_available Who's gonna help me get to the doctor all the time? Gonna stay with me when I'm spitting up all night? Who's gonna help me up the stairs when I'm too weak to walk? Who's gonna do that? You? Why do you want to kill yourself? 
not_available To save you.
not_available She needs food.
not_available We know that.
not_available Then feed her.
not_available Give her something.
not_available She wouldn't eat it.
not_available You can force it down her throat.
not_available Please.
not_available I don't need help.
not_available I can take care of myself! 
not_available All right.
not_available Where can we put him? 
not_available Family room.
not_available Bring the van around.
not_available You want to help.
not_available All you do is mess up! 
not_available Don't talk like that.
not_available You should've forgot about me! I was better off in El Salvador! Hey.
not_available Hey! What is your problem? 
not_available She has the problem.
not_available She's doing this for you.
not_available Well, I never asked her to! Come here.
not_available Maybe we will force
not_available feed her because your getting deported sounds like a good idea now.
not_available I'll go back home.
not_available I don't care.
not_available So you wanna die? Look, it's not like she says.
not_available I had a good life there.
not_available She ruined everything.
not_available She wanted you to be together.
not_available Right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She worked two jobs.
not_available I hardly know her.
not_available She wanted a better life for you.
not_available Oh, yeah? You think it worked out? She loves you.
not_available She isn't doing this for me.
not_available She's doing this because she feels guilty.
not_available Let her go, if that's what she wants.
not_available You don't mean that.
not_available Sure, I do.
not_available Just let her die.
not_available Do you have Mueller's chart? Oh, yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'm doing three consults.
not_available That's all right.
not_available I just need to cosign it.
not_available You wanna grab some lunch? I I have to get up to the unit.
not_available Dinner? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Look, I feel bad about everything.
not_available Me too.
not_available Well, I'm sorry.
not_available You know, I'm really good at getting in my patients' heads.
not_available I wish I'd been able to figure out what was going on in yours.
not_available I have to get up to the ICU.
not_available There's a family waiting.
not_available You left some stuff at my place.
not_available I can bring them by sometime.
not_available I can come by tonight and pick it up.
not_available Okay.
not_available Leave them in a bag on the steps.
not_available Sure.
not_available If that's what you want.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Doc, think she'll eat now? 
not_available Probably not.
not_available Too bad.
not_available She'll die, the kid will get deported.
not_available What about the hearing? 
not_available Not sure if it'll change anything.
not_available We'll see what my boss says.
not_available Good to go.
not_available Thanks for your help.
not_available Can't say we didn't try.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, Elena's unresponsive.
not_available I checked the Internet.
not_available Forty
not_available five days.
not_available For what? 
not_available I.R.A.
not_available prisoners in Belfast.
not_available They started dying 45 days after fasting.
not_available How long has she been going? Forty
not_available one.
not_available Oh, Sam.
not_available Paramedic's on the MICN.
not_available Hey.
not_available Okay, I made all the revisions, rewrote the abstract and conclusion.
not_available I can't deal with this now.
not_available We got an hour.
not_available Look it over.
not_available I can e
not_available mail it.
not_available We'll make the deadline.
not_available It's important to me too.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, please.
not_available May I call you Susan? 
not_available No.
not_available I need this publication for my Chief Resident application.
not_available Trust me.
not_available It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than that.
not_available Convert the chest tube to a Heimlich valve.
not_available Call for an ambulance and have a nurse drop in on her.
not_available You're sending her home? We need to put a bit more pressure on her.
not_available I just tried.
not_available Not very hard.
not_available Well, we can't force her.
not_available Yeah, but we can help her.
not_available Maybe in a couple days she'll change her mind and reconsider.
not_available If she goes home, she's not coming back.
not_available Respecting her wishes is first.
not_available Then maybe she'll get into Oncology.
not_available Or she's lost a follow
not_available up.
not_available This lady does not have a doctor.
not_available She doesn't feel comfortable with the medical system.
not_available That's what's making it tough.
not_available I'm feeling a lot better.
not_available Beta
not_available blockers kicked in.
not_available Your heart rate's down.
not_available Cool.
not_available Overactive thyroid can cause glaucoma 
not_available so I need to check your eye pressures.
not_available Go for it.
not_available First, a drop.
not_available Now, this might feel a little weird.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need a Heimlich valve.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You use proparacaine? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Did my eyeball come out? Oh, my God! 
not_available Chuny 10 of morphine right away.
not_available Jake, dribble the local.
not_available Adrian, what's happening to you is called a subluxed globe.
not_available Get me an Attending.
not_available Kovac is here.
not_available Everything's blurry! That's normal.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available Adrian, we need you to stay still.
not_available I can't! Okay, you have to.
not_available Is that Legal Aid lawyer still here? No.
not_available He had to go to class.
not_available Turns out he's a third
not_available year law student.
not_available Cocky little bugger.
not_available Hey.
not_available Five more minutes and I'd have given her the Ativan myself.
not_available Sam, your hunger
not_available strike lady's asking for you.
not_available In there? 
not_available She's coming around.
not_available Elena, what do you need? The bathroom.
not_available The bathroom.
not_available Where did this come from? I don't know.
not_available I didn't have an order for an IV.
not_available With an amp of multivites.
not_available Did you do this? 
not_available No.
not_available What's going on? Well, Elena's awake.
not_available With an IV.
not_available Yeah, I can see that.
not_available What is this? We just
not_available Could you two step outside? I need to talk to Elena alone.
not_available What happened? It's okay.
not_available Elena, it's okay.
not_available What? Who knew Lewis could start an IV all by herself? All right, I'll stop by.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Pratt, we'll run the board as soon as I help Abby.
not_available I need to go up to Oncology for a bit.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, Adrian.
not_available Keep looking down.
not_available You needed an Attending? 
not_available Welcome to your night shift.
not_available Subluxed globe.
not_available Scleral pressure's not doing it.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need a Desmarres retractor.
not_available We don't have one.
not_available Do we have a paper clip? 
not_available A paper clip? Yeah.
not_available You're sticking a paper clip in my eye? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available You won't feel a thing.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
not_available How about some Versed? Don't you have an eye specialist or something? Everything's okay, Adrian.
not_available Stay still.
not_available Nice and relaxed.
not_available Okay, insert between the upper lid and the superior rectus.
not_available Right there.
not_available It's
not_available It's tough.
not_available Jake, retract the lid superior.
not_available Got it.
not_available Good.
not_available A little bit more.
not_available Cover the end depress with your ring finger.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available Let it out.
not_available We're almost done.
not_available Okay.
not_available The eyelid is past the equator.
not_available Okay.
not_available Look up, Adrian.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I can see.
not_available Nice.
not_available I'm cold.
not_available They're getting you some warm blankets.
not_available Did you do this? It's just one bag.
not_available After that, it's up to you.
not_available But it was up to me already.
not_available You know, I talked to some reporters.
not_available You're getting a lot of attention.
not_available Because I'm dying.
not_available Here you go.
not_available The INS is taking your demand for a hearing very seriously.
not_available They don't want the bad press.
not_available You have done all you can.
not_available It's okay to eat now.
not_available Not until they let him stay.
not_available He wasn't always like this.
not_available He was a good boy.
not_available He did a stupid thing, and then, in jail, he joined the gang.
not_available You try so hard, but you never know how they'll turn out.
not_available All he has now is anger and hate.
not_available But you want to keep going? He's still my son even though he doesn't care about me.
not_available I think he does.
not_available He just doesn't know how to show it.
not_available The last thing he said to me on his way out 
was "Please don't let her die." What time is the ambulance coming to take me home? Should be in about an hour.
not_available There's someone I'd like you to meet.
not_available As long as it's no surgeon.
not_available She's not even a doctor.
not_available Debra Graham, I'd like you to meet May Crawford.
not_available Hello.
not_available What are you? The social worker? No.
not_available A psychologist.
not_available I'm a secretary at an ad agency.
not_available And a breast
not_available cancer survivor.
not_available It's been three years now.
not_available We'll let you two talk.
not_available I had some spots on my bones.
not_available That's how they found it.
not_available Really? 
not_available Okay, where did you find her? A cancer support group upstairs.
not_available They have patient navigators to help people get through the system.
not_available Think it'll work? Maybe she'll listen to her more than she'll listen to us.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thought you were gonna leave the stuff on the steps.
not_available Yeah, I got stuck doing an LP on a 300
not_available pound guy.
not_available It's cold, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Springtime in Chicago.
not_available Wanna come in for a second and get warm? I don't think so.
not_available You have my stuff? Yeah.
not_available Hang on a second.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You need to get that? No.
not_available The machine will pick it up.
not_available Sure you don't wanna come in? I could make coffee.
not_available Or some tea.
not_available No, I should get going.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good night, John.
not_available Good night.
not_available We did a good job getting that kid's eyeball back in.
not_available Yes.
not_available We're a pretty good team.
not_available Yeah."This is Abby.
not_available She's my teammate." "This is Abby.
not_available She's my partner." No.
not_available It sounds like we work at a law firm.
not_available How about "my special friend"? What are you afraid that people will think? What? 
not_available This morning, that's what you said.
not_available I just don't want us to go too fast and get ahead of ourselves.
not_available You have two weeks to decide.
not_available Decide what? How fast you want to go, how you'd like to be referred to.
not_available What happens in two weeks? 
not_available Big family thing.
not_available Oh, yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's like a Saturday brunch.
not_available Okay.
not_available And before that, we're gonna have to go to church.
not_available Church? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My niece is getting baptized.
not_available I have to hold her.
not_available Oh, you're the godfather.
not_available Yeah.
not_available If something happens to the parents, I'm responsible.
not_available That sort of thing.
not_available So I'm going to a baptism as the godfather's? Fill in the blank.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Ed Miyamoto.
not_available The revised architect's plans will be in my office Friday.
not_available Stop on by.
not_available Hello.
not_available If your current mortgage rate is more than
not_available Hi, John.
not_available About 6 in the morning here.
not_available Just wanted to say hello.
not_available You could call, but I'm leaving for work in an hour.
not_available Bye.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available It's me.
not_available I wasn't sure I was gonna catch you.
not_available Well, I just got home from work.
not_available It was good.
not_available I looked at the plans today.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I've been thinking about a name for the building.
not_available Well, how would you feel about "The Joshua Carter Center"? Yeah, after the baby.
not_available For the first two days, it's pretty much all IV but we can try a small amount of clear liquids.
not_available That's it? 
not_available Just a few spoonfuls until your stomach gets used to it.
not_available I swore I wouldn't stop until he was safe.
not_available Bless us, O Lord, in these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord.
not_available Keep my son away from harm.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available Amen.
not_available Hello? Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, it's Chuck on line four.
not_available I'll take it in the hallway.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, put him on.
not_available Hi, baby.
not_available It's Mommy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You need to go to bed for Daddy, okay? I'll be home soon.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I can't do that right now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available All right, I'll try.
not_available "One hippo, all alone calls two hippos on the phone.
not_available Three hippos at the door bring along another four.
not_available Five hippos come overdressed.
not_available Six hippos show up with a guest.
not_available Seven hippos arrive in a sack.
not_available Eight hippos sneak in the back.
not_available Nine hippos come to work.
not_available All the hippos go berserk."
