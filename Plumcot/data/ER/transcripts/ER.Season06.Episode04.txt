not_available You know what? Just corn flakes and a small orange juice, please.
not_available That's it? 
not_available No room left for food.
not_available I'm eating like a horse.
not_available Well, twins.
not_available They are squishing my stomach.

not_available I don't have insurance.

not_available Where I work, you don't need it.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hey, the celebrity herself! Beg your pardon? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, right? 
not_available What are you talking about? "Prescription for 
Danger Are You Safe at County General?" Good picture.
not_available Oh, my God! Stop it! Get that thing away from me! Leave me alone! Let go! 
not_available Robin, calm down.
not_available It's not so bad.
not_available I hate you! Yosh? Do you like koala bears, Robin? 
not_available Why? I have a bear that wants to meet you, Mr.
not_available Koala Bear.
not_available I hate bears! 
not_available Robin, stop it.
not_available Can you hold her, Mrs.
not_available Bourke? If you're good, I'll take you to the toy store.
not_available When did she start vomiting? 
not_available This morning, after she drank her juice.
not_available Mommy, make him stop! We had takeout last night.
not_available I hate you! Any diarrhea? 
not_available A little.
not_available Childhood illnesses? 
not_available Just a few colds.
not_available Prescription medicines, you keep those out of reach? Yes, our home is childproof.
not_available Probably food poisoning.
not_available I'll give her Compazine for the nausea.
not_available And observe her for a few hours.
not_available Honey, did you hear that.
not_available We're gonna stay here so they can take care of you.
not_available I hate it here! Wait
not_available Okay.
not_available Looking for me? 
not_available Yo, Dr.
not_available Pete.
not_available I've got one seriously hot appy for you.
not_available Hot appy? 
not_available Ready to be sliced and diced.
not_available Why don't you call for a surgical consult? 
not_available I told you.
not_available Thought you'd want it.
not_available He can't do general surgery.
not_available I don't do general surgery.
not_available Told you.
not_available Thanks, Connie.
not_available You're welcome Doctor Dave.
not_available I don't blame you.
not_available Hernias, appys
not_available Boring, right? You're like me.
not_available You like the guts, the glory, the bright lights, the big city.
not_available We're cut from the same cloth.
not_available You know what means "to be skating on thin ice"? Ok.
not_available This is me backing off.
not_available That's good.
not_available Stay up there as long as you can.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Kerry, hi.
not_available Morning, Gabe.
not_available How much longer? The expulsion of flatus marches to its own drummer, Mr.
not_available Rineberry.
not_available The more I fart the better I'll feel? To put it somewhat indelicately, yes.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Stay with him.
not_available Keep your eye on him, okay? 
not_available I was just gonna grab a cup of coffee.
not_available Great, I'll join you.
not_available So, you're starting your day with a little splenic flexure syndrome? The guy, he didn't want to stand on his head till I reminded him gas rises.
not_available It seems like you're settling in well? 
not_available Everybody's been terrific.
not_available Good.
not_available Great.
not_available Mark Green is still pissing on treesDo you want me to say something to him? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawrence? Yeah, Lily? 
not_available It's Lucy.
not_available Lucy.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Did you want to order Oxacillin for the cellulitis in Four? Cellulatis in four.
not_available Yeah, he should have some.
not_available You just didn't sign for it.
not_available Easily fixed.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available Is it me, or are medical students younger than they used to be? It's definitely the students.
not_available I haven't felt this old since your class graduated from med school.
not_available My class? I remember your mom came by to me and she was thanking me for you know, for inspiring you to go into emergency medicine.
not_available And the whole time she's talking to me all I can think 
is "My God, We're practically the same age." Oh, no.
not_available She had a year or two on you anyway.
not_available How is she.
not_available How is she doing? 
not_available She passed away a couple of years ago.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available That's rough.
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available How is your family doing? All my ex
not_available wives are alive and living well.
not_available And your son was going into medicine too, wasn't he? That was my dream, not his, as he would say.
not_available Of course, he doesn't say much of anything to me anymore.
not_available Families, huh? Go figure.
not_available Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Think I'll have more cream.
not_available Sure I certainly never meant to convey any deficiency at County.
not_available I could hardly anticipate a shootout.
not_available And not everything in the account is negative.
not_available You're right and I particularly enjoyed the description of Dr.
not_available Carter clamping off his first aortic rupture in an 8 years old.
not_available Yeah, which as the account clearly states, was successful.
not_available Do you remember, Lizzie, the point of this article? To toot County's horn.
not_available Actually, it was to toot my horn.
not_available Which is why you'd understand that I'm disturbed that, not only at getting heat on this from upstairs, but at finding my picture in a sidebar next to the obituaries.
not_available I'd gladly give up the front page.
not_available Lizzie, when I appointed you Associate Chief it was for two 
reasons One, to serve; Two to protect my needs, my interests.
not_available But I've sensed some reluctance.
not_available To what? 
not_available Corralling Benton for one.
not_available We settled that.
not_available Oh, have we? So, I haven't made a mistake in appointing you? No, you haven't made a mistake.
not_available Good.
not_available By the way, thereÂ’s been some slop
not_available over from the Anspaugh administration.
not_available It seems Donald's still scheduling his own surgeries.
not_available Speak to him about it, would you? You can't be serious.
not_available It's interfering with my schedule.
not_available I'm completely serious.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Carter.
not_available Is Elaine Nichols' path report back yet? You'll need to speak to her about that.
not_available Right, of course, I will when she comes in to have her sutures out, which generally is about a week after the operation, right? Generally.
not_available And in Elaine's case, that could be some time today.
not_available This morning maybe.
not_available Carter.
not_available This afternoon? 
not_available Carter.
not_available Yes? There's some chance it'll be this afternoon, say around 3:00.
not_available Thank you.
not_available By the way, loved the article.
not_available Tommy Stevens.
not_available Attempted suicide by hanging.
not_available Yeah that makes one nasty rope burn, huh? What? 
not_available Finish up, Dumar.
not_available Vital signs.
not_available Shallow resp.
not_available I didn't want to intubate in the field in case he broke his neck.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available On my 
count One, two, three.
not_available He's getting dusky.
not_available We need to tube him.
not_available Will be a tricky intubation.
not_available Tricky is my middle name.
not_available And potentially dangerous.
not_available Like I said, danger's my middle name.
not_available Pulse ox down to 84.
not_available Let's get in.
not_available Whatever you do, do not extend the neck.
not_available I'm as gentle as a kitten, sir.
not_available BP's still 80.
not_available Run another liter of saline.
not_available I can't see the cords.
not_available We need to crike him.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Bag him.
not_available We need a fiberoptic laryngoscope.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Fiberoptics.
not_available That is cool.
not_available You ever done one? 
not_available I've certainly seen them.
not_available So, that's a no, huh? 
not_available But, you Dr.
not_available Green could change all that.
not_available Ok, I'll give you one shot.
not_available Then it's mine.
not_available It doesn't look too bad.
not_available Not very deep.
not_available Probably it just needs a couple of stitches.
not_available Did the paramedics bring you in? Would you get us some more fourby
not_available fours? We're running low.
not_available So your parents weren't with you when this happened, huh? No.
not_available This may sting a little, Becky.
not_available How did it happen? He wasn't outside.
not_available Who wasn't outside? 
not_available Tommy.
not_available My boyfriend.
not_available Did he cut you? I didn't know they had a basement.
not_available I saw a light bulb hanging.
not_available And there he was, right next to it.
not_available In the basement? 
not_available He tied a rope around a pipe.
not_available So I ran back up to the kitchen and got a knife.
not_available And you used the knife to cut the rope? He just fell down.
not_available I couldn't hold him.
not_available The knife slipped.
not_available And you cut yourself.
not_available Will he be okay? Did the paramedics bring him? They wouldn't let me come with him.
not_available I came in a different ambulance.
not_available If you wait here, I'll go check and see what I can find out.
not_available Tell me when you're at the cords.
not_available About to make contact.
not_available I'm there.
not_available Advance into the trachea and slide down the tube.

not_available This the suicide? Tommy? How is he doing? 
not_available Great.
not_available Neck is swollen up.
not_available Couldn't even see the cords.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene let me do a fiberoptic.
not_available It was like threading a needle.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available He's pinking up.
not_available But with the prolonged oxygen deprivation I'm not sure about his neuro status.
not_available Come one, he was blue for too long.
not_available You might be looking at veggie burger.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Oh, God! Tommy! 
not_available Haleh.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's get you outside.
not_available Tommy! Is he all right? What does he mean? Is he gonna be all right? You a resident? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, you still need to learn that every patient in here is somebody's boyfriend, father, mother, son.
not_available They don't exist simply for you to learn new and interesting procedures.
not_available I didn't see her standing there.
not_available Well, next time open your eyes before you open your mouth.
not_available What's with the new guy? Which new guy would that be, Malucci? Dr.
not_available Lawrence or you? Never said anything about killing himself.
not_available It's not your fault, Becky.
not_available You should be thankful you found him.
not_available He's got a good chance.
not_available I almost didn't go back inside.
not_available I was gonna be late for school.
not_available But I don't know, I just did.
not_available Were his parents there? 
not_available No.
not_available At work.
not_available His dad.
not_available His mom lives in Florida.
not_available You know where does his father work? Some kind of construction.
not_available I don't really know him.
not_available He's not around much.
not_available Are you sick? You don't look good.
not_available She's just a little tired.
not_available Who do you belong to? Here, I'll make you better.
not_available Say "ah." Thank you, but this patient already has a doctor.
not_available Let go of me! Robin! Wait one second.
not_available One second.
not_available Your mommy is right over here.
not_available No! Let me go! I'm so sorry, Dr.
not_available Lawrence.
not_available No, that's quite all right.
not_available I have that effect on women.
not_available May I have my stethoscope back, please? When? triggering the vent on his own.
not_available Tommy, my name's Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available You're in the hospital.
not_available Your girlfriend found you and cut you down.
not_available The paramedics brought you in.
not_available What's his PO
not_available 2? Tommy, we have this tube down your throat to help you breathe.
not_available But we can take it out, okay? You extubating him? 
not_available He's got good tidal volume.
not_available You gave us a scare, Tommy.
not_available I got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So, Tommy, what I want you to do is take a deep breath and blow out when I pull out the tube.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available All the way in.
not_available Good, good.
not_available And blow.
not_available Good job.
not_available It's gonna be a little tender.
not_available Don't try and speak right away.
not_available Where's Becky? 
not_available Becky's here.
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's worried about you of course.
not_available Says your mom's in Florida, so we'll call your dad.

not_available Pager number? Here.
not_available Look, why don't you write it? Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available When you're ready.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawrence, you have a second?

not_available He's suicidal.
not_available Calling a psych consult? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Think I should find out the sex? Well, everyone is different.

not_available How about here? Do they need people here? Maybe the cafeteria? I don't know.

not_available A subdural? 
not_available Wanna look? No.
not_available Mostly diffuse swelling, microhemorrages.
not_available Nothing we can fix.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Lawrence? 
not_available In the lounge.
not_available All right, hyperventilate him.
not_available Call Neurosurgery.
not_available Get an ICP monitor.
not_available Ok I think I'll check the board and see what else is in, right? You track down his family.
not_available He's wearing a wedding ring.
not_available He must have a wife.
not_available Shouldn't a nurse do that? 
not_available Only if you fail.
not_available Elaine? John.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Lighter.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That's a stupid joke.
not_available May I sit down? I tried calling you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday said the tests are clear.
not_available My cancer hasn't spread.
not_available That's great news.
not_available Yeah, so everyone says.
not_available But you don't feel that way? 
not_available I don't know what I feel.
not_available I think that's probably normal.
not_available I think most people probably
not_available John.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'll spare you the platitudes.
not_available You waiting for Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Yeah, I'm early.
not_available Maybe we can get together later.
not_available Go for a walk, get a drink or talk.
not_available Talk? 
not_available About anything except your surgery and my miserable life here.
not_available And what would that leave? 
not_available Sports.
not_available Or music, or art, or the Y2K thing.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available The Y2K thing.
not_available I'm grasping at straws here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I see that.
not_available But I'm not giving up.
not_available Well I guess I'm probably free at 7.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Raybush, the parachute accident was extremely serious and he's in a coma.
not_available I think you need to get here as soon as you can.
not_available You're in Dallas.
not_available Dallas.
not_available Right, of course.
not_available Three
not_available hour flight.
not_available I need to be honest with you.
not_available There is a good chance he won't be able to hold out that long.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available Excuse me? You want to dictate a message and have it read to him? I don't think
not_available Do it.
not_available Of course I can do that.
not_available Yes, I have a pen.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, it's your dad.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available He wants a replacement cypress.
not_available Seems reasonable.
not_available How much? Well, I know it's a Connie, who's that talking to Dr.
not_available Lawrence? It's the father of the kid, Tommy Stevens.
not_available Listen, dad, I gotta go.
not_available You'll see we'll work something out.
not_available No, I'll call you later.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'm working two jobs.
not_available That's a hell of a lousy excuse.
not_available I had to take on extra projects.
not_available We need the money.
not_available What? More than you need your son? Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Can I be of some help? Yeah, you can get this guy out of my face.
not_available He hasn't even let me see my son yet.
not_available Tommy is in a very fragile state right now, Mr.
not_available Stevens.
not_available I'm not sure that it's good for him to see you.
not_available What the hell?! I'm his father! 
not_available You mean like for an hour a day? Dr.
not_available Lawrence, just a minute.
not_available Mr.
not_available Stevens, you do have a right to see your son.
not_available Can you take Mr.
not_available Stevens down to Curtain Area 3? This way, Sir.
not_available What was that about? He expects
not_available He's his father.
not_available Somebody needs to give this guy a talkingto! 
not_available That's not your job.
not_available The hell it isn't, man! 
not_available You don't know the details.
not_available I know enough! And what did you say her name was? Viola Simpson.
not_available She said she was glad you have food experience.
not_available Was she glad to hear I was pregnant? Not glad is an overstatement, but she didn't seem to care.
not_available Your appointment is at 5:30.
not_available That gives me plenty of time.
not_available I can pick up my stuff at Magoo's and still get home and change.
not_available Thanks, Mrs.
not_available Hathaway.
not_available Carol.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Let me know how it goes.
not_available And stay off the cigarettes! Scout's honor.
not_available No.
not_available Not a retraction really, just simply the other side of the story.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, think about it.
not_available You wanted to talk? 
not_available Please.
not_available Yes, thank you.
not_available Is it a bad time? No.
not_available Not if you don't mind my scrubbing.
not_available Not at all.
not_available Was this mirror always here? I believe it's a recent Rocket addition.
not_available Whatever for? One can only imagine.
not_available God, I hate these caps.
not_available I look like a Yorkshire pudding.
not_available Elizabeth? 
not_available Yes I do need to talk to you, Donald.
not_available I'm sorry to even have to mention it.
not_available Don apologize.
not_available Someone has to do the devil's work.
not_available I'm relieved you see it that way.
not_available And it's not easy managing colleagues.
not_available Yeah, I'm beginning to realize that.
not_available When I was doing my rotten job, much of which you've recently taken on, I always tried to get to the core of the issue.
not_available Right.
not_available Ask yourself 
this Do you believe Peter Benton is a good surgeon? Peter Benton? Yes, of course, he's an excellent surgeon.
not_available Ah, even better.
not_available Now, ask yourself 
this Should County have excellent surgeons on its staff? Absolutely.
not_available Then don't you think we should all want Peter to practice surgery whenever he can? Yes.
not_available I do, actually.
not_available I don't agree with Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available One thing to keep in mind in your new 
position If you don't agree with the dirty work, don't do it.
not_available Malooch.
not_available I've got a gnarly split kneecap in Exam Two.
not_available You're teasing.
not_available No.
not_available It's a disgusting mess.
not_available Your kind of case.
not_available I got some reading to catch up on.
not_available Sure you do.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He coded.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton called it.
not_available You called it? That's usually what I do when a patient dies.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available What the hell do I do with this? The 4yearold? 
not_available She was here this morning.
not_available I remember.
not_available I couldn't wake her up.
not_available Found her in V
not_available fib, unresponsive to defibrillation.
not_available Connie, get Cleo.
not_available She's been down at least 30 minutes.
not_available Do something! We will, Mrs.
not_available Bourke, everything we can.
not_available On my 
count One, two, three.
not_available Gently.
not_available What happened? Cardiac arrest.
not_available See anything earlier? 
not_available Thought it was gastroenteritis.
not_available Hold compresions.
not_available Check the rhythm.
not_available She's still in V
not_available fib.
not_available Paddles.
not_available Charge to 30.
not_available Is she gonna be all right? Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available Procainamide, 17 per kilo.
not_available Did she ingest anything? Just the Chinese food.
not_available I already told Dr.
not_available Finch that.
not_available What about drugs, antidepressants, toxics, insecticides? No.
not_available Gas, bleach
not_available Cleo, are you running this? Yes.
not_available Charge to 50.
not_available Think, Mrs.
not_available Bourke.
not_available Iron tablets, detergents
not_available We keep vitamins on the kitchen table.
not_available Vitamins with iron? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's iron poisoning.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Clear.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available She's asystole.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available Highdose epi! 
not_available Connie, move her out.
not_available No, no.
not_available I want to stay.
not_available I want to stay.
not_available Oh, my God! I want to stay! Dr.
not_available Finch, you want atropine? Do you want atropine, Dr.
not_available Finch? No.
not_available We got a case number from the Coroner's office.
not_available Why don't you see if you can track down the family pediatrician? The nurses can do that.
not_available I wanna do it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You know there'll be an M and M.
not_available And there could also be medical
not_available legal issues.
not_available Do you mind if I look over your notes? Chart's on the counter.
not_available What was your discharge impression? Food poisoning.
not_available Or a mild case of gastroenteritis.
not_available You asked about household poisons? The mom said the house was childproofed.
not_available Prescription meds? 
not_available Out of reach.
not_available Did you ask about iron? No.
not_available I'm not sure I would have either.
not_available The chart looks good.
not_available Everything you did was within the standard of care.
not_available Risk Management won't have a problem.
not_available Is that it? Cleo, you saw the child in the second phase of the overdose.
not_available She looked and felt completely normal.
not_available You did what anyone of us would have done.
not_available I should have asked.
not_available Iron is on the differential.
not_available So are 200 other things.
not_available I should've asked.
not_available You did everything you could.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available She's dead.
not_available Malucci, did you call Public Health about that bat bite? That guy in Exam Three needs a rabies series.
not_available He died on me.
not_available The parachute guy.
not_available Massive head injuries.
not_available Didn't stand much of a chance.
not_available I wrote what his wife wanted to tell him on the spot.
not_available But he died before I had time to read it.
not_available You took the message more for her than for him.
not_available I guess.
not_available It just feels weird throwing it away now.
not_available She said some really nice things.
not_available Private things.
not_available I've got a bad nosebleed.
not_available Can someone take it? If we had a bed.
not_available Why is that rhinitis still in Four? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Ask Dr.
not_available Lawrence.
not_available Let me.
not_available I think I know where he is.
not_available I used to work all the time.
not_available Even volunteered for the shift at Christmas.
not_available Didn't mean I didn't love my kids.
not_available Dads are like that.
not_available How you feeling, Tommy? Okay.
not_available His blood gas is back.
not_available Good PO
not_available 2.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Tommy's father had to leave.
not_available Back to work.
not_available There was a problem at the site.
not_available Were you able to talk to Dr.
not_available DeRaad? 
not_available The shrink? It's hard talking to somebody you don't know.
not_available They're here to listen.
not_available I'm not crazy.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available I just
not_available I know you think it's stupid.
not_available But I love her.
not_available I mean, I really love her.
not_available Who? Your girlfriend? And she loved me.
not_available And then suddenly she didn't.
not_available How can somebody love you so much, then just stop? When did she tell you? 
not_available I didn't believe her till today.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available You talk to Anspaugh? 
not_available Yes.
not_available How did he take it? I didn't discuss it with him.
not_available Didn't get around to it? I hope you offered me this position you did it because my surgical skills aside, you trust my judgment.
not_available Naturally.
not_available Now if I'm here to protect your interests I have to tell you it's in your best interest to keep Donald Anspaugh happy.
not_available Not only is he a great asset to the surgical staff and to you but he is also on special consideration.
not_available Now if this interferes with your tennis lessons in any way then I'm sorry
not_available I don't play tennis.
not_available Whatever.
not_available The point is, if you want to push Donald out, you'll have to do it yourself
not_available Who said anything about pushing him out? Well, I assume this is the first step.
not_available Lizzie, when you "assume," you make an "ass" of "u" and "me.
not_available " What? 
not_available Look, I just wanted Fridays off.
not_available I thought you could talk to Donald about the schedule.
not_available But If you're not comfortable doing it, I understand.
not_available Yeah, that's all right.
not_available You're feeding it wrong.
not_available Try folding it longways.
not_available And then flip up the corners and fold it flat.
not_available Or you can just tell me to mind my own business.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available I use quarters myself.
not_available What do you want? Coke.
not_available Caffeine, the ER doc's best friend.
not_available Tommy went up to Medicine.
not_available DeRaad put him on a hold.
not_available You don't have to fill me in.
not_available I jumped to conclusions with his dad.
not_available I wanted to help.
not_available Wanna sit down? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well, the kid's in trouble.
not_available You know, you go to the parents first.
not_available Dad was still an ass for going back to work.
not_available You have a family? 
not_available A daughter.
not_available You divorced? Get to see her a lot? She lives in St.
not_available Louis.
not_available You know, when I was about your age my son was brought into the ER.
not_available He'd fallen out of a tree.
not_available They patched him up, good as new.
not_available Later I realized he had jumped from the tree.
not_available He wanted to come see me.
not_available That was then
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawrence? Mr.
not_available Henderson's going to the O.R.
not_available I just need you to you sign his chart? I can do that.
not_available Thanks for the Coke.
not_available You bet.
not_available Did you check a second crit? 
not_available 38, and the EKG was normal.
not_available I reviewed the films with Radiology.
not_available And you were right.
not_available The cystogram was normal.
not_available Why did you get a cystogram? You ordered it when the urine tested positive for blood.
not_available He had microscopic hematuria.
not_available I ordered an IVP.
not_available No, you said cystogram.
not_available I wouldn't order one for 30 red cells.
not_available You did.
not_available Lucy, I've treating trauma patients for 30 years.
not_available I think I know what I ordered.
not_available Get an IVP before he goes up.
not_available He's already on his way.
not_available Catch him and get him to Radiology.
not_available He's not going to surgery without an IVP.
not_available Sutured the scalp lac.
not_available Bye.
not_available Sign out your patients? Hold on.
not_available You forgot this.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available It's Mark.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm just calling to see how you're doing.
not_available I'm sure it's a mistake.
not_available See you, Mark.
not_available You're taking off? I gotta go home soak my feet, and the rest of my body.
not_available Carol? Meg, how did it go? 
not_available I screwed up.
not_available What happened? I missed the interview.
not_available I thought you said 6:30 but it was 5:30.
not_available I blew it.
not_available It's not true.
not_available I couldn't go through with it.
not_available Why not? No one wants to hire a pregnant woman.
not_available And I can't blame them.
not_available Why should I waste their time? I'm gonna have to quit in a month anyway.
not_available Meg, stop.
not_available We're gonna go together and work something out, okay? Coming in! 
not_available Six years old.
not_available FeverCarter! 
not_available I'm off in 15 minutes.
not_available I got it.
not_available Pulse 140.
not_available BP 60.
not_available What is it? 
not_available No IV.
not_available Cleo, you don't have to
not_available What is it? Altered with fever.
not_available Maybe meningitis.
not_available On my 
count One, two, three, lift.
not_available CBC, blood cultures, chem panel.
not_available Let's get a line in.
not_available Dry as a bone.
not_available No response to painful stimuli.
not_available No veins.
not_available Can't get a draw.
not_available Call Surgery.
not_available I'll try a central line.
not_available His veins are collapsed.
not_available If I can't do it, call Surgery.
not_available Systolic's down to 50.
not_available Pulse 145.
not_available Okay, do it.
not_available Cutdown tray now.
not_available Two liters of saline, one at the ankle, one at the head.
not_available Pulse ox 92.
not_available Here's the blood.
not_available Get a crit.
not_available I want a bolus of 20 per kilo, about 400 cc's.
not_available Run in a gram of ceftriaxone and catch a urine.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I have Robin Bourke's pediatrician on line two.
not_available Cleo, you got this? 
not_available Yeah, I got this.
not_available Send up a UA and culture.
not_available I'll do an LP.
not_available Carter, you have a second? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Did you hear Dr.
not_available Lawrence order that cystogram for Mr.
not_available Henderson? Gross hematuria? 
not_available No, just microscopic.
not_available You don't need one.
not_available That's what I thought but he told me to order it.
not_available You must have heard him wrong.
not_available No, he said cystogram.
not_available Dr Lawrence wouldn't order a cystogram for microscopic hematuria.
not_available It seemed strange to me but I figured he knew what he was doing.
not_available He does know what he's doing.
not_available You ran the wrong test.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available "I love you Larry, the girls love you, you've been the best husband and father the love of our lives, our true north.
not_available You could never leave us you'll be with us and in us.
not_available We'll love you always." What did you tell him? 
not_available That I spoke to the adjuster and agreed to accept a late payment.
not_available Except they canceled his policy.
not_available Right.
not_available So who pays for the cypress tree? 
not_available You're looking at him.
not_available The dutiful son.
not_available Well, duty comes at a price.
not_available You're gonna have to buy me dinner.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whatever you want.
not_available Good, cause I'm hungry.
not_available What have you got? What have you got? Mark! Quit grabbing! 
not_available I'm gonna grab.
not_available I got it framed for your office.
not_available You've just lost dinner, mister.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Lawrence.
not_available It's Gabe.
not_available You off? 
not_available Almost.
not_available We are getting something to eat.
not_available You care to join us? No, thanks, I still have some dictations.
not_available We'll be at Doc Magoo's if you change your mind.
not_available Right, thanks.
not_available Have a good night.
not_available Yeah, You too.
not_available Good night.
not_available Not everybody gets to be on the front page of a newspaper.
