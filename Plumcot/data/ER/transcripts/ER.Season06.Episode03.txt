not_available I moved it forward.
not_available Sure that's the right thing to do? Isn't it kind of fast? Why are you so interested? 
not_available She's a friend of the family.
not_available Really? Then I shouldn't be discussing it with you, should I? Make sure you get a chest film.
not_available Lucy, you finished assisting Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Good.
not_available I have something for you.

not_available I don't remember.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available That's what we have x
not_available rays for.
not_available So I'll get an AP, and a lateral of the forearm, as well as wrist and elbow films.
not_available Sure, we don't want to miss anything.
not_available It's busy.
not_available I know, Patient through
not_available time is longer than at New Western.
not_available But our census is bigger.
not_available OH, busy is good.
not_available Busy keeps you young.
not_available I'll just take a look at that fellow in Three.
not_available Look at that.
not_available How cute is that.

not_available Dog, fire truck and Brigitte Bardot.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Dates me, I know, but your first love is always your strongest.
not_available You must be Dr.
not_available Lawrence? John Carter, Senior Resident.
not_available As usual, I'm learning how to be a doctor from my patient.
not_available Meet Mr.
not_available Ulman.
not_available Minor head trauma, brief LOC.
not_available You tell me what reflex would indicate increased intracranial pressure.
not_available A blown pupil? 
not_available Not a reflex.
not_available Observe.
not_available I scratch the thenar eminence.
not_available I look for ipsilateral contractions of the muscles of the chin muscles.
not_available I see none.
not_available Therefore I diagnose no significant head injury.
not_available It's called Radovici's sign.
not_available You can dress, my friend.
not_available I'll see about getting you discharged.
not_available Thanks a lot, Doc! 
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Radovici's sign? Pretty cool.
not_available Try it on your next head trauma.
not_available I will.
not_available Got that migraine in Four? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I'll tell you how I remember.
not_available Radovici sounds like radish.
not_available I pluck the radish with my thumb Daycare said he cried all day, tugging on his ear.
not_available Temp's 101.
not_available Must be a load off having a daycare center here.
not_available Does his mom work too? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It must be tough on the both of you.
not_available Such a sweet kid.
not_available How's his ear? 
not_available He's got a nasty looking otitis.
not_available Is he allergic to any medication? 
not_available No.
not_available Ok.
not_available Some Tylenol for the pain, and let's put him on amoxicillin for 10 days.
not_available Did you have ear infections as a kid? No, why? Is just they often run in families.
not_available Yeah, well, you know, he probably got it in daycare.
not_available I mean, there is a Lot of sick kids up there.
not_available You wanna leave him here with me until his temperature goes down? Yeah, sure.
not_available I know.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available All right.
not_available There you go.
not_available Has ICU found a bed for Joshua Fox yet? The gunshot wound kid in Trauma One.
not_available Well, call them again.
not_available Have you seen my bicycle guy? Isn't he still in courtain Three? Spandex
not_available butt? Yeah, he was discharged by GL.
not_available Who's GL? 
not_available Gabriel Lawrence.
not_available All right, the good
not_available looking older guy.
not_available I just saw him going to the lounge with Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available A Frenchman, Dr.
not_available René Laënnec rather than press his ear to mademoiselle's magnificent breast rolled
not_available up a newspaper instead and used that to listen to her heart.
not_available Voilà, the first stethoscope! Voilà, the first sensitive male doctor in history! Dr.
not_available Green, you know who invented the stethoscope? I don't.
not_available Did you discharge my patient? I don't believe so.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ulman.
not_available Fell off his bike.
not_available I wasn't aware he's your patient.
not_available He was.
not_available I'd ordered a head CT which he obviously didn't get.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I performed a thorough neurological exam.
not_available He didn't need a CT.
not_available The lost of consciousness put him a risk factor of intracranial hemorrhage.
not_available Minuscule risk.
not_available I gave him a head
not_available injury instructions sheet.
not_available If he has any warning signs, he'll come back.
not_available He lives alone.
not_available If he slips into a coma, no one knows.
not_available This isn't like New Western.
not_available County patients tend to be a little less reliable when it comes to follow
not_available up.
not_available I'm aware of that, Dr.
not_available Green.
not_available That's why I told him to call me in four hours to tell me how he's doing.
not_available Difficult if he's passed out on the floor.
not_available What would you do? Without seeing the patient, I'd rather
not_available No, I'd like to know.
not_available What would you do? Fell off his bike.
not_available Lost consciousness.
not_available You did a complete neuro exam? Yes, he was alert and oriented.
not_available Full balance, recall, normal reflexes.
not_available How long was lost of consciousness? 
not_available Less than two minutes.
not_available You visualized the fundi? 
not_available Discs were sharp.
not_available I think Dr.
not_available Greene was just being very thorough.
not_available Sounds like a "no" to me.
not_available Look at it this way.
not_available We just saved Mr.
not_available Ulman $800.
not_available "A" for Accountability.
not_available Right.
not_available Yeah but she really does meet all the requirements.
not_available I really couldn't agree with you more on thisCan I talk to you? You'll get back to me later, right? 
not_available As soon as I can.
not_available What's up? What's up? Why you didn't tell me you were hiring Lawrence? I only found out that he was available two days ago.
not_available So, in two days you didn't have time for a five
not_available minute conversation? Mark, look, I mean, the man's a legend.
not_available He's one of the founding fathers of emergency medicine.
not_available We're so lucky to have him.
not_available Couldn't you have the courtesy to at least tell me first? It's called respect, Kerry.
not_available Look, it's even on your stupid badge.
not_available Elaine.
not_available Heard you were coming in today.
not_available Did you? 
not_available I asked you to leave me alone.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available I know that you did and I'm sorry.
not_available But I really need to talk to you.
not_available Because it's Because I don't want you to have the wrong idea about me.
not_available I don't.
not_available I want you to know that I'm here for you.
not_available And that for me this wasn't just aboutSex? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It wasn't about that.
not_available It was for me.
not_available If we're talking needs, John, I don't need you to feel sorry or worried.
not_available Or tender or anything.
not_available I just need you to go away.
not_available I don't wanna go away.
not_available Loren Johnson's X
not_available ray.
not_available Mid
not_available shaft fracture of the radius.
not_available No injury to the wrist or elbow.
not_available She was lucky.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available What's this? Some more of Loren Johnson.
not_available I pulled her records.
not_available See these calluses? Healed rib fractures.
not_available And this, some kind of blunt trauma.
not_available Maybe a baseball bat.
not_available She wants to go home as soon as we splint her arm.
not_available You know, this is only her second visit here.
not_available But she has been to Mercy three times, McGaw twice, Ravenswood once.
not_available This time, I don't want her to go home.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Yes? Yes.
not_available Hi, I'm Loren's husband, Pauly.
not_available I just want to thank you for looking after her so well.
not_available Loren wasn't clear on how the accident exactly happened.
not_available Maybe that's because she's a little bit embarrassed about it, isn't that right, Loren? How did it happen? She was up a ladder in our bedroom hanging drapes and lost her footing.
not_available Asked her not to do it by herself, didn't I, honey? Yes, you did.
not_available Shall I splint her? Mark, can I have a word? 
not_available Lizzy, Paula Trancoso, Chicago Gazette.
not_available Elizabeth Corday, My associate Head of Surgery.
not_available And Mark Greene, one or our ER docs.
not_available You' re wearing scrubs.
not_available Yes, it was my idea.

not_available Elizabeth was gonna show Paula around the ER.
not_available You don't mind, Mark? If you feel Dr.
not_available Corday has the time Had I known that the Gazette was gonna send you, my dear, I would have made time in my schedule.
not_available But as it is, I'll have to leave you to the tender mercies of Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Well, this is the ER, obviously.
not_available This is Josh's cousin.
not_available Great.
not_available Josh.
not_available Josh, your cousin's here.
not_available How's he doing? He looks a lot worse than he is.
not_available His lung collapsed so we put a tube in his chest.
not_available You can talk to him if you want.
not_available He's taching at 140.

not_available Let's roll him.
not_available See anything back there? Any blood? 
not_available Nothing on the back.
not_available All right, check the extremities.
not_available Where's the blood from? 
not_available Looks like he cut his hand.
not_available Did he even get shot? 
not_available No, he fainted.
not_available Is this the guy who got shot? You need me? 
not_available Yes, his hand needs suturing.
not_available Suturing? That's it? I want every piece of equipment checked for damage.

not_available Still tachycardic.
not_available We called our doctor from the ambulance.
not_available He said they should take us to Ambrose.
not_available But the paramedics said you were closest.
not_available They are allowed to do that, the paramedics.
not_available Can they go against the patients' wishes? Get a crit, UA, C
not_available spine and chest film.
not_available Until I do these tests, David's not going anywhere.
not_available Elaine? Is everything all right?

not_available I just think maybe this has been too fast for me.

not_available What?! Because of your illness you can reasonablyYou're the one who's ill! What the hell do you think
not_available ? Okay, I get it.
not_available I'm in the nuthouse, huh? "Due to your illness, you can reasonably be expected to inflict serious physical harm on yourself or on others.
not_available Therefore you're subject to involuntary admision and are in need of immediate hospitalization." Wait till my lawyer gets ahold of you.
not_available You have no criteria to hold him.
not_available Her x
not_available rays are my criteria.
not_available If she won't press charges, they mean nothing.
not_available He's gonna get up to Psych, and they'll send him right back down and he'll go home.
not_available I don't care about him.
not_available I care about her.
not_available We can do nothing or we can do something.
not_available This way she has a chance.
not_available I can't really run away.
not_available Can I? You can delay, but not for long.
not_available Elaine, if you are worried about reconstruction, I can make an appointment with a plastic surgeon, and you can justWhat will happen to it? After you cut it off? 
not_available Now you're being morbid.
not_available Why? It's a part of me.
not_available It'll go to Pathology and then it'll be got rid of.
not_available Thrown in the trash.
not_available Just medical waste.
not_available I'll have a blob of gel instead.
not_available What will it feel like when I touch it? When somebody else touches it? Elaine, lots of women have this type of surgery.
not_available I can't imagine feeling anything.
not_available And If I can't, how will anybody else? How can I be with anybody again? 
not_available You can't let this define you.
not_available It's hard not to.
not_available I was happy with who I was.

not_available Cut it all.
not_available You know the only good thing about sickle cell gene? 
not_available There isn't anything good.
not_available No, no, there is.
not_available You know, there is a disease called malaria that kills almost a million children a year.
not_available What do you think protects people against malaria? The sickle
not_available cell gene.
not_available That isn't a bad thing, is it?

not_available Why? Because to justify certification a patient has to be a danger to himself or others.
not_available He is a danger to others.
not_available Come on, just look at his wife.
not_available She said she fell off a ladder.
not_available Until she says different, nothing we can do.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Have you talked to him? 
not_available I've seen him.
not_available Dr Kovac, I know why you did it.
not_available But I'm not even gonna take him upstairs for evaluation.
not_available I'm going to release him.
not_available Can you do me a favor? Can you talk to him at least? What's the point? 
not_available Please.
not_available You and me, let's talk to him.
not_available The crazy foreigner.
not_available They should put these on you, you know? Why? I'm not going to hit your wife.
not_available I never hurt my wife.
not_available Never.
not_available Mr.
not_available Johnson, settle down.
not_available We just want to talk to you.
not_available Well talk to her.
not_available Go ahead, ask her.
not_available Have I ever hurt you? No! Will you let him go, please? You want us to release him? 
not_available Please.
not_available OK.
not_available Let him go.
not_available How long before you hit her again? On the way home? Or maybe wait till you get drunk? Have a bad day at work? What are you doing? 
not_available One thing I don't understand.
not_available The X
not_available rays show your wife had three cracked ribs.
Here How'd it happen? 
not_available Leave it, Kovac.
not_available She fell off a ladder again? Or what? Was it down the stairs, maybeCan you shut this guy up? Did you just kick her? 
not_available That's enough.
not_available To break her ribs you'd have to stamp on her chest.
not_available What a man! Shut up! Go on, then.
not_available Screw you.
not_available I'll kill him! No! I'll kill him! 
not_available Calm down, Mr.
not_available Johnson! Get off of me! I'm gonna kill him! 
not_available See? Danger to others.
not_available Get out of here! See? All right.
not_available Mark, Beta HCG on the sickler.
not_available Where are they? 
not_available They walked out a couple of minutes ago.
not_available Lawrence, we got a problem here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Powell? 
not_available We need you to come back into the hospital.
not_available But we just left.
not_available Your daughter needs another test.
not_available But we've seen the doctor.
not_available Cristal is feeling much better.
not_available What is it? 
not_available She needs to come back.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available The ICON is positive.
not_available She has to come right back in.
not_available Now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch, Sam Jacobs.
not_available I just want to thank you for looking after one of my favorite families so very well.
not_available We haven't quite finished the tests.
not_available I've made arrangements for David to be transfered to Ambrose.
not_available If you'd be so kind as to sign him.
not_available I'm not happy about moving him.
not_available I've looked it.
not_available His C
not_available spine's clear.
not_available An ambulance is waiting.
not_available He complained of back pain at the scene.
not_available I'm still waiting on a second crit.
not_available When you get that, fax it over to me.
not_available It'll be a half an hour, that's all.
not_available In half an hour, Dr.
not_available Finch, he'll be under observation at Ambrose, not taking up precious space here.
not_available We ready to roll, Sam? Are we, Dr.
not_available Finch? 
not_available There's the ovary.
not_available It looks pretty normal.
not_available What are you looking for? 
not_available There.
not_available Mass in the fallopian tube.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Fetal pole and heartbeat.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available There's a heartbeat.
not_available What are you saying? 
not_available There's a heartbeat.
not_available Your daughter's pregnant.
not_available No, she's 12 years old! 
not_available There's got to be a mistake.
not_available There's no mistake.
not_available She's pregnant.
not_available The fetus is in the fallopian tube, not the uterus.
not_available I want a second opinion.
not_available I'm the second opinion.
not_available We're lucky we caught this early enough.
not_available Your daughter needs surgery now.
not_available If it ruptures, it could be very dangerous.
not_available I'm gonna call the O.R.
not_available Were you checking up on me? 
not_available Just watching out for the patients.
not_available Will there be video games? Sure.
not_available Video games, TV, your own room.
not_available Just like a hotel.
not_available What's your favorite game? David? David? David, can you hear me? Stop! What? Why are we stopping? 
not_available He's tacky.
not_available Get a BP.
not_available I can't get a pressure.
not_available No pulse on the left.
not_available Go to trauma.
not_available I don't want him staying here.
not_available He has to.
not_available Need a hand? 
not_available Eight years old.
not_available Name is David, in rapid deceleration.
not_available MVA, crashed while being transferred to Ambrose.
not_available Probable a traumatic rupture at the junction of the subclavian and aortic arch.
not_available Why was he being transfered? 
not_available All right, we' re going to have to crack him.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Where is Kerry? She said she'd be here.
not_available You know this place closes at 5? 
not_available Yeah, we know.
not_available Do we really need two? 
not_available Two witnesses, yes.
not_available Right, suction.
not_available Start a round with the packed cells.
not_available He's in V
not_available tach.
not_available 60 of lidocaine.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available I can't find the source.
not_available He's still in V
not_available tach.
not_available Stand by with the paddles.
not_available I've never done one like this before.
not_available Why don't you talk me through it? 
not_available Keep suctioning.
not_available You have to
not_available Connie, would you get that woman out of here! Ma'am, you have to leave.
not_available Peter, need any help? 
not_available Please, Mark, get that woman out of here.
not_available Get your hands off me.
not_available Out! Gonna clamp distally to the left subclavian.
not_available Open the pleura to identify the area that's leaking.
not_available Release the clamp distally to identify the leak.
not_available I see it.
not_available Now evacuate the hematoma.
not_available Put a curved Potts underneath the leak to leave the aorta patent.
not_available Now clamp above the tear.
not_available There you go, Carter, You just isolated the leak.
not_available Nice work, Carter.
not_available Do you Reginald Moore take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in the state of matrimony to love her, honor and keep her through sickness and prosperity whatever your future might be? I do.
not_available I think he needs a feeding.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just one second.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you hungry? It's okay.
not_available Go on.
not_available And do you Jeanie Boulay take this man as your lawful wedded husband to live together in the state of matrimony to love, honor and keep him through sickness and prosperity whatever your future might be? I do! No, it's not unusual.
not_available This is a teaching hospital and Residents are here to learn.
not_available So they are allowed to practice on patients.
not_available How else do they learn? A little tough on whoever they learn on, isn't it? The residents are carefully supervised.
not_available What I saw wasn't carefully supervised.
not_available Well, I'm sure you've seen enough, didn't you?.
not_available It was really really nice to meet you.
not_available And I do look forward to reading your article.
not_available Mark, thank God I got rid of her.
not_available Yeah, careful she doesn't turn up somewhere else disguised as a surgeon.
not_available Did she get in the way in Trauma? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mark, I didn't ask to be her tour guide.
not_available Well, you didn't say no.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Heard about your Psych hold.
not_available Yeah, I'm very popular with Psychiatry.
not_available They took him upstairs for assessment.
not_available Maybe they'll hold him.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I provoked him, in front of witnesses.
not_available Maybe now she'll see how he's really like, you know.
not_available You don't think she knows? Yeah, I know, it's hopeless.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available She didn't go upstairs with him.
not_available Lucy took her to the cafeteria.
not_available Fingers crossed.
not_available David's stabilized.
not_available He's in surgery.
not_available Barring any complications, he'll be okay.
not_available If you want to go and see him the nurse will take you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available You did well to catch that.
not_available If we'd waited for the tests, we'd would have seen this.
not_available We could've operated in a controlled manner rather than having to rip an 
not_available We had no choice.
not_available I did.
not_available I shouldn't have let myself listen to you.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Okay.
not_available It went well.
not_available There was no evidence the cancer had spread.
not_available But we will have to wait for the pathology reports on the lymph nodes.
not_available I got a plastic surgeon in to close, so we could minimize scarring.
not_available And of course within the next couple of weeks we can begin reconstruction.
not_available When can I go home? Well, we had to put in some drains to collect any accumulating fluid.
not_available Like I'm a sewer system.
not_available Most likely it'll just be for the night.
not_available So you'll be able to go home tomorrow.
not_available Now, I've given the nurse all my numbers.
not_available So if you need anything, you have any questions, just call anytime.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Kovak, now that Dr.
not_available Lawrence is here I don't believe that we're gonna be needing you anymore, ok?.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, are you on tonight? 
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available How much fluid did you give him? 
not_available Two liters wide open.
not_available What do we got? Seventeenyear
not_available old, 3 gunshot wounds to the right chest.
not_available One to the left.
not_available BP 90 over 60, pulse 120.
not_available Intubated in the field.
not_available He needs a bilateral chest tube.
not_available One for you and one for me.
not_available Malucci, you do a central line.
not_available On my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Two chest tubes and a central line.
not_available Only got one chest tray.
not_available Get another.
not_available We'll share.
not_available 10
not_available blade.
not_available BP's 80.
not_available Pulse ox 92.
not_available Curved Kelly.
not_available Twenty cc's for the lab.
not_available O
not_available neg is here.

not_available BP's down to 70.
not_available 100 cc's on the right.

not_available Check the balloon.

not_available Check the balloon.
not_available Come on.
not_available If we can't put pressure on the bleeder from the outside, we do it on the inside.
not_available Pressure's down to 60.
not_available All right, tell me when.
not_available There's 30 cc's.
not_available Chest tube output's down to a trickle.
not_available Pressure's up to 80.
not_available Old army trick to tamponade the subclavian.
not_available Cool.
not_available Very cool.
not_available Let's get him up to the O.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? How is she? 
not_available She's resting comfortably.
not_available You can go in if you like.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available Hey.
not_available Want a lift? 
not_available In that? It's my mom's.
not_available I had to pick up some stuff from work.
not_available What, baby stuff? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here we are.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let's see 
not_available Let's get him this.
not_available He's 9 months old.
not_available You're never too early to start.
not_available Carlos, do you think your daddy's silly? What about this? You like one of these? "Pull over.
not_available Pull over." He is silly.
not_available Elizabeth, I wanted to apologize for being abrupt.
not_available You mean rude.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available You could apologize actually for that crap at the head CT.
not_available What?! No way on earth will I apologize for that.
not_available You put me on the spot.
not_available Yeah, but I expected you to give the right answer.
not_available The right answer? That Lawrence is still bugging you, isn't he? Just because he can diagnose something without having to order every test in the book.
not_available He may have some fancy moves in Trauma but he doesn't know how to function in an inner
not_available city ER.
not_available You're afraid you might learn something? 
not_available He's too slow, he spends hours with every patient, and then he ties up the residents chattering on about the Radovici sign.
not_available The what? You don't know about that? No, what is it? 
not_available I don't think I should tell you.
not_available Mark.
not_available Just one more.
not_available Come on, Reece, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Jackie, you think he looks like me? I hope not.
not_available He's got enough problems.
not_available Hey, when I was a kid, did I have a lot of ear infections? I don't know, Peter.
not_available I was your sister, not your mother.
not_available You were a scrawny little thing.
not_available Always coming down with something.
not_available No wonder you got into medicine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll take him up to bed.
not_available Do the washing up.
not_available All right.
not_available Dry up too.
not_available Don't leave everything just sitting on the side.
not_available I love you.
not_available Do you love me? Get out of here.
not_available Come on, my baby.
not_available You live here? 
not_available I told you it's in the water.
not_available Yeah, but I mean, is it sanitary? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What do you do in winter? 
not_available In winter I go south.
not_available Like the birds.
not_available Thank you for the lift.
not_available Sure.
not_available See you.
not_available Sure.
not_available You scratch the thenar eminence causing ipsilateral contractions of the chin muscles.
not_available Definitely contracting.
not_available Is that a good thing? 
not_available Sadly, no.
not_available It indicates increased intracranial pressure.
not_available Disturbances of the brain.
not_available Which explains why you're working with Romano.
