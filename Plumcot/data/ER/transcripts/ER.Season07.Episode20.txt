not_available Dr.
not_available Malucci was only trying to help you.
not_available You could have seriously injured him.
not_available Well, I hope I taught him some manners.
not_available Have you been in this ER before? 
not_available I've been in a lot ERs.
not_available And to be honest, this one's substandard.
not_available Maybe you'd feel more comfortable in jail.
not_available They used to drown redheaded babies because they thought they were evil.
not_available And they used to burn crazy people who they thought were witches.
not_available I just need something to help me go to the bathroom.
not_available Is that too much to ask?! She's historically nonmed compliant?

not_available Abby.
not_available Did you witness the attempt, Abby? 
not_available I was with her.
not_available She took the pills in a bathroom.
not_available Who was that? Your mother's public defender.
not_available Since they won't stipulate I'll have you testify to the intention and lethality of the attempt.
not_available Nobody called me to testify.
not_available That's why you're here, right? You want your mother to stay committed.
not_available Well, yes, but somebody should have
not_available Okay.
not_available You're here now.

not_available All right.
not_available Peter, I thought you would never get here.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I was carrying Reece.
not_available I stepped in a grate in the sidewalk and twisted my ankle so bad I thought I was going to pass out.
not_available Was he hurt? Are you hurt? He scraped his elbow.
not_available He's okay.
not_available Carla, you were carrying him while you were wearing these? They said they wanna operate.
not_available I kept telling them to call you.
not_available I do not want an operation.
not_available Yeah, well, you have a trimalleolar fracture.
not_available They'll have to put a screw in it so it'll heal properly.
not_available Can't you do it? 
not_available No.
not_available You need an orthopedic surgeon.
not_available Well, how long am I gonna have to stay in the hospital? 
not_available A couple of days.
not_available I can't.
not_available Roger's out of town.
not_available Yeah, is he ever around? We haven't been getting along well lately.
not_available Which is one of the reasons why I cannot deal with this right now.
not_available I'll take Reece for a couple of days till you get back on your feet.
not_available I don't think that's gonna be a good idea.
not_available Why not? Jackie told me that you moved in with that girlfriend.
not_available And that's a problem? 
not_available It's not a good environment for our son.
not_available Carla, give me a break.
not_available She's a pediatrician.
not_available I'm just saying she don't seem like the motherly type.
not_available She was admitted following a suicide attempt.
not_available That's not what I asked, Dr.
not_available DeRaad.
not_available Has Mrs.
not_available Wyczenski shown any signs of suicidality since her admission? Not that I'm aware of.
not_available She has voluntarily submitted for all treatments and medications recommended by your department? 
not_available That's correct.

not_available Your Honor? Get to the point, Mr.
not_available Nesmith.
not_available Your mother can be eccentric, maybe a little embarrassing at times? She suffers from a debilitating mood disorder.
not_available Having her live with you while trying to date would be a major inconvenience? I've tried having her live with me before several times.
not_available It doesn't work.
not_available Doesn't work? No.
not_available She stops taking her medications, she loses control and she disappears.
not_available Does she look out of control to you? She's on her meds now.
not_available So she does take her medication.
not_available She's only taken them for a week.
not_available As long as she's med compliant, she's not a danger.
not_available She doesn't stay med compliant.
not_available That wasn't my question.
not_available Have you known your mother to be a danger to herself while med compliant? No.
not_available Not usually.
not_available You think locking her up in a psychiatric facility would be better for her? 
not_available I can't take care of her.
not_available Can't or won't? 
not_available She tried to kill herself while with me.
not_available Nonresponsive.

not_available She's gonna be okay? She might need a transfusion.
not_available I'll speak with you after she's stabilized.
not_available Oh, God! 
not_available Can you take him outside? Call for packed cells.
not_available If pressure's not up after two liters HemoCue every 30 minutes.
not_available Are human bites really worse than dog bites? Yeah, because of the virulence of the bacteria.
not_available If germs infect the joint, it can cause scarring which can limit your range of motion.

not_available Sort of our version of a handshake.
not_available Next thing you know, he's got his hand in my pouch.

not_available I'm not into the weird stuff.
not_available It makes me sick.
not_available I never felt like myself.

not_available How do you feel now? 
not_available Better.

not_available Did you try to kill yourself during your last depressive episode? I took an overdose of sleeping pills, yes.
not_available But I never meant to kill myself.
not_available She's lying.
not_available Why did you take so many pills? Who in their right mind wants to drive from Oklahoma to Chicago, really? I get carsick.
not_available I just thought if I could sleep, I'd be all right.
not_available I took some pills.
not_available She took 900 milligrams.
not_available They didn't work right away.
not_available You know, I foolishly then took some more pills.
not_available She took 900 milligrams.
not_available That's 36 pills.
not_available How much did you take? I know it was stupid.
not_available I just thought if I could sleep The next thing I know, I woke up in the hospital.
not_available But I never meant to hurt myself or anyone else.

not_available Ask her where she got the pills.

not_available Did you do a blood transfusion? 
not_available We gave her plasma.
not_available Her blood wasn't clotting properly.
not_available Why isn't her blood clotting? It could be a sign of liver disease.
not_available The liver affects the clotting factors.
not_available She ever have hepatitis? No.
not_available She drink alcohol every day? 
not_available No.
not_available Tylenol? Any other medications? Maybe some herbal stuff.

not_available We got that monkey from a lab and we had to dress him in that stupid outfit to hide his open sores! We need to admit you.
not_available A gynecologist will want to see you and start treatment right away.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I don't like hospitals! Look, the tumor will only get worse, and you'll feel sicker.
not_available Is there someone that we can call? A family member, perhaps, who can talk to you about this? Nope.

not_available Right? Excuse me, you got a light? 
not_available This is turning into a freaking disaster.
not_available You did fine.
not_available Who's covering for you? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available She's asking for you.
not_available Maybe you should talk to her.
not_available What for? You didn't want me to deal with her.
not_available No.
not_available I thought she needed hospitalization.
not_available Well, why do you think I'm here? Because you know she needs your help, even if she doesn't want it.
not_available I thought you should eat something.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You lied.
not_available You wanted to kill yourself.
not_available I can't be committed.
not_available Well, you need help, Mom.
not_available And I obviously don't know how to help you.
not_available I understand.
not_available I don't want to be a burden to you, Abby.
not_available I swear that's the truth.
not_available But I can't be committed.
not_available So you'll just do this to yourself over again? You'll just roll through the whole cycle? 
not_available No.
not_available Then what? What? What are you gonna do differently this time? I don't know.
not_available I don't want to break any more promises to you.
not_available I've put you through so much already
not_available If you believe that, you'd seek treatment.
not_available I will.
not_available I just
not_available Can't be committed.
not_available Right.
not_available Well Well, just forgive me if I don't trust your judgment.
not_available I would have found a way to try, Abby.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available Nothing I do is your fault.
not_available My company has this Christmas charity event.
not_available One year the guy who always dresses up for the kids got sick.
not_available My boss made me put on this reindeer suit.
not_available The kids went nuts.
not_available The adults thought it was great.
not_available Everybody took pictures with me.
not_available Sounds almost fun.
not_available It was a blast.
not_available I used to be so shy.
not_available But the suit gives you freedom.
not_available It lets you do things you normally wouldn't do.
not_available But I'm not a plushie or a furvert.
not_available A what? Furverts like to wear their suits during sex.
not_available And plushies are overly fond of stuffed animals.
not_available What? 
not_available But not me.
not_available I just like the suit.
not_available Some people disapprove and think it's wrong, but the truth is I'm never happier than when I'm a kangaroo.
not_available You have to rule out appendicitis, biliary disease, food poisoning.
not_available Does she have a fever? 
not_available No.
not_available 98.8.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available What's that smell? 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I've seen this before.
not_available Get a surgical consult.
not_available I'll call DCFS.
not_available No.
not_available It's a folk cure.
not_available They heat a coin over a candle and drag it across the back.
not_available Sometimes they dip the coins in essential oils.
not_available Just because it's an ancient tradition doesn't mean it's not child abuse.
not_available The minty smell is oil of wintergreen.
not_available It's got a high concentration of salicylates.
not_available It could have caused the aspirin toxicity.
not_available Let's get a blood gas and a salicylate level.
not_available You do that.
not_available I'm calling Family Services.
not_available Will I be able to have more children? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Noni, what your boyfriend did was really wrong.
not_available You need to consider whether or not to file criminal charges.
not_available Victor loves me.
not_available He just got scared.
not_available That doesn't justify what he did.
not_available I was so excited to be pregnant.
not_available What do you want to do? Mrs.
not_available Wyczenski, are you familiar with reading directions and warnings on overthe
not_available counter medications? Yes, I suppose so.
not_available Would you please read the label on this? I'm sorry, I don't have my reading glasses.
not_available I can't see.
not_available Allow me, then.
not_available Okay.
not_available "One tablet at bedtime.
not_available May repeat in four hours if necessary.
not_available Do not exceed four tablets in a 24
not_available hour period.
not_available " You took 36 tablets, did you not? I didn't have my reading glasses with me then either.
not_available You took 36 pills and you didn't intend to kill yourself? I was depressed, but I didn't want to kill myself.
not_available Really.
not_available Where did you get the pills? 
not_available I got them at a convenience store.
not_available How did you pay for them? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available You stole them? Objection.
not_available Shoplifting has nothing to do with suicidality.
not_available Goes to intent.
not_available Get to it quickly.
not_available Why did you have to steal them? Why didn't you ask your daughter to pay for them? 
not_available She wouldn't have.
not_available Why not? 
not_available She was worried.
not_available Worried that you'd try to kill yourself? She worries when I get depressed.
not_available Because during other depressions you have attempted suicide.
not_available In fact, you've been committed on two other occasions for attempted suicide.
not_available In '83 and 1974.
not_available Yes.
not_available What method did you use for those? 
not_available Carbon monoxide poisoning.
not_available In '83.
not_available What about in '74? 
not_available I took some pills.
not_available Did you coin Lynda because she's sick? I don't understand what you're saying.
not_available Could someone get me a translator? Where's Chen? Look who's here! Your cardiac enzymes are back, Mr.
not_available Ferris.
not_available You had a small heart attack.
not_available What did I tell you? I know heart attacks.
not_available I'm lucky you showed up when you did.
not_available We kept you alive till he got there.
not_available If there are any blockages, we'll open it with an angioplasty balloon 
not_available and we'll keep it open with a stent.
not_available Thank you, Peter.
not_available Not bad for a guy who blew up a rubber in your classroom.
not_available I'll check on you later.
not_available Hi, Reece.
not_available What are you doing here? His mother broke her ankle.
not_available She's waiting to be admitted to Surgery.
not_available Could you look at a belly? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I don't understand what you're saying.
not_available Could you just calm down? 
not_available She seems pretty upset.
not_available You think? You speak Cantonese? You think? I was a translator in the Army.
not_available Could you ask her what she treated her granddaughter with? 
not_available I think I can manage.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Malucci.
not_available Her labs are back.
not_available Electrolytes are normal.
not_available No anion gap.
not_available PH 7.4.
not_available Salicylate level's 
not_available Well, that's not a toxic range.
not_available Nope.
not_available Her liver
not_available function tests and her head CT are also normal.
not_available Then it's one hell of a case of gastroenteritis.
not_available We've given her 10 of Compazine.
not_available She's still puking.
not_available Peter's looking at her now.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Well, anything? She said she used hot coins and liniment.
not_available Yeah, I know that.
not_available But did she say why? She's possessed.
not_available Grandma or the girl? What are we talking here, demonic spirits? No, more like evil thoughts.
not_available Sinful behavior.
not_available You know, SE
not_available X.
not_available Faye? Faye! Faye, where are you going? Where're you going? I got a garden party at 6.
not_available You need to be admitted to the hospital so you can start treatment.
not_available We both know that's not gonna happen.
not_available You can't leave.
not_available Come on.
not_available I've never been one for hospitals.
not_available They smell funny.
not_available Besides, I already signed the papers.
not_available Will you at least speak to a psychiatrist? Mr.
not_available Whiskers.
not_available Take it.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available Really.
not_available Look, honey, I'm gonna be dead in a few months.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available Make me feel better knowing he's with someone who'll appreciate him.
not_available Stupid puppet ended my acting career.
not_available But it did buy my first house.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Every day comes with its own surprises.
not_available A statement from a former employer of Mrs.
not_available Wyczenski
not_available I don't need any more statements.
not_available The employer affirms that
not_available We've spent more than enough time on this one already.
not_available Let's move on.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Wyczenski is released on her own recognizance.
not_available What's next, Mike? 
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available You won.
not_available Is this yours, Marty? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available So I can just go? 
not_available Yes, you can go.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available That's it? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available She's letting her go? Is the respondent here? 
not_available Yes, he is, Your Honor.
not_available She needs hospitalization! I'm not debating it with you.
not_available You've counseled your client? 
not_available I have.
not_available Yeah, but, I mean, that's
not_available We did all we can.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available We have to move on.
not_available You're done.
not_available It's good.
not_available Just go back to the hospital and sign out.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's good.
not_available Move on.
not_available All of you should just move on.
not_available We wouldn't want to waste time on this.
not_available I've been dealing with her for 30 years.
not_available Russell? You didn't have to drive her to the hospital.
not_available Pour charcoal down her throat.
not_available Breathe for her.
not_available This way.
not_available I'm getting my coat! Just don't touch her.
not_available She's not your mother.
not_available What do you care? The rest of us will take care of her.
not_available And maybe if you're really lucky next time you won't have to hear the case at all.
not_available Maybe next time you'll do it right! And then it'll be the coroner's problem.
not_available No evidence of appendicitis or pancreatitis.
not_available Biliary colic? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm about to give up.
not_available Did you check for pyelo? Yes.
not_available And hepatitis.
not_available You should get an x
not_available ray of that wrist if it's bothering you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What will you do with Reece? 
not_available I left a message for Jackie.
not_available Hopefully she can pick him up on her way home from work.
not_available Why don't you take him home? You can't do anything with that hand.
not_available I wanna stick around until Ferris gets a room.
not_available Then I'll take him home with me.
not_available I'm off in an hour.
not_available No, I don't want you to have to do that.
not_available I don't mind.
not_available We'll have fun, right? 
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You have to let me take an x
not_available ray.
not_available Come on, you're resorting to blackmail? What the hell is that? I remember Mr.
not_available Whiskers! Where did you get him? On eBay? Princess Taffeta was the patient who Maced you.
not_available That's probably worth some money.
not_available Looks like roadkill.
not_available Malucci, there's a priest in with Lynda An? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's doing an exorcism.
not_available Excuse me? Actually, he's a chaplain, and it's more of a blessing.
not_available But it should work.
not_available I think her problem's psychosomatic.
not_available Based on your vast knowledge of psychiatry? And the fact her grandma caught her messing around with her boyfriend.
not_available It's all about guilt.
not_available Hey, how's it working out with Lynda? 
not_available I think she's gonna be fine.
not_available Excellent.
not_available How are you feeling, Lynda? 
not_available Hungry.
not_available No more nausea? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available She's eating solid foods and not vomiting.
not_available She's ready to go home.
not_available I'd like to admit you, keep you overnight for observation and rehydration.
not_available Could I get a pizza or something? We'll see what we can work out, okay? 
not_available Nice catch.
not_available I'd still like to do some more tests.
not_available Why, because you can't admit that a surgeon and a pediatrician got outsmarted by a goombah? Yeah.
not_available Don't sweat it.
not_available You're not the first to be deceived by my rugged good looks and boyish charm.
not_available By signing, you acknowledge doctors feel it's best you remain hospitalized and you accept and understand by leaving against medical advice you risk a deterioration of your psychiatric symptoms.
not_available What about my meds? Can I have a prescription? I will give you three days' worth.
not_available I want to see you Monday.
not_available If you' re doing well, I'll give you a week's worth.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay what? What does that mean? Could I call you? 
not_available Sure.
not_available All right.
not_available You can call me anytime.
not_available You can call me just to talk.
not_available Okay.
not_available I got some stuff from that motel room and some stuff you left in my apartment.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Figure out where you're going? Yeah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi gave me the name of a shelter.
not_available I'm gonna go there for a few days.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good luck, Maggie.
not_available See you next time.
not_available Next time? Yeah, whenever it is, wherever it is Maybe there won't be a next time.
not_available You're gonna walk out of here on your own one week after swallowing a pharmacy, as close to death as I see people get and you think there's not gonna be a next time? I hope not.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I promised myself I wouldn't make any promises.
not_available You know when I saw you seizing on that table, I 
thought "This is it.
not_available This is it.
not_available This is how it's all gonna end.
not_available I am going to watch my mother die.
not_available " I still might not be wrong about that.
not_available It could still end that way.
not_available And there's not one thing I can do about it.
not_available But I'll show up.
not_available Because you will always have that power over me.
not_available I will show up and I will try to stop it.
not_available I love you, Mom.
not_available How long will she be in the hospital? 
not_available We'll keep her overnight for observation.
not_available Could I see her? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I wanna talk to her.
not_available She prefers to be alone.
not_available You need to speak to the police.
not_available Is this him? 
not_available It's him.
not_available This is between me and Noni.
not_available What did you do, talk her into pressing charges? 
not_available I didn't have to.
not_available Murder is a felony.
not_available Come with me, sir.
not_available It wasn't even a baby.
not_available Can I speak with Dr.
not_available Quaid? Daryl Quaid.
not_available Well, he gave me his card and it has this number on it.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available One of those days? Ever find out what happened with your numbers guy? Was he a savant? Don't know.
not_available He left with this doctor from the VA.
not_available I just called to follow up but there's no record of my patient or the doctor I let him leave with.
not_available What will you do? 
not_available Same thing as I always do.
not_available Hit a bar, get drunk, go home with a stranger and have wild sex until I pass out from exhaustion.
not_available Takeout and a hot bath? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Randi, have you seen my puppet? Your what? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Whiskers.
not_available I didn't touch it.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Can't believe somebody would steal that.
not_available Where do you guys want Super Larry? 
not_available Exam 1.
not_available The opossum guy's still in there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, let's get rid of him.
not_available Mr.
not_available Paxton? Mr.
not_available Paxton? You still playing opossum? Mr.
not_available Whiskers! 
not_available Whatever happened to Mrs.
not_available Lindstrom? 
not_available Retired.
not_available She was mean.
not_available That woman was born mean.
not_available Even the other teachers were afraid of her.
not_available I'm sure you thought the same of me with all those detentions I gave you.
not_available Your detentions steered me towards medicine.
not_available So I might have played a small role in it.
not_available I'm proud of you, Peter.
not_available Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
not_available And you should be proud of yourself.
not_available I am.
not_available Look, don't get me wrong.
not_available Sometimes it's hard when people's lives depend on your success and you're not always successful.
not_available Sometimes you
not_available Sometimes you get so tired that you start forgetting what's important.
not_available And what is that? Two things in this world I'm certain 
of My love for my son and my skills as a surgeon.
not_available I'm a father, I'm a doctor.
not_available At the end of the day, that's enough.
not_available What about a teacher? That was never one of my greatest skills.
not_available The only skill you need to be a good teacher is to care.
not_available That's all.
not_available Who knows? Maybe one of your students will wind up saving your ass one day.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I heard you were here, but I haven't seen you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Most of my day is spent in the jail ward.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was glad to hear that the charges were dropped.
not_available Shannon Wallace decided to tell the truth after she got the treatment that she needed.
not_available That's good.
not_available What do you want, Kerry? 
not_available I thought you might be hungry.
not_available No.
not_available No, I'm not, and I have a ton of work to do.
not_available So Right.
not_available Well, if you change your mind here's some Kung Pao chicken from George's.
not_available Abby, are you okay in there? Want some dinner? You need to eat.
not_available Have you been watching Martha Stewart again? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available For what? For being there.
not_available And here.
not_available Everything.
not_available Is the food here? 
not_available What food? I'm making dinner by myself.
not_available Why are you laughing? I just hope you didn't order from that Thai place again.
not_available Who is it? Abby?
