not_available There's something not right about him.
not_available Hey, I'm Dr.
not_available Carter, Martin.
not_available How you doing? What, is he deaf, too? 
not_available Martin? Can you turn around? Are you hurt? Are you in pain? I don't think he likes you much.
not_available Do you think you could write down what's wrong? Is it your head? Chest? Stomach? Oh, told you.
not_available He's probably just hungry.

not_available Two days.
not_available Yeah, I got that.

not_available That's horrible.
not_available Bovie, pickups.
not_available Let me get something straight.
not_available Someone chops this girl up and you take your time in the ER placing three horizontal mattresses in the ventricle? It was a large defect.
not_available Foley balloon would've taken care of it.
not_available We still had to repair the myocardium.
not_available Exactly.
not_available While you were having your little sewing bee I could have been repairing the pulmonary artery.
not_available I didn't appreciate that wound.
not_available Satinsky and more Prolene.
not_available So what's your excuse? Did you lose a fortune in the stock market? 
not_available No.
not_available Cat run away? How many units in? Just the six O
not_available neg.
not_available You and the hubby still fighting? 
not_available Rumor mill is still churning out winners.
not_available I'm glad the gossip's so amusing.
not_available Army
not_available Navy.
not_available So is this split temporary or the real thing? I don't know.
not_available You want my advice? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Another clip.
not_available Stay away from love.
not_available It does things to the brain.
not_available PVCs.
not_available Hundred of lidocaine! 
not_available Come on, Diana.
not_available So it's her nerves, right? Nothing a Xanax won't cure? Actually, your transaminases are high.
not_available What's that mean? 
not_available You have pretty extensive liver damage.
not_available I don't drink at all.
not_available Drugs? 
not_available No.
not_available Have you had anything out of the ordinary to eat the last few days? We had seared ahi last night, pear salad.
not_available Chanterelles.
not_available You ate our mushrooms? In my omelet.
not_available You weren't up yet.
not_available Where did you get them from? We picked them in Marin a few months ago.
not_available I froze them.
not_available If they were bad mushrooms, you could have amanita poisoning.
not_available And that causes liver damage? Extreme cases can result in liver failure.
not_available What do you do for that? 
not_available Don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
not_available But, worst
not_available case scenario, you'd need a transplant.
not_available But I don't even feel that sick.
not_available It may not come to that.
not_available Do you have any relatives we can test to see if they' re a match? Do we know her name? 
not_available Cops are on it.
not_available Why didn't they tube her? 
not_available Big, interior hematoma at the base of the neck.
not_available Didn't want to take the chance.
not_available Female in her twenties, stabbed at Hamden College.
not_available Second one today.
not_available Found a knife at the scene.
not_available BP, 110/70.
not_available Stab wounds to the neck and two deep ones by the sternum.
not_available Was she in the dorm too? 
not_available Science building.
not_available Police are searching the university.
not_available Killing spree on campus.
not_available Remind me not to hang out there.
not_available Open a crike tray.
not_available Might need to cut through this hematoma.
not_available Draw up 20 of etomidate and 120 of sux.
not_available And I need a 7.5 tube.
not_available A wall collapsed at the school fire.
not_available What can we take? 
not_available Three criticals, four minors.
not_available Okay, call Respiratory and ENT.
not_available Hang on, she's trying to say something.
not_available Honey, can you tell us your name? Okay, suction ready.
not_available Hold cricoid while we bag.
not_available Pulse ox is coming up 96 percent.
not_available Probable mediastinal injury.
not_available We'll have to triple
not_available scope her.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Friend of yours? Could someone take him to Curtain 1? 
not_available Six hundred of clinda, 200 gentamicin.
not_available Meds are in.
not_available We should tube her, Kerry.
not_available Wait.
not_available What is it? I loved her.
not_available Hey, where's my doctor? 
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available Can you tell her that I'm flying again? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Hold still.
not_available This beats the patch any day.
not_available I thought women liked pirates.
not_available Yeah, 400 years ago, maybe.
not_available I was paged about a possible liver transplant.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available The sister's here.
not_available I thought both of us could talk to her.
not_available Thanks, Susan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What's in New York? 
not_available What? There were charges on our Visa bill from New York.
not_available Terry Welsh? 
not_available Right down there by Curtain 3.
not_available Fiftytwo dollars from Saks? 
not_available That's mine.
not_available It's a phone order.
not_available Something you couldn't find in Chicago? 
not_available Terry? Hi, sorry.
not_available I just got out of practice.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Paul said it was serious.
not_available Yes.
not_available Serious enough that we should line up a donor.
not_available Donor? 
not_available Right in here.
not_available Hi, Ter.
not_available Joanne? Your sister's doing okay now but we'd like to take the first step and get blood drawn.
not_available And have you sign the consent form.
not_available Consent for what? You didn't fill her in? 
not_available I thought Joanne should.
not_available I might need a new liver.
not_available What? And my best shot for a match is someone in the family.
not_available She's stage
not_available three.
not_available Means she's well enough to accept a living donor transplant.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available We'd like to test, 
not_available see if you're a match.
not_available I have the Sweet Sixteen this weekend.
not_available What? 
not_available We beat Indiana on Thursday.
not_available A game you obviously didn't watch.
not_available You play in a lot of games.
not_available These are the playoffs, Joanne.
not_available There's not a lot of time.
not_available Right? 
not_available Sooner is definitely better.
not_available It's just part of the liver.
not_available It grows back.
not_available You donate the right lobe, about 60 percent.
not_available Wait.
not_available Stop.
not_available Let me think.
not_available What's to think about? 
not_available No, you're right.
not_available We don't even know if she's a match yet.
not_available Shelley? You should be lying down.
not_available What's Renee doing here? 
not_available You know this girl.
not_available Renee Carlson.
not_available She's Diana's roommate.
not_available She was badly injured.
not_available Was she stabbed like Diana? Are Renee and Diana close? No.
not_available She's quiet.
not_available Kind of weird.
not_available Diana's moving out in a few weeks to come live with us.
not_available Where is Diana? Is she okay? Oh, my God.
not_available She's not dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I called your house today, Martin.
not_available I know you can speak, because I heard your voice on the answering machine.
not_available Why aren't you talking to me? What? I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
not_available Why don't you just say it.
not_available Martin! Okay, stop playing games.
not_available Tell me what's wrong.
not_available Look, we'll try supportive therapy.
not_available But there are no guarantees.
not_available She's started bleeding in her stomach.
not_available I'm a match, aren't I? 
not_available You wouldn't be explaining if I weren't.
not_available A transplant would be totally curative.
not_available But there'd still be a risk for me, right? 
not_available It would be minimal.
not_available Someone as healthy as you should recover completely.
not_available In three days? 
not_available More like six weeks.
not_available I'm a senior.
not_available This is my first and last time in the playoffs.
not_available Can't she wait a month? 
not_available She's already having complications.
not_available Pretend she didn't have a sister.
not_available What would you do? Well, we'd be forced to put her on a waiting list for a cadaveric donor.
not_available So there are other ways she could get a liver.
not_available Terry, this is her best chance.
not_available Obviously it's your choice, but I'm sure she'd do the same thing for you.
not_available No.
not_available She wouldn't.
not_available Run inside! Tell them we need a collar and a backboard now! I got hot water on me! Charlie, does your neck hurt? 
not_available Everything hurts.
not_available I need help here, somebody.
not_available Please! You need help driving! 
not_available What happened? The boy.
not_available Okay, Charlie.
not_available Stay still like a statue.
not_available We're gonna move you.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Get another backboard.
not_available He's not breathing.
not_available Lie him down.
not_available He's been unconscious for 20 minutes.
not_available Why is he wet? He was taking a bath.
not_available We stepped away.
not_available He was underwater.
not_available For how long? Two minutes at the most.
not_available We need the pulse ox.
not_available How old is he? 
not_available He's 8.
not_available His name's Viktor.
not_available Not moving much air.
not_available How could we let this happen? 
not_available He'll be okay, Linda.
not_available You his mom? 
not_available I am.
not_available I'm his doctor.
not_available They called you first? 
not_available Pulse ox, 85 on 15 liters.
not_available Did you try to resuscitate him? 
not_available No.
not_available Take vitals? 
not_available We thought it best to just come over.
not_available First
not_available aid lab, EKG and a portable chest.
not_available And an ABG.
not_available Follow the light.
not_available Need to see pupils.
not_available My pupils aren't my problem.
not_available Titrate 10 of morphine.
not_available Get him feeling better.
not_available Now you're talking.
not_available Circumferential burns to the elbows.
not_available Trying to clear the neck.
not_available Trauma panel, dip a urine.
not_available Get the SonoSite.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Let's get a full scan just to be safe.
not_available Head, C
not_available spine, abdomen.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Draw up atropine, etomidate and sux.
not_available Linda, Kyle, I recommend you step out.
not_available Orange zone on the Broselow.
not_available We wanna stay with him.
not_available Not now.
not_available I'm not leaving my son.
not_available He's not getting enough air.
not_available 6
not_available 0 cuffed ET tube.
not_available He's gonna be okay, right? Are you a medical doctor? 
not_available Socialization therapist.
not_available Satting at 91.
not_available Try a nasal trumpet.
not_available Felicia Kind.
not_available Number three straight blade.
not_available Okay, sit down.
not_available Deep breath.
not_available You need to take that outside.
not_available Surgilube.
not_available Let's do a jaw thrust and get a good seal.
not_available Sats at 92.
not_available I should have called first.
not_available I'm glad you came over.
not_available We were on our way home from baby gym class, and she just said it.
not_available Who's that? Who's that? Dada? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Dada.
not_available That's right.
not_available It's Dada.
not_available Why were three adults giving an 8year
not_available old a bath? A bonding game.
not_available Recreating the womb.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Holding your son underwater bonds him to you? 
not_available It was only for short periods.
not_available Apparently not short enough.
not_available Mark, you should get out there.
not_available Is something wrong? No.
not_available Ella has something to tell you.
not_available Tidal volume, 300.
not_available AC, Get a blood gas in 20 minutes.
not_available I'll be right outside.
not_available Hey, you deserted me.
not_available I did nothing of the sort, Charlie.
not_available You're in perfectly good hands.
not_available She never buys from me.
not_available You're overpriced.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, Renee Carlson's mom is here.
not_available Is there anything on the firefighters? 
not_available No.
not_available Repeat the hematocrit in one hour and send the O
not_available neg back to the blood bank.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Carlson, I'm Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I'm treating Renee.
not_available Hi.
not_available They called me at work.
not_available They told me she got hurt at school.
not_available I thought she twisted an ankle or something.
not_available Your daughter has multiple knife wounds including a deep cut across her throat.
not_available You saved her? 
not_available We were able to repair the wounds and she's stable.
not_available But we had to put a tube down her throat to help her breathe.
not_available When will she wake up? 
not_available It's hard to say.
not_available We'll just have to wait.
not_available She hasn't been in the hospital since she was born.
not_available We need to get her up to the intensive care unit.
not_available The police said her friend Diana was attacked too.
not_available Yes.
not_available Is she okay? Diana's injuries were much more extensive.
not_available We were unable to save her.
not_available Has Renee been having any problems at school? No.
not_available Has she been depressed or showing any signs of
not_available ? No.
not_available Why are you asking this? We're just trying to understand what happened.
not_available Someone attacked my daughter and her friend.
not_available That's what happened.
not_available Why is everyone asking all these questions? Diana had defensive wounds on her hands and her arms.
not_available Renee didn't.
not_available So what? My daughter didn't hurt her friend.
not_available And she certainly did not do this to herself.
not_available There must be a maniac out there.
not_available I'm sure Renee will tell us what happened as soon as she wakes up.
not_available That's right.
not_available She'll tell you.
not_available She and Diana were best friends.
not_available Viktor's stable.
not_available He's breathing with the help of a machine.
not_available Will he wake up? We hope we see some progress in the next 24 hours.
not_available A social worker's on her way down.
not_available Why do we need a social worker? 
not_available Wait, let me explain.
not_available I got the gist of it.
not_available We adopted Viktor in Prague last year.
not_available We were thrilled.
not_available But he hasn't connected with us.
not_available Love and time usually does it.
not_available It was putting a strain on our marriage.
not_available Felicia's helping us.
not_available You put your son in a lot of danger.
not_available If he needs counseling, or you do, go to a real doctor.
not_available Her success rate is 85 percent.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What, no geese? 
not_available A flock of ducks walked down the hall.
not_available He's seeing birds.
not_available Please, Stan.
not_available You told me you saw butterflies earlier.
not_available Pink elephants.
not_available They weren't pink.
not_available They were psychedelic and pretty as Natalie Wood.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He checked out for an hour.
not_available Where to? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available But Dr.
not_available Lewis is covering for him.
not_available Where are you going? I have a 5day

not_available Can you take this to Exam 4? This is a bit awkward, but I need to know where my husband is.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You're covering his patients.
not_available Yeah, but
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please tell me.
not_available I know there's something going on.
not_available I don't think I deserve to be in the dark.
not_available He is my husband.
not_available You need to talk to him.
not_available Susan.
not_available Elizabeth, think about it.
not_available What would be going on that he wouldn't want to tell you? That he'd try to protect you from? Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for my husband, Mark Greene.
not_available He just started his treatment.
not_available Can you take me to him, please? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I just pre

not_available Hanson, Jeffries and Lopez.
not_available Sandy Lopez? She was the first one in.
not_available What about gamma radiation? 
not_available Didn't work.
not_available Tumor's still growing.
not_available Should we call Dr.
not_available Burke? Maybe he 
not_available I saw him.
not_available In New York.
not_available How much time? If this works, 10 months.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? I don't know.
not_available I guess it was bad timing.
not_available I could have helped.
not_available How? 
not_available You shouldn't be alone.
not_available This doesn't change anything.
not_available It does.
not_available It changes everything.
not_available I don't expect you to come back just because this happened.
not_available Let me know if Perotti goes to the O.R.
not_available I'm pretty sure it's an appy.
not_available What, you're going back to work? I don't know what else to do.
not_available I've débrided the forearms.
not_available She needs Thermazine and burn
not_available net.

not_available The last bed.
not_available Urine output was 250 cc's last hour.
not_available There's your new boyfriend.
not_available What? Oh, poor guy.
not_available He's a little on the simple side.
not_available You think? Martin, did you talk to the lady from Psych? That doesn't mean anything to me.
not_available Okay, a scarf doesn't mean much either.
not_available I don't get it, okay? Did someone knit you the set? Something happened to that person.
not_available Two days ago, when you stopped talking.
not_available Danny Barnett, found on the scene at the fire.
not_available No obvious burns or injuries.
not_available People were very worried about you, Danny.
not_available Where were you? 
not_available Cafeteria.
not_available How are his sats? Ninety
not_available nine on room air.
not_available Did you breathe in any smoke, Danny? No, I told the fire lady I'm not hurt.
not_available She still made me come.
not_available Is the fire lady here with you now? 
not_available She rode in the ambulance with me.
not_available Maybe they took her home.
not_available And was she hurt? Don't think so.
not_available She was telling jokes.
not_available Okay, I'll be right back, Danny, okay? Jerry, call the 38.
not_available Verify that all their firefighters are accounted for.

not_available Yeah? Suture Room.
not_available What's that? It's a lighter.
not_available Scoped it out of some kid's belly.
not_available What are you gonna do with it? 
not_available Keep it.
not_available Why? 
not_available Behold Dr.
not_available Carter's box of wonders.
not_available You've scoped all that stuff out of patients? I like to think of it as gastrointestinal brica
not_available brac.
not_available Hey, is that my good pen? I can't believe you pulled this out of someone's stomach.
not_available Other end.
not_available Keep it.
not_available Here.
not_available You didn't sign it.
not_available I know.
not_available Terry, where are you going? Back to practice.
not_available What about Joanne? Joanne's never had time for anyone but Joanne.
not_available That's still no reason not to help her.
not_available We're not close.
not_available She's still your sister! I know I should be a bigger person, but I've trained for this my whole life.
not_available I'm not willing to sacrifice that.
not_available If that makes me a selfish, terrible person, I'm sorry.
not_available Maybe I'll help Joanne afterwards, but not right now.
not_available Hiding out, are you? Do me a favor, Just go down there when those idiots page you.
not_available They're like crazed cyborgs, paging every five minutes until they somehow manage to find your fearless leader and suck us all into their universe.
not_available Oh, what happened? Prince Harry in rehab again? Mark's tumor's back.
not_available Has it invaded Broca's? It's encroaching the motor cortex.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It was always a possibility.
not_available He's known about it for weeks.
not_available He just didn't tell me.
not_available Well Maybe he was protecting you.
not_available There's so much we haven't worked out.
not_available I don't think I can go through this again.
not_available I'm sick and tired of being the strong one.
not_available You know, we've broken up.
not_available We've grown apart.
not_available He doesn't even expect me to be there, anyway.
not_available What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to just go back home to watch him die? Yes.
not_available Well, I don't think I can.
not_available Is he your husband? Yes.
not_available Do you love him? Yes.
not_available The police found his mom on the bathroom floor.
not_available They think it was a heart attack.
not_available Does he live with her? Yeah, I think it's a conversion disorder brought on by the stress of finding her dead.
not_available Does he have any other family? Yeah, there's a sister coming in from Louisville.
not_available And Psych said they'd hold him until then.
not_available I'm gonna go visit him.
not_available Okay.
not_available Viktor Evans' parents? 
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available How much do you charge for therapy? 
not_available Went a little too far this time.
not_available Too far? You deprived that boy's brain of oxygen.
not_available He'll pull through.
not_available How would you know? 
not_available I have a feeling.
not_available Feeling.
not_available If you call yourself a doctor, you should be able to back it up.
not_available Before I started working with Viktor he could barely crack a smile let alone acknowledge his adoptive parents.
not_available Now he's calling them Mommy and Daddy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, he's having purposeful movements.
not_available Don't worry, honey.
not_available Mommy's here.
not_available Is he okay? Viktor, can you hear me? Try and grab my fingers.
not_available Good grip strength bilaterally.
not_available We're in the clear.
not_available Check the weaning parameters.
not_available Viktor, you have a tube in your throat, so you can't talk.
not_available Welcome back, champ.
not_available We'll take it out as soon as we can.
not_available Look.
not_available This may have been a breakthrough day.
not_available You think? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available He's engaging with you.
not_available You're kidding, right? 
not_available We have other methods we can try.
not_available Not if you intend on keeping Viktor.
not_available What you did today was abusive, not loving.
not_available Radical problems need radical therapies.
not_available Tell that to Child Protective Services.
not_available They'll be making a home visit.
not_available You okay, Dr.
not_available Greene? I gotta go.
not_available What's Stan still doing here? I told him he could stay if he sang quietly.
not_available At least it's not Oklahoma! tonight.
not_available Thank God for small favors.
not_available And he's off the birds.
not_available Can you call for Stewart's pelvic CT results? Check the second troponin on Lang.
not_available All right.
not_available Mark, you haven't written up your H &amp; P's.
not_available I'll do that on my next shift.
not_available Yeah, well, this shift isn't over.
not_available I just had my first round of chemotherapy, Kerry.
not_available I feel like hell.
not_available I'm gonna go home early, okay? Hey.
not_available What's the expression? "Couch tomato"? "Potato.
not_available " And I'm at the table.
not_available I should buy a new comforter.
not_available Don't do it on my account.
not_available A girl named Michelle called for you.
not_available Oh, I forgot.
not_available You're taking her to the IceCapades? What's wrong with that? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I tried to explain that I was just your roommate.
not_available I'm not sure if I like her, anyway.
not_available Is this the last one? 
not_available No, there's a couple more in there.
not_available Any luck? Yes, here's one.
not_available Two bedroom, one bath, hardwood floors, breakfast nook.
not_available Sounds big.
not_available Has a doorman.
not_available Safe.
not_available And a lake view.
not_available How much? 
not_available This one's only twice what I can afford.
not_available I'm gonna jump in the shower.
not_available Yeah, you don't wanna keep Tai and Randy waiting.
not_available This latte blows.
not_available Weaver said Charlie won't be on his feet until next week.
not_available Then I'm in trouble, because this cafeteria stuff is criminal.
not_available I heard about Mark Greene.
not_available Tough to keep a secret around here.
not_available You did.
not_available So that night, you were? What can I say? I'm passionate.
not_available You spent the night together, and I thought 
not_available You have a very active imagination.
not_available If you only knew.
not_available You are not flirting with me.
not_available No way.
not_available I'm never gonna make that mistake again.
not_available Back in uniform.
not_available Isn't your head cold? 
not_available No, no, I got thick hair.
not_available What are you hiding? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available What are you hiding? What do you got there, Gallant? What do you got in there? 
not_available Oh, look at that.
not_available Oh, can I hold one? Sure.
not_available So cute.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hey.
not_available Out barhopping? I was just 
not_available Lost? Looking for you.
not_available And you only found my car.
not_available It was great what you did for that kid today.
not_available Part of the job.
not_available The good part, when the fire doesn't get you.
not_available Do you wanna talk about it? 
not_available No, I'm back at 7.
not_available You know what? You can't drive.
not_available Kerry, come on.
not_available You were missing.
not_available I was worried.
not_available I'm touched.
not_available You were right.
not_available You did do me a favor.
not_available Come to think of it, it was a pretty cool save.
not_available Fire went to three alarms.
not_available I couldn't see my hand in front of my
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Where's your dad? 
not_available Upstairs.
not_available He didn't feel well.
not_available Would you like to take Ella? 
not_available Hey.
not_available There's Rach.
not_available Hi.
not_available Thank you.
not_available He's sick again, isn't he? How long have you been like this? Forever.
not_available Don't they say if it makes you sick it's working? It's cold comfort when you're lying on the bathroom floor.
not_available You want some Compazine? 
not_available I took some an hour ago.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me put this on your forehead.
not_available You know, I tried for weeks to get her to say "Mama" and "moon." 
not_available They always say "Dada" first.
not_available That's just because it's easy to say.
not_available Maybe she likes me.
not_available She's a good judge of character.
not_available Here.
not_available I'm gonna go out and get some Zofran.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Stay.
not_available Stay.
not_available It'll pass.
