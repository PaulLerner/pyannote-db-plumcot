Previously on ER Someone's down! 
not_available We have to wait for a secure area.
not_available We should not be out here! I thought you smoothed things between ER and paramedics? You're my new intern.
not_available I just gave you an order.
not_available I wasn't aware Reece had a hearing problem.
not_available My son is my business.
not_available And I'm not interested in continuing as Interim Chief.
not_available Beard is stuck! I wouldn't have asked if you had told me what you were doing.
not_available Sorry you thought it was your business to ask me.
not_available Carter? What are you doing here? Hey! Morning, Carter.
not_available That's Grace Jones.
not_available Hey, I didn't wake you up, did I? I mean, you're on at 7.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But no problem.
not_available Good.
not_available You settling in down there? Yes, I like it.
not_available You have a very interesting CD collection.
not_available What? I said, you have a very eclectic CD collection! Thanks.
not_available Anything you want to listen to, just ask.
not_available Don't ever touch it on your own, though.
not_available I've rented to a lot of students, so I had to make that a rule.
not_available Carter, let me make you one of these, man.
not_available It'll slingshot you into your day.
not_available You're in a really good mood.
not_available I'm just so glad to be Hey, can I ask you something? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Do you find it easy to evaluate other people's work? Time to grade your student? I worry about being too harsh.
not_available Does she deserve to be judged harshly? I want to be fair.
not_available Lucy hasn't gotten off to a great start this year, clearly.
not_available But she's smart and she's willing to work hard.
not_available Maybe I should go easy, give her a chance to turn things around.
not_available Go on.
not_available Keep talking.
not_available A stripper? I said, "Damn! Can't you cover that up?" She was destroying the magic.
not_available I thought I'd ride along this morning.
not_available It's more fun than the hospital, isn't it? He likes it on the frontlines, or we need closer supervision.
not_available Somebody's gotta keep an eye on you.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available Here! By the way, can I crash here tonight? My building's being fumigated.
not_available Have to ask the captain.
not_available Shouldn't be a problem.
not_available You can sleep on a Barcalounger.
not_available I've done that.
not_available Who paged me? I got an 87year
not_available old man with cholangitis for you.
not_available I stopped taking admits at 6:30.
not_available Why didn't you page the on
not_available call team? He came in while you were on call.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano specifically asked for you.
not_available How sick is he? He's septic, intubated hypotensive and in renal 
not_available No, no! This can't be happening.
not_available Look, I haven't had a nap in the last I have to take a shower, I smell bad.
not_available And you give me a patient sick as a dog? What does that say? What does that say? 6:38! I'm not on call! He's in Curtain 3.
not_available We've all been there.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Tony Broadway? That a great porn star name, or what? Carol, want to know your porno name? 
not_available What? Take your middle name and the street you live on.
not_available Like, mine would be Anthony Broadway.
not_available Tony Broadway.
not_available You're mixed up.
not_available That's your romance novelist's name.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available Your porno name is your pet name with your mother's maiden name.
not_available My name would be Nibbles McGee.
not_available Nibbles.
not_available That's a great porno name.
not_available Mine would be Fluffy Florez.
not_available If you don't have a pet? 
not_available Use one you had as a kid.
not_available Nibbles is a great name.
not_available I don't think that's right.
not_available What would yours be? 
not_available Mine wouldn't work.
not_available Have we gotten a package from Lakeside Supply? This early? 
not_available It's supposed to arrive overnight.
not_available Tell me when it's here.
not_available Kerry, have you got a minute? We need to prepare these Attending schedules.
not_available I'm not familiar with the computer down here.
not_available It's a snap.
not_available Jerry can take you through it.
not_available Can you give me a hand? 
not_available I got a lot of patients.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, got a woman complaining about her bill.
not_available She was charged for procedures not done.
not_available Why are you telling me? Those calls go to the Chief of Emergency.
not_available Or the Interim Chief.
not_available Tell her you'll pull her chart and call her within two days.
not_available I don't know how I'm supposed to learn in this environment.
not_available Our relationship has turned adversarial and it's not good for the patients.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, we need to talk.
not_available Hey, Lucy.
not_available Is everything all right? You're talking to yourself.
not_available Not a bad thing Actually, do you think I should sit down and talk to Dr.
not_available Carter? Depends on how direct you want to be.
not_available You don't want to be confrontational.
not_available You don't want him to be defensive.
not_available Right.
not_available I'd do it over a meal.
not_available Oh, like a chat.
not_available I like that.
not_available Makes sense.
not_available Oh, damn! Hey, Lucy? Could you get me a tampon from the thingy? Oh, I got one here.
not_available Damn it.
not_available There you go.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Peter, sorry I'm late.
not_available I was in the ER with an admission you need to see.
not_available The problem? 87year
not_available old male septic, with cholangitis.
not_available He's on mezlo and Flagyl.
not_available I got his pressure up with dopamine.
not_available He's too sick for open surgery.
not_available We'll do a decompression.
not_available I booked the O.R.
not_available Busy night last night? Oh, God, horrible! Twelve admissions, plus this one.
not_available I got an abdominal aortic aneurysm, stab wound to the chest fall from a second
not_available story balcony.
not_available They just kept coming.
not_available I worked 36
not_available hour shifts as an intern in England.
not_available This makes me realize how long ago that was.
not_available I'll take him down, and we'll round at 8, okay? Lovely.
not_available Gives me enough time for prerounds and a shower.
not_available You know, I bumped into David Kotlowitz an hour ago.
not_available He's a terrific ENT.
not_available He's done a lot of work with cochlear implants.
not_available Did you tell him about Reece? No, I just told him I had a friend in need of talk on the subject.
not_available Don't solicit medical advice on my behalf, all right? I worked with Kotlowitz.
not_available That's why I brought it up.
not_available Lf you'd rather I hadn't 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fine, forget about it.
not_available What is that? A sternal saw? 
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available What's it doing here? 
not_available My midline thoracotomy proposal sailed through the Human Subjects Committee.
not_available Nobody told me.
not_available Well, I'm certified to use it, so we're up and running.
not_available I thought we'd talk before it got underway.
not_available Surgeons use it on odd days ER docs get it on evens.
not_available Your turn's tomorrow.
not_available Hey, bad news.
not_available We're still not pregnant.
not_available We'll redouble our efforts.
not_available If it's more than three times a week we get diminishing returns.
not_available Like reusing the same tea bag.
not_available There's a romantic idea.
not_available Wasn't very romantic, was it? Doug? I've got a lethargic infant not eating.
not_available You better come see him.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Baby's name is Sun? Korean? Actually, it's Sun.
not_available His mom's a little different.
not_available All right, Mrs.
not_available Everly.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Can I take a look at Sun? I don't know what's wrong.
not_available He won't nurse.
not_available We'll figure it out.
not_available Hey, you his big sister? What's your name? 
not_available Sky.
not_available Hello, doctor.
not_available Well, hello, Sky.
not_available Sun and Sky, huh? He was fine until a few days ago.
not_available Then I noticed he wasn't nursing so well.
not_available Any solid foods or formula? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Only my milk.
not_available My breasts are engorged with him not eating.
not_available When was the last time he pooped? 
not_available Oh, man.
not_available When? 
not_available Yesterday morning.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yes, I haven't changed him since.
not_available We'll hydrate him.
not_available Give him We'll have to do blood tests.
not_available And I need your consent to do a spinal tap.
not_available You stick a needle into his spine? Won't that hurt? We'll sedate him, no pain.
not_available Mom, it's gonna be okay.
not_available Do you think so, honey? We'll be right back, okay? Get a CBC, Chem
not_available 20 and blood cultures.
not_available Can you assist with the LP? Sure, how do you sedate him? Propafol.
not_available I'll get it from Pedes.
not_available General anesthesia? Have we done that in the ER? First time for everything.
not_available I'll take the proper precautions.
not_available Yelling doesn't help! There's an ambulance out front.
not_available Thank God! 
not_available Don't open that door.
not_available Get away from me! Come on! Get away from me! Don't touch me! 
not_available Yes, hello.
not_available We got a 911 call.
not_available I called.
not_available She shouldn't have called.
not_available Get in here! Where's the injured man? 
not_available This is not an emergency.
not_available Everything's fine.
not_available I don't need the hospital.
not_available Your name? 
not_available Richard Weingarten.
not_available He let this lunatic drill a hole in his head.
not_available I'm an emergency physician.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available Okay, just sit down here.
not_available Sit down.
not_available What are you ashamed of? What happened? 
not_available It's called trepanation.
not_available It's a centuries
not_available old practice, a means of increasing brain blood volume.
not_available I had mine done in Amsterdam in 1968.
not_available Oh, God! It was like God lifted a weight from me.
not_available It's a surgical drill.
not_available We're going to the hospital.
not_available You can't take me against my will.
not_available I've studied this for years.
not_available I didn't embark on it lightly.
not_available Let us at least put a bandage on and get a blood pressure.
not_available Okay, sir, just sign this.
not_available It says you refuse treatment.
not_available Go to the rig and get some saline.
not_available Come on, Rich.
not_available We did it.
not_available The Internet! That's what started this whole thing! Laura! I hate it! 
not_available Get her outside.
not_available I hate it! What are you doing? Outside! I don't want to go! 
not_available Calm down! I'll have you brought up on charges.
not_available I want to go back inside! You're an intelligent person.
not_available I don't want to take you against your will.
not_available I had to do something.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Doesn't look like you penetrated the dura.
not_available All I want to do is put a sterile dressing on to clean the wound.
not_available I'll leave you some saline and gauze so you or your friend, can keep it clean.
not_available I forgot to bring any gauze.
not_available I've held enough screaming babies to know.
not_available They have to be sedated.
not_available Doug? How you doing? You can't administer propafol to an infant.
not_available You've done it upstairs for 10 years.
not_available You're not an anesthesiologist.
not_available I didn't think you'd have a problem.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available I have him on a cardiac monitor, pulse ox, dynamap and a crash cart.
not_available You cannot just make up policy as you go along.
not_available I'm trying to prevent pain, do what's best for this boy.
not_available If you want to discuss policy, leave.
not_available We'll do it later.
not_available We will.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, want to grab lunch later? Let's see.
not_available Tell me about this patient in Curtain 3.
not_available Thirtyyear
not_available old male with pain on urination.
not_available The UA is negative for white cells.
not_available Chlamydia.
not_available Do a sexual history? He had two partners last year, and used condoms.
not_available So he claims.
not_available Send up a DNA probe and treat empirically.
not_available Treatment for chlamydia? Doxycycline BID, or a dose of Zithromax.
not_available You should look at his chart 
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need to ask, do you always use condoms? Pretty much, yeah.
not_available There's times where you haven't? Once or twice maybe, yeah.
not_available That's all it takes.
not_available We're gonna give you antibiotics.
not_available I think you have a common infection called chlamydia.
not_available What, VD? Sexually transmitted disease, yes.
not_available She doesn't think so.
not_available He also had conjunctivitis and arthralgias at the knee and ankle.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bussey, excuse us for a moment.
not_available He was in Mexico and had diarrhea.
not_available The timing and symptoms are classic for Reiter's.
not_available You could've included that.
not_available You cut me off.
not_available You could've said, "Reiter's." 
not_available I didn't get a word in.
not_available You I'm always doing what? 
not_available Like now, you're defensive.
not_available You don't even hear me.
not_available So, what's the treatment for Reiter's Syndrome? Indomethacin.
not_available We can still send off for chlamydia 
not_available No, you're right.
not_available It's Reiter's.
not_available Good pickup, Lucy.
not_available Propafol is ideal for use in the ER.
not_available First of all, onset is immediate, and it wears off in Don't you think a doctor should be trained? Got a gunshot to the chest coming.
not_available The saw is sterilized in Trauma 1.
not_available We need to be ready if this guy qualifies.
not_available You'll document 10 critical times.
not_available Clock starts when? Soon as the patient enters.
not_available Don't they need to have cardiac arrest? He sounded okay.
not_available Patients can deteriorate en route.
not_available Fortysixyear
not_available old man shot with a BB gun.
not_available Hemodynamically stable.
not_available A BB gun? The punk who shot me needs to be put under the jail.
not_available Ten years old or not.
not_available Let me up off of this, I can walk.
not_available Let him go.
not_available Doesn't need a thoracotomy.
not_available No, a tetanus shot and a Band
not_available Aid.
not_available You can follow me, sir.
not_available Want to turn around, or can we hang? 
not_available No, take 10 minutes.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available What's going on? Just doing a quick blood draw.
not_available So how's the clinic going today? Oh, I just love prenatal days.
not_available Takes me back to my OB roots.
not_available Why don't you let a nurse do that? Because I was trying to be discreet.
not_available Let me do it.
not_available It's kind of hard to stick yourself.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What labs you need? Just a CBC, check if I'm anemic.
not_available Oh, I only ask because if you'd like I can run the results through the clinic.
not_available Be more private.
not_available That's a great idea.
not_available What I'd really like is to check my hormone levels.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Infertility workup? 
not_available I don't want to discuss details.
not_available I wasn't trying to It'd be great if you run it through the clinic.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mark, glad I caught you.
not_available I've had to move my surgical schedule.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee's interview is pushed to 1:30.
not_available Is that a problem? 
not_available No, that's fine.
not_available Have you looked at her CV? 
not_available Impressive.
not_available If she's half as impressive in person, she might be our next Chief.
not_available And not a moment too soon.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, I didn't think you were gonna be around.
not_available I was on a paramedic ride
not_available along, and we brought in a patient.
not_available So, you finish your student evaluation yet? I thought I had till the shift ends? No big deal, this afternoon's fine.
not_available I wrote an evaluation for Lucy but I tore it up because I want to be fair.
not_available You put something on paper that'll impact her life.
not_available Just evaluate her work.
not_available What are you talking about? I'm talking about your porn
not_available star name.
not_available Take your pet's name and your mother's maiden name.
not_available Try it.
not_available Like mine is Rex Voytek.
not_available Oh, I know that game.
not_available But it's your drag name, not porn.
not_available Drag name? 
not_available Yeah, the name of your pet and the street you're born on.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available RuPaul had it on her show.
not_available Leave some crumbs for the rest of us.
not_available Are you the cookie police? 
not_available Have some but I brought those for the docs and nurses.
not_available So you're the cookie fairy.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Bad enough you raid the icebox, now you want to call names? Conni, you begrudge us some juice? It's not like you bring anything in.
not_available You should thank me for the cookie I keep from your fat snack hole.
not_available You just keep talking, Morales.
not_available Hey, what's going on? 
not_available That one's got a problem.
not_available You antagonizing them? 
not_available He called Yosh a fairy.
not_available I called him the cookie fairy.
not_available It was a dumb joke.
not_available A real dumb joke.
not_available Ready to head back? Yeah, let's go.
not_available I got no problem with him being a bone
not_available smoker.
not_available I was joking like I would with anybody.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available Write the discharge orders soon.
not_available Bed Control likes them by 12 noon.
not_available Yes, I am aware of that.
not_available I told you I'd have a hard time seeing you as my intern.
not_available It's complicated for a lot of reasons.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, Mr.
not_available Frybush's creatinine is much higher.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shall we call a renal consult? Yeah, this guy needs dialysis.
not_available So did you ever get that shower? 
not_available No, can you tell? Well, go ahead.
not_available I'll cover SICU.
not_available I don't want special treatment.
not_available Turning down a shower? 
not_available I've got a lot of work.
not_available Okay, have it your way.
not_available Gotta go find Weaver.
not_available She's itching to use that saw.
not_available Going to the roach coach.
not_available Want something? Yes, a triple espresso.
not_available Thank you, Kit.
not_available Elizabeth? How would you like to scrub in on a bilateral adrenalectomy? Oh, I appreciate the offer, but I'm postcall.
not_available I gotta finish my work, and I have to catch up on sleep.
not_available A case like this comes once in a blue moon.
not_available I'm up to my neck in ER garbage, but I'm not passing this up.
not_available Well, it's been a while since my last adrenalectomy.
not_available I'll do right, you do left.
not_available I can get Dr.
not_available Kennedy to cover your service.
not_available Jeanie? The baby's spinal tap came back negative for meningitis.
not_available What's going on? A lot.
not_available We got to talk to the mom.
not_available I'll take Sky out of the room.
not_available She doesn't need to hear all this.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Her mom leans on her a lot, don't you think? 
not_available A smart kid, though.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available What did you find? 
not_available Spinal tap was negative.
not_available I have more questions.
not_available Maybe Jeanie and Sky could take a walk.
not_available I don't want to worry about her wandering.
not_available I'd rather stay here with Mom.
not_available Can she help me put some toys away while you talk? It's a good idea.
not_available Mind helping me? 
not_available I don't mind.
not_available I'll be right back, Mom.
not_available See what toys we can find.
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay, we need to see if we can figure out the cause of Sun's deterioration.
not_available Now, has he had a polio vaccine? 
not_available Oh, God, polio! He was vaccinated.
not_available Is that effective? Do you have a doll at home? 
not_available No.
not_available No, really? I had one.
not_available Dolls are for babies.
not_available I'm a big girl.
not_available And how old are you? 
not_available Six.
not_available Six.
not_available After the adrenal vein, we'll work our way around the medial and inferior edges of the gland.
not_available Cut, please.
not_available And another tie.
not_available Elizabeth, cut.
not_available Elizabeth? Sorry.
not_available Yes.
not_available You do need a rest.
not_available Why don't you step out? No, I'm fine.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Go take a nap.
not_available Sorry I dragged you along.
not_available Dr.
not_available Goodman? Can I run something by you? 
not_available Make it quick.
not_available Male with aphasia and arm weakness.
not_available CT scan was normal.
not_available Spinal fluid is clear.
not_available I'm thinking vasculitis or MS? Send off a sed rate and a complement level in the CSF.
not_available Look at the differential.
not_available May be some zebras you haven't considered.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, Yosh, is that Lucy's palmtop? I love this.
not_available She let me borrow it.
not_available Can I use it? When you're done.
not_available I'm done.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Know how to work it? 
not_available Yeah, Lucy showed me once.
not_available I'd hoped to avoid this.
not_available But things haven't improved.
not_available I don't know how I'm supposed to learn in this hostile environment.
not_available Our relationship has turned completely adversarial and it's not good for the patients.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available This crazy bastard lets Dr.
not_available Greene Iook inside the hole with a penlight.
not_available Unbelievable! 
not_available I thought I'd seen it all.
not_available Doc writes him a scrip for antibiotics.
not_available The guy thanks us for coming.
not_available Yeah, I've got a way with ranting lunatics.
not_available I ain't kidding.
not_available You do.
not_available Hey, what's up, guys? 
not_available We're all here.
not_available You're not on today.
not_available Truth is, they're here because we got you something.
not_available You like it? 
not_available It's great.
not_available You're one of the gang now.
not_available Almost.
not_available Almost? There's something every paramedic does.
not_available It's only appropriate that you do too.
not_available How many patients have you brought in strapped to a backboard with a collar? What do you have in mind? Come over to the table, we'll show you.
not_available As a part of our training, we all get on the board ourselves.
not_available You want me to lie on the board.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We all did it.
not_available Comes with the coat.
not_available Gotta drop your pants.
not_available No, he doesn't! Forget about that part, guys.
not_available All right? Forget it.
not_available I have to get back to the hospital.
not_available Then don't fight.
not_available Just lie down.
not_available Come on.
not_available Relax, guys, back off.
not_available Let him do it on his own.
not_available You want me to lie down.
not_available There.
not_available There you go.
not_available Get him! Got the shower on? Come on, the shower's on! 
not_available Get the shower! Stop it! Stop it! Take it easy, doc.
not_available Hey, guys, guys.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let him up.
not_available Let him up.
not_available We weren't gonna hurt you.
not_available Much.
not_available It's all over for now.
not_available Jer, know what your name is as a porn star? That game is tired.
not_available I've got the best, Satan Monroe.
not_available Your mother's maiden name is Satan? 
not_available Carol, I need you.
not_available What's wrong? Young woman complains of severe right lower quadrant pain.
not_available Pregnancy test positive, a possible ectopic.
not_available Name? 
not_available Maria Jones.
not_available Five pregnancies.
not_available Two live births, two abortions.
not_available Hi, Maria.
not_available We're gonna take care of you.
not_available It hurts, it hurts! 
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get a CBC, Beta HCG, Chem
not_available 20.
not_available Type and cross two units, and start a line of saline.
not_available Did you do a pelvic? 
not_available No, she's in too much pain.
not_available She said I'm pregnant.
not_available Is my baby okay? Okay.
not_available Let's do an ultrasound while we're at it.
not_available It just hurts so bad! Okay, you're gonna be fine.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available We were just about to start without you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee, Mark Greene.
not_available Sorry if I held things up.
not_available I'll try not to take it personally.
not_available You've been flexible with your time.
not_available We appreciate it.
not_available I'm happy to be here.
not_available Let's get right to it.
not_available "Three years as associate chief.
not_available Excellence in Clinical Teaching Award two years in a row." How do you think you can improve our department? You could benefit from an eightbed observation unit for 23
not_available hour stays.
not_available Paid for how? We're a cash
not_available poor county hospital.
not_available That's why you need it.
not_available Tell us more.
not_available I set up a unit like it in Atlanta.
not_available And it saved the hospital $2 million a year in unnecessary admissions.
not_available What kind of patients are we talking about? 
not_available Lucy, take this.
not_available What is it? Your evaluation.
not_available It's blank.
not_available You fill it out since you think I'm so adversarial.
not_available And keep track of this before someone walks away with it.
not_available You listened to my notes? You're so sure I'd give you a bad evaluation you're planning a countermove.
not_available A hostile workplace? I didn't know it's time for evaluation.
not_available Please.
not_available Why'd you want to have lunch? To get things out in the open.
not_available Well, they're out in the open.
not_available Why don't you fill that out, and let's see how fair
not_available minded you can be.
not_available How long will they be upstairs? 
not_available Not much longer.
not_available What was the name of the doll you had? 
not_available Baby.
not_available Was Baby a boy or a girl? She wasn't a boy or a girl.
not_available She didn't have a penis or a vagina.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Letting him lick the spoon.
not_available Does your brother lick the spoon? Sometimes, with things that he likes.
not_available Like what? Yogurt? 
not_available Sun doesn't like yogurt.
not_available What does he like? 
not_available Lots of things.
not_available Does he like honey? Your little brother licks honey off of your spoon? 
not_available He likes it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sky, let's go find your mom and Dr.
not_available Ross, okay? Okay.
not_available I like the observation unit idea.
not_available Good.
not_available Very good presentation.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd be happy to give you a tour of the ER.
not_available I don't need to be hand
not_available held.
not_available But I do want to walk around.
not_available Feel free.
not_available I'll catch up with you.
not_available It's a pleasure.
not_available Mark, do you like her? 
not_available She's good.
not_available You didn't say much.
not_available Didn't think you're impressed.
not_available I'd like to continue this in a less formal setting.
not_available I'll see if she can come for dinner.
not_available Would you be? 
not_available I can't tonight.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Are you feeling better? 
not_available A little bit.
not_available Going to the bathroom helped, huh? Maybe it was just gas pains.
not_available You haven't had any bleeding, which is good.
not_available You're further along than we thought.
not_available Looks like 15 weeks.
not_available I wasn't even sure I was pregnant.
not_available Look.
not_available Can you tell? Is it a boy or a girl? Can't say for sure.
not_available It looks like a girl.
not_available After having two boys, that'd be nice.
not_available Well, I don't see a penis.
not_available You can't always tell on an ultrasound.
not_available You'll have to come back make sure she stays healthy.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available Come on, Corday.
not_available Pull yourself together.
not_available It's just a few more hours to go.
not_available Elizabeth, can you do me a favor? Watch the service? I've gotta see Dr.
not_available Kotlowitz.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah, I ran into him.
not_available Actually, I went looking for him.
not_available Peter, that's terrific.
not_available Yes, go! 
not_available I can cover service.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I need orders on a new admission.
not_available I'm not in the mood for jokes.
not_available No, Mr.
not_available Ramos is back.
not_available Ramos? Fem
not_available pop bypass? I discharged him yesterday.
not_available He's back with an infection and an asthma attack.
not_available You know the rules.
not_available Yep, I know.
not_available He's mine.
not_available He's on continuous albuterol.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Ramos.
not_available Let's take a look at your legs.
not_available I was hoping you'd be here today.
not_available Oh, where else would I possibly go? I asked the mom if she'd given the baby food.
not_available Guess I talked to the wrong person.
not_available The baby's lucky.
not_available We can treat botulism.
not_available But what do we do to help Sky? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Her mom's draining her childhood.
not_available As much neglect and abuse as I see, trust me, Sky is okay.
not_available She needs to be a little girl.
not_available Yeah, that's true.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available Okay, now you can't give honey to your brother or to any baby because it can hurt them.
not_available Honey can have botulism spores.
not_available Their intestines are immature, and they can't kill off the spores.
not_available He's maxed out with a pressure of 65.
not_available Systemic resistance is 3500.
not_available Let's start Levophed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, I need you here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ramos is pretty tight.
not_available You okay? Yep, I'm fine.
not_available How much albuterol? 
not_available Twenty an hour.
not_available He's had Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available 125 in the ER.
not_available Okay, I'll push some magnesium.
not_available Magnesium? It relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchioles.
not_available Can you look at Mr.
not_available Frybush? Give me five minutes, okay? Carter, can you explain this evaluation? If it's this bad, you should've come to me.
not_available Do you have something against her? Wait a sec 
not_available I want to see you and Lucy.
not_available We're gonna figure this out.
not_available Find her and then me.
not_available Can I hang on to that? 
not_available No! Sound like you're in a good mood.
not_available Do me a favor? I need a place to crash.
not_available Building's being fumigated.
not_available Would Carol mind? 
not_available You kidding? Come over.
not_available Save me a few bucks.
not_available Sure thing, glad to have you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He's set up for another four hours of continuous.
not_available Magnesium's on board.
not_available How are you feeling, Mr.
not_available Ramos? 
not_available Dizzy.
not_available Whoa.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Maybe he's hypoxic.
not_available How much mag did you give him? 
not_available Two grams IV push, 40 cc's.
not_available Forty cc's of 50 percent mag? Not 50 percent! Five percent! No, Dr.
not_available Corday, you gave him 50 percent.
not_available My God, you're right.
not_available I gave him a lethal dose.
not_available He's not breathing.
not_available ET tube! Bradying down.
not_available Heart rate's 30.
not_available Two grams calcium gluconate.
not_available Push an amp of atropine.
not_available Bag him, prep for IJ.
not_available I'll float a pacemaker.
not_available Lost the pulse, in P.E.A.
not_available I'll start compressions.
not_available Seven and a half gloves and The cochlear implant is a miracle, and the technology keeps improving.
not_available I'm impressed by what I read.
not_available Don't read.
not_available Talk to people who have it.
not_available Talk to parents of kids I can get you in touch with people who faced the same.
not_available Great, I've already heard an earful from the opponents, so The fanatics.
not_available Well, they've got their agendas.
not_available The level of passion with which these people attack you, it's bizarre.
not_available Someone used the word "genocidal." Said I was eradicating deaf culture.
not_available Deafness is not an alternative lifestyle.
not_available People who claim it is are beyond reasoning with.
not_available The thing I figure is why make an argument against hearing and speaking? Honestly, know what I think? I think it comes down to laziness.
not_available A deaf person can function.
not_available But some people don't want to exercise and do all the drills it takes.
not_available Look, it's years of hard work.
not_available Yeah, but they have the energy to attack me.
not_available The hell with them.
not_available Don't stand in my way when I'm trying to help a person function.
not_available Why don't you tell me how you really feel? Anyway, you bring in your son and we'll see if he's a candidate.
not_available Do you work closely with Dr.
not_available Corday? Actually, she's my intern.
not_available She told me about the fallout with Rocket Romano.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Do you know if she's seeing anybody? I'm just wondering.
not_available I'm pretty sure she's involved with somebody.
not_available I'm not surprised.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, well.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You bet, anytime.
not_available Give me a call.
not_available Check, please.
not_available Systolic, 60 palp.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We've got capture.
not_available Turning the rate down to 80.
not_available Did you page Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available Done.
not_available Pulse is stronger.
not_available Good.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available That could be the atropine.
not_available That, or he stroked out.
not_available What happened? I gave him enough magnesium to cause a cardiac arrest.
not_available Twenty grams.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I looked at the label.
not_available I thought it said 5 percent but it was 50 percent.
not_available But I looked at the label.
not_available I got your blood work back.
not_available Thanks, Lynette.
not_available Progesterone level's normal.
not_available That's good news, you ovulated.
not_available I've been trying to get pregnant, and I haven't.
not_available How long have you been at it? 
not_available Couple months.
not_available Give yourself at least six months before you start worrying.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available I'm crazy.
not_available Maybe you guys need to increase your activity.
not_available How often do you, you know, do the do? What? 
not_available Oh, sorry, am I being indiscreet? Carol, what's the deal? I went to see your ectopic.
not_available She's dressed, ready to leave.
not_available Maria Jones? 
not_available She pulled her IV? Maria, where are you going? I feel better.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available You were in so much pain, I couldn't examine you.
not_available But I'm better now.
not_available But, wait.
not_available We need to make sure everything's okay with you.
not_available Just let the doctor look you over.
not_available Look, I just wanted to know if it was a boy or a girl.
not_available Nothing's wrong, so why worry? Wait! You were faking those abdominal pains? Are you crazy? 
not_available You weren't sure you were pregnant.
not_available Why would you lie and cause all that drama to find out if it's a boy or a? No, are you gonna abort this baby? Let go of me! Carol! 
not_available She's had two boys and two abortions.
not_available Are you getting rid of this child? It's my baby and I'll do what I want.
not_available I told you that ultrasound is inconclusive.
not_available It could be a boy! Lady, take your hands off of me.
not_available Carol, let her go.
not_available Girls are trouble anyhow.
not_available What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you?! How could you inject a patient with 20 grams of magnesium? I make no excuses.
not_available It was a grievous error.
not_available Where were you during this, Dr.
not_available Benton? I was out of the hospital.
not_available I came when I was paged.
not_available It wouldn't have mattered, anyway.
not_available You left your intern unsupervised.
not_available This patient may have suffered brain injury.
not_available I stopped by the unit.
not_available Mr.
not_available Ramos' eyes are open, and he's responding.
not_available You are not to leave while on duty.
not_available You are not to leave your intern unsupervised.
not_available I know it's hard for us all to view Elizabeth as an intern.
not_available But we've opened up this hospital to enormous liability.
not_available I'll speak to Risk Management and the hospital attorneys.
not_available They'll determine what information to release to the families.
not_available Don't either of you discuss this with anyone.
not_available Can we get together and not talk about this? I have to pick up my son from my sister's house.
not_available All right.
not_available You just need to get a good night's sleep.
not_available I didn't fill this out.
not_available Who did? 
not_available She did.
not_available Why did she? 
not_available Because he told me to.
not_available I didn't say to give it to him, I said to give it to me.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available Okay, wait.
not_available Don't talk to each other, talk to me.
not_available Mark, I wanted to know how she thought she was doing before my final assessment.
not_available I tried to put myself in his shoes and be critical.
not_available He said, "fill it out" meaning "turn it in." 
not_available How could she assume that? Makes no sense.
not_available That's part of his problem.
not_available Incomplete directions.
not_available I give incomplete directions? 
not_available Name a time.
not_available Just one? Tell her to name a time when I gave her incomplete directions.
not_available Okay, talk to each other.
not_available Don't talk to me.
not_available Whatever this is, I can't fix it.
not_available Work it out, both of you.
not_available Kerry, I need to talk to you about the x
not_available ray report.
not_available Please don't blow me off.
not_available Sorry, trauma coming in.
not_available Possible candidate for the thoracotomy study.
not_available I didn't know that's running.
not_available Stab wound to left chest.
not_available Had a pulse in the field.
not_available Gave him epi, 1500 cc's of saline.
not_available Shocked him twice.
not_available Great candidate.
not_available The stopwatch? Right here.
not_available You mind if I tag along? Now, start the timer.
not_available Here we go.
not_available On my 
count One, two, three! Two units of O
not_available neg on the infuser.
not_available Get type
not_available specific as soon as you can.

not_available Seven and a half gloves.
not_available Okay, skin incision is complete.

not_available Dr.
not_available Lee.
not_available Finding your way around? Yes, thanks.
not_available I wanted to ask you.
not_available I didn't feel I connected with you at my interview.
not_available Is that a correct assessment? 
not_available How do you mean? I'd look over and wonder, "Am I making my best case?" It was a good interview I like this department and I want this job.
not_available I'm one of the baddest ER bitches out there.
not_available If I didn't make my best case before, I'd like to try again now.
not_available Can I grab a soda and sit with you? Yeah, sure.
not_available Call me when he's in Recovery.
not_available Don, I have something to confess.
not_available Oh? For a while I felt resentment when it became clear I wasn't your choice to run the Emergency Department full
not_available time.
not_available It's not that you weren't qualified 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Now I am so grateful to be putting all of myself into medicine.
not_available And I want you to know there are no lingering hard feelings on my part.
not_available Well, I must say I could sense the bad feelings.
not_available I did wish there was something I could do because I value your friendship.
not_available Well, how's the job search going? We interviewed a wonderful woman.
not_available Amanda Lee, out of Atlanta.
not_available I don't know her.
not_available Join us for dinner? I'd love to hear what you think.
not_available Don, I'm trying.
not_available But I'm not all the way there yet.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Isn't it weird living with your boss? No, we get along okay.
not_available Plus, it's a bargain.
not_available All I have to do is some yard work, clean the gutters.
not_available Do the stuff that she can't handle.
not_available Roxanne, if you make me forget this day I will owe you the biggest favor.
not_available Lousy day, huh? 
not_available My med student is driving me crazy.
not_available Lucy.
not_available There's so much I want to teach her.
not_available And it's just not happening.
not_available I don't think I'm a bad teacher.
not_available I don't think she's a bad student.
not_available You know what? I can say one good thing about Lucy.
not_available She's not here.
not_available Oh, you make a good point.
not_available Didn't mean to put you to work.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available It's gonna be nice.
not_available Want some more? 
not_available No, no.
not_available It was good, though.
not_available Hey, who's making all that noise? What's up, man? Come on.
not_available Let's get ready to go, huh? Come on, say goodbye to Aunt Jackie.
not_available Jackie, who gave him this phone? Oh, it's a toy, Peter.
not_available It's a cute shape, and he likes it.
not_available He probably saw you on it all day.
not_available Hey, hey! I'm sorry.
not_available You know, we went to a surgeon today.
not_available I'm trying to do what's best, and I feel like I'm in a battlefield.
not_available The more information I get, the less I know.
not_available I don't have anybody to talk with.
not_available What about Carla? Yeah, she's looking for me to take the lead on this thing.
not_available I can't go back and forth over it with her.
not_available Your girlfriend's a doctor.
not_available Why can't you talk with Elizabeth? 
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Peter? 
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Peter? Come on.
not_available Hey, man.
