
not_available Previously on ER Get the gurney, Conni! She has bruising around her groin.
not_available She may have been raped.
not_available I'd be lucky to find someone like you.
not_available You neglected your duties.
not_available You feel that way, speak to me.
not_available You feel Dr.
not_available Benton's reaction was inappropriate? I wouldn't call it inappropriate.
not_available Administration's making me fire two nurses.
not_available I didn't think you'd go to Anspaugh.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Man versus El train.
not_available Suicide? Dennis? It's Gant! Oh, sweet Jesus! Carter, put the tube in! 
not_available Oh, God! What happened? I guess that's the question.
not_available How could this awful, senseless thing happen? I've seen traumas from plenty of accidents since I started my training.
not_available But this was someone I knew.
not_available You're convinced it was an accident? 
not_available I guess.
not_available Have the police? I don't think they've come to any conclusions.
not_available Either he lost his balance and fell under the tracks or he jumped.
not_available I understand that you and Dr.
not_available Gant were friends? Roommates? Well, we hadn't seen much of each other for the last month.
not_available I was seeing somebody, and I was staying over at her place a lot.
not_available Obviously, the hospital is interested in finding out if anything could have been done to prevent this tragedy.
not_available You mean if it were a suicide? We're both aware of the complaint about Dr.
not_available Benton Dennis lodged on the day of his death.
not_available In your judgment was this day unique in Dr.
not_available Gant's experience or had he frequently felt he was treated unfairly? We both complained.
not_available About the hours, the Residents That's what I thought it was, venting.
not_available I know Dennis had bad days But what I'm asking is if anyone or anything put undue pressure on Dr.
not_available Gant.
not_available A policy, a teaching method, anything that seems, in retrospect, too harsh.
not_available I'll have to think about that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gant's father is arriving this afternoon to collect his things and bring the body back home to Atlanta.
not_available I hope you'll be able to accompany Mr.
not_available Gant to the apartment.
not_available Oh, my God, John.
not_available I couldn't believe it.
not_available A shocker.
not_available Think he pulled a Cobain? Dale.
not_available Well, if they do rule it a suicide, maybe we'll get some shorter hours.
not_available Dennis said something at Christmas about his girlfriend but if he were depressed, you'd have noticed.
not_available Yeah, I would've.
not_available It's the ER.
not_available I thought you had the ER yesterday.
not_available I'm covering Dennis' shift.
not_available I need 8 units of O
not_available neg.

not_available Respiratory's alerted.
not_available I'll set up a vent.

not_available Where are they? I'll check the ETA.
not_available Did you get my message about the memorial service? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available I was wondering if you could say a few words.
not_available Talking about the memorial? It's 5:00 in the chapel, right? 
not_available Man, I still can't believe it.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Here comes the groom.

not_available Hey, Lily? More blood for the bride! Any exam rooms open for our best man here? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available How are Duke and Katria? 
not_available I'm taking you for an abdominal CT.
not_available Pressure's dropping! He's crashing! Damn it! Take that! Two units O
not_available neg onboard.
not_available My guy just bottomed out.
not_available Want me to hold your hand? There's no room! 
not_available Figure it out.

not_available It's coming.
not_available Start pushing, Malik! Where we going? 
not_available Trauma 2.
not_available Scoot over! Make room! To the right! To the right! Get a centralline kit, an intubation tray, and start pushing the O

not_available Forty palp.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get a central

not_available Ours.
not_available He's arrested.
not_available All right.
not_available Thoracotomy tray! Let's move! Come on! You want to watch your elbows? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available I missed you last night.
not_available How's your cold? It's better.
not_available Thanks for the roses.
not_available You like them? I love them.
not_available Here.
not_available Man, you are spoiling me, know that? Something wrong? 
not_available Oh, you know.
not_available All this union stuff.
not_available It'll be a weird day for the nurses.
not_available So is this sickout gonna happen? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Does it bother you that I told you? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available We're still on for tonight? Movie, dinner? It's a date.
not_available It's fractured.
not_available How's that pressure dressing? 
not_available Looks like we stopped the bleeding.

not_available You want to take this guy up? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You do the body, I'll do the room? 
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm a little short
not_available handed this afternoon.
not_available A lot of my nurses are calling in sick.
not_available Is there any way you could pull a double? Sorry.
not_available Can you give us a hand in here? Go on.
not_available I'll get this.
not_available The memorial service is gonna be in the hospital chapel.
not_available You wouldn't need to say much.
not_available Just Forget it.
not_available I'm no public speaker.
not_available There's still no official ruling on the cause of death.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh says the police are still talking to witnesses.
not_available Maybe they'll turn up something.
not_available When did you speak to Anspaugh? This morning.
not_available He called in the interns.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why? To see how we're doing.
not_available To see what we think happened.
not_available Were there interns on the platform? I think he was wondering about Gant's state of mind these last couple weeks.
not_available Did he call you guys in one at a time or all together? One at a time.
not_available Hasn't Anspaugh talked to you yet? I'm supposed to go talk to him.
not_available I guess he needs to do a survey first.
not_available GSW to the abdomen.
not_available Who's on call? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available I don't think anybody's blaming you.
not_available Why would they? Did you finish your rounds this morning? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Get to it.
not_available I can finish this myself.
not_available She'll stay on a 72
not_available hour hold while we finish her psychiatric evaluation.
not_available Steer clear.
not_available You're too entangled.
not_available I'm her doctor.
not_available And her guardian angel, and the guy who let her down.
not_available Is she pissed? 
not_available At you? Yeah, sure.
not_available You told her you wouldn't sell her into the system, and you did.
not_available But betrayal isn't anything new to her.
not_available She's a 14year
not_available old on the streets.
not_available You don't have to explain it to me.
not_available Or to her.
not_available Another doc could follow up on her neuro exam.
not_available You knew I'd be back.
not_available She's a kid you helped, who hates your guts.
not_available You want to change that.
not_available What's Charlie's prognosis? She's got issues, but I won't recommend a psychiatric placement.
not_available DCFS will take over from here.
not_available But it wouldn't be a problem for her if I see her? Charlie's armor is in good shape.
not_available How is yours? What are you doing this afternoon? 
not_available Lydia and I are hitting the sales.
not_available I'm not spending a penny until our contract is settled.
not_available It'll settle.
not_available Nothing like the pink flu to make a point.
not_available I've never been on a strike.
not_available I hope you never will be.
not_available This is just a sickout.
not_available The pink flu.
not_available Close your ears, E
not_available Ray.
not_available I'm a union man.
not_available One shift without RNs will make them think twice about cutting overtime.
not_available I'm worried about the patients.
not_available We all are.
not_available That's why we won't accept a contract that compromises patient care.
not_available Or screws us.
not_available That too.
not_available Could you help me with this damn coffeemaker? See? What would they do without us RNs? You should be taking tea and lemon for that cold.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available I hate to see her fall.
not_available I tried to warn her.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Greene's a nice guy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene's a doctor, on the rebound.
not_available How many nurse/doctor flings have you known? Including my own? And how many of them worked out? The problem is, she's got a grand trine in fire, and his sun is in Pisces.
not_available Labs are back from Curtain 3.
not_available They're mine.
not_available Haleh, can you pull a double? When? 
not_available Today.
not_available My entire p.m.
not_available Shift called in sick.
not_available I heard something was going around.
not_available Something is going around.
not_available Can you stay? I'm sorry.
not_available I'm coming down with it myself.
not_available I just want to check on your concussion.
not_available It's only gonna take a second.
not_available Come here.
not_available Sit around.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sit up.
not_available I want you to look into the light.
not_available Okay? Come here.
not_available Follow this just with your eyes, not your head.
not_available It looks like the swelling went down.
not_available Follow the light with your eyes, not your head.
not_available How's your head? Any confusion? What year is it? December '95, according to this hot magazine you gave me.
not_available Did you know Michael and Lisa Marie are splitting up? What was I supposed to do? Let you go back out on the street? Like I haven't been beaten worse when I lived at home.
not_available You having any trouble seeing? I get these little blobs.
not_available What kind of blobs? Open your eye.
not_available Dark spots floating around.
not_available Any flashes of light? Sometimes when you get a blow to the head there's retinal detachment.
not_available An ophthalmologist will look at it.
not_available In the meantime, lay back down, okay? Just when I thought things couldn't get more boring.
not_available If I go blind, can they still send me to the nut house? 
not_available That's not where you're going.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Then just to jail.
not_available You're going somewhere so you'll be safe.
not_available I should've lied and said I wasn't raped.
not_available That's why you locked me up.
not_available You're on a hold for your own good.
not_available Like it was my fault.
not_available I should've just said it was sex.
not_available It's not like there's much of a difference.
not_available Like any of it matters.
not_available Don't let them put me in a home.
not_available I won't.
not_available Nobody's gonna hurt you.
not_available Please.
not_available Guess.
not_available No more roses! I mean, I love the roses.
not_available They were beautiful.
not_available It's not roses.
not_available It's a beauty.
not_available This thing must've cost you.
not_available Try it on.
not_available You're gonna need it come spring.
not_available I thought we could go to the Upper Peninsula.
not_available It's only January.
not_available What says we can't plan ahead? 
not_available My last 10 relationships.
not_available Nurse's Admin is coming down to discuss What are you rebelling against? 
not_available What have you got? Weaver, without a chart, in Curtain 3.
not_available I got distracted.
not_available All his fault.
not_available Does Admin want to discuss our situation? You mean the nurses' sickout? That's what it is.
not_available Would you stay and help me out? 
not_available The nurses have to stick together.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available And a manager.
not_available Don't ask me to break ranks.
not_available It's too hard to say no to you.
not_available She's great.
not_available Heard from Susan? If you think I'm reacting to Susan leaving, you're completely wrong.
not_available I'm completely wrong.
not_available Picked this guy up at the airport shuttle.
not_available He's diaphoretic.
not_available Temp's 103.
not_available BP's 70/50.
not_available Vomited three times en route.
not_available Diarrhea too.
not_available You don't want to go near my rig.
not_available Find Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Okay, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available One liter of saline.
not_available Pulse/ox is 98 percent on 5 liters.
not_available Temp's 103.6.
not_available Five of Compazine and Tylenol, 10
not_available grain suppository.
not_available Mix a dopamine drip.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available He was picked up at the airport.
not_available Departing or arriving? 
not_available Here.
not_available Let me check.
not_available Cap refill's poor.
not_available Let's get a CBC, Chem
not_available 7, urine C &amp; S, chest film.
not_available According to his ticket, Mr.
not_available Hecht just flew in from Paris.
not_available His original point of departure was Libreville.
not_available Where's that? 
not_available Gabon, West Africa.
not_available Everybody get masks on.
not_available I'll mask the patient.
not_available What are you thinking? I'd like to get a consult from Infectious Disease.
not_available Isn't Gabon where they found the Ebola virus? Let's set up an isolation room.
not_available Keep caregivers down to a minimum.
not_available I'll stay with Mr.
not_available Hecht.
not_available I started the case.
not_available How'd it go? Best man pull through? Lost his spleen.
not_available I finished my rounds.
not_available Did you want me to take Dennis patients? No.
not_available I'll do them.
not_available You know, I bumped into Dr.
not_available Morgenstern.
not_available He told me the police have ruled Dennis' death an accident.
not_available Is that what you think it was? 
not_available It's easier for everyone For his family.
not_available Easier on everyone.
not_available But that doesn't mean it's true.
not_available Why do you care what I think? Because we knew Dennis better than anybody.
not_available I'm not your friend Keaton.
not_available I know she'd hash it over with you.
not_available But you know that's not me.
not_available Peter? There you are.
not_available When it rains, it pours.
not_available Dissecting aneurysm coming down from ICU.
not_available Care to join me? I'd love to.
not_available Finished your rounds? 
not_available Yes, I have.
not_available He's covering the ER.
not_available That shouldn't stop you from joining us.
not_available If you get paged, you can leave.
not_available I'll tell you how to do your job, and we'll see how you take it.
not_available Charlie's not gonna do well in an institution.
not_available Norm agrees with me.
not_available I said if she gets a chance, she'll probably ditch out of a group setting.
not_available That's why I'm attempting to locate the mother.
not_available Good luck with that.
not_available She was last seen in Ohio over a year ago.
not_available You believe that? Charlie doesn't want us to find her.
not_available That's why she's not cooperating.
not_available Such a great mom.
not_available Even a bad mom can give consent.
not_available That's what you need for this kind of placement.
not_available If Charlie would cooperate in finding her other relatives in Cleveland she could be placed with them.
not_available She understands that? But I'm the enemy.
not_available I'll give it a shot if I'm not stepping on your toes.
not_available No, stomp away.
not_available We all want the same thing.
not_available Jeanie, this is Dr.
not_available Fischer from Infectious Disease.
not_available How's the patient? 
not_available He's defervescing.
not_available Lytes, chest x
not_available ray, urinalysis were all normal.
not_available He's been conscious off and on, but delirious.
not_available He confirmed he was working in Gabon.
not_available Some sort of land survey.
not_available I want a sed rate and an LP.
not_available Right away.
not_available And the airline? 
not_available Keep them on alert.
not_available But I want test results before they contact passengers.
not_available I hear hoof beats, but I haven't seen any zebras.
not_available You drew blood cultures? 
not_available Graft is holding, finally.
not_available Let's close.
not_available Carter, suction.
not_available Come on! Two
not_available 0 Prolene.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Let's wake up! Whole department's off today.
not_available Everyone's still in shock.
not_available Bovie.
not_available I'm sorry I didn't get to know Dr.
not_available Gant better.
not_available How was working with him? 
not_available It was too soon to say.
not_available More 2.
not_available He hadn't distinguished himself yet.
not_available Surprising, given his transcripts.
not_available He came with the highest recommendations.
not_available Maybe he was having adjustment problems.
not_available So you noticed him struggling? Gant wasn't prepared to handle an urban trauma center.
not_available Why'd you give him a positive report? Sorry? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available Why did you praise him for his improved technical skills and initiative in his second review? Perhaps at another time.
not_available I gave that review before some recent backsliding.
not_available I wasn't even aware he received that evaluation.
not_available He hadn't.
not_available It came today.
not_available You can be sure he never received any encouraging word from you.
not_available Candy, take over suction.
not_available You're excused.
not_available All he ever got from you was harping and criticism.
not_available And now he's dead, and you're gonna have to face it.
not_available My apologies, Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available You don't like the roses? 
not_available I love the roses.
not_available Just slow down.
not_available You don't have to impress me.
not_available I just passed the florist and thought about you.
not_available But in my family, if a man sends flowers twice in one week the only thing left is conversion to Catholicism, marriage and 7 kids.
not_available Should I look over my shoulder for your father with a shotgun? My brother Julio.
not_available He packs a.45.
not_available There you are.
not_available Looks like 100 percent participation.
not_available We have no nurses in one hour.
not_available This is Roger Drummond from Labor Relations.
not_available You know Mary Cain.
not_available Our attorneys are filing an injunction.
not_available An organized work stoppage is illegal under their contract.
not_available No one was actually stupid enough to admit to an organized sickout? 
not_available I hope only this shift's affected.
not_available We can't stay open without nurses.
not_available I've rounded up some private
not_available duty nurses.
not_available And also some nurse managers from other departments.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available I can come down myself.
not_available The extra bodies will help with non
not_available emergent cases.
not_available The hospital prefers not to cave.
not_available At least we should stay closed to trauma.
not_available I agree with Carol.
not_available Me too.
not_available All right.
not_available We close to trauma, 3:00 sharp.
not_available I'll call the paramedics, let them know to divert.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available No signs of retinal detachment.
not_available What about the blobs? 
not_available Most people have floaters.
not_available You probably notice them more as you've been recovering.
not_available When will this stuff wear off? Your vision will be normal in an hour or so.
not_available Wear these.
not_available Thanks for checking her out, doc.
not_available Anytime, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available You have a very nice daughter.
not_available She's not my daughter! Who said that? 
not_available It was just a joke.
not_available Cool! These are trippy.
not_available Everything's a blur.
not_available Why did you tell Dr.
not_available Zagerley that? That you're my dad? 
not_available You're old enough.
not_available Half the time you clam up and the other half you're taking back lies you told.
not_available So? So you're making it tough for people to help you.
not_available You cooperate, then Social Services can find a relative or get consent for somebody to take you in.
not_available Like who? 
not_available Help them figure that out.
not_available Stop lying to people.
not_available Like adults don't lie every chance they get? Why don't you have any kids? I get my fill on the job.
not_available So this truth thing's a one
not_available way street.
not_available I get it.
not_available I haven't gotten it together long enough to stay with a woman let alone family and babies and long
not_available term commitments.
not_available You wouldn't have to have a baby if you had a foster kid.
not_available Anybody in particular? A teenager wouldn't be that long of a commitment.
not_available I'm practically grown up already.
not_available If I were ready, you'd be first on my list.
not_available You've used that on women, haven't you? 
not_available I have.
not_available There you are.
not_available So how are the eyes? 
not_available She's doing fine.
not_available Good.
not_available Well, I'm sure her mother will be relieved to hear that.
not_available You found her in Cleveland? On south Des Plaines, 10 blocks away, where she and Charlie live.
not_available My God, Charlie! I was freaking.
not_available I was so worried.
not_available Look at you.
not_available What did I tell you would happen? You'll end up with scars from this.
not_available When are you gonna listen to me? I can't turn my back for a second, you're out the door.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pomerantz? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh said you might be available today for counseling for those of us who knew Dennis Gant.
not_available That's right.
not_available They've set up an office for me on the Surgical Ward.
not_available Room 820.
not_available I'll be there till 6:00.
not_available I don't know if I can make it today.
not_available I meant to stop by earlier, but I got called into surgery.
not_available Are you an intern? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Oh, you're John Carter.
not_available Dennis mentioned you a few times.
not_available You were his friend.
not_available Oh.
not_available You knew Dennis? He came for counseling when he first arrived.
not_available But after a few sessions, he stopped.
not_available I see.
not_available I'm really very sorry.
not_available I know how hard it is to lose a friend.
not_available I hope you'll come by and talk.
not_available When Dennis quit therapy, did you think that it was okay? I mean, did you feel it was all right for him to stop? I didn't disagree with it, his stopping, at the time.
not_available He seemed to be settling in, developing a support system.
not_available There's a survivor's guilt that comes with any unexpected death.
not_available Maybe I feel guilty because I am.
not_available You should come and see me.
not_available I'll try.
not_available I'll try to remember your names but please have your I.D.
not_available Tags where they can be seen.
not_available Bye, Lily.
not_available Bye, Haleh.
not_available Goodbye, Carol.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Has anyone worked ER before? 
not_available Twenty years ago.
not_available I hated it.
not_available We're closed to trauma.
not_available That'll ease the workload.
not_available And please, if you have questions, ask.
not_available Later.
not_available A quarter till? 
not_available I can meet you there.
not_available I'll pick you up.
not_available Bye, Chuny.
not_available If they win this, it'll be good for nurses.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available County's gotta find the money.
not_available They can check my bank account.
not_available It's not in there.
not_available I'll send these up to the lab.
not_available Cell count and diff, protein, glucose India ink and culture.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Nice to see you again.
not_available Did we find you something exotic? We've all seen way too many movies.
not_available No ecchymosis or bleeding or rash.
not_available It doesn't suggest Ebola.
not_available Meet me in the lab.
not_available We'll make the Geimsa stains.
not_available We have techs who will do that.
not_available I'm an old
not_available fashioned lab rat.
not_available I like to do it myself.
not_available Greg's wonderful.
not_available I should've thought of him for you earlier.
not_available Kerry.
not_available As your doctor.
not_available There's no reason for you to drive out to Highland Park anymore.
not_available Greg's very respected for his work with HIV patients.
not_available He left a successful private practice to come to County after his partner died of AIDS last summer.
not_available That's too bad.
not_available You ought to think about it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe I will.
not_available She's not even a runaway.
not_available Her mom lives 10 minutes away.
not_available Sounds like a case herself.
not_available Letting her kid run the streets all hours of the day and night.
not_available What do you think? Chop House for Valentine's Day? I'd love to, but you're not my type.
not_available I know.
not_available It's not very romantic, but it's Chuny's favorite.
not_available They gonna send Charlie home with her mom? There's a cooling
not_available off period where the DCFS figures out which end is up.
not_available And I'm on my way to the gym.
not_available Sounds like she's in safe hands.
not_available Thank God for Social Services! Hey, Carter, can I get you anything? I could get used to being closed to trauma.
not_available I was actually hoping for something to do.
not_available Doesn't feel real, does it? I just keep waiting for Dennis to come in and tell everybody it was a big mistake.
not_available You couldn't have done anything.
not_available I know that.
not_available I just don't believe that.
not_available Help! Somebody help my friend, please! He's dying! Okay, on a count Don't! His leg is barely hanging on! What happened? 
not_available Gil was taking a nap in the alley.
not_available They dropped a dumpster on him.
not_available I dragged it off of him and called for help but no cars would stop.
not_available I couldn't find a phone.
not_available The paramedics wouldn't have brought you here.
not_available You saved your friend a ride across town.
not_available Get the doctors.
not_available Get all the doctors! Let's try the other slide.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Want to take a shot? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Know what you're looking for? Hoop
not_available shaped rings, like Saturn's.
not_available Exactly.
not_available You like astronomy? My fifth
not_available grade science project was on comets.
not_available I'm an expert.
not_available You must be excited about the appearance of Hale
not_available Bopp.
not_available It's a comet that was just discovered this month.
not_available Do you have your own telescope? 
not_available Careful.
not_available You'll get me started on a new set of useless facts.
not_available I thought about getting a telescope.
not_available Can you see much with the city lights? Join me for a comet watch.
not_available I usually set up outside the Adler.
not_available I'd love to sometime.
not_available How about tonight? It's supposed to be clear.
not_available But bundle up.
not_available At 4, a chill comes off the lake.
not_available It's only visible in the pre
not_available dawn sky.
not_available Hey, wait.
not_available Look.
not_available I think I found some.
not_available Take a look.
not_available Am I right? They have rings, more than one? That's it.
not_available The asexual form of the parasite.
not_available Plain old malaria.
not_available Good news for Mr.
not_available Hecht? Chloroquine, 10milligram IV followed by a 15
not_available milligram drip.
not_available Hey, you know, I'm usually awake at 4 a.m.
not_available Anyway.
not_available I'll bring the coffee.
not_available Great.
not_available O
not_available neg is here.
not_available Four units.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Ask Radiology what's taking so long.
not_available Get on the rapid infuser.
not_available I got a pumper! Femoral artery! Four by fours for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Gauze? 
not_available Four by fours.
not_available Come on! Gil, come on.
not_available BP's thready.
not_available Pressure's 60.
not_available Heart rate's 140.
not_available Pulse ox, 90.
not_available How's that lavage coming? 
not_available I need Betadine.
not_available Coming up.
not_available Watch out! 
not_available I need some help with this tape.
not_available Okay, I got it.
not_available Who's on the infuser? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Just a sec.
not_available Positive lavage.
not_available We got internal bleeding.
not_available I need a thigh cuff.
not_available Thigh cuff for Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Upper right drawer.
not_available Right drawer.
not_available Up.
not_available Found it.
not_available He's fibrillating.
not_available I'll start compressions.
not_available Let's shock him.
not_available Paddles, Carter, 200.
not_available Everybody up! No juice.
not_available Hit the sync switch.
not_available Turn it off.
not_available Can I set? Clear! Come on, Gil.
not_available Three hundred.
not_available Clear! Is he dying? Is he dying? Is my buddy dying? 
not_available We're doing our best.
not_available Why don't you wait outside? Three
not_available sixty.
not_available Clear! He's my friend! 
not_available I know! I know! Give me an amp of epi.
not_available I tried to get him here.
not_available Shut this guy up! It's my fault! I let him down! Let's shock him again at 360.
not_available Clear! He's my buddy, and I let him down! Okay! We got it! Get him out of here! 
not_available Let's go! No, you didn't.
not_available At least you tried! 
not_available Kerry, cover for me.
not_available Go on.
not_available Go on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's try him again at 360.
not_available Clear! I knew Dennis was having a hard time.
not_available I knew he was in trouble but I was too busy and I just didn't want to get dragged down.
not_available I didn't listen.
not_available You're in the middle of your first year of Residency.
not_available You're working at an inhuman pace.
not_available Why am I doing it again? Because you were trying to learn a job where lives are at stake.
not_available I didn't save Dennis' life though, did I? You don't know that you could have.
not_available I know that I wasn't much of a friend.
not_available I'll collect the sharps.
not_available You check off the dispensed meds.
not_available You don't have to do that.
not_available I don't mind chipping in.
not_available Number lavage blade two needles from a central line.
not_available All right.
not_available Three epi, 100 of lidocaine.
not_available I wanted to compliment you on how you handled yourself today.
not_available It isn't easy to be a manager when it's hitting the fan and your workers are your friends.
not_available Two IV needles.
not_available Thanks.
not_available It's been pretty awful around here lately.
not_available I think of myself as a nurse, and I'm wading through this management crap.
not_available Two of O
not_available neg, empty, two unused.
not_available You waded through it very gracefully.
not_available Isn't there three of O
not_available neg? Oh.
not_available Yeah, here it is.
not_available No.
not_available This one is marked A
not_available pos.
not_available What? Did we order type
not_available specific? It never came down.
not_available I mean, where did this? God, this must've been on the infuser! There's blood in the Foley bag.
not_available Oh, my God! I gave him the wrong blood.
not_available This unit of A
not_available positive must have been left on the infuser.
not_available When I started, I'm sure there was a bag on there.
not_available I just thought someone had hung it.
not_available I didn't check the label.
not_available Have you sent a sample to be re
not_available crossmatched? Yeah.
not_available It showed massive intravascular hemolysis.
not_available I gave typeA blood to a type
not_available O patient.
not_available I killed him.
not_available He was bleeding out anyway.
not_available We've saved worse.
not_available It was an honest mistake.
not_available You were the only RN.
not_available We were all filling in roles.
not_available It still doesn't take away the basic error.
not_available I did not check the label.
not_available We're saying if you determined an incident report was unnecessary we wouldn't pursue it.
not_available Am I speaking out of turn? 
not_available No.
not_available You could've thrown the empty bag in hazardous waste and been done with it.
not_available That's true.
not_available But I'd still have to look at myself in the mirror every day.
not_available Thank you for making the arrangements, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available And the sentiments you expressed set just the right tone.
not_available I want to apologize about what happened earlier in surgery.
not_available You already did.
not_available Did I miss it? Mr.
not_available Gant, this is Dr.
not_available Benton, who you were asking about.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, this is Dennis Gant Sr.
not_available He was hoping to meet you.
not_available My sympathies are with you.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available I'm sorry I missed the service.
not_available Dennis' E
not_available mail gave me a sense of how demanding your schedules are.
not_available In fact, I had to admonish my son for taking time to write home at all.
not_available I didn't want him to neglect his workload.
not_available I know that Dennis greatly respected your work and looked up to you.
not_available Well, I'm afraid I was a bit tough on your son.
not_available Maybe Dr.
not_available Carter filled you in.
not_available No, I haven't.
not_available You have to be tough.
not_available Life is.
not_available I wasn't entirely convinced that my boy should've chosen such an ambitious specialty.
not_available But I didn't raise a quitter.
not_available I hope he didn't disappoint you.
not_available No, your son worked very hard.
not_available And I think he would've made an excellent surgeon.
not_available Oh, I am so late.
not_available What a day, huh? You know, you and Dr.
not_available Fischer make a good team.
not_available We're getting together later.
not_available He's an astronomy buff.
not_available You have a date with Greg Fischer? No.
not_available Not a date.
not_available In some ways, it's perfect that he's gay.
not_available What makes you think he's gay? Well, you said 
not_available He isn't gay.
not_available You said his partner died of AIDS.
not_available His partner in his medical practice.
not_available Not his lover.
not_available Oh, my God! Greg Fischer is one of the most eligible heterosexuals in Chicago.
not_available So he thinks this is a date.
not_available It is a date.
not_available I can't go.
not_available Don't be silly.
not_available I have to tell him I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available It's just a date.
not_available Get to know him.
not_available You're entitled to a date.
not_available Really.
not_available Go.
not_available Have fun.
not_available I expect to hear all about it tomorrow.
not_available Have you seen ERay? 
not_available He's helping one of the temp nurses.
not_available Not with a patient.
not_available With her astrological chart.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Fischer in? I see.
not_available Is he on pager, by chance? No? No? Okay, thanks.
not_available Carol, good news.
not_available The union blinked.
not_available Nurses will be back on the morning shift.
not_available You saved me a trip from upstairs.
not_available I needed to give you this.
not_available During a trauma, I gave the patient the wrong blood, and he died.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Patient's family aware of the error? He was a transient.
not_available He had no family members.
not_available Well, that's fortunate.
not_available What? I'll look over the report, but don't beat yourself up.
not_available The sickout contribute to this man's demise? It was my error.
not_available I didn't check the label.
not_available I'm gonna have to write this up, of course.
not_available But I think in view of the circumstances of the day we may be able to forego an investigation.
not_available I don't want any special favors here.
not_available I stayed on today because, as a manager, I'm required to.
not_available I understand.
not_available The mom admits there were fights and claims she can't keep Charlie in.
not_available Sounds more like the mom's not in much herself.
not_available She confirmed the abuse by one, if not two, of her boyfriends in the past.
not_available Why did you page me? 
not_available Charlie's making claims.
not_available Against me? 
not_available Not accusations.
not_available Norm and I felt that it would be best if we hashed it out together.
not_available I appreciate your coming.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Thank you for taking care of her.
not_available It's my job.
not_available But so many don't care.
not_available Or just don't take the time.
not_available I was out of my mind when I heard.
not_available I thought she was babysitting.
not_available I was updating Dr.
not_available Ross about the problems at home.
not_available I won't say I don't have a temper, and I've made a lot of mistakes.
not_available But I love Charlie like crazy, and I just want her to find something.
not_available I know she can't go out on her own but So I told them what you told me about how my mom could give consent.
not_available Adele would know more about that.
not_available Charlie means parental consent for her to live with you.
not_available She believes you agreed to that.
not_available Like we said, I'm almost grown up.
not_available I wouldn't be around all the time.
not_available I mean, I'd be in school.
not_available And I can see you're a good man and a doctor.
not_available I'm not giving up my daughter.
not_available She needs a good influence.
not_available That isn't what we talked about.
not_available In fact, it's the opposite.
not_available Charlie was mistaken.
not_available We could do it.
not_available They'd let us.
not_available So you were lying? You see what it's like with her? You make me nuts! 
not_available I can't do this.
not_available Why not? I'd do whatever you said.
not_available Adele and Dr.
not_available Middleton can help you.
not_available Screw Adele and Dr.
not_available Middleton! And screw Mom! It's all a bunch of crap! I'll run away! You know it, and it'll be your fault! I hate you! Maybe you should go.
not_available Go! Go on! Get out of my face! I'm half
not_available frozen! The snow was supposed to stop.
not_available You didn't even get a glimpse.
not_available We'll have to try that again, like in June, July Two hot chocolates.
not_available You want something to eat? Yeah, maybe.
not_available I'm afraid I'm not hardy enough for astronomy.
not_available Or crazy enough.
not_available I've never been that interested in the stars themselves.
not_available It's the stories behind them.
not_available You have a favorite myth? I like the gruesome ones like Cassiopeia.
not_available Turned to stone by Medusa.
not_available She didn't freeze while stargazing? Actually, she's waiting for the man of her dreams.
not_available Remember? She's searching for a nice, upstanding guy.
not_available He can even be a nerd.
not_available As long as he's not completely lacking in spontaneity.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available No.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I just didn't expect that.
not_available But did you like it? Yes, I did.
not_available But Greg I'm HIV
not_available positive.
not_available I should've told you, but I didn't think it was a date.
not_available That's okay.
not_available No.
not_available I should've.
not_available But I was having fun.
not_available So Here you go.
not_available Did you want to order anything? No, thanks.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I know I was hard on Gant.
not_available I thought it was the best way for him to learn.
not_available And I don't blame you.
not_available No more than I blame myself.
not_available I just feel like I have been walking around with this secret and you're the only person who knows it.
not_available And you won't admit to it.
not_available You know, a few years ago, I went to my high
not_available school reunion.
not_available North Lawndale.
not_available Jackie got it in her head.
not_available It wasn't much of a turnout, because half of the class had dropped out.
not_available I didn't know the others.
not_available My parents tried to keep me from bad influences.
not_available But here I am with them, you know? And a third of the guys are in prison, and I bet another third are dead.
not_available You hear about this one and that one over the years.
not_available But this night I'm just struck by the sheer numbers.
not_available I don't know what to think of Gant's death.
not_available But, Carter, I don't need you to tell me how I feel.
not_available You want to go through this alone? You want to make this into something that I don't know about? I guess you can.
not_available We'll both keep our distance.
not_available We'll both do our work.
not_available Pretend like nothing happened.
not_available We're good at that.
not_available Look what that did for Dennis Gant.
