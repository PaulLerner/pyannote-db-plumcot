not_available A family member, an acquaintance.
not_available No.
not_available No one.
not_available Can I be candid? In my experience, it's very unusual for a woman of Asian descent to offer a child up for adoption.
not_available We've found that most Asian women end up changing their minds.
not_available Oftentimes at the last minute.
not_available Did you bring me out here just to make sure I wouldn't change my mind? Lots of women never make it past this bench.
not_available I can't keep this child.
