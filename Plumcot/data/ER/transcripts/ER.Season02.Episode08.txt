not_available We would.
not_available Are you gonna stay? Do you need to know now?

not_available Okay.

not_available I mean, come on, if you really wanna kill yourself, forget about pills.
not_available Get yourself a straight razor.
not_available You find that artery, you slice right on up.
not_available You'll be dead in a minute.
not_available Pills are for people who don't really mean it.
not_available I really meant it.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available She's kidding, right? Mom, it's not a "money" kind of favor.
not_available I was hoping you and dad could look after Susie tomorrow night.

not_available He had Bell's Palsy.
not_available No vesicles or sores in his ears? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You're not sure? 
not_available Pretty sure.
not_available Why? Well, vesicles indicate Ramsay Hunt syndrome which could infect the brain.
not_available I wasn't looking for vesicles.
not_available If you think you missed them, I'd call his folks, get him in here and make sure.
not_available Yeah, mom.
not_available Yeah, I know how you are when you don't get enough sleep.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available So much for Ozzie and Harriet.
not_available Any other ideas?

not_available Carol.

not_available Start Mucomyst.
not_available Let me know when her LFTs come in.
not_available Contact her folks? 
not_available Don't have a number.
not_available She won't talk.
not_available Have you seen her brother? 
not_available Not I.
not_available Open your mouth.
not_available There you go.
not_available Now you're getting the hang of it.
not_available Pulse ox is up to 98.
not_available You had me scared there for a while.
not_available Any idea how this happened? Granny's got a collie.
not_available Let me see this.
not_available Okay, Mrs.
not_available Almont, Alan will be fine.
not_available Does he live with you? No.
not_available Just visiting for the week while his folks are out of town.
not_available Okay, well, if he'll be staying with you, you'll have to get rid of the dog.
not_available You're the doctor who was on the TV! 
not_available Yes, that's me.
not_available You're gonna be okay, sugar.
not_available That's the doctor from the TV! Doug, I talked to the boy's HMO.
not_available They want him at their Urgent Care.
not_available Where? 
not_available Oak Park.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available He was in acute respiratory distress.
not_available I'm not sending him across town.
not_available His pulse ox is up to 98.
not_available And I want to make sure that it stays that way.
not_available There.
not_available "Pulse ox, 89"? Tell his HMO that, they'll let him stay.
not_available What's going on? Dr.
not_available Ross, I'm not fudging my nursing notes.
not_available Nobody's asking you to.
not_available There's gonna be a discrepancy.
not_available I'm not sending him out.
not_available Do you know why she did it? My mom died in a car accident last May.
not_available Might have something to do with it.
not_available They were close? Not really.
not_available Does Julia get along with your dad okay? 
not_available He ain't around.
not_available He works a lot? He just can't deal with stuff.
not_available I don't think he likes being in the house.
not_available Do you have a phone number for him? Yeah.
not_available Somewhere.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available County General.
not_available What was that about? 
not_available I might have misdiagnosed.
not_available Ramsay Hunt.
not_available Forgot to check the ears? No, I checked, but I wasn't thinking Ramsay Hunt, so I didn't look for it.
not_available Pretty big miss.
not_available Bring him back to make sure.
not_available A lady with chest pain, history of lupus and renal failure.
not_available Benton said you should take it.
not_available Don't miss anything.
not_available Oh, your x
not_available rays are back.
not_available Poor dear was exhausted.
not_available Your lungs look fine.
not_available Would you? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Thank you, love.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have another cup.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm fine, thank you.
not_available Do you work with children? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I raised three right here in Chicago.
not_available Of course, they grew up and made me obsolete.
not_available Are you looking for work? Yes, actually.
not_available Work nights? Pour it through the strainer if you would, please.
not_available Chuny, can I not read your writing, or is that a 98? That's a 98.
not_available So you wrote down this asthmatic kid's pulse ox as 98 and five minutes later, Doug noted it 89? Did he crash? He didn't crash.
not_available Could this be a case of numerical inversion due to temporary dyslexia? I don't know.
not_available I'm just a nurse.
not_available So I'm correct in deducing that there's an inconsistency here? 
not_available Looks that way.
not_available Someone made a mistake.
not_available I didn't make a mistake.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Give me a sec.
not_available Carol? 
not_available Yeah? Look, I'm really sorry for being a jerk back there before.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available It's no big deal.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available No, it is to me.
not_available Can we get together later and have dinner or go to a movie? Look, I'm busy, but I'll call you, okay? 
not_available I don't hear anything unusual.
not_available Temp's normal.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Briggs, sit tight.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available Let's order a CBC, Chem
not_available 7, ABG, EKG, chest film.
not_available Abdominal series.
not_available AntiDNA, anticentromere, antiphospholipid 
not_available antibody, cryoglobulins.
not_available That's gonna be $2000 right there.
not_available I don't wanna miss anything.
not_available Is this because she's Vucelich's patient? She's Vucelich's patient? Better get a cardiac echo too.
not_available And a CT.
not_available Doug? 
not_available Let's get one more neb treatment.
not_available And then I'll okay him for transfer.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Doctor? Thank you so very much.
not_available You're very welcome.
not_available You wanna fill me in? Kid had a bad asthma attack 
not_available and his HMO wanted him transferred.
not_available So you falsified his chart? 
not_available That's sounds right.
not_available It's illegal.
not_available Should I put him on a bus to Oak Park? 
not_available You should've come to me.
not_available I could've called his HMO and backed you up.
not_available But now, when they see this, they're not gonna pay.
not_available There's no way I can justify a lie of a new medical record.
not_available We're just gonna have to eat it.
not_available Good.
not_available Eat it.
not_available I can't keep banging heads with you every other day.
not_available It's just too much work.
not_available If you're gonna stay here and work for me, this cowboy crap has gotta stop.
not_available Stay here and work for you? Now there is an attractive prospect.
not_available Is that what this is about? You can't take the fact that I'm your boss? Typically narcissistic of you.
not_available I can't take the fact that anyone is my boss.
not_available I need to speak to your sister alone.
not_available Okay.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Do these have to stay on? We took some new tests.
not_available One of them was a pregnancy test.
not_available It came back positive.
not_available You knew that.
not_available Did that have something to do with taking the pills? Sometimes keeping things inside makes them seem worse than they actually are.
not_available You don't know.
not_available I know about wanting to die.
not_available I took a bunch of pills a year ago.
not_available I loved my mom.
not_available When she died it's like everything fell apart.
not_available Kyle was a mess.
not_available At night I'd hear him crying, like when he was little.
not_available We never meant for it to happen.
not_available I only went in to hold him until he stopped crying.
not_available And now I'm pregnant.
not_available It's okay.
not_available If I had recommendations this strong I could've gone to an Ivy League school.
not_available Recommendations? This patient of mine's a nanny.
not_available Her agency faxed them over.
not_available Her name's not Ransom, is it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't count on any long
not_available term commitment.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Heads up.
not_available I got it.
not_available in a Civil War re
not_available enactment of Battle of Malvern Hill.
not_available Took on Lee, Magruder and Stonewall.
not_available Two ton cannon broke loose, rolled over his toe.
not_available Damn artillery sergeant.
not_available Ought to be court
not_available martialed.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available That is pretty smushed up.
not_available What's open? Trauma 1.
not_available It was musket butt to bayonet all morning.
not_available The damn rebels were thicker than fleas on a dog's back! 
not_available Hi.
not_available She told you.
not_available Kyle, whatever she told me is confidential.
not_available I'm not free to discuss it.
not_available She told me she told you.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can to help you guys, okay? Oh, man, she did tell you! When my dad finds out, he's gonna kill me! Kill me, man! He carries a gun! Kyle, I'm not gonna tell your father anything you don't want him to know.
not_available I'm not waiting to find out, know what I'm saying? Kyle! You wanted to practice your suturing? Here's your man.
not_available Turned 25 years old today.
not_available Celebrated by drinking himself into a stupor and walking through a plate glass window.
not_available It's a two man job.
not_available Carter will help.
not_available Let's get the chest films first, then the echocardiogram.
not_available The echo guy was here first.
not_available I got a heart and spleen waiting.
not_available Give me two minutes.
not_available Carter.
not_available What? What are you doing? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available She's got a history of lupus and renal failure and complained of chest pain 
not_available so I'm working her up.
not_available Carter, come.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Carter, only an idiot would order that many tests for chest pain.
not_available I'm trying to be thorough.
not_available She's Dr.
not_available Vucelich's patient.
not_available You're kidding? 
not_available No.
not_available Oh, damn.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Tell me, did you order these labs on my patient? Dr.
not_available Vucelich, I apologize.
not_available I left my student unsupervise
not_available No.
not_available I take full responsibility.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton had nothing to do with this.
not_available Then you're the one I should thank.
not_available Thank? Yes, the test for antiphospholipid antibodies was positive.
not_available She has a serious blood disease.
not_available We need to put her on heparin right away.
not_available So tell me, what was your thinking, son? Actually, there was very little.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Briggs has a very complex history, so I took a shotgun approach.
not_available Don't underestimate yourself, Mister 
not_available Carter.
not_available Carter, right.
not_available Given the circumstances, your approach was more than valid.
not_available Not that I advocate indiscriminate testing.
not_available No need to run Chem
not_available 20s on every runny nose, right? But when someone has a constellation of problems, you can't hold back.
not_available Remember that, Benton.
not_available Good work.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available By the way, I'm doing a fem
not_available pop bypass.
not_available You wanna assist? Go, Carter.
not_available You know the procedure? Fem
not_available pop bypass? How many have you done? Mrs.
not_available Ransom? I must have drifted off.
not_available Did you get my references? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available Very, very impressive.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was thinking that I could drop around tonight.
not_available Make it a little less intrusive on the little one.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Ransom, we need to talk about your blood tests.
not_available Your red and white cells and platelet count are extremely low, which is suggestive of aplastic anemia which is very serious.
not_available Perhaps you could give me a few pills.
not_available Pep me up.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Ransom, your condition is most likely terminal.
not_available You need to be admitted to the hospital for a bone
not_available marrow biopsy.
not_available Oh, Pishposh! Not another one of those! You've had one? 
not_available Yes, months ago.
not_available Most unpleasant.
not_available Have you been getting transfusions? From their description, they are simply ghastly.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I would rather just carry on and, you know, hope for the best.
not_available I I could come around about 7 tonight if that's convenient with you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Ransom, your disease has reached a stage where you can't work anymore.
not_available You need to be admitted to the hospital.
not_available I think I'm the better judge of that.
not_available Don't you? Oh, man, that smarts! You've avulsed most of the skin off the top of your big toe.
not_available Just saw it off and throw it in a basket.
not_available I need to get back to the field.
not_available Amputation isn't necessary.
not_available I just launched a countercharge at Jackson's center.
not_available Damn cannon came off the blocks.
not_available Are you General Grant? 
not_available No, Grant wasn't at Malvern Hill.
not_available I'm Major General Fitz
not_available John Porter, tactical genius.
not_available Used the 5th Corps to outflank two rebel divisions and drive them back across the Chickahominy.
not_available I have to rongeur the bone.
not_available Let's get Mr.
not_available Richter some lidocaine.
not_available No, ether.
not_available That's all Porter had when they cut off his leg.
not_available Mr.
not_available Richter, we haven't used ether as an anesthetic in over 40 years.
not_available Lidocaine.
not_available 2% digital block.
not_available Just give me a bullet to bite on.
not_available We may be out.
not_available I got it.
not_available Could we send out a private to round up some bourbon? No, Mr.
not_available Richter, we're fresh out of privates as well.
not_available I'm about to use this tool to grind down the bone in your toe.
not_available I highly recommend that you take the lidocaine.
not_available Not as long as I'm in command.
not_available Go to it, surgeon! Do your stuff! I saw your sister, Jackie last week, near the State of lllinois building.
not_available She was buying a Polish dog from a vendor.
not_available I don't think she saw me.
not_available She's supposed to be on a diet.
not_available Busted.
not_available She works near there.
not_available Didn't she work at the gardens? Used to.
not_available Always wanted to work outdoors.
not_available She's allergic to pollen.
not_available You're kidding? So they put her in a room with no windows.
not_available And a plastic plant.
not_available Probably.
not_available She told me she saw you.
not_available Didn't tell me about the hot dog, though.
not_available I'm Richard Kazlaw.
not_available I was told Julia's here.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kazlaw, I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Julia tried to kill herself, but good news is, she's okay.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available She's actually with a social worker now.

not_available If you could just fill out this paperwork, consent form, that sort of thing.

not_available Take this, please.
not_available No sign of him?

not_available Isn't this dandy.
not_available Give him five more minutes.
not_available If he doesn't show, we'll make some sort of an excuse.
not_available Say he's out scouring the sewers for lost kids and stray pets.
not_available Are you Dr.

not_available I wanna take this opportunity to acknowledge some of my colleagues.
not_available First, David Morgenstern for his stalwart support.
not_available One minute he's stamping my walking papers and the next he has his face so far up my butt if he had a moustache, it would tickle my throat.
not_available Let's not forget Neal Bernstein.

not_available And last, and definitely not least, Mark Greene.

not_available You got me.
not_available I'll tell you something.
not_available He'd get a kick out of what I'm about to do.
not_available Don't do it, Doug.
not_available Big mistake.
not_available Well, you know what my father always said? If you're gonna make a mistake, make it a big one.
not_available Still sewing? Thanks for teaching me the staple gun.
not_available Well, good night.
not_available Why didn't you tell me you were divorced? Separated.
not_available We haven't had many conversations lately.
not_available At least not civil ones.
not_available Peter.
not_available Al and I had a lot of problems that had nothing to do with you and me.
not_available Good night.
not_available Slow down! 
not_available I had no idea you were this neurotic.
not_available What? Coming out here to check a kid's ears? I thought you came to support me, not ridicule me.

not_available This is it, 218.
not_available Hey, your first house call.

not_available All clear.
not_available You done? I'm done.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And I'm really sorry to bother you at home.
not_available It was no surprise to me to see Doug Ross on TV sloshing around in freezing water trying to save a kid in trouble.
not_available Because in a way, that's what he does every day.
not_available I don't know any doctor who cares more for his patients.
not_available I'm proud to present this award for outstanding community service to a great pediatrician and a great friend.
not_available Doug Ross.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd like to take this opportunity to single out a few people who have influenced my career, for better or worse.
not_available But I guess you all know who you are and how I really feel about you.
not_available Perhaps the less said the better.
not_available Thank you for this.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It's scary to think that in four months I'm gonna be a doctor.
not_available I'm not gonna have Residents looking over my shoulder checking my mistakes.
not_available It's an awesome responsibility, if you think about it.
not_available Do we have to talk shop? 
not_available What? I'm sorry.
not_available I just hate to think that medicine is all we can talk about.
not_available No.
not_available We can talk about something else.
not_available Well, good.
not_available Great.
not_available You first.
not_available No, you go first.
not_available Did you do that because you couldn't think of anything? At least take your hands out of your pockets and do it right.
not_available You're not thinking of doing anything rash, are you? You mean like this? What are you, crazy? 
not_available Those awards really bounce.
not_available Must be acrylic.
not_available Thanks for the speech.
not_available Thanks for not giving your first draft.
not_available I'm an idiot, you know.
not_available You have your moments.
not_available You know why my old man called me today? Because he saw me on TV.
not_available I haven't heard that voice in 22 years.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available The scary thing is that I'm doing a pretty good imitation.
not_available Never kept a job more than two years.
not_available Most of the time it was two weeks.
not_available He had a nasty habit of getting drunk and punching out his boss.
not_available Maybe it's just me but I take a dim view of that particular approach.
not_available So do I still have a job? If you still want it.
not_available Damn it! Goddamn! Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it! What are you doing up there? 
not_available I'm destroying your roof.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available That's just what I need.
not_available No, seriously, I saw some of these rotting tiles and I figured I'd start pulling them off, and I think I've ruined your roof.
not_available Well, stop! Oh, my God! 
not_available I know, I know.
not_available This is horrible.
not_available I figured I could save you some money on roofing.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available About what? Putting a really big hole in my roof? I The roof, the mouth Whatever odious behavior I'm about to commit.
not_available All of it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I shouldn't have made you feel stupid this morning.
not_available Hey, I did that all on my own.
not_available No, I blind
not_available sided you.
not_available Well, that's true.
not_available Well, look, I
not_available About what you said today It doesn't matter to me.
not_available You know what I mean? I don't think any less of you.
not_available Most of all I'm really glad that it didn't work.
not_available Me too.
