
not_available So we've got Bulls games to go to, and deep
not_available dish pizza to eat at Arnie's.
not_available Hey, they've got some cool band at the Climax Lounge too.
not_available How about the hospital lounge? I have to go to work today.
not_available Oh, well, I can come with you.
not_available And we can hit the streets after that.
not_available Listen, Jaspreet, that sounds fun, but I don't party when I'm working.
not_available But what about last night? 
not_available Well, last night was an exception.
not_available There's gonna be plenty of "those " because while I'm here, we're gonna be partying.
not_available And how long is that? Until my parents give up on the idea of me marrying Chemmel Narayan.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Some creepy doctor Dad wants for me.
not_available He's got a bigger muffin top than Humpty Dumpty.
not_available And every time I even think about shagging him I throw up in my mouth.
not_available Your dad wants you to have an arranged marriage? I thought he was cool.
not_available He's a bloody wanker.
not_available He tries to act like the family man but the truth is, he has some chick half his age living in Notting Hill.
not_available Jaspreet, your parents don't know you're here, do they? 
not_available I'm sure American Express will tell them.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Okay, come on, everybody.
not_available Keep it going.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Keep it going.
not_available Come on, Sam.
not_available You're doing good.
not_available Come on.
not_available I was at mile five, but this is a little too much.
not_available You got to run on your toes.
not_available You land on the flat of your feet.
not_available Are you seeing stars yet? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm seeing a bench.
not_available A bench with a pillow.
not_available Great job, everybody.
not_available Same drill tomorrow at 5 a.
not_available m.
not_available Next week, we add the bicycle.
not_available No.
not_available No on the bicycle.
not_available This is triathlon training, Sam.
not_available Bike, swim, run.
not_available How about a shower, or drink, nap? That's more my speed.
not_available Sam, you okay? No.
not_available I need a gurney.
not_available I'll tell them to send one out for you.
not_available And some O2.
not_available Tell them everything you've ever implemented.
not_available Document compliance, medication reconciliation.
not_available Mention when I went to Africa? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Tell them how good you are in bed too.
not_available I should've worn that suit.
not_available This one's fine.
not_available Are these pants wrinkly? All right, I'm wigging out.
not_available I don't know why.
not_available You are gonna rock this.
not_available I know it.
not_available Pratt, can you give me a hand? I've got a meeting with Anspaugh.
not_available Get Skye.
not_available This is Beth Ackerman, 22.
not_available Fell down the escalator at Bloomingdale's.
not_available It was 50 percent off suede boots.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Gates, are you in pain? 
not_available Yeah, my ankle's killing me.
not_available Deformity and point tenderness over the distal tib
not_available fib.
not_available She said her stomach hurts too.
not_available We'll take a look.
not_available She took a pretty good fall.
not_available I didn't break that glass vase, did I? Sam, you're running a little late here.
not_available I'll be ready in a minute.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Oh, she's fine.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available You're fine, right? Shut up.
not_available And the truth is, I'm not some Ivy League import.
not_available I trained here as a med student and a resident.
not_available I know that ER better than any other candidate.
not_available I've been nominated for a med school teaching award.
not_available I'm efficient.
not_available And I understand the need to balance teaching with productivity.
not_available I'm the fastest attending on the floor, and I have the records to prove it.
not_available What else would you want in a chief? 
not_available Experience.
not_available Come on, you've hired experience.
not_available And all you got out of it was a mental breakdown and another guy who didn't last three months.
not_available I love your chutzpah.
not_available I've told you this, but I don't see it.
not_available You don't see what? Some people are leaders, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Some people aren't.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, with 
not_available I have talked to your supervisors.
not_available Yes, Kovac told you to go to Africa, and you did it.
not_available Kovac also told you what to change in the ER.
not_available You did that too.
not_available But, without prompting, what have you done here? In order to overlook these candidates I would have to see that you are an undeniable choice.
not_available And I'm not convinced.
not_available Maybe I shouldn't be here at all.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt 
not_available No, I've been busting my butt.
not_available If you don't see that, why should I waste my time here? So you're going to give up if you don't get this? No.
not_available I'm gonna go somewhere I'm respected.
not_available And my efforts aren't in vain.
not_available Consider this my two weeks notice.
not_available I think you're overreacting.
not_available If they're so hung up on status quo, why spend another day here? 
not_available This is your family.
not_available No, my Aunt Ellen's family.
not_available This is business.
not_available Look, Morris, I love you guys.
not_available I really do.
not_available But this isn't right.
not_available What happened? Your people getting oppressed? 
not_available Shut up, Frank.
not_available They didn't say you'll never get it.
not_available They said not now.
not_available You think Anspaugh will make you chief? If I leave and jam at another hospital, he'll change his mind.
not_available Then what? You'll come back? 
not_available Hell, no.
not_available Fight the power.
not_available Shut up, Frank.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, can you jump on this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Eightyear
not_available old, head lac, seems altered.
not_available And you are? Teacher's aide.
not_available He fell in gym class.
not_available Did he pass out? 
not_available I wasn't there.
not_available They told me to bring him in.
not_available Hey, I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available What's your name? My head hurts.
not_available We're gonna get you checked out.
not_available Exam 3.
not_available What labs do you want? 
not_available CBC for a baseline.
not_available We were leaving the store.
not_available She wanted me to take her home, but she was in pain.
not_available Where do you live? In Harvey.
not_available Jack got us a weekend special.
not_available We saw "Jersey Boys" last night.
not_available Capped it off with a couple martinis.
not_available Six, to be exact.
not_available Sounds like fun.
not_available Special occasion? Beth, can you take a deep breath for me? Yeah, she got back from a tour in Iraq two weeks ago.
not_available How long were you there? Thirteen months.
not_available Going back in six weeks.
not_available You military too? 
not_available Marines.
not_available After 9/11, they sent me to Guam.
not_available What's happening in Guam? 
not_available Not enough.
not_available Any allergies? 
not_available Walnuts.
not_available That's about it.
not_available Okay, a little stick here.
not_available Looking better than the last time I saw you.
not_available I was a little winded.
not_available A little winded.
not_available You were sucking air like a dry guppy.
not_available Ooh.
not_available Oh, she has some tenderness in the left lower quadrant.
not_available Follow exams.
not_available Make sure Trauma takes a look.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need you to go to Admit, and fill out some paperwork.
not_available No problem.
not_available Honey, I'll be right back, okay? 
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available The icon's positive.
not_available What does that mean? You're pregnant.
not_available One, two, supermodel.
not_available Oh, that's fabulous.
not_available Neela's like my hero.
not_available She moved to America, and she took it by the balls.
not_available Yeah, she does have a way.
not_available The rest of our family, they have a stick up their bottoms.
not_available But Neela said bollocks to tradition, and she moved to the States.
not_available She's like our own Mick Jagger.
not_available I don't know.
not_available More of a backup singer.
not_available You know, like a Pip.
not_available I being Gladys, she being a Pip.
not_available Hi, sorry.
not_available Radiology wanted me to stay in CT with our diverticulitis guy.
not_available We don't handhold here, Harold.
not_available Let Radiology do their own job.
not_available Harold, I'd like you to meet my cousin, Jaspreet.
not_available Hi, "I'm " 
not_available Harold, you're Harold.
not_available Right.
not_available Some people call me Jazz.
not_available I love jazz.
not_available Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie.
not_available Gillespie? 
not_available Green Mill's the place for that.
not_available We should go sometime.
not_available Really? So you and me? What's wrong with this guy? He's having an asthma attack.
not_available Somebody get an inhaler.
not_available You're gonna feel a little bit of a sting here.
not_available Ow.
not_available This is the numbing shot for your stitches.
not_available It hurts.
not_available It will get easier after this.
not_available Where do you think you'll go? I'll call Northwestern.
not_available They wanted me once.
not_available Maybe they'll want me again.
not_available You feel that? Feel what? Good.
not_available I'll start stitching you up now, okay? How many will I get? About five.
not_available Can you make it six? I want one more than my friend Lucas.
not_available All right, I'll see what I can do.
not_available CT's backed up.
not_available They said to call back in a half hour.
not_available This place needs a second scanner.
not_available Carlos, do you remember how this happened? I don't know.
not_available I was playing kickball and fell.
not_available Were you feeling sick today? 
not_available No.
not_available Are you taking any medicine? Epzicom, didanosine and Kaletra.
not_available Those medicines are for HIV.
not_available How long's your asthma? I think it happened because of my psychosexual stress.
not_available Psychosexual what? It's rare.
not_available They don't teach it in med school.
not_available She's single? 
not_available She ran away from marriage.
not_available Sweet.
not_available Harold, she's not for you.
not_available She's a sex
not_available crazed maniac.
not_available Okay, come on.
not_available Enough with the babying.
not_available Neela and I have a rectal abscess, and a woman versus escalator.
not_available Can I do the I and D? 
not_available No.
not_available No, Neela and I are gonna cover the ER.
not_available I got a lot of consults piling up, and wanna keep the team.
not_available What should I do? 
not_available You can deflate your little balloon.
not_available And then take Bollywood out there for a tour.
not_available Okay.
not_available This is the uterus.
not_available And there's the baby.
not_available Are you sure? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Look, there's the heartbeat right there.
not_available Hey, I called your sister and told her everything's gonna be okay.
not_available What's up? What are they doing? An ultrasound.
not_available Why? What's going on? I'm pregnant.
not_available You're what? Oh, my God.
not_available Oh, we're pregnant.
not_available Yeah, pregnant.
not_available Gonna be an adorable baby.
not_available I can tell already.
not_available What? Are these the arms right there? Yep.
not_available And there's the fingers and toes.
not_available So it's about eight weeks old.
not_available Eight weeks? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available At least.
not_available The OB will do a formal ultrasound.
not_available Give you a more accurate estimate.
not_available Trauma's here.
not_available This the escalator fall, Beth Ackerman? Yeah.
not_available Hello.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Rasgotra from Surgery.
not_available Does anything hurt? Sounds like he wants you to be more proactive with your own ideas.
not_available I'll take my ideas to another hospital.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I never liked Anspaugh.
not_available Well, if you need help looking, I can make some calls.
not_available If I can't find a job fast enough, I might need a sugar momma.
not_available Oh, maybe we can work something out.
not_available I can cook and clean.
not_available I'll take that into consideration.
not_available Dawn, did Carlos Moore's mom get in? I left a message.
not_available Her phone keeps going to voice mail.
not_available Try it again.
not_available She needs to know her kid is here.
not_available Just because a boy steps to me doesn't mean I'm gonna tell.
not_available That is not right.
not_available What would you do? You gotta be up
not_available front.
not_available Tell him what's up.
not_available Because he asked? This is about being honest.
not_available Damn, if that's the "case " " I'll" be telling people all day that I'm Hlv
not_available positive.
not_available The truth is, you're both right.
not_available It is important to be honest.
not_available But every guy you meet doesn't need to know.
not_available However, men you plan to be intimate with do need to know.
not_available Even if he just wants to kiss you? Jeanie, it's Carlos.
not_available What? 
not_available They called.
not_available He's at County.
not_available Ladies, I need to cut this short.
not_available Is there anything we can do? 
not_available No.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I left Sydney's prescription.
not_available No problem.
not_available I got it.
not_available We got a 52yearold diabetic with a non
not_available healing ulcer on the foot.
not_available What's his glucose? Eighty
not_available nine.
not_available Excuse me, is triage still in here? 
not_available Yeah, check in at the desk.
not_available My kid was brought in about an hour ago.
not_available You have to sign in.
not_available His name's Carlos Moore.
not_available I need to know what room.
not_available I'll be with you in a minute.
not_available This guy needs a foot series and a CBC.
not_available Please, just look it up for me.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, get back here.
not_available I told her to wait.
not_available What room is Carlos Moore in? Carlos Moore.
not_available Ma'am, you need to sign in.
not_available Jeanie? 
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available It's Carlos.
not_available He fell.
not_available You know her? 
not_available Yeah, she used to work here.
not_available How are you? 
not_available I'm good.
not_available Will you help me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Exam 3.
not_available He's Dr.
not_available Pratt's case.
not_available Come on, I'll show you.
not_available The ER has changed a bit.
not_available How have you been? 
not_available Good.
not_available You look the same.
not_available Oh, you look great too.
not_available Hey, there you are.
not_available Hey.
not_available Are you okay? Were you spacing out during kickball? I guess.
not_available It's so boring.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It doesn't look too bad.
not_available Jeanie Boulet.
not_available She's Carlos' mom.
not_available She was a PA on staff.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available We're about to take him up to get a CT.
not_available Really? He needs a CT? Possible loss of consciousness.
not_available Possible? Doesn't the school know? The aide wasn't sure, and I wanna play it safe and get the scan anyway.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Weaver here? I know her.
not_available No.
not_available She doesn't work here anymore.
not_available Carlos is a bit more complicated than other kids.
not_available I know.
not_available He told me about the HIV.
not_available No offense, but I'd feel better with the most senior person taking care of him.
not_available He hit his head.
not_available And I have a lot of experience managing head trauma.
not_available I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
not_available But would it be possible for me to speak to your attending? Ma'am, I am the attending.
not_available Hemoglobin's stable.
not_available I'm not getting anything here.
not_available Your fractured bones are blocking the blood flow.
not_available I'm gonna need to realign them.
not_available Oh, whatever.
not_available I just don't get it.
not_available Jack, we'll talk about this when it's over.
not_available L Propofol's kicking in.
not_available Good sats.
not_available Let's stabilize posteriorly.
not_available Okay, ready.
not_available On three.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Whoa, whoa, what's going on, Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? Displaced tib
not_available fib.
not_available I don't recall having orthopedic training.
not_available Well, no.
not_available Typically, the ER waits for the Ortho team before reducing unstable fractures.
not_available Had no choice.
not_available We lost the dorsalis pulse.
not_available And now it's back.
not_available Really? Oh.
not_available You must have some set of hands, girl.
not_available Call us when you've got film.
not_available Go.
not_available We got a femur in 2.
not_available I really would prefer an MRI.
not_available A CT will give us the information.
not_available Maybe, but it involves radiation.
not_available He doesn't need that.
not_available An MRI takes longer, and not as good for finding a traumatic bleed.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available I know, honey.
not_available I just wanna do the right thing.
not_available This is the right thing.
not_available We can do the CT quickly and without sedation.
not_available And if you wanna stay, you have to wear one of these lead aprons.
not_available If not, you can wait in the Control Room.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available This isn't gonna hurt, honey.
not_available I know.
not_available You ready, Carlos? I'll be right here.
not_available It will be over before you know it.
not_available That reduction was impressive.
not_available Let's not congratulate ourselves until we see the film.
not_available Is it over? Your bones are in place.
not_available Need to wrap and repeat x
not_available ray.
not_available How do you feel? I'm okay.
not_available Who is he? It's not what you think.
not_available Was he someone in your squad? Was he an officer? Was it a journalist? The guy you wrote me about? 
not_available Now's really not the time.
not_available No, Jack.
not_available Explain to me how you've been home two weeks and are two months pregnant.
not_available Because I was raped.
not_available Kyle Kyle Petterson raped me.
not_available Your sergeant? You were laughing with him when you got off.
not_available I saw you.
not_available He did it, Jack.
not_available You're lying.
not_available It's true.
not_available Stay still.
not_available You're covering someone you screwed.
not_available Why don't you go outside, calm down.
not_available Hey, get off of me.
not_available Jack.
not_available God.
not_available I'd wait a year or so.
not_available Jobs are tight.
not_available No, the housing market's tight.
not_available People always need doctors.
not_available Hey, I'd pimp my dog if it will get you to stay.
not_available Why don't you pimp a few charts, and clear the board? We're packed.
not_available You should put Abby back.
not_available She's taking some personal time.
not_available Still? It's been weeks now.
not_available So what? She'll come back.
not_available I saw your nephrotic syndrome patient.
not_available Consult's on the chart.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Daniels.
not_available Oh, hey, hey, hey.
not_available How'd he do? 
not_available He handled it like a champ.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available I'll find you as soon as I get the results.
not_available Okay.
not_available Michael Grant from Northwestern.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Whoa, whoa, you called already? You snooze, you lose.
not_available Hello? "Dr.
not_available Pratt?" 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll take the neck.
not_available You talk some sense into him.
not_available Oh, and this is the desk.
not_available It's kind of like the epicenter where Where senior attendings like myself create the action.
not_available More like the chaos.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.
not_available Oh, I'm Archie Morris, Neela's friend.
not_available Not to be confused with boyfriend, because we've never dated.
not_available Why wouldn't I know? Okay, Dr.
not_available Morris, Jaspreet and I need to finish the tour.
not_available Oh, tour? Tour? Where has young Henry taken you? 
not_available It's Harold.
not_available Whatever.
not_available We went to the O.R., and saw this guy carrying a heart.
not_available It was so cool.
not_available Then we saw this awesome MRI scan, and saw pictures of this chick's brain.
not_available We went to the morgue, and saw this dead body.
not_available And this thing was dead, as in dead, dead.
not_available Wow.
not_available Did he take you to the trauma room where senior attendings save lives? No.
not_available But I'd love to see that.
not_available Would you? My pleasure.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available But I haven't even taken you to the pathology lab yet.
not_available We must have been asleep about two hours when he came in.
not_available First, I thought we were being attacked.
not_available That's why he was there.
not_available But then he got on top of me, and put his hand over my mouth and told me to be quiet, and I froze.
not_available Did you tell anyone? The next day, we were out on patrol looking for insurgents.
not_available What was I supposed to do? I needed those guys to have my back.
not_available Still, he should be punished.
not_available It's too late.
not_available I pretended it didn't happen.
not_available Like Jack said, I was laughing with him.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available I've been through it.
not_available Holding it in gives you nothing but nightmares and panic attacks.
not_available I heard Jeanie Boulet was in the house.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Oh, my, look at you.
not_available You look great.
not_available Oh, you do too.
not_available Alex, do you remember Carlos? You were this small when we met.
not_available How you feeling? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I got a CT.
not_available About 45 minutes ago.
not_available I wonder if they've processed the films yet.
not_available Who was helping you? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Let's go find out if the radiologist has them.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available You all right? Back in a few minutes.
not_available So, what's going on? Are you still running the same clinic? One on the South side, one on the North.
not_available How's Reggie? Did he finally make detective? Yeah.
not_available He sure did.
not_available We separated two years ago.
not_available Oh, don't tell me that.
not_available He just It was too much for him.
not_available I'm at the clinic 24/7.
not_available Oh, so you're still close? 
not_available Joint custody.
not_available It's good for all of us.
not_available Have you heard from Doug and Carol? 
not_available Oh, they are still loving Seattle.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross sent a picture of the twins.
not_available They just started third grade.
not_available Wow.
not_available I keep saying I'm gonna visit.
not_available And how's Carter? Is he still in Africa? I heard he might be coming home for a visit in the spring.
not_available I should have everybody over for gumbo and Ã©touffÃ©e.
not_available Do that.
not_available We'll get together like the good old days.
not_available Has anyone seen Dr.
not_available Pratt? He's at the Jumbo Mart having coffee.
not_available I was just hoping I could get my son's CT results, and get him home.
not_available I'll give them a call.
not_available Name's Carlos Moore.
not_available Line's busy.
not_available They've been slow all day.
not_available I'll go upstairs, see what's taking them.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available I started making up the schedule myself.
not_available Before I knew it, I was arranging teaching conferences reorganizing the appointment grid.
not_available Yeah, well, that's just great.
not_available But Anspaugh doesn't believe in me.
not_available You heard it yourself.
not_available It's not about Anspaugh.
not_available It's about you.
not_available Make it so they can't deny you this.
not_available Look, there are some Physician Leadership Programs over at U of C, coming up in about a month.
not_available They might give some ideas.
not_available Why would I have to jump when Northwestern said they'd die to have someone like me? You think you're gonna walk and run the place? The head of the department is looking for someone to mentor to replace him.
not_available He wants to meet tomorrow.
not_available You know, Dr.
not_available Pratt, when a fighter gets knocked down in the first round " he" doesn't throw in the towel.
not_available I'm not throwing in the towel.
not_available I'm getting into another ring.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why is she up there? No.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available I gotta take care of this.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, think about what I said.
not_available Having you run this department, that would be phenomenal.
not_available Have you seen our soldier's boyfriend? Who body slammed me? 
not_available I'm not gonna send a search party.
not_available Yeah, you need to toughen up.
not_available You should come running with us.
not_available I lift weights, Sam.
not_available I'm not into torture.
not_available So why are you doing all this? I don't know.
not_available I'm trying to get out there a little bit more.
not_available I'm taking wine tasting too.
not_available What's funny? 
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available I was just remembering a dream I had last night.
not_available Sam was in it.
not_available I was? What was I doing? 
not_available Hey, Sam, have you seen Dr.
not_available Wexler? 
not_available Not in a while.
not_available Hey, what was I doing, Gates? Hey, hey, are those my films? Yeah.
not_available I went to light a fire.
not_available Yeah, you should've paged me first.
not_available I was trying to help.
not_available That wasn't the way to do it.
not_available Ms.
not_available Boulet? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, we should talk.
not_available Yeah, later.
not_available But, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available What is it? Mind if we go talk in the doctor's lounge? No, I've waited long enough.
not_available Just give me the results.
not_available There's a lesion by the frontal horn of the left ventricle.
not_available From the fall? It's contrast enhancing with surrounding edema.
not_available No, it's not from the head injury.
not_available Then, what is it? Could be a few possibilities.
not_available It could be toxoplasmosis, CNS lymphoma, histoplasmosis.
not_available Meaning AIDS.
not_available My son has AIDS.
not_available I never would've told her like that had you not gone up there.
not_available You're blaming this on me? 
not_available You went behind my back.
not_available You're acting like I slept with your girlfriend.
not_available I was helping you out.
not_available I don't need it.
not_available Had I gotten the results myself, I would have pulled her.
not_available Or if you had taken a second to talk to me Because of you, what should have been a private conversation happened here.
not_available You know what, Dr.
not_available Pratt? You don't get it.
not_available What don't I get? A micromanager in complete denial? This should be a team.
not_available Shouldn't be working autonomously.
not_available Please, give me a break, okay? I came up on this team.
not_available Now, the next time you're bored and you need something to do try treating a patient.
not_available Your own.
not_available Chief.
not_available He'd done so well for so long.
not_available Then, over the last year, his CD4 counts dropped.
not_available They changed his antiretrovirals twice, because the virus became resistant.
not_available Let's just see what the doctors have planned.
not_available There are all types of new treatments now.
not_available Haleh's right.
not_available Even if it means Carlos has AIDS survival has improved over the last decade.
not_available Please don't lecture me.
not_available I'm Hlv
not_available positive.
not_available I know all about it.
not_available But it's different when it's your own kid.
not_available I know that.
not_available It's so surreal happening here.
not_available It's where I met Carlos.
not_available Where I decided to adopt him.
not_available We don't know what this brain lesion is.
not_available If it's toxoplasmosis, it'll get better with antibiotics.
not_available And if it's a lymphoma? 
not_available Then there's chemo.
not_available You know that doesn't work.
not_available If it's a lymphoma, he's got months.
not_available Why don't we just find out what it is first? How will we do that? There's no simple way.
not_available The only way to know for sure is to do a biopsy.
not_available Cut into his brain? The neurosurgeon can do it stereotactically with a needle under CT guidance.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's the best way.
not_available Ms.
not_available Boulet, a Reggie Moore is here to see you.
not_available It's Carlos' father.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Hey.
not_available Bam, you're out.
not_available What are you doing? Playing four square.
not_available I don't even know how you play.
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, okay, all right.
not_available Let's keep it moving.
not_available Go inside, guys.
not_available Game's over.
not_available Jerk.
not_available They're not patients.
not_available I pulled them.
not_available You whip that thing one more time, I'll be sewing up their head lacs.
not_available Get in.
not_available The box, get in.
not_available Get in.
not_available What is your problem? Why are you so agitated? Morris stole my girl.
not_available Your girl? Jaspreet? Two guys have taken my women in the past two months, I'm sick of it.
not_available Across the way, we have the Jumbo Mart.
not_available Down the street is Ike's, a very fine establishment.
not_available And there's the el, which can take you anywhere.
not_available That's so cool.
not_available Hey, Neela, Jaspreet and I were gonna grab some drinks.
not_available You down? 
not_available Well, actually, I was Yeah, we're in.
not_available Double dates.
not_available Be there.
not_available Harold, come on, let's go.
not_available Come on.
not_available How are we gonna tell him? Let's just talk about the mass.
not_available What about the AIDS? You wanna tell him about that? We should take it just one step at a time.
not_available You wanna start lying to him now? 
not_available It's not lying.
not_available With all due respect 
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available You're the specialist.
not_available You have the answers.
not_available Think this is easy? 
not_available Patients have the right to know.
not_available He's my kid.
not_available He's mine too.
not_available You don't think he reads? You don't think he listens to your calls? Carlos knows what an AIDS
not_available defining illness is.
not_available Just give her a minute.
not_available Yeah, she's stubborn.
not_available It's either her way or no way.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available Did Ortho see the post reduction film on the pregnant soldier? 
not_available They signed off on it.
not_available Good.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry to hear about what you went through.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Well, I appreciate that.
not_available But I don't think it's appropriate to share that personal stuff with the patients.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available They're dealing with their crisis.
not_available They don't need to listen to ours.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available I thought you split.
not_available How's Beth? How do you think? I don't believe her.
not_available Well, you think she's telling the truth? 
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Doesn't matter what I think.
not_available I was always afraid of her stepping on an IED or getting killed by a sniper.
not_available But something like this We shouldn't have to worry about our guys.
not_available We're all supposed to be there defending our country.
not_available You're right about that.
not_available But start by defending her.
not_available What kind of spot? Well, we're not sure.
not_available It could be caused by some germs.
not_available Or it could be something else.
not_available Can they take it out? It's not that easy.
not_available They have to do some more tests first.
not_available What kind of tests? What we wanna do is just take a little piece out and look at it under a microscope.
not_available You mean, I have a tumor? Remember I told you? God helps us through the good times and the bad.
not_available Well, we have to have faith.
not_available He's gonna hold our hands through this.
not_available All of us together, buddy.
not_available Carlos? Hey, Carlos.
not_available Carlos? What's happening? 
not_available Push 2 of lorazepam right now.
not_available Second two didn't touch him.
not_available He's maxed out on lorazepam.
not_available What next? Pentobarb.
not_available You wanna go straight to pentobarb? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pulse is up to 165.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Try Depakote.
not_available Nope, it takes too long.
not_available Get Pede's neuro down here.
not_available Why? He's got elevated ICP, and failed first
not_available line drugs.
not_available A no
not_available brainer.
not_available I'd like to get a consult before you induce a coma.
not_available Coma? No, no way.
not_available We should avoid intubation.
not_available Gonna need general anesthesia for the biopsy.
not_available Sat's dropping, 87.
not_available All right, call respiratory.
not_available Prep a 6oh
not_available ET tube.
not_available That's excessive.
not_available He needs an anticonvulsant.
not_available Pentobarbital, 300 milligrams IV.
not_available Haleh, now.
not_available All right, I'm in.
not_available Bag him up.
not_available What about an EEG? They'll do it in O.R.
not_available Pentobarb drip at 30 migs Does he need steroids? 
not_available I was ordering six of Decadron.
not_available What's that for? 
not_available To reduce the swelling.
not_available You staying while he's in surgery? 
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Well done, Greg.
not_available They're ready for him in O.R.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Beth's boyfriend never made it back.
not_available Yeah, I saw him outside.
not_available I tried to talk to him, but I wasn't persuasive.
not_available You, not persuasive? I thought you're a sweet talker.
not_available Well, I guess even this situation was beyond me.
not_available Guess again.
not_available He came back.
not_available Well, I knew he would.
not_available I just wanna make sure that you knew that I knew that, you know 
not_available How you doing? I'm better now.
not_available How's the ankle? 
not_available The splint's really helping.
not_available Gotta keep it elevated, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available When can I get her out of here? Soon.
not_available I just wanted to talk to you about pregnancy options.
not_available You know, I can make a call to the gynecologist and you can have a D and C done as early as tomorrow.
not_available I'm not getting an abortion.
not_available You wanna have this baby? Beth, I don't understand.
not_available Let me call a counselor down here to talk to you.
not_available I'm gonna keep it.
not_available Pregnant soldiers don't get sent back.
not_available I love "Earth" and "Veer
not_available Zaara.
not_available " They're epic.
not_available Since when did you follow Bollywood movies? Since he went on the Internet Truth is, I don't really watch Indian films.
not_available When you go home to the motherland, you've caught a few? I've never actually been to India.
not_available Not every Indian person has been to India.
not_available Like assuming every African
not_available American has been to Africa.
not_available Well, I mean, just assumed.
not_available Arranged marriages, India.
not_available Hello? You assumed wrong, butt
not_available head.
not_available Bite me.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available You buying? Dr.
not_available Grossman.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I hope you're cool about earlier.
not_available What? About how you stole our case? I was trying to be proactive.
not_available That's what my girlfriend said when she moved out.
not_available I'm joking, Rasgotra.
not_available I love proactivity.
not_available In fact, how would you feel about an ortho rotation? Really? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Well, I'm flattered.
not_available I'll have to talk to Dr.
not_available Dubenko first.
not_available I already did that.
not_available You have a surgical
not_available elective requirement, so now you're all mine.
not_available Really? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available And he's gonna just let me out that easily? You're gonna be with the cool kids next week.
not_available Be ready.
not_available I'm pretty tough.
not_available Having the baby is not the answer.
not_available Beth, there are other ways.
not_available I am not going back over there.
not_available I don't believe in it anymore.
not_available So report him.
not_available I can't prove anything.
not_available What if he's hurting other people too? Think about that.
not_available Yeah, he's right.
not_available I know it's scary, but you can do it.
not_available I love you.
not_available And I support you.
not_available The last thing that I'm gonna do is let anything else bad happen to you including going back over there.
not_available I promise.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you looking at? You fools.
not_available Neela's crazy cousin took these.
not_available We are the most idiotic, dysfunctional family ever.
not_available If anybody's looking for me, I'll be upstairs.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available They're still working on him.
not_available I was gonna go get some coffee.
not_available You okay? That's our boy.
not_available I mean, she can sit there and watch it.
not_available I can't.
not_available I know it's tough seeing your kid in there like that.
not_available You would think her getting HIV would've crippled her.
not_available But she turned it into a mission.
not_available The clinics, the patients.
not_available If she's not mentoring someone, she's following up with a "teenager " making sure they're taking their medicine.
not_available She seems pretty committed.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, she sure is.
not_available If you have any questions or you need anything don't hesitate to page me.
not_available Aren't you supposed to tell me everything's gonna be all right? Hang in there, my friend.
not_available Ice is all you can do.
not_available Are you sure you can't give me some more tips over dinner? What? I thought it was pretty good when we're hanging out.
not_available It was, but 
not_available Oh, don't tell me.
not_available You hooked up with an elf? 
not_available No.
not_available I was kind of bummed you didn't call.
not_available I went home to D.C.
not_available Got tied up with the family.
not_available But, look, this weekend, we could catch a movie, get some drinks.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available What happened to the cop? I thought he was your new lover.
not_available We're dating, we're not married.
not_available So this is a modern thing.
not_available Juggle more than one guy? 
not_available Men do it all the time.
not_available Wanna hear about my dream? 
not_available Not particularly.
not_available Earlier, you were begging for it.
not_available I don't beg.
not_available In my dream you did.
not_available Ew! Was it sexual? 
not_available Ew.
not_available No, it wasn't.
not_available You were begging to do my laundry.
not_available Bye, Tony.
not_available You washed one load, eight times.
not_available You're insane.
not_available What do you think? You think you're like a clean freak or something? The biopsy's going well.
not_available They've localized the lesion and are getting tissue.
not_available His vitals are great.
not_available He hasn't had any more seizure activity.
not_available Jeanie, that's good news.
not_available It's just the beginning.
not_available He'll fight.
not_available He's a tough kid.
not_available When I tested positive 12 years ago people were so freaked by it.
not_available Some of the doctors didn't think I should work here anymore.
not_available The nurses had problems with it too.
not_available Even my family.
not_available I would go home for Christmas, and I'd hear my aunts 
talking "Well, at least she doesn't have AIDS, girl.
not_available We'd have to sit her in the other room to eat.
not_available " I don't want Carlos to go through that.
not_available He doesn't deserve it.
not_available You'll make sure that doesn't happen.
not_available You know what scares me about all this? What if everything I've been fighting for is a bunch of bull? It's not.
not_available I tell my patients they won't end up here, but they do.
not_available My ex, Al, died two years ago.
not_available He was 78 pounds.
not_available He didn't even recognize me.
not_available And my friend Paulette.
not_available She's the first person I met.
not_available Ms.
not_available Boulet 
not_available If I lose him, I'm done with it.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available It's true.
not_available I won't do it anymore.
not_available You have to.
not_available Do it for Carlos.
not_available Do it for yourself.
not_available But whatever you decide, you keep doing it because you are exactly what we need.
not_available You're not so bad, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I know.
not_available It usually takes people a while, but I eventually win them over.
not_available I wanna say a prayer for him.
not_available Say one for us both.
not_available All right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Daniels.
not_available Yeah, it's Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I was thinking about what you said earlier, and Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna stick around for round two.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be right up.
