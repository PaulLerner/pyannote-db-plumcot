not_available I thought that's where I put it.
not_available Well, show me.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Here.
not_available Here's the cordis.
not_available You want me to set up for an art line? 
not_available Either.
not_available I'll take either.
not_available Got it! 
not_available No.
not_available That is the introducer.
not_available It looks like a big, yellow snake.
not_available Get me somebody who knows the difference.
not_available She's new, Carter.
not_available It's her first day.
not_available This kid is dying here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If you don't know what you're doing, get out.
not_available Here it is.
not_available Don't yell at her.
not_available We're losing time here.
not_available It's not her fault he's sick.
not_available Flush the ports.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Laura! Laura! Laura! Laura! Hold on! 
not_available What is it? Stay right there.
not_available I'm coming down! If she left a note, you shouldn't have been late.
not_available I did tell her about the party.
not_available Take it up with her.
not_available I don't have time for this.
not_available Nanny? 
not_available No, Roger.
not_available He's my new shadow.
not_available He should meet Carmen.
not_available What do you have? Revision of a failed circumcision, You? Splenectomy and a pilon tib
not_available fib.
not_available Listen 
not_available I'm sorry about earlier.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I thought I could beat the odds.
not_available Look, I know you're stressed out with the new baby and everything.
not_available What's that have to do with it? Not to mention the head
not_available trips that's going on around here.
not_available My fuse would be short too.
not_available Have you ever seen me do anything wrong? Lazy? Sloppy? No.
not_available Look, I think you're just having a bad run.
not_available That's not very comforting to my next patient.
not_available Elizabeth, if I needed surgery or Reece did, I'd come to you.
not_available BP's down to 60.
not_available How much fluid is in? 
not_available Eight.
not_available We're gonna put him into pulmonary edema.
not_available Dopamine's maxed out.
not_available Levo's at 20 mics.
not_available There's no place to put the pulse ox.
not_available God, this kills fast.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Crash cart.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available He's young.
not_available Let's give him a chance.
not_available Come on, Andy.
not_available Clear! Charge to 360.
not_available Go get the conducting pads.
not_available And clear.
not_available Okay, Laura.
not_available You're gonna feel pressure in your lower back.
not_available Can I call my mom? 
not_available As soon as we're done.
not_available It's long
not_available distance.
not_available Omaha.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? Andy? They're working on him.
not_available You know him well? Everyone knows him.
not_available He's on the soccer team, really popular.
not_available Spend time with him lately? Laura? 
not_available Fluid's clear.
not_available Laura? 
not_available Well, we sort of kissed last night.
not_available Did you kiss anyone else? 
not_available Why? Andy has a very contagious bacterial infection.
not_available We need to know who might've been exposed.
not_available I usually only kiss one guy a night.
not_available Do you think Andy shares the same policy? I don't know.
not_available Last night was the first time I talked to him.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? What? What is it? I can't pay for this.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Half of our patients can't pay.
not_available And if there's a follow
not_available up or anything, I don't even know where I'll be.
not_available Your tox screen is positive for opiates.
not_available Well, my joints bleed.
not_available It hurts.
not_available What drugs do you do? 
not_available Demerol, if I can get it.
not_available And if not, heroin? 
not_available I don't see tracks.
not_available It's not a regular thing.
not_available Do you use your PortACath to shoot? 
not_available All right, look.
not_available You know, I didn't ask to come here.
not_available That's not what a PortA
not_available Cath is for.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let me call someone for you.
not_available There's no one to call.
not_available Let's talk about rehab, then.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I'm not done with your hand.
not_available I can't leave it open like that.
not_available Please? Is ham and cheese okay? 
not_available I'm not picky.
not_available There's fruit in there too.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Wait here.
not_available I need to get another suture kit.
not_available Why were you fighting? He's using his catheter to shoot drugs.
not_available It has to be removed.
not_available Can you do that? You all right? 
not_available Me? Yes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter was under pressure.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Don't you think he would find some other way to do drugs? He was given the catheter for clotting factor, not heroin.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Lewis again from the ER in Chicago regarding Laura.
not_available Please call me right away.
not_available Okay, I'm in.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Where's the vent? 
not_available On its way.
not_available Her pressure's dropping.
not_available More dopamine? 
not_available No.
not_available We're running in the antibiotics.
not_available Portable chest? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Check the tube.
not_available Not that it makes much difference.
not_available It's a waiting game now.
not_available Not so fast.
not_available You don't want to give her a pneumo.
not_available I missed it.
not_available I missed it too.
not_available You didn't see her.
not_available Well, it presented like the flu.
not_available You call the college? Student Health is giving antibiotics to everybody in the dorm.
not_available And the people at that party? 
not_available They'll get the word out.
not_available They don't want an outbreak.
not_available Abby, 600 milligrams of rifampin 
not_available for anyone on the meningitis cases.
not_available It makes me sick.
not_available Better than dead.
not_available Here you go.
not_available There she is.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I got busy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Now all you need are crutches.
not_available Do I have to? Nurse's orders.
not_available Can I ask you something? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How late are you here tonight? 
not_available One more hour.
not_available If I were gonna see you again, I'd be more subtle.
not_available But would you like to go for coffee or something? Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I'm not available.
not_available There's a boyfriend.
not_available Well You don't know? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But thank you.
not_available Pressure's steady.
not_available Can I have a little room, please? 
not_available I have to see the field.
not_available And I have to work.
not_available Careful.
not_available Mommy's watching.
not_available Releasing the splenophrenic vessels.
not_available Let's pack it in with lap pads.
not_available Small vascular clamp.
not_available Mobilizing the spleen.
not_available Bowl, please.
not_available Let's isolate the hilar vessels.
not_available We'll ligate.
not_available Did you touch the circulating nurse? 
not_available For God's sake.
not_available Of course not.
not_available It looked close.
not_available Carmen, get out.
not_available What? 
not_available I've had it with your intrusive pettiness.
not_available I'm doing my job.
not_available No.
not_available You are driving us all crazy.
not_available Now, leave the O.R.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Well, then we'll call Security to assist you.
not_available Shirley? Are you serious? 
not_available I've never been more serious.
not_available Catfight pending.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday? 
not_available They want you in Romano's office.
not_available I'm operating.
not_available He said to have you scrub out and to escort you, or I'm fired.
not_available I'll take that spleen.
not_available Don't follow me.
not_available Isn't Surgery supposed to take your messages? 
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Roger or Jackie? 
not_available One of each.
not_available Sounds like they're feuding.
not_available Let them.
not_available I don't think I can.
not_available Just temporarily.
not_available Is he okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He should be sore for a week or so.
not_available And he'll work like normal? 
not_available Should be just what you ordered.
not_available Sarah didn't have an issue with the circumcision.
not_available I was trying to let him down gently.
not_available Let him down? 
not_available I didn't want to hurt him.
not_available You need to go upstairs and tell him the truth.
not_available Three weeks.
not_available No.
not_available Now.
not_available I backed over a guy's cat once and stayed two more weeks.
not_available This has got to be worth at least three.
not_available Do whatever you want.
not_available I'm so bad at relationships.
not_available I can never just say what I feel.
not_available I know what you mean.
not_available You do know I was in the O.R.
not_available Sit down, Elizabeth.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available This is Edwin Bane, Cook County Health Department.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available It couldn't wait? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Bane is an investigator.
not_available So it's an investigation now.
not_available Unfortunate record you've accrued lately, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Yes.
not_available We are a little baffled by it.
not_available As am I.
not_available Did something turn up in my cultures? 
not_available No.
not_available Does Carmen have a problem with my technique? 
not_available We're looking at other theories.
not_available Other theories? It has to be more than a statistical anomaly.
not_available What do you think is happening? Well, if I knew that, I'd have fixed it by now.
not_available And there's nothing you want to tell us? What are you insinuating? The next step is a criminal inquiry.
not_available I beg your pardon? All four of these patients were elderly, in marginal health.
not_available Yes.
not_available All die of post
not_available op sepsis under your care.
not_available And on at least one occasion 
not_available the family asked you to euthanize.
not_available No! No Adrienne Tanzi? There was discussion about the quality of life.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Am I being accused of something here? Doctor, you wouldn't be the first angel of mercy to help end patients' suffering.
not_available Hold on, doctor.
not_available I thought you were fact
not_available finding.
not_available I am.
not_available So if there's something you want to tell us, you should tell us now.
not_available Like what? That I'm going around with a syringe full of bacteria infecting these people on purpose? All right, that's it.
not_available Let's adjourn.
not_available The Chicago Police will be contacting you.
not_available You might want to think about hiring counsel.
not_available Is that your dog? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Speedy.
not_available He's lost.
not_available Somebody order crayons? 
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Did you finish your shift? I'm waiting for Luka.
not_available Is it always like this? 
not_available Pretty much, yeah.
not_available I really admire what you do.
not_available Oh, you get used to it.
not_available No.
not_available I meant you.
not_available I always wanted to be a nurse.
not_available Really? At the hospital where my mother died, the nurses treated me like their daughter.
not_available They gave me ice cream and dolls to play with.
not_available They were like angels.
not_available Have you seen my patient? Which one? 
not_available Wes.
not_available The one you met.
not_available I talked to him maybe an hour ago.
not_available He's gone.
not_available You finished stitching his hand, right? Yeah, but the social worker has to see him.
not_available Maybe he didn't want to get that tube removed.
not_available I didn't tell him I wanted to do that.
not_available Did you? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't say anything.
not_available Abby, if you see Adele, could you tell her that my patient eloped? Sure.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available He'll be okay.
not_available He's on the street with a serious coagulopathy, drug habit, no money.
not_available Well, if he left home, I mean
not_available What? And stayed away this long, maybe he doesn't want to be found.
not_available Rachel?! Damn it! Rachel! It's okay, sweetie.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I know.
not_available Oh, it's all right, darling.
not_available He's cute, but don't you think he should cut his hair? Rachel, turn off the music and get off the phone! 
not_available Two seconds.
not_available Hang up! I gotta go.
not_available My dad's wife is freaking.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available You're supposed to be babysitting.
not_available I am.
not_available Ella was screaming.
not_available Oh, sorry.
not_available Did you feed her? 
not_available I wasn't supposed to until she woke up.
not_available Well, she's up now, isn't she? You want me to feed her now? 
not_available Yes, I want you to feed her now.
not_available Listen, I want you to be responsible.
not_available To think about something other than yourself.
not_available I said I was sorry.
not_available I didn't hear her crying.
not_available You didn't care to listen.
not_available You were playing that crap and talking about rubbish to your friend.
not_available If you're so worried, then why don't you stay home with her? I mistakenly thought that you were reliable enough to do it.
not_available Well, then forget it.
not_available I'm calling Lynn back.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Elizabeth! 
not_available Warm up that milk.
not_available No! Now! 
not_available She's your kid.
not_available You're living in my house.
not_available You can't tell me what to do.
not_available Oh, yes, I bloody well can.
not_available You know what? You need to chill out.
not_available This is my house.
not_available You can't talk to me that way.
not_available Boy, my dad sure can pick them.
not_available Rachel, you do not want to battle with me.
not_available You'll lose.
not_available I guarantee it.
not_available Your shift's over, isn't it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What are you, a med student again? I sent him home.
not_available I loved being this age, having a crush on a guy, finally meeting him at a party.
not_available She probably went home all excited, wondering what would happen next.
not_available She has a chance.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I just want to be here whichever way.
not_available Don't stay all night, okay? Dr.
not_available Lewis, there's a woman on line two calling from Omaha.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available You make me drive all the way over here? What is your problem? 
not_available You'd know if you'd take my calls.
not_available I have 100 things to do during the day.
not_available More important than your son? More important than refereeing you and Jackie.
not_available I was 20 minutes late.
not_available She uses that to keep me from him? We need to rethink the visitation thing.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available It's Jackie who's messing things up.
not_available Jackie is his aunt.
not_available And I'm his father! His what? 
not_available I'm one of his fathers.
not_available Look, Roger, I I appreciate you caring for Reece.
not_available I thought this time was important to make a transition.
not_available Transition? 
not_available But right now, you know what? You need to let go.
not_available Peter, look, I'm willing to work out a schedule or something.
not_available No.
not_available Reece has one father, and that's me.
not_available We both know that's not true, don't we? Carla said you're not his real father any more than I.
not_available You want to back up with that.
not_available So don't think you can just dump me 
not_available like you're more important to him.
not_available I am more important to him.
not_available You don't call me anymore.
not_available You don't come near the house.
not_available Stay away from Jackie and stay the hell away from my son.
not_available Are you gonna do it again? 
not_available Seriously, I think it worked.
not_available It feels much better.
not_available Needles in your back? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It was a bonus.
not_available I didn't realize you were a masochist.
not_available Whatever works.
not_available I should run home and get my whip.
not_available Yeah, you do that.
not_available You almost off? 
not_available Yeah, 15 minutes ago.
not_available What are you still hanging around for? And miss this late
not_available night stroll? It's starting to get a little chilly out here.
not_available I got asked out by a fireman today.
not_available Really? Ankle guy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hard to believe? 
not_available No.
not_available He's good
not_available looking.
not_available Big? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Funny.
not_available Invite me to the nuptials.
not_available All right.
not_available You gotta help me out.
not_available I don't know what to do.
not_available Rub your back? I'm just not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do here.
not_available I'm not exactly sure how I'm supposed to comment on your love life.
not_available I said no because I was waiting for something to happen 
not_available with us.
not_available You've been waiting? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You weren't doing much 
not_available to move it forward.
not_available No, you gave me an ultimatum.
not_available You gave me an ultimatum, and I did what you asked and you've done nothing.
not_available What did I ask you to do? 
not_available I broke up with Luka.
not_available First, you didn't break up with Luka for me.
not_available I didn't? 
not_available No.
not_available Second of all 
not_available you didn't break up with Luka.
not_available I'm pretty sure I did.
not_available Well, then why do you care so much about what he does or what he thinks or
not_available ? I dated the guy for a year.
not_available There's gonna be some history.
not_available Maybe too much history.
not_available Well, yeah, I had a life before John Carter.
not_available If you want someone with no history you're gonna have to find yourself a virgin.
not_available No.
not_available I'll settle for someone who isn't hung up on somebody else.
not_available You don't have to settle for anything, Carter.
not_available I talked to her.
not_available She's at Andrew's.
not_available And? He said he'd have her back by 10.
not_available End of a great day.
not_available That investigator was totally out of line.
not_available He all but accused me of homicide.
not_available It's crazy.
not_available What if people believe him? 
not_available They won't.
not_available You know what's really crazy? I feel guilty.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available I do.
not_available Four people are dead.
not_available I was their doctor, and I can't explain what happened.
not_available Well, the answer certainly isn't that you were euthanizing people.
not_available Then I come back home, and I take it out on a 14year
not_available old.
not_available That's a fair fight.
not_available She didn't do what she said she was gonna do.
not_available That's worth a conversation.
not_available I'm gonna have that with her.
not_available I don't think I can handle this, Mark.
not_available I was barely handling working and looking after the baby.
not_available You can.
not_available I can't.
not_available Oh, hey, hey, hey We'll work this out.
not_available Okay? We'll lay down the rules for Rachel.
not_available We'll get you a lawyer if we have to.
not_available Oh, God! We got fights ahead of us.
not_available We know that.
not_available But we're together.
not_available And we got children.
not_available We're happy.
not_available That's a lot.
not_available That's a lot.
not_available Hey.
not_available I called your mom.
not_available She's flying in.
not_available You had us a little worried.
