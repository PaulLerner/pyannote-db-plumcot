not_available There's a Mrs.
not_available Rodriguez here.
not_available You brought in her son this morning, that 14year
not_available old.
not_available Anyway, someone said you knew the family.

not_available Well, that's something.
not_available So let them read it.
not_available Write down the meds when you're ordering them, okay? I don't want a screwup because some nurse forgot the heparin.
not_available The nurses here are pretty good.
not_available The nurses here are downright great.
not_available And I think they deserve that from the rest of us.
not_available Oh, good, Doug.

not_available Malik will watch the baby.
not_available I slid the peanut under the spermatic cord.
not_available What's a peanut?

not_available I keep forgetting you haven't done surgery.
not_available It's a small clamp with some gauze on the end of it.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Are you sure you don't mind this? I could probably practice on some patient.
not_available No, no.
not_available You're actually pretty good at it.
not_available Yeah, but I missed one earlier this morning and In that case, I think the veins are a little over there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's a pretty complicated surgery, actually.
not_available I was surprised that Dr.

not_available You're kidding.
not_available I didn't think med students got to Bovie anything.
not_available It's very rare.
not_available Did you do it in that surgery this morning? The thoracic outlet syndrome? No, that's standard stuff.

not_available Hey, Larkey, the boys at Dispatch screw up again? No, we were out cruising for snow cones.
not_available Heard the call.
not_available Is this the seizure? 
not_available Heat prostration.
not_available Fell down, started mumbling in Lithuanian which our junior ticket taker there diagnosed as a seizure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, it looks like you have everything under control here.
not_available Your rig's a little sloppy, though.
not_available Some of us are trying to work here.
not_available Hey, Larkey.
not_available So where are those snow cones? You did excellent work today, Carter.
not_available A lot of students freeze up on their first Bovie, but you were calm, steady.
not_available Morgenstern was impressed.
not_available Really? So was I.
not_available Vaguely.
not_available Choledocholithotomy, first thing in the morning.
not_available And then I could scrub in? 
not_available 7 a.
not_available m.
not_available About the IV thing that happened 
not_available Carter! Just don't oversleep.
not_available I'd always heard banks put dye in with stolen money.
not_available Well, guess it's better than being puked on but harder to get out, I hear.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't suppose we get to keep the money.
not_available God knows County could use it.
not_available No, I don't suppose.
not_available I understand your niece has a cold.
not_available Fluids and fever
not_available control measures.
not_available Yeah, Malik's looking after her in Room 5.
not_available I saw her.
not_available She is quite adorable.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Susan You got a little spot right there.
not_available Under your chin.
not_available Can I come in? What is this, Grand Central? Are you all right? 
not_available It's just dye, Mark.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available It hasn't been a very good day.
not_available I know you're worried about the baby, but it's just a cold.
not_available Rachel got them all the time.
not_available She still gets them.
not_available You don't need to tell me that children get colds.
not_available Doug Ross and Kerry Weaver told me that.
not_available I get it.
not_available I didn't know you and Kerry were close enough to be talking about Little Susie.
not_available She told me about calling that code.
not_available She's irritating as hell, and you know it.
not_available I'll admit that she has a style 
not_available Problem? Challenge.
not_available You'd think, on her first day, she'd at least try and be nice.
not_available Well, maybe she thinks that way about you.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You think you're gonna be able to handle this okay? Do I have a choice? 
not_available Take a look.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available It's great.
not_available It's high, which means it's scary.
not_available Compared to what you do for a living? 
not_available I'm very careful down there.
not_available I'm being careful.
not_available And I'm a wimp for using a WetNap? 
not_available Now, that's different.
not_available Oh, it's a policy kind of thing? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's like whoever is driving gets to pick the music.
not_available Except for country, which is unacceptable.
not_available And whoever drives gets to pick where we stop for lunch.
not_available They decide who stays in the ambo and who goes up on the Ferris wheel.
not_available Raul never gets to drive, does he? 
not_available No.
not_available So if you're so afraid of heights, what are we doing up here? I figured we should have a little quality time.
not_available So this is a sacrifice on your part? 
not_available Yes, you could say that.
not_available Not to mention the sacrifice Raul is making in staying on the ground.
not_available Who? Okay, one more time.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Ross? Mrs.
not_available Beals? Could you excuse me just for a second? It's not really Mrs., but that's okay.
not_available I need to make the afternoon shift, or I'll lose my job.
not_available Byron will be okay with you, right? 
not_available You can't leave yet.
not_available I have to, or they'll fire me.
not_available I'll take Byron with me.
not_available He has to see the child psychiatrist.
not_available He's in there with him now.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, please.
not_available I really need this gig.
not_available All right, we'll watch out for Byron.
not_available You get back as soon as you can.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, thank you, Haleh.
not_available When did you reach Jack Chandler? 
not_available I haven't.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available She'll be back.
not_available Gym class, right? I don't even go to school.
not_available I don't have to anymore.
not_available Where's my mom? Dr.
not_available Myers, can I see you down the hall? Just for a second.
not_available Byron, we'll be right back.
not_available Okay, buddy? So this kid is a real mess.
not_available Who are you, and what are you doing in there? Psych Resident.
not_available I'm trying to help him.
not_available You can't poach this case out of the ER.
not_available Hey, I was called down here.
not_available By who? 
not_available By whom.
not_available By Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Chief Resident? Code red! Somebody call the damn fire department! Rip it out! Rip it out! I got it.
not_available Byron? Byron? Where's the kid? What kid? What kid? 
not_available Call Security.
not_available Byron? Hey, are you okay? Come here.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Everything's gonna be all right.
not_available Where's my mom? You kind of had me scared there for a minute.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available We'll get your mom.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available It's all right.
not_available This thing break down on you again? Should've called me.
not_available I'd have helped.
not_available Al.
not_available You know Peter Benton, don't you? I did physical therapy for his mother last year.
not_available My husband, Al.
not_available Yeah, you came by the house once, right? Yeah, right.
not_available Right, yeah.
not_available Surgeon, right? 
not_available Resident.
not_available Well, yeah, you know Surgical Resident.
not_available You know anything about distributors? Peter's brotherin
not_available law's a mechanic.
not_available His mother talked about her family a lot.
not_available All the time.
not_available Sounds like my mom, doesn't it? Is there anybody you want me to call? No, no, I think we got it.
not_available Why don't you give it a try.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available There you go.
not_available We got it.
not_available I gotta get her some new wheels, man.
not_available This thing's shot.
not_available Hey, it's good to see you again.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take care.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Beals 
not_available I told you, there is no Mrs.
not_available Cindy, okay? Please don't leave yet.
not_available Byron's a very sick little boy.
not_available He needs psychiatric help.
not_available He could've burned himself up in there.
not_available I'll take him to work.
not_available He likes that.
not_available He'll be okay.
not_available Listen, taking him to work is not gonna solve any of his problems.
not_available Well, neither are you.
not_available Look, I really appreciate your help and I'll do all the follow
not_available up for his hand.
not_available My cousin is gonna put us up.
not_available She's waiting in the car.
not_available She's got a bunch of kids home, so we really do have to go.
not_available Someone gonna answer the phone? Hey, Bob, what's going on? 
not_available What happened to you? What do you mean? We were goofing around on that last run.
not_available You know, sticking our heads out the window, the way dogs like to do.
not_available It's a good look, Carol.
not_available Bob, have you seen Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Suture Room.
not_available The bounce
not_available back migraine is here again.
not_available Not now, Jerry.
not_available I'm only trying to get you out in time for your train.
not_available Curtain 2.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We run out of Vicryl before nylon, and lidocaine with epi is always low.
not_available And 25 days and Kerry, would this be a good time? Thank you, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I appreciate your staying late.
not_available Sure.
not_available Who gave you the right to call a Psych Resident on one of my patients? The 9year
not_available old pyromaniac? Seemed appropriate.
not_available We were waiting for Jack Chandler, who, as you know specializes in children.
not_available Chandler is not on call today.
not_available He was giving me a curbside consult.
not_available He's out playing golf.
not_available He was gonna stop by.
not_available He owes me a favor.
not_available You're asking an extremely distraught to hang around, delay treatment, for a chat with your buddy? Instead you send in some prepubescent Resident who upsets the kid, so he sets the curtains on fire.
not_available He set the curtains on fire because you left him alone.
not_available Chandler comes in on a curbside he won't write anything in the chart or follow
not_available up.
not_available Where does that leave the kid? Where's he left now? His mother took him out of here AMA.
not_available And whose fault is that? The Psych Resident wasn't managing this case.
not_available You were.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Doug.
not_available I said that I'm off! 
not_available Doug, come on.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Did I miss something here today? Let's just say that the last train to Milwaukee is in 48 minutes and I plan to be on it.
not_available So now is not a good time to tell you about a blunt trauma to the chest pulling up? See you tomorrow.
not_available You okay? I'm afraid to move.
not_available Every time I do, she starts to cry.
not_available It's an amazing sound, really.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available I got two at home.
not_available And a new one on the way.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I didn't even know.
not_available No one does.
not_available I guess I just announced it.
not_available But when you gotta move them, you gotta move them.
not_available Take your chances.
not_available Oh, Conni, I'm sorry about my attitude today in that trauma.
not_available You were pretty pissy, all right.
not_available But it was worth it just to see you take that green splash.
not_available Here.
not_available Wanna try a handoff? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shooting! We need a 12
not_available lead EKG on him.
not_available Let this be a lesson, Daniel.
not_available Never try to catch a running back with your chest.
not_available I can't breathe too well here.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available You're gonna be okay.
not_available It's just a bruise? 
not_available He's hyperventilating.
not_available You would be too if you took a helmet to your solar plexus.
not_available Get a pulse ox.
not_available BP's falling, 70/40.
not_available Pulse ox is 92.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Put him on a mask.
not_available Six liters.
not_available Is something wrong? 
not_available Yeah, Dan, you should've tackled lower.
not_available Blood gas is back.
not_available PO
not_available 2, 65.
not_available PCO
not_available 2, 28.
not_available pH, 7.48.
not_available He's hyperventilating, but his PO
not_available 2 is way too low.
not_available Shortness of breath, acute hypoxia in an otherwise healthy 15year
not_available old.
not_available JVD, muffled heart sounds, crashing BP.
not_available Pericardial tamponade? Blunt trauma? 
not_available It happens.
not_available What's a pericardial tamponade? Is that something bad? I can't breathe too well.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Twelvelead? 
not_available No time.
not_available Pericardiocentesis tray.
not_available It's a bizarre thing, Daniel, which makes you a bizarre guy.
not_available But we like that about you.
not_available There's bleeding in the sac around your heart, so it's not beating right.
not_available We're gonna numb the area and then we're gonna insert a needle and drain the blood.
not_available You're gonna stick a needle in my heart? Don't worry, I've done it a thousand times.
not_available John, move in for a better look.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm using a subxiphoid approach.
not_available Forty
not_available five degree angle.
not_available We're aiming at the left shoulder drawing back as you advance the needle.
not_available Cool.
not_available See, Dan, there's nothing to it.
not_available BP's coming up, 100/60.
not_available Mark, didn't you say something about catching a train? 
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available When were you gonna tell me? I tried, Susie.
not_available I really did.
not_available Hey, I got another job for a couple days, waitressing.
not_available Made 110 bucks.
not_available School was too hard.
not_available They had all these different programs.
not_available You had to move this file into this file.
not_available It made me feel so stupid.
not_available All the other girls in the class already knew how to type and how to write business letters.
not_available I thought a letter was, like, a letter.
not_available They had all the right clothes.
not_available I didn't have any of that stuff, except for what I borrowed from you.
not_available Even then, it doesn't look right on me.
not_available I really wanted this.
not_available For Susie.
not_available And to show you that I could do it.
not_available I didn't tell you because I knew that I would disappoint you.
not_available And because I thought that just maybe this time I wasn't gonna screw up.
not_available But What happened to the waitressing job? Good night, Chloe.
not_available Hold on! Hey, wait! Damn! Enjoying the view? I'm glad you came by.
not_available I wasn't sure you would.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd want me to.
not_available No, no, no, I'm glad.
not_available Look, you know, Jeanie, I thought I could do this, but We can't.
not_available I know.
not_available We talked about all this before.
not_available It's just, it's hard.
not_available Yeah, well, so is this.
not_available You gotta tell him.
not_available You gotta tell him.
