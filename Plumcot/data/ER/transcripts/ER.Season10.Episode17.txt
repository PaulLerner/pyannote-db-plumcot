not_available I couldn't.
not_available No.
not_available You can't take no for an answer when you have an unstable patient.
not_available I gave her the order.
not_available I thought you said morphine.
not_available Neela saw it was contra
not_available indicated, so I changed it.
not_available And what? You forgot? I was a bit preoccupied.
not_available Had someone crashing in CT.
not_available Dr.
not_available GallantMyoclonus and hyper
not_available reflexia here.
not_available Isn't there a serotonin antagonist we can give him? 
not_available We just have to wait.
not_available For what? To see if he lives.
not_available When can I go? Talk to the police first.
not_available The police? About my mugging? Yeah.
not_available Still haven't left? 
not_available I don't wanna talk about it.
not_available I am going to kill you.
not_available Baby, please, I am sorry.
not_available Listen.
not_available Come on.
not_available Don't be like that.
not_available Who knew that guy was such a whack? How does a guy get to be such a freak? Born with a Ychromosome? Oh, so all men are twisted? 
not_available You said it.
not_available You hate men? If it weren't for sperm and heavy lifting, you'd all be useless.
not_available I can't wait to pop this baby out so men will quit looking at me like I'm Mother Teresa or the Maxim cover.
not_available It's not just men.
not_available The world is full of degenerates.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And the sad part is they always get away with it.
not_available Get him! Get him! Get him! Temp's still up, 104.
not_available Another 200 of IV dantrolene.

not_available You're right.
not_available It was more like 10:45.
not_available Pulse ox down to 82.
not_available He's not moving any air.
not_available Too much Ativan? Or neurologic damage from hyperthermia.
not_available Let's open an intubation tray bag him on 100 percent.
not_available His wife and daughter are here.
not_available Suction's ready.
not_available Call Respiratory for a vent.

not_available So I've got our problem solved.
not_available Alex's birthday party.
not_available Thanks for the help, Luka.

not_available You see, that's your first mistake.
not_available Anyway, a plan is in motion, arrangements are being made and everything is under control.
not_available Keegan's CBC isn't back yet and I need a head CT on Hong.
not_available Do me a favor? Check my departure time? What, are you flying through Paris? 
not_available Amsterdam.
not_available Hello! 
not_available Frank.
not_available Hey, Frank.
not_available What's up? How are you? 
not_available Thought I'd stop on my way from rehab.
not_available How's that going? 
not_available How do you think? They split me open like a Montana trout.
not_available You don't just bounce back, you know? Wanna see my scar? 
not_available No.
not_available Guy in Two might wanna touch it.
not_available You look good.
not_available You do.
not_available I can do two miles on the treadmill.
not_available I haven't been able to do that since, well, ever.
not_available Where are my last two paychecks? 
not_available Been holding them for you.
not_available Where? In your wallet? 
not_available When are you coming back? I don't know.
not_available Rehab's like a vacation, my old police benefits are a charm I don't really miss this sideshow.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Pratt around? 
not_available He's off today.
not_available Tell him I owe him a beer.
not_available Sure thing.
not_available My doctor's not ready for me to come back to work yet.
not_available It's gonna be a while.
not_available But I do miss everybody.
not_available I just wanted to say that.

not_available No.
not_available Always been healthy.

not_available seven systolic.
not_available How are you doing, Tevin? 
not_available I don't like horses.
not_available He's altered.
not_available Have an intubation tray ready and squeeze in those fluids.
not_available Do you know what this is? 
not_available Your son's spleen is enlarged.
not_available It may be acting like a sponge, soaking up his blood so it can't circulate.
not_available So, what can you do to stop it? Hopefully transfusions will keep him stable until we know the cause.
not_available First liter in.
not_available Pulse in the 70s.
not_available Okay, keep the NS coming.
not_available Femoral
not_available line kit.
not_available I'm with him every day.
not_available I take care of him.
not_available Nothing like this has ever happened.
not_available Does your son have a history of thalassemia or sickle cell disease? My wife has the trait, I tested negative.
not_available I wanna go on a Ferris wheel.
not_available As soon as you're better, buddy.
not_available I don't know what that other thing is.
not_available Thalassemia.
not_available It's a hereditary anemia.

not_available Talking to him's the best thing you can do.
not_available Blood's here.
not_available Line's in.
not_available Run them on the infuser.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Add a sickle screen and HIV to the labs.
not_available We didn't realize Luis was recently put on phenelzine.
not_available An interaction between the drugs creates the condition serotonin syndrome.
not_available You get very sick.
not_available Like when they gave him the morphine? Worse.
not_available You get high fever, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, muscle spasms.
not_available How long does that last? 
not_available A few days at least.
not_available But it's very serious.
not_available Up to 30 percent of the people with serotonin syndrome die from it.
not_available So 70 percent survive? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available They didn't think he'd ever wake up after the fall, but he did.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available That means he's a fighter.
not_available He's really smart, you know? I mean, he was gonna go back to school before the accident.
not_available Then I got pregnant again.
not_available My dad hired him on at his roofing business.
not_available Don't usually work when it's icy.
not_available But there was a job that he wanted to finish before Christmas.
not_available Why say you did this? 
not_available It doesn't change anything.
not_available I'm partially to blame.
not_available It's okay to lie? Do you want to match or not? 
not_available Only if I deserve to.
not_available You do.
not_available So let this be my fault.
not_available Patellar dislocation in Curtain 4 needs a reduction.
not_available How's Luis? 
not_available He's stable.
not_available It's looking pretty good.
not_available Is there something I should know about? 
not_available No.
not_available You did what you were told.
not_available Gallant's supervising resident.
not_available Should have known not to order up a drug without a medical history.
not_available He didn't.
not_available I did.
not_available You ordered the Demerol? I assessed it, I ordered it, I pushed it.
not_available And you didn't run it by an Attending or a Resident? 
not_available No.
not_available Because I asked you to be autonomous? Found an Arabic interpreter for your belly
not_available pain lady.
not_available Thank you.
not_available All right, we need to talk about this, the three of us.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Fantastic.
not_available Oh, Lavecchia's results.
not_available Kidney stone from this morning.
not_available No hydro, pain
not_available free with Toradol and ready to go home just like you said.
not_available Didn't need the Demerol after all.
not_available Still have the vial? 
not_available I'll put it back in lockup.
not_available I used it for a patient.
not_available Sam, did you get labs back on Tevin? How's Tevin doing? 
not_available He's doing much better.
not_available I wanna go home.
not_available Mr.
not_available Walker.
not_available Hey, wanna pick out a sticker? Tevin tested positive for sickle cell anemia.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available I told you I don't carry the gene.
not_available Maybe there was a mistake with your test.
not_available Maybe there was a mistake with your test.
not_available What your son has, splenic sequestration, is consistent with sickle cell.
not_available A form that's very manageable.
not_available You're not listening.
not_available I told you I went to a genetic counselor.
not_available He said I'm not a carrier that our son could not get the disease unless both parents are.
not_available That's true.
not_available So what? You're saying I'm not his father? What I'd like to do is send his blood for a more advanced test.
not_available Just to be sure.
not_available Send my blood too.
not_available Test me again.
not_available Neela.
not_available Carter wants to talk to me after my shift.
not_available I told him what happened.
not_available You what? I didn't think it was right for us to lie about it.
not_available Nobody needed to know.
not_available That was the point.
not_available Please, someone! Please help! Something's wrong! He went into V
not_available tach.
not_available Unsuccessful cardioversion at 200.
not_available Get him off the vent, bag him! 
not_available Please.
not_available He can't die.
not_available Charge to 300.
not_available Clear.
not_available No change.
not_available Try 360.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available Amp of epi after the next one.
not_available Charged.
not_available Clear.
not_available V
not_available fib, 100 of lidocaine.
not_available This is not supposed to happen.
not_available Go and find Dr.

not_available Let's go, 360 again.
not_available Clear.
not_available Come on, hit him again, 360.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still in fib.
not_available Three sixty again.
not_available Clear.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How long has it been? Shall we try the highdose epi? Forty
not_available two minutes.
not_available Run the dopamine.
not_available We still have time.
not_available Or we can pace him.
not_available Neela.
not_available Let's try pacing him.
not_available Tie off the lines leave the ET for the coroner.
not_available Carter, inform the family and then meet us.
not_available Are his tests back? They confirmed my diagnosis.
not_available The good thing is most kids do very well with folate and prophylactic antibiotics.
not_available Good.
not_available That's good.
not_available I also ran your blood through.
not_available The tests indicate that
not_available Is there anything affecting my health that I need to know about? Not really.
not_available No.
not_available All that piece of paper is gonna tell me is whether or not he's got my genes.
not_available Either way, he's still my son.
not_available I'm his father.
not_available From a medical standpoint, it's a bit more complicated.
not_available Liza My wife and I, we We went through a rough patch about five years ago.
not_available We broke up for a few weeks.
not_available She got pregnant right after we got back together.
not_available We've been happy ever since.
not_available She's gonna want to know about Tevin's condition.
not_available I'll tell her that I'm a carrier.
not_available He got it from both of us.
not_available And he's gonna be okay.
not_available He's in here, Mrs.
not_available Walker.
not_available Honey, is he all right? 
not_available He's fine.
not_available He's fine.
not_available Did you get his labs back? Is he the father? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, I didn't mean to keep ragging on your suggestions before.
not_available Maybe Mr.
not_available Jekyll's isn't a bad idea.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hyde's.
not_available Look, I know I'm not exactly Carol Brady.
not_available So I really wanted it to be special.
not_available It will be.
not_available Be ready to go in a half
not_available hour.
not_available I have to pick something up, okay? Was the med list current? I think we should stick to protocol.
not_available As the Attending, I'd like to review this with my staff before we do this.
not_available Was the med list current or not? It was recent.
not_available It wasn't completely up to date.
not_available And no one checked with the nursing home? 
not_available I tried.
not_available You tried? Abby, why didn't you push the meds? 
not_available I was called out.
not_available But the result wouldn't have been any different.
not_available As the nurse, it's your responsibility to double
not_available check allergies and interactions.
not_available I thought that had been done to the
not_available It's a case of managing a patient's pain with incomplete information.
not_available I suspect a jury won't see it that way.
not_available Who made the decision? 
not_available I did.
not_available You did? So now we let medical students push pain meds without supervision? 
not_available That's not what happened.
not_available I was with a patient.
not_available Neela did exactly what I told her.
not_available Actually, that's not
not_available You need a few minutes to get your story straight? What does it say in the chart? Exactly what I've been saying.
not_available I ordered the drug, and Neela pushed it.
not_available And is that accurate? Like I said, I wasn't in the room.
not_available Simple question.
not_available Is it accurate? 
not_available As far as I know yes.
not_available A young man comes in here and dies of a lethal drug reaction that could have been prevented with one phone call.
not_available Next time why don't we just send a blank check to the family's attorney? Mom! Mom! 
not_available Son of Sam is back.
not_available Mom! What are you doing here? 
not_available Luka picked me up.
not_available It's amazing! We gotta go, though! 
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll take those.
not_available If we hurry, we can get there by 11.
not_available What are you talking about? What are you wearing? Luka said I have to wear a life vest for the boat.
not_available Boat? What boat? Isn't it awesome? It's bigger than our whole apartment.
not_available Wow.
not_available You really went a whole other direction.
not_available A weekend in the great outdoors.
not_available Fishing, camping, burning s' mores.
not_available S' mores.
not_available Do you know what that is? 
not_available White thing on a stick.
not_available Come on, you gotta see inside.
not_available Wait.
not_available Where are we going? 
not_available I rented a spot at Lake Geneva.
not_available Bottom of the ninth, two outs, nobody on and here comes Kovac with a clutch home run.
not_available Is that baseball? How you gonna back this thing out? Mr.
not_available Joss's triple
not_available A repair went well.
not_available He's stable in the ICU.
not_available And Dr.
not_available Edson's finishing up on the perirectal abscess right now.
not_available And do you know a good cheap red wine that goes with spicy food? I have a date.
not_available Two nights in a row.
not_available It's with the teacher tonight.
not_available Okay.
not_available Zinfandel.
not_available I'm not completely comfortable with waking up with one man and going out with another the next night.
not_available Well, if we were guys, we'd be talking about carburetors right now.
not_available So you don't think it's slutty? No.
not_available I just won't sleep with him.
not_available That sounds like a good plan.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Women plan, God laughs.
not_available Hey, when did I become the guru of sluttiness? Did you start that banana bag on Vern? 
not_available Three times.
not_available He keeps going off to the bathroom and coming back drunk.
not_available I think I should delete emergency medicine from my match list.
not_available One mistake.
not_available I pushed you too hard.
not_available No.
not_available What they said about me in your meeting was all true.
not_available Look, you're a talented doctor.
not_available And you did a lot of good things today.
not_available Nothing I did on this shift can convince me or anyone else that I belong here.
not_available Yesterday you were a little too cautious.
not_available Today you were a little too reckless.
not_available Somewhere in the middle is the way to practice emergency medicine.
not_available I just want you to know I shouldn't have left you alone with the patient until he was stable.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available What you did was the sweetest, dumbest thing anyone has done for me.
not_available Well, something like this could have derailed your career.
not_available Worst that'll happen to me is discipline, counseling.
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available You don't look all right.
not_available Seems kind of silly now, but out in the bay this morning, I was I was thinking about asking you out.
not_available I was thinking of saying yes.
not_available I have that cefoxitin for Mr.
not_available Martin.
not_available I just need the extension tubing.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Let me help you find it.
not_available I said I can do it! Bottom drawer.
not_available Well I suppose it's time to call it a night.
not_available You're welcome to stay a little longer.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I really should get going.
not_available I'll get my coat.
not_available I'll help you find it.
not_available It was such a lovely evening.
not_available And I am so glad that the girls like each other.
not_available Ella's a great kid.
not_available Oh, and it was really good of you to pick her up from school.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available You want me to carry her to the car for you? No, no.
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available I can manage.
not_available So good night.
not_available You should have come and talked to me.
not_available You know why I backed you up in there? Because if Weaver knew the truth you'd be done.
not_available I know you went out on a limb for me but I could just say I got confused.
not_available You could have.
not_available Until you falsified the chart.
not_available But 
not_available That's a felony.
not_available Okay.
not_available Then I gotta go tear it up.
not_available Too late.
not_available Why? Why? It's just one entry on an otherwise blank order sheet, okay? Nobody's gonna know it's missing.
not_available We can talk to Weaver again.
not_available It's too late! It's already up in Legal.
not_available You know, you guys sit up there and you decide who's gonna go and who's gonna stay.
not_available I mean, why did you have to push her? Why'd you have to push her?! The only reason she screwed up is you made her think she wasn't good enough! She wasn't cutting it! We're talking about you now, Michael.
not_available I wasn't thinking.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
