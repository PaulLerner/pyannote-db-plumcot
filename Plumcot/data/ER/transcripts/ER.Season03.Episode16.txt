
not_available Previously on ER When are you coming back? 
not_available The hearing is in a couple of weeks.
not_available Nurse Hathaway is doing fine on her own.
not_available Why two women on one night? Scheduling mix
not_available up.
not_available I thought we were going out? 
not_available Before or after the basketball game? I just took out your appendix.
not_available I'm afraid of liking you too much.
not_available We're going to intubate him.
not_available He doesn't want that.
not_available Intubate him.
not_available Mom? Oh, did I wake you? What are you doing? 
not_available I'm making you breakfast.
not_available Where's the coffee? How are you feeling? Sleeping okay? 
not_available Like a baby.
not_available No nightmares? 
not_available No.
not_available It would only be natural.
not_available I see worse things at work every day.
not_available Today's the big day, right? 
not_available The test? No, find out about your job.
not_available They suspended me.
not_available I might not get my job back.
not_available Those eggs done? 
not_available No, still too runny.
not_available I like them runny.
not_available Just another couple of minutes.
not_available What test? 
not_available Medical school admissions test, Mom.
not_available I thought you gave up on that.
not_available No.
not_available Big commitment.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Perfect.
not_available Doctor.
not_available That would be something.
not_available I could do it.
not_available I knew you could.
not_available Why do you always do that? Make me feel incapable, stupid.
not_available I just said that you could do it.
not_available I wish you could believe in me.
not_available You're always criticizing me, belittling me.
not_available Why didn't you tell me I could be an astronaut? Did you want to be that? 
not_available I wanted you to tell me I could.
not_available Fine.
not_available Go be an astronaut.
not_available I'm your mother, I love you whoever you 
are Doctor, nurse, housewife.
not_available Oh, right, housewife.
not_available You're the one that holds you back.
not_available You always quit things.
not_available You never think you're good enough.
not_available I finish things.
not_available Ballet, cheerleading, the flute.
not_available I was 13! 
not_available Business school, your own wedding.
not_available I finished nursing school.
not_available Right.
not_available Exactly.
not_available You have a great job you're good at.
not_available Why is the grass suddenly greener? I'm proud of you.
not_available Why aren't you proud of yourself? Carla! Carla! I was coming to see you.
not_available I didn't know you had to be at work this early.
not_available I don't.
not_available I'm sorry I haven't called.
not_available A lot of stuff came up.
not_available I just had a lot of stuff going on.
not_available I had a minor surgery and 
not_available Sorry to hear that.
not_available Are you okay? Yes.
not_available It was just my appendix.
not_available What about you? What do you want? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available I told you I was pregnant weeks ago.
not_available Then nothing.
not_available No phone calls, no coming by to see how I was doing.
not_available I got the point.
not_available I wasn't trying to make a point! I realize there's going to be a baby, and he will be my responsibility too.
not_available I just needed some time to think about this.
not_available It's not the way I would've planned it, but you're not doing this alone.
not_available Are you going to marry me, Peter? 
not_available That's not what I'm saying.
not_available What are you saying? Are you going to stop by and change some nappies and stay for some Kodak moments? The child will need a good school and a nice place to live.
not_available Can't I provide that? 
not_available I can help, Carla.
not_available Money.
not_available So that is what this is all about.
not_available Yes.
not_available That among other things.
not_available The child will need a man in his life.
not_available Who says the baby will not have a man in its life? Are you seeing somebody else? Peter, you and I have known each other for a very long time.
not_available I never expected you to marry me.
not_available I never expected a damn thing from you.
not_available You care about you.
not_available And that is the way it's always going to be.
not_available But it's comforting, really.
not_available It's one of the few constants in my life.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available This baby is going to be fine.
not_available Plenty to eat, nice clothes, a man to call dad.
not_available I'll take care of that.
not_available You go back to worrying about yourself.
not_available That's what you do best.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton! First day back.
not_available How's the incision healing? 
not_available I'm fine, Carter.
not_available You shouldn't be back yet.
not_available Have you finished the whole course of antibiotics? Hi, Peter, how's the scar? I made a Rocky
not_available Davis incision, running stitch, McBurney's point.
not_available When the hair grows back, the itching starts.
not_available You're going to show us your scar, Peter? Let's see! Yes, let's take a look.
not_available I did it one
not_available handed.
not_available Stop, Carter! 
not_available That's a shame.
not_available It's a great job.
not_available Good thing I took pictures.
not_available What is that, a mole? 
not_available Good morning.
not_available What are you doing? Good God, what is that? 
not_available Benton's appendix in a jar.
not_available Wow, they shaved him good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter we're still backed up.
not_available Okay, I'm on my way.
not_available Carter looks beat.
not_available He was on again last night.
not_available Surgical interns still cover Dr.
not_available Gant's shifts.
not_available Sounds like a 90
not_available hour week.
not_available More like 95.
not_available Thank God for Pediatrics.
not_available What is that all about? Nurses and management are still at the table.
not_available Contract expires at midnight.
not_available Mark, paramedics are pulling up with a female, 35, respiratory failure.
not_available Duty calls.
not_available Hey, lunch? 
not_available Lf you're buying.
not_available Carol's back today? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Investigation is done, Nursing has the report.
not_available Have you seen it? 
not_available No.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available She says she's fine.
not_available Okay, Jeff, thanks.
not_available Nothing yet.
not_available They're still at it.
not_available I don't want to walk a picket line.
not_available Not in February.
not_available We stay firm.
not_available Easy for you to say.
not_available They'll settle.
not_available They can't run the place without us.
not_available That's what the air traffic controllers said before parking cars for a living.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Down's patient, 37.
not_available Found in bed with respiratory distress.
not_available Resps shallow at 30.
not_available BP's 100/50.
not_available Mom said she's had an infection, but she never fully recovered.
not_available Where's the mother now? 
not_available She followed in her car.
not_available Two
not_available plus pitting edema! Louise, I'm Doctor Greene.
not_available You have a little trouble breathing? We're going to make you feel better.
not_available She's scared.
not_available She held my hand all the way.
not_available Louise, can you tell me what day it is? You can't tell me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle, can you take a listen? 
not_available Chuny, come and hold Louise's hand.
not_available You bet.
not_available CBC, lytes, EKG, chest film, O
not_available 2, 6 liters by mask.
not_available Hi, Louise.
not_available My name is Chuny.
not_available S3 gallop and mitral regurg? Possible cardiomyopathy.
not_available Mark, she's trying to say something.
not_available Louise do you need something? What's wrong? 
not_available Where's my mom? Your mom is coming real soon.
not_available Okay? Don't worry.
not_available You can just relax.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Human Resources reviewed your incident report in ER procedures.
not_available They passed our recommendations to the Safety Committee.
not_available And? 
not_available They agreed with us.
not_available Your mistake was a result of systems problems and not negligence.
not_available There will be a written warning in your file for a year.
not_available The three weeks you missed will be deducted from your vacation time.
not_available That's it? 
not_available You preferred a public flogging? You can start back today.
not_available You don't have to start back today.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available I better get back to work.
not_available La Boh áme! 
not_available You make it sound like a bacteria.
not_available What is it? Like five hours long? 
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'm not an opera fan.
not_available Marcus Roberts tickets on the contrary I got it, Greg.
not_available You don't want to go.
not_available Fine.
not_available Is La Boh áme the one where they lop off the nuns' heads at the end? It's set in Paris.
not_available There's star
not_available crossed lovers and artists.
not_available Jeanie, hang on.
not_available If you want to go, we'll go.
not_available Don't do me any favors.
not_available I'd love to go.
not_available I just thought we could do something spontaneous.
not_available Opera? 
not_available I have to get back to my patient.
not_available Let's hang out anyway.
not_available We'll order food.
not_available Watch the Bulls
not_available Warriors game.
not_available You think you're charming, but you're not.
not_available Lunch then? Please let me buy you lunch.
not_available Jeanie! 
not_available That's one boggy heart.
not_available It's taking up most of her chest.
not_available EKG shows ST and T wave changes.
not_available What do you want to do? Get an echo and page Cardiology.
not_available Mark, Louise's mother is here.
not_available Hi, Mrs.
not_available Cupertino, I'm Mark Greene.
not_available How's Louise? 
not_available Not good.
not_available Her heart isn't pumping well, and her lungs are filling with fluid.
not_available Can I say hello? 
not_available Yes, sure.
not_available Hello, Louise.
not_available It's Mommy.
not_available Hi, Mommy.
not_available Are you okay? You're not scared, are you? I brought some of her things.
not_available Just to make her feel more at home.
not_available I'll just put this quilt on her.
not_available Make sure she's good and warm.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Cupertino, can I speak to you? She had trouble understanding me.
not_available Can she communicate? Oh, yes.
not_available She likes to talk.
not_available Is she suffering from any dementia or Alzheimer's? No, she's a good girl.
not_available Echo's on its way.
not_available Is she competent to make her own medical decisions? No.
not_available I'm her guardian.
not_available Louise can't make decisions on her own.
not_available You are aware that Louise's condition is very serious.
not_available Louise may need a heart transplant.
not_available Is she on the waiting list? 
not_available The list? No.
not_available She's not? They wouldn't put her on the list.
not_available They wouldn't put Louise on the heart transplant waiting list? My daughter is mentally retarded, doctor.
not_available Peter, sorry to keep you waiting.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available We've missed you.
not_available I was surprised not to see my name on today's schedule.
not_available How are you feeling? Well rested? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And mentally? Feeling sharp? No postoperative depression? 
not_available No.
not_available No depression of any kind? Dr.
not_available Hicks, if you're asking if I can perform my duties adequately, I can.
not_available I'm asking how you are, Peter.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Okay, then, let's see what we've got.
not_available It's two PortA
not_available Caths, a circumcision and nevus removal.
not_available A mole? They can't refuse to put her on the list because she has Down's.
not_available There must be other circumstances.
not_available She's a retard, so why bother.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kayson.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle.
not_available Echo shows left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 18%.
not_available There are also signs of wall
not_available motion abnormality.
not_available I'm worried about her breathing.
not_available We've given her 40 Lasix, she's still struggling.
not_available I'd like to try a vasodilator.
not_available Sure.
not_available Do whatever you can to make her comfortable before you release her.
not_available She will be a lot happier at home with her mother.
not_available She needs a heart transplant, right? That would be the standard operative course, yes.
not_available Louise's mother told us that she's not on the transplant list.
not_available UNOS can't refuse to put a patient on the list because of a birth defect.
not_available UNOS didn't refuse, we did.
not_available Cardiology? Hospital Transplant Committee.
not_available We chose not to submit her name to UNOS.
not_available That's a death sentence.
not_available She's a 37year
not_available old Down's patient.
not_available She is lucky to have lived this long.
not_available Down's patients can live to be 60.
not_available That's extremely rare.
not_available What are you, an intern? First
not_available year resident.
not_available Why don't we step in here? Dr.
not_available Kayson, Dr.
not_available Doyle's expressing a frustration I think we all feel.
not_available Louise is an obvious candidate for the UNOS transplant list.
not_available I'm a cardiologist.
not_available I'd like nothing better than to give her a new heart.
not_available If you have a problem with the decision, speak to the committee.
not_available Short of that, send her home.
not_available Nice guy.
not_available Carol, are you back? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you, Jesus.
not_available Hey, you all, Carol's back.
not_available Carol, you're back.
not_available Starting now.
not_available We've missed you.
not_available Thought we'd never make it.
not_available Did they dock your pay? 
not_available No, just some vacation time.
not_available It's been a disaster without you.
not_available A complete zoo.
not_available I didn't do that bad a job.
not_available No, you did worse than that.
not_available Call union meetings after work, Haleh.
not_available Carol's back.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available We'll talk to you at lunch.
not_available We'll catch up later.
not_available We're glad to have you back.
not_available Are you okay? I'm sorry to disappoint everyone's expectations, but I'm fine.
not_available It started a few hours ago after breakfast.
not_available Is it a sharp pain? 
not_available No.
not_available Sort of all over.
not_available I just started my morning walk.
not_available Any recent illness? I take digoxin for atrial fibril I can never say that word.
not_available Fibrillation.
not_available Anything else? 
not_available No.
not_available What did you have for breakfast? 
not_available The usual.
not_available Three fried eggs, bacon, glass of buttermilk, toast and jam.
not_available The American Heart Association breakfast.
not_available Don't lecture me.
not_available My mother had the same every day in her life.
not_available She died last year at 96.
not_available Car accident.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available 130/90.
not_available Heart rate, 110.
not_available Resps, 24.
not_available Did Dr.
not_available Weaver get a CBC? Yes.
not_available Crit's 53.
not_available White count is 12.2.
not_available You drink enough fluids? Is that what's wrong with me? 
not_available Too early to tell.
not_available Chest film? 
not_available Not back yet.
not_available I'm going to call for a surgical colleague to come and take a look.
not_available Her breathing's improved.
not_available Hey, Louise, feeling better? 
not_available For you.
not_available She likes to share.
not_available Malibu Barbie was my favorite too.
not_available I was more partial to Ken.
not_available You don't like Ken? 
not_available Too pretty.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available Ken is trouble.
not_available Louise, can you hold on to her while I do my work? She misses her friends since she got sick and had to move back home.
not_available She had her own place? 
not_available An apartment above the garage.
not_available And she had a job at the Jewel helping people with their groceries.
not_available Father even let her be an altar girl at the church.
not_available Everybody loves her.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I got that list from upstairs.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Transplant Committee? Who are the bastards? Excuse us.
not_available Your attitudes can get in the way of achieving your goals.
not_available You're not going to vote for me for homecoming queen this year? Like that, you mean.
not_available Recognize any names? 
not_available One.
not_available The vanquished return victorious.
not_available Hey, Doug, you miss me? You have no idea.
not_available I heard they clipped you for some vacation time.
not_available I never take it anyway.
not_available I think I have a couple of years saved up.
not_available This place is a mess.
not_available How are you doing? No complaints.
not_available Today is the 20th, isn't it? 
not_available I think so.
not_available MCATs are this afternoon.
not_available Are you going? 
not_available Got to work.
not_available All that savedup vacation time? 
not_available It was a stupid idea.
not_available Four years of med school if I ever get in.
not_available All that debt.
not_available I would be 50 by the time I got out.
not_available What's the point? I could bring you coffee in the middle of the night to the med library.
not_available I could teach you how to cheat on the biochem exams.
not_available Doug.
not_available They need you at Pedes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Carter, where have you been? 
not_available Getting some food.
not_available Do you have a spoon? No.
not_available Anspaugh's in there with your patient.
not_available Said you paged him.
not_available I paged Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available You got Anspaugh and the rounds.
not_available What do you hear, Edson? 
not_available Rales at the base of the lungs.
not_available I'm sorry to have dragged you down here, I paged Dr.
not_available Hicks for a consult.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks is in surgery, and we were on the prowl for an interesting case.
not_available We heard you had a surgical abdomen.
not_available That's my suspicion.
not_available Pain vague and diffuse, very little tenderness to palpation.
not_available Chest films show bibasilar effusions.
not_available Rales heard on auscultation.
not_available Would you consider this a surgical patient, Dr.
not_available Edson? 
not_available No, I'd bet on CHF.
not_available Yes, but I was more concerned with the CBC.
not_available Previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation? Her diet? I'd assume that she went into fib or ate a salty meal.
not_available And that was enough to push her into congestive heart failure demonstrated by the rales and chest effusions.
not_available The diffuse abdominal pain is probably due to congestion in the liver.
not_available In other words, congestive heart failure secondary to a
not_available fib.
not_available Wouldn't you agree, Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Yes, that sounds about right.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Pomerantz available? I'm Mark Greene from the ER.
not_available Does she know you? 
not_available Yes, Steph, I do.
not_available Hi.
not_available You got a minute? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Just move those, put them anywhere.
not_available What can I do for you? You're on the committee that evaluates prospective transplant patients? I have a dying patient, Louise Cupertino.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kayson tells me that she was denied access to the UNOS list.
not_available Kayson made it sound like she wasn't excluded for medical reasons.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available Kayson said yes.
not_available If I can get you and another person to sign on, Louise can get a new heart.
not_available Our decisions must be unanimous.
not_available But I'm the one that turned Louise down.
not_available Do you know how many people die each year because of lack of organs? 
not_available 3500.
not_available She had a job, an apartment.
not_available Is her life less worthy than a smoking businessman with wife and kids? Don't patronize me.
not_available I agonized over this.
not_available Louise has an IQ of 40.
not_available She can't comprehend the surgical risks.
not_available She had a job, but she was always late.
not_available She can't tell the time.
not_available How is she going to adhere to the rigors of the post
not_available transplant regime? Her mother will make sure she gets her meds, get her where she needs to go.
not_available She's a 120pound 8year
not_available old.
not_available We do the operation, and assuming she doesn't die for lack of care she's in a state home in two years.
not_available And her mother's adamant she not end up in a home.
not_available Those are logical reasons we give ourselves so we can sleep at night.
not_available Louise can make people smile, she can laugh and cry and hold someone.
not_available I have an 8year
not_available old.
not_available If she never grew a day older I would still cherish every moment we've spent together.
not_available It's not our place to decide whether Louise lives or dies.
not_available She has as much right to be here as you do or I do.
not_available Nina, don't let her die.
not_available I'm freezing.
not_available I thought you liked picnics.
not_available I love picnics.
not_available I'm just not used to having to thaw my sandwich first.
not_available Where's your sense of spontaneity and romance? 
not_available This dip is frozen solid.
not_available It's a p ðt Á.
not_available It's a brick.
not_available Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available You're very romantic.
not_available You're very spontaneous and crazy.
not_available Please put your parka on before you freeze to death.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You can't be fine.
not_available It's 10 degrees.
not_available I think we should start sleeping together.
not_available What? 
not_available Sex.
not_available I think we should have some.
not_available In fact, I think we should have a lot.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available Hell, yes, I'm sure.
not_available This isn't a joke, Greg.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available Jeanie Boulet would you please sleep with me? How is she? 
not_available Her breathing is worse.
not_available How is the pain? 
not_available It hurts.
not_available Hi, who are you? 
not_available Her daughter, Yolanda.
not_available She's so stoic.
not_available If she says it hurts, it must be awful.
not_available Oh, God! Let me do a repeat CBC and a blood gas.
not_available Do you want to page Anspaugh? 
not_available No.
not_available Call Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available Tell her that I need her down here right away.
not_available My fianc Áe has been begging me for years to get this thing off.
not_available Betadine.
not_available I'm not very religious, but her family wouldn't even consider the marriage if I didn't convert.
not_available It's cold.
not_available I wouldn't have started dating her if I knew this was part of the deal.
not_available Lidocaine.
not_available You'll feel a small prick in the area to be anesthetized.
not_available Please don't move.
not_available Good, you haven't started yet.
not_available I have three eager pre
not_available med students from Evanston.
not_available I thought they might enjoy watching you perform a circumcision.
not_available Don't mind us, sir.
not_available I'm converting to Judaism.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks, phone call from the ER.
not_available Make them feel welcome.
not_available You're in very capable hands.
not_available Number 15 blade.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Someone paged me? 
not_available I paged you.
not_available Samantha Ewing.
not_available I've got a CF kid up here, Jad Heuston.
not_available Know him? He's been on a respirator for some weeks on his mother's request.
not_available Today's his 18th birthday, and he wants off.
not_available Why page me? 
not_available He wants you to do it.
not_available Hi, Norma.
not_available Hi, Katy.
not_available Happy birthday, Jad.
not_available His first act as an adult was to ask to be removed from the respirator.
not_available I explained the dangers, but he insisted.
not_available Are you still sure? The nature of his disease and the time he's been on the machine may cause him to die after some minutes.
not_available Can you talk to him? What's his tidal volume? Is this what you really want? Have you said your goodbyes? Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right, buddy.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available I'm going to count to three.
not_available You're going to take a deep breath.
not_available You're going to blow out while I pull.
not_available Can you give me a hand with this? I love you.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available On three.
not_available Ready? One, two, three.
not_available Blow, blow, blow.
not_available Is he going to be okay? Good afternoon.
not_available What could be so important? of abdominal pain five hours ago.
not_available Pain was vague and diffuse.
not_available Belly wasn't too tender.
not_available Takes digoxin for a previously diagnosed atrial fib.
not_available Rales.
not_available Chest x
not_available ray shows basilar infiltrates bilaterally.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh was here, and he diagnosed congestive heart failure diffuse abdominal pain due to congestion in liver secondary to CHF.
not_available We gave her 40 of Lasix.
not_available Good story.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available I think Dr.
not_available Anspaugh is wrong.
not_available Page Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, please.
not_available He's still at lunch with Weaver.
not_available Quickly.
not_available You have a better story.
not_available Her abdominal pain is worsening.
not_available Resps are 39, and she's acidotic.
not_available When she came in, she was dehydrated.
not_available So why's fluid on her lungs? The pain isn't explained by congestive heart failure.
not_available It doesn't add up.
not_available And what is your thinking? 
not_available She suffers from atrial fibrillation.
not_available That puts her at risk for developing clots.
not_available She threw an embolus and it's blocking her small bowel.
not_available What is going on? Dr.
not_available Carter believes that you diagnosed his patient incorrectly.
not_available Pain is worsening, resps are up to 39 and she's acidotic.
not_available CHF made sense earlier, but I think she has ischemic small bowel disease secondary to an embolism in the mesenteric artery.
not_available Pretty good story.
not_available Damn it! I diuresed her.
not_available Normal saline, 200 cc's per hour.
not_available Call the O.R., we're moving her now.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available Your mother needs an operation.
not_available She's going to be just fine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh, can I assist? 
not_available You're going to do it.
not_available Perform an embolectomy? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're the only one here who seems to know what they're doing.
not_available It's going to fall.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available She looks like she's feeling better.
not_available Yes, she ate a little bit.
not_available Seems to be breathing okay.
not_available Who's her friend? My brother.
not_available Mom brought him down, I figured Louise needed some company.
not_available Hey, Jimmy, say hello to Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He's my boss.
not_available Hi, Jimmy, how are you? 
not_available What did they say? Come here.
not_available Psych doesn't think she can handle post
not_available op regime and that the mother will be around long enough to get her through it.
not_available That's a lot of crap.
not_available She can go to a group home.
not_available Jimmy takes classes out of Glenkirk.
not_available Mom doesn't want her in a home.
not_available She has guardianship.
not_available I called Loyola and Rush.
not_available They both have transplant centers.
not_available Maybe they can get her on the list.
not_available Mark.
not_available Dr.
not_available Doyle, this is Dr.
not_available Pomerantz from Psych.
not_available She's the one that evaluated Louise.
not_available Hi, Louise.
not_available How are you doing? Mrs.
not_available Cupertino.
not_available She's doing better.
not_available She's out of heart failure.
not_available You need to fill this out.
not_available Transplant candidate registration form.
not_available She can't get on the network without it.
not_available Kayson filled out most of it.
not_available I need today's history so that I can rank her.
not_available Get it back to me soon.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available Nina thank you.
not_available Jad, why don't you come and go? You take off during the day and do what you want to do and when you come back, we hook you up with IV antibiotics.
not_available We get a PT to pound your chest in the morning.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It's a lot more comfortable.
not_available You might even squeak out a couple of extra weeks out of this thing.
not_available I said no, thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available Here is my beeper number.
not_available That's my home number.
not_available You can call me anytime, day or night.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Anywhere but here.
not_available Sorry, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I raided the cafeteria.
not_available Bought every cake they had.
not_available Ladies! Here's your cake.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available The nurses got their new contract.
not_available Did they get what they asked for? 
not_available Current employees are protected but the hospital wants to replace RNs with unlicensed technicians.
not_available Technicians? 
not_available It's the wave of the future.
not_available Come on, doctor.
not_available Dance.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available No, I'll get the next song.
not_available Have you seen Carol? She changed her mind and went home before lunch.
not_available I'm starving.
not_available Want a piece of cake? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Hey, I just dropped off all the paperwork with Nina Pomerantz.
not_available Louise will be on the transplant list tomorrow.
not_available All we can do is wait.
not_available Where's your brother? 
not_available In the lounge watching TV.
not_available Louise's mother won't sign the surgical release.
not_available Kayson was just here.
not_available She doesn't want Louise to have the transplant.
not_available Did he explain that she will die without the transplantation? Twice.
not_available Then I tried.
not_available She wants to take her home.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Cupertino you don't want Louise to have the operation? I was 41 years old when Louise was born.
not_available I knew right away that something was wrong.
not_available I couldn't see Louise, but I saw the doctor.
not_available He was frowning and snapping his fingers over the little bassinet.
not_available They took her away before I had the chance to see her.
not_available I thought maybe she'd died.
not_available Maybe the umbilical cord had gotten wrapped around her neck.
not_available Nobody told me anything.
not_available Then they put me in another room with mothers and their babies.
not_available And I waited there for hours until the doctor finally came back.
not_available He looked very sad.
not_available He told me that Louise was mongoloid.
not_available He said that I should put her in a state hospital and never ever see her again.
not_available She will die if she doesn't have this operation.
not_available We all die, doctor.
not_available Louise has been the light of my life for 37 years.
not_available God blessed me with this wonderful girl, and I wouldn't change a thing.
not_available I'm not going to be here much longer.
not_available I'm her whole life, just as she has always been mine.
not_available There are group homes.
not_available Places where she can make friends enjoy life, even if it is for only a few more years.
not_available I went to a home 20 years ago when my husband died.
not_available If something happened to me, who would take care of her? And there were women there like her with Down's wandering around half
not_available naked.
not_available They didn't even know their names.
not_available I couldn't put Louise in a place like that.
not_available You want to save people, doctor.
not_available If my daughter dies, you'll lose.
not_available But I'm not afraid of death.
not_available Jesus is there, waiting for us.
not_available To hold us and bring us into the light.
not_available To show us the kingdom of heaven.
not_available And if Louise dies before I do I know where I will see her next.
not_available With angels where she belongs.
not_available Because she is an angel.
not_available My angel.
not_available Something new? 
not_available Mesenteric embolectomy.
not_available Who's doing it? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter! 
not_available Just rolled the woman into 3.
not_available Sweet God in heaven.
not_available I hope someone's helping him.
not_available We're putting in a PortA
not_available Cath, a catheter used to deliver chemotherapy.
not_available Should you pursue a career in surgery, you'll perform this procedure dozens of times in your first year of residency.
not_available The position of the catheter must be checked with a fluoroscope.
not_available Does everyone know what a fluoroscope is? Here it is.
not_available Can I steal Debbie? We need her in O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available What's going on? Dr.
not_available Carter is performing a mesenteric embolectomy.
not_available By himself? 
not_available Anspaugh and Hicks are supervising.
not_available What's the score? 
not_available Bulls are down by one.
not_available Oh, what a nice shot.
not_available I let a kid with CF leave the hospital today.
not_available He's 18 years old.
not_available He went off to die with his girlfriend.
not_available Didn't want any help.
not_available Could you have done anything? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available I spent the day trying to get a CHF patient with Down's on the heart transplant list.
not_available Any luck? Mother wouldn't sign the surgical release.
not_available Fine couple of doctors we are.
not_available Do you remember when we were going to change the world? No.
not_available I was always in it for the money.
not_available All right.
not_available See you later.
not_available Want to grab a pizza? 
not_available No, I have to be someplace.
not_available Anybody I know? No, I'm just helping out an old friend.
not_available See you.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you ready to go? Where? 
not_available Dinner at Morton's and La Boh áme.
not_available I said we didn't want the tickets.
not_available I said you were wrong.
not_available I'm not dressed, we'll be late.
not_available You can tell me what we missed.
not_available What about the basketball game? 
not_available Taping it.
not_available You don't have to prove anything, Greg.
not_available I don't? 
not_available This has all been pretty fast.
not_available We can slow it down.
not_available Make sure it's right.
not_available So this means that we don't have to go to the opera? No, seriously.
not_available Can we just slow it down? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Waiting for you.
not_available Have you been waiting long? 
not_available Oh, a while.
not_available So you took it? 
not_available Yes, I did.
not_available And? 
not_available I knew a lot more than I thought.
not_available There were a lot of people taking it.
not_available Kids.
not_available I felt about 100 years old.
not_available They seemed confident and smart.
not_available I guessed a lot.
not_available I bet you did great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Was your day okay? 
not_available You know, just saving lives.
not_available Have you seen my mom? 
not_available I banged the door, nobody answered.
not_available Do you want to come in? I'll make some coffee.
not_available No, I can't.
not_available I'm up early.
not_available I'm going to go home.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you tomorrow then.
not_available Yes.
not_available Doug, I know everyone is worried about me but I'm fine.
not_available I was scared in that store, but I'm okay now.
not_available Why did you take it? 
not_available The MCATs? For me.
not_available I just wanted to see if I was good enough.
not_available You are.
not_available I love this place.
not_available You should, you're a wonderful surgeon.
not_available You belong here.
not_available You know, you were right this morning.
not_available I haven't slept much in the last few months since Gant's dying.
not_available Before that, me almost killing that baby and Keaton not recommending me Six months ago, I thought I was invincible.
not_available And now I don't even I don't even know.
not_available I guess life isn't working out the way I thought it would.
not_available You're not responsible for Dr.
not_available Gant's death, Peter.
not_available I could have stopped it.
not_available Told him he was doing well, encouraged him.
not_available I wish I could tell you that it was all intentional.
not_available That it was part of some master plan that I had going on.
not_available Truthfully, I never even thought about Gant.
not_available He was just an intern.
not_available I was more involved with my career, my ambitions.
not_available We all have to find our own way, Peter.
not_available You're not invincible.
not_available You're a young doctor.
not_available You're learning, making mistakes, saving lives.
not_available It takes a lifetime.
not_available You just have to have faith.
not_available Go home.
not_available You have got a busy day tomorrow.
not_available More circumcisions and PortA
not_available Caths? No.
not_available I've signed you up for a lap choly at 6 and I would appreciate it if you'd assist me on a splenectomy at 11.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available You're welcome, Peter.
not_available See you in the morning.
