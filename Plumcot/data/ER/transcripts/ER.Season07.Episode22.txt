not_available Yes.
not_available Sir, I'm sorry about that.
not_available Sir? Sir, I'm Officer Napolitano.
not_available You told the officer your assailant was Caucasian? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Did he wear a yellow windbreaker? Yeah, you know.
not_available How did you know that? I think he might have shot some people at a foster
not_available care facility.
not_available Same guy? 
not_available And three.
not_available Can you remember your license plate? 
not_available No.
not_available Pressure's down to 90.
not_available Two liters saline, wide open.
not_available But it's a black Acura Legend, correct? 
not_available What's wrong? You'll have to do this later.
not_available Check with DMV.
not_available Might be bleeding in your abdomen.
not_available How do you know for sure? 
not_available Let's get an ultrasound in here.
not_available It's a black Acura Legend? What? Yeah.

not_available 32 French.
not_available Wait.

not_available Luka, why'd you do that? 
not_available It was due Monday.
not_available I didn't want to turn it in.
not_available I thought you forgot.
not_available No.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available Why? Now they'll come after me for summer tuition.
not_available I can help you with the money.
not_available I don't want help.
not_available I just wanted to let it go.
not_available Then why did you fill it out? I'll get you some Xeroform.
not_available Lesion by the shoulder.
not_available The bullet passed mid
not_available shaft.
not_available This is much more proximal.
not_available Look at the lateral.
not_available It's in front of the bone.
not_available Could be soft
not_available tissue sarcoma.
not_available Get a biopsy.
not_available Is your kid stable?

not_available I just have to do an FNA.
not_available Clear the room.
not_available Next round coming in.
not_available Two more gunshot wounds.

not_available It's the same guy again.

not_available Found a mother and son shot inside.
not_available Did they get the shooter? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Do we have the ORs? 
not_available Cleaning two now.
not_available Peter still needs to go up.
not_available That leaves one.
not_available And Anspaugh should be finishing soon.
not_available Psych nurses aren't trained to handle ostomy care.
not_available If they need ostomy care, he can check his own damn bag.
not_available We need you.
not_available Two more GSWs rolling up.
not_available In a minute.
not_available Abby, let's go outside.
not_available And when I call you, you get on the phone! She was helping with the mass casualty.
not_available I needed to clear Recovery for the barrage of gunshot wounds you keep accepting! I'm not taking responsibility for post
not_available op complications in the psych ward! Well, then we'll have to find somebody who's interested in responsibility.
not_available What is that supposed to mean? 
not_available DeRaad can finish your shift.
not_available What? 
not_available Nice knowing you.
not_available GSW through the right lateral neck.
not_available Airway's clear.
not_available What's his pressure? 
not_available 110/70.
not_available Hi.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Ted.
not_available Ted, can you swallow for me? Where's my mom? Is all this his? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? No.
not_available His mom was wrapped around him.
not_available The bullet went through her into his neck.
not_available Mommy! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Get Dr.
not_available Weaver to scope him.
not_available He may need an esophagram.
not_available We're gonna take you inside.
not_available Okay, Ted? I think this is the lady that brought in your abused kid last week.
not_available Simple gunshot wound to the back.
not_available BP, 128/74.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Shayatovich.
not_available Where's Ted? Where's Ted? He's gonna be okay.
not_available There's another doctor looking at him.
not_available Please, help him.
not_available He was bleeding.
not_available His neck was bleeding.
not_available Who shot you, Mrs.
not_available Shayatovich? Derek.
not_available I told the policeman it was Derek Fossen.
not_available Your neighbor.
not_available He was looking for Ben.
not_available I told him I didn't know where he was.
not_available He said if I was gonna take his boy away he was gonna take mine from me.
not_available Please, please help him.
not_available He was bleeding.
not_available We're gonna take care of him.
not_available Let's get a HemoCue and a pulse ox.
not_available Roll her, roll her, roll her! Oh, God! That looks like about two liters.
not_available May be an aorta
not_available esophageal fistula.
not_available She's out.
not_available Okay, bag her.
not_available I'll intubate her inside.
not_available Get a thoracotomy tray and all the O
not_available negative we got.
not_available Fossen.
not_available Derek Fossen.
not_available FOSSE
not_available N.
not_available Looks like it was contained until it blew through the esophagus.
not_available Do you have an address? 
not_available He lives next door to her.
not_available Can't get a pressure.
not_available Squeeze in two units of O
not_available neg.
not_available I'm in.
not_available We put his son into protective custody.
not_available His name is Ben.
not_available He should be somewhere in the foster
not_available care system.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available All right.
not_available Rib spreader.
not_available Find the son.
not_available That's who he's looking for.
not_available Abby, get the infuser.
not_available Pressure's up to 120 after two liters.
not_available Do you need this? 
not_available No.
not_available Liver and spleen are intact.
not_available So maybe I'm not bleeding.
not_available No.
not_available You've got a slow leak from a small vessel.
not_available You're gonna need surgery.
not_available I don't want surgery.
not_available Look, we'll make a midline incision, find the bleeding artery and then tie it off.
not_available Doc, I'm already dying.
not_available Your infection might slow your recovery but it's routine surgery.
not_available People live with HIV.
not_available I know that.
not_available I've been fighting this disease since 1986.
not_available I responded to the AZT, and the protease inhibitors were a miracle.
not_available They gave me an extra five years.
not_available But my T cells have been dropping since July.
not_available My viral load's gone through the roof, even with all these antivirals.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jeffries, I need your consent.
not_available No.
not_available I had pneumocystis three months ago.
not_available If we don't operate, you'll die.
not_available I am already dead, doc.
not_available This may just allow me to skip a very painful end.
not_available Another Satinsky.
not_available Unit eight is up.
not_available Heart's not filling.
not_available Clamp the aorta.
not_available Greene, the injury is high and posterior.
not_available Just trying to bring you more light.
not_available That'll help.
not_available Can't you get your finger in the hole? 
not_available If I could see it.
not_available More light.
not_available Just call for FFP and platelets.
not_available Forget it, forget it.
not_available I can't close this defect.
not_available Another amp of epi.
not_available She'll go out of thoracic aorta and exsanguinate in seconds.
not_available Let's try bypass.
not_available It's too late for that.
not_available Call it.
not_available Time of death, 11:40.
not_available We pull the sample out with a needle.
not_available And then we look under a microscope.
not_available You think it's cancer? 
not_available It could be scar tissue.
not_available Or a cyst.
not_available Cancer's only one possibility.
not_available My mom died of cancer.
not_available How old was she? 
not_available 35.
not_available I'm 12.
not_available Let's see the biopsy first.
not_available That way we can talk about what we know as opposed to what we don't know.
not_available Do you have anybody that you'd like me to call? 
not_available I'm in foster care.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Foster parents? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm between homes.
not_available Right.
not_available She make it? 
not_available No.
not_available This guy's on a rampage.
not_available They didn't catch him yet? I don't know.
not_available They're gonna go to his house.
not_available So much violence, huh? Were you gonna tell me? Tell you what? 
not_available I heard a rumor.
not_available Oh, yeah? A good one? Dr.
not_available Rosen called.
not_available You know, from the emergency department at Northwestern.
not_available You took the message? 
not_available He wanted to set up an appointment.
not_available Just looking at options.
not_available Are you leaving? I still have to make up three months of my residency.
not_available Well, after that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm not even being considered for Chief Resident.
not_available I have to write this damn peer review for Chen.
not_available They're not even talking me about an Attending position.
not_available Have you talked to Weaver about an Attending position? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Because if she wanted me, she would have asked me about it.
not_available Maybe she doesn't think you're interested.
not_available Maybe I'm not.
not_available Carter, is your cirrhosis patient ready to go to the floor? No.
not_available I have to do a paracentesis first.
not_available We need the bed.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's the chest tube output on the gardener? You still angry at me? 
not_available I wasn't angry.
not_available You seemed angry.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available I should have ripped it up.
not_available I thought you wanted to go back to school.
not_available Maybe I do.
not_available Just not now.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available You don't want to be a doctor anymore? I don't know.
not_available You don't know? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's $40,000 in tuition.
not_available It's lost wages.
not_available It's another six years of me killing myself.
not_available Then it's over and you'll be doing what you want.
not_available Maybe I'm doing what I want.
not_available If that were true, you would have never started.
not_available Maybe I realized being a nurse is good enough.
not_available Is it not good enough for you? No, no.
not_available It's fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available You did great, Ted.
not_available The bullet went through a muscle in your neck.
not_available But you're gonna be okay.
not_available Can I see my mom now? 
not_available Let me find out.
not_available Do you know your dad's work number? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Do you know where he works? 
not_available Abysco.
not_available Abysco? Is that a company? 
not_available He makes binders.
not_available He makes binders.
not_available All right.
not_available You want to draw some more? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available The mom didn't make it? 
not_available The proximal aorta was shredded.
not_available I have to track down his father.
not_available What do you want to tell the boy? 
not_available I'll stall.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? This him? Yeah.
not_available He has a record? One arrest.
not_available Domestic dispute.
not_available He hit his girlfriend.
not_available He wasn't at his house? 
not_available I'll let you know when we have him.
not_available What about his son? We tracked down the foster parents.
not_available A patrol car's picking him up now.
not_available I think he's coming here.
not_available What? Well, he was pissed at the neighbor for bringing him to the ER.
not_available You took his kid away from him, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks, Frank.
not_available I'll send in some extra units.
not_available Mark, he couldn't come here.
not_available He knows there's too many cops around.
not_available He hasn't displayed a lot of sound judgment so far.
not_available What is he shooting with? Semiautomatic pistol, 13
not_available round clip.
not_available He's been reloading.
not_available Maybe picked it up at Kmart on the way.
not_available It's not the guns.
not_available People kill people.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available But not as fast.
not_available He would have found another weapon.
not_available Fourteen shots so far, Frank.
not_available Six deaths.
not_available You can't affect mass murder with a Chinese throwing star.
not_available Rescue 78 coming in with an injured cop.
not_available Motorist dragged him for half a block.
not_available There you go.
not_available He hit him with a car.
not_available That's assault with a deadly weapon.
not_available Shut up! Free air under the diaphragm.
not_available Must have nicked the bowel too.
not_available His crit's down to 23.
not_available I can't dilute him much further.
not_available I checked his viral load.
not_available It's over 50,000.
not_available He'll die of an opportunistic infection within a year.
not_available Well, that doesn't mean we should help him commit suicide.
not_available He didn't shoot himself.
not_available If we let him refuse surgery, it's the same thing.
not_available Get a court order then.
not_available He'll be dead by the time it's approved.
not_available Then it's his choice.
not_available All right.
not_available I went over there.
not_available She was upset.
not_available She was crying.
not_available She came on to me.
not_available I didn't do anything.
not_available I didn't want to do anything.
not_available Maybe she felt guilty and she told Roger and she put a spin on it.
not_available And you wouldn't put a spin on it.
not_available No.
not_available Then why didn't you tell me? 
not_available To avoid this.
not_available What? You looking at me like I did something wrong.
not_available I see.
not_available You didn't trust me and I'm supposed to trust you.
not_available I didn't think it was worth getting into.
not_available At least I know where I stand.
not_available Cleo, that's not what I meant and you know it.
not_available Peter, his pressure's dropping.
not_available Go.
not_available Run in another liter of saline.
not_available Any chest pain or dizziness? 
not_available No.
not_available Let's get two units from the blood bank and transfuse each over an hour.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I don't want a blood transfusion.
not_available Your hematocrit is drifting to a dangerously low level.
not_available I understand.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you.
not_available What about your family? I mean, if you don't care about yourself, what about them? I haven't spoken to my mother in over 30 years.
not_available I outlived the two people that I loved in the world.
not_available I've lived longer than I expected.
not_available Just let me go.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available How are you feeling? 
not_available My neck hurts.
not_available I'll ask one of the nurses to come give you some medicine.
not_available Can I see my mom? Not yet.
not_available I'm trying to reach your dad.
not_available Can I stay with her until you do? I don't think so.
not_available She's having an operation right now.
not_available Is she okay? We're having a little trouble trying to get the bleeding stopped around her heart.
not_available She was hurt bad.
not_available I know.
not_available You hungry? 
not_available No.
not_available Where's all this blood from? 
not_available Tore off part of his ear.
not_available Give him more pain medicine.
not_available Titrate 10 of morphine.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? 
not_available I don't think so.

not_available Yellow windbreaker? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He saw blood on the collar.
not_available Fossen did this? 
not_available Just a minute.
not_available Colby asked him to step out.
not_available When he opened the door, the guy smashed our unit and took off.
not_available Colby's jacket must've got snagged.
not_available He was screaming.
not_available He got dragged forever.
not_available He didn't stop.
not_available Where did he get the car? Probably boosted it.
not_available Jeep Grand Cherokee, first three license numbers G74? 
not_available That's all I got down.
not_available Could it be G79? You got him? 
not_available Shots fired at 823 Piedmont.
not_available Jeep Grand Cherokee parked at the corner.
not_available License number G79
not_available 6L5.
not_available Woman found down inside.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Easy.
not_available Is she dead? 
not_available Called in the paramedics.
not_available We're all overworked, Robert.
not_available You can't insinuate you'll fire someone every time you're frustrated.
not_available I'm not.
not_available She's fired.
not_available Robert.
not_available Cleaning out her locker right now.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available This is a county facility.
not_available Employees cannot be summarily fired.
not_available She was already on probation for that other matter.
not_available She was exonerated.
not_available And she's had a history of violation of institutional policy.
not_available Like what? 
not_available What do you care? She's a good doctor.
not_available A good doctor who has had 30 delinquent charts awaiting discharge summaries.
not_available So does half the staff.
not_available She used the telephone watch line 
not_available for personal calls.
not_available You're kidding! 
not_available She yelled at a patient in public.
not_available You're trying to find a way to fire her.
not_available There's plenty of documentation that the disciplinary committee has reviewed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Give me a minute.
not_available It's Adele.
not_available She's been shot.
not_available What? 
not_available That maniac shot her at her house.
not_available The social worker? Chest x
not_available ray, T and L spine.
not_available Get an ultrasound.
not_available Feel this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you get a look at the man who shot you? He looked familiar.
not_available He said something about his son.
not_available We put his son Ben into protective custody last week.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Okay.
not_available Adele, can you feel this? No.
not_available Cord injury, 1.8 grams Solu
not_available Medrol over 15 minutes.
not_available Hi, Adele.
not_available Hi.
not_available She was shot mid
not_available back.
not_available She can't move her legs.

not_available I think so.
not_available Any pain in the belly? 
not_available BP, 92/65.
not_available Pulse, 110.
not_available Any pain in your belly? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Could be a pneumothorax.
not_available Lungs sound good.
not_available Pulse ox is 99.
not_available For an intraabdominal bleed? 
not_available There's spinal shock.
not_available How did he know where I lived?

not_available What? 
not_available Get someone over to my house.
not_available What? Send someone over to my house now.
not_available She's still hypotensive.
not_available Want dopamine? Start her on five mics.
not_available Come on, Elizabeth.
not_available Pick up.
not_available Pick up.
not_available Does this feel sharp? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What's her crit? 
not_available Working on it.
not_available How about here? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you have voice mail or machine? 
not_available Machine.
not_available Would she hear you leaving a message? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How about here? 
not_available No.
not_available Were you already home or was he waiting for you? He came in.
not_available I was sitting at my desk doing my bills.
not_available Patellar reflexes are absent.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, no one's answering the door.
not_available Do you want them to search the house? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They'd have to force entry.
not_available Search the house! 
not_available 942, go ahead.
not_available Still hypotensive.
not_available Up her to 10 mics.
not_available She needs volume.
not_available I'm not in yet.
not_available Adele, can you bend your knee? 
not_available I can't move it.
not_available Look, I don't care.
not_available We may have an emergency laminectomy.
not_available Fine.
not_available Check.
not_available Go.
not_available Doc, they'll call it in when they have it secured.
not_available Am I paralyzed? 
not_available Hopefully, it's only temporary.
not_available That's it.
not_available Give me a new kit.
not_available Check for sacral sparing.
not_available Come on, now.
not_available Now.
not_available Set up the microscope.
not_available We're coming up.
not_available Maybe she went out, went to the store.
not_available Did you page her? What? Did you page her? 
not_available No.
not_available I need you to page Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I don't
not_available I know that! Page her! Mr.
not_available Jeffries.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jeffries.
not_available What's his HemoCue? 
not_available Down to five.
not_available Barely responds to painful stimuli.
not_available Hang two units of blood.
not_available He doesn't want that.
not_available Where's the consent form? 
not_available On the cart.
not_available You can't take him without consent.
not_available He's unable to give consent now.
not_available I need two physicians' signatures for emergency surgery.
not_available No.
not_available You'd have him die? 
not_available I'll respect his wishes.
not_available Good, Adele.
not_available The spinal injury is incomplete.
not_available We can operate.
not_available I need an emergency signature.
not_available Not now.
not_available IJ's in.
not_available Let's get another chest.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available Run the Solu
not_available Medrol.
not_available 325 an hour.
not_available Gunshot wound to the belly
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Whatever.
not_available Go.
not_available Systolic's up to 100.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get him up.
not_available Can you get a repeat CBC? 
not_available Whatever you want, Peter.
not_available I've got my two signatures.
not_available He made himself clear.
not_available Look, he has advanced AIDS.
not_available He probably has an HIV encephalopathy.
not_available No.
not_available He was alert and oriented.
not_available You should have called Psych.
not_available I did.
not_available They never showed up.
not_available Laura called.
not_available They're stillDamn it! 
not_available Oh, God! I'm sorry.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Did you cut yourself? I don't think so.
not_available The glove just tore there.
not_available Peter.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let me get some gauze pads.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let me see it, all right? 
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Keep irrigating it.
not_available Where are the Zerowets? 
not_available Bottom left drawer.
not_available Pharmacy? This is Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I need you to pull a PEP kit for me.
not_available All right.
not_available Use two liters.
not_available What? No.
not_available Look, I'm on my way up there right now.
not_available What about the patient? 
not_available Keep transfusing him.
not_available Talk to Neuro? 
not_available They're doing a craniotomy.
not_available Watch it, Peter.
not_available I need help with a thoracic decompression.
not_available There's a piece of bone in your mid
not_available back, pressing on your spinal cord.
not_available That's why I can't move my legs? Yes.
not_available But if they remove the fragment, you may recover.
not_available No one's at your house.
not_available We did a sweep.
not_available Check my garage? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Call me if you find her.
not_available Will I be paralyzed? 
not_available Not if I can help it.
not_available I still need to talk to you.
not_available Drop it.
not_available It's over.
not_available Is my van still there? What? 
not_available The garage.
not_available Was my van there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But you have two cars.
not_available Hers is in the shop.
not_available Does she take the baby out? 
not_available She's been going for walks around 3.
not_available It's 1:05.
not_available It depends on the baby's schedule.
not_available Can you keep a unit there until she gets home? 
not_available Nick.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nick, listen.
not_available Shot in the head from the back.
not_available The guy was riding in the back seat.
not_available Cab driver on Roosevelt.
not_available Roger that, 27.
not_available Rescue's en route.
not_available Okay, that'll be us.
not_available Can you give it to Luka? I have to go upstairs.
not_available Think it's him? 
not_available Yeah, that's him.
not_available I can't reach this boy's father.
not_available And he's figuring it out.
not_available Who? The neck wound.
not_available His mother died.
not_available You need to talk to him.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Carter, we got a GSW to the head coming in.
not_available I want you to prep Trauma 1.
not_available Get Dilantin, mannitol and Decadron.
not_available ETA? 
not_available Check with dispatch.
not_available Ewing seems pretty aggressive.
not_available We'll need a chest and abdominal CT to rule out metastatic disease.
not_available You sure? It's a soft
not_available tissue mass.
not_available Extra
not_available osseous.
not_available It's rare.
not_available You might want to write it up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Want me to talk to the parents? He doesn't have any parents.
not_available Where is she? Where is my mom? Where is this operation? The bullet She was shot in the back.
not_available The bullet passed through her heart.
not_available She lost so much blood that her heart stopped beating.
not_available We opened up her chest for an emergency surgery.
not_available We gave her blood transfusions.
not_available The best surgeon in the hospital did it.
not_available She wasn't in any pain.
not_available She didn't suffer.
not_available We worked on her for a long time.
not_available We couldn't stop the bleeding.
not_available And we couldn't get her heart to beat again.
not_available Ted, your mother died.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Here.
not_available You need to take these now.
not_available Shouldn't we draw baseline labs first? 
not_available No.
not_available Now.
not_available The sooner the better.
not_available Peter, two units are in.
not_available I can't get his pressure above 80.
not_available All right.
not_available Hold on.
not_available He's already drug
not_available resistant.
not_available You don't have a large viral load.
not_available He does.
not_available Cleo, listen to me.
not_available The conversion rate with meds is less than 3 in 1000.
not_available Peter.
not_available Crit is 14.
not_available If he's going, he has to go now.
not_available Okay? All right.
not_available Get another two units.
not_available I'll meet you at the elevator.
not_available Call Infectious Disease.
not_available See if they need to modify the post
not_available exposure regimen.
not_available I'm surprised my code still works.
not_available It's not gonna happen, Kim.
not_available What isn't? 
not_available They can't let you go, not legally.
not_available No.
not_available They always intended to fire me.
not_available They would have done it sooner, but they needed a thick Human Resource file first.
not_available Which is bogus.
not_available They'll never get away with it.
not_available They already have.
not_available Only if you let them.
not_available It's not worth the effort.
not_available I'm not interested in working for a place that doesn't want me.
not_available You have the right to due process.
not_available We can find a civil
not_available rights attorney.
not_available We? It's not right, Kim.
not_available You know why they're firing you.
not_available You have to fight it.
not_available You have to fight this.
not_available I'm supposed to fight? You're hiding but I'm supposed to fight.
not_available Well, I'm sorry.
not_available But I don't want to fight.
not_available I just want to move on.
not_available So should you.
not_available Chris and Hillary.
not_available It's Mark Greene.
not_available I'm looking for Elizabeth.
not_available If you see her, could you ask her to give me a call? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, we got him.
not_available He opened fire in Lincoln Park.
not_available Shot three people before being taken down by a civilian packing a 9mm.
not_available Is he still alive? 
not_available So far.
not_available What's he had? 
not_available Two amps of epi and atropine.
not_available Is this the cabby? Shot at the base of his skull.
not_available Cleo, jump in on this? 
not_available High cervical injury.
not_available Blew out his brains.
not_available Cleo! Any vitals in the field? 
not_available No.
not_available Just lots of brain matter.
not_available Any witnesses? 
not_available No.
not_available But we think it was Fossen.
not_available Well, why? on the driver's log at 
1 14 p.
not_available m.
not_available What? 
not_available The house you had searched.
not_available Fossen must have been on his way over there.
not_available Cabby probably heard his description on the radio.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Bang.
not_available Fossen blew his brains out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Don't worry, doc.
not_available That means he never got there.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene! He's coming in.
not_available Was that a record number of gunshot wounds for one shift? By the same guy? Absolutely.
not_available He has a good chance.
not_available Like you said, you found it early.
not_available It's more that he has to go through it alone, you know? As if having cancer as a kid wasn't bad enough.
not_available He could get passed over for Chief Resident.
not_available Or he could get kicked out of med school and be forced to work as an ER nurse.
not_available I was not kicked out.
not_available What would you call it? Suspended for being a deadbeat.
not_available Do you know he offered to pay my tuition? Who? 
not_available Luka.
not_available And I know he means well.
not_available It's just frustrating for me sometimes because I have to explain my every feeling.
not_available And normally when you're with someone for a while, they learn your moods.
not_available But he doesn't do that.
not_available You know what? 
not_available Stop it.
not_available What? Don't talk to me about Luka.
not_available I'm not your girlfriend.
not_available And I shouldn't even be here with you.
not_available Why not? Because I don't want to wish bad things for you and Luka.
not_available And I don't want to sit on the sidelines waiting for you two to break up.
not_available And I don't want to be your friend.
not_available It might be convenient for you, but it's not doing much for me.
not_available What are you talking about? Where did you put him? Where did you put my son? How much Oneg do you want? 
not_available Four units.
not_available You can't take me from him! Quiet! So we can listen! 
not_available Two entrance wounds on the right.
not_available One on the left.
not_available Another two in the belly.
not_available A total of five.
not_available You.
not_available You did this.
not_available Set up for bilateral chest tubes and a central line.
not_available Systolic's low at 80.
not_available I'll intubate.
not_available This is your fault! 
not_available Ready for the chest tubes.
not_available Now.
not_available Paralyze.
not_available One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.
not_available You stole my son.
not_available You destroyed my family.
not_available Ambu
not_available bag.
not_available He's my son! What gives you the right to? You can't take my son away! It starts with one bad cell that multiplies.
not_available And then it grows out of control.
not_available You usually don't know it's there until it is big enough that it causes pain.
not_available We're very lucky that we found it today.
not_available So you're saying I'm lucky I got shot.
not_available In a way, yeah.
not_available It's just gonna take longer to die.
not_available No.
not_available That's what I'm telling you.
not_available Since we caught it early, there's a good chance that you're not gonna die.
not_available What's a good chance? Seventy percent.
not_available You know what 70 percent is? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It leaves 30.
not_available Well, let's concentrate on the 70, okay? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, GSW's rolling in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Be right there.
not_available So, what happens to me now? Now I'm gonna have a cancer doctor, an oncologist, come and take a look at you.
not_available No.
not_available I mean, where do I live? I don't know.
not_available I'll find out.
not_available When was your last tetanus booster? I don't know.
not_available Do I need an xray? 
not_available It looks like just a graze.
not_available Is that the guy? Yes.
not_available Multiple GSWs to the chest and abdomen.
not_available At the range, they teach you to shoot for the center mass.
not_available It's not always fatal but it takes him down.
not_available You shot him? 
not_available I got mugged last year.
not_available Same park.
not_available I don't go there now without protection.
not_available He started shooting people! Someone had to do something! We should arm the whole city.
not_available Hey, I stopped him.
not_available He would have kept going.
not_available You're lucky.
not_available Lucky I was packing.
not_available Carter, you free? 
not_available Sort of.
not_available GSW to the right flank.
not_available Vitals are stable, but I need you to check for gross hematuria.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available I handed it in to her.
not_available What? Your reference.
not_available Should put you over the top.
not_available All fives.
not_available Wow! Thanks.
not_available I had to lie.
not_available Now, Carter.
not_available Coming.
not_available First two are in.
not_available Another subclavian.
not_available Put the next two on the infuser.
not_available How's the chest tube output? 
not_available Couple hundred cc's.
not_available Only 50 on my side.
not_available Is he gonna make it? Probably.
not_available Didn't hit any vital structures.
not_available After five shots? 
not_available Some guys get lucky.
not_available He's lucky we didn't take him down.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Corday's on line four.
not_available Could you get it for me? 
not_available Pressure's up to 85.
not_available 3
not_available 0 nylon.
not_available What's in the Foley? Seventy cc's.
not_available Dips are negative for heme.
not_available Can you cut this? Elizabeth? Mark, what's going on? 
not_available Where were you? I was at the Farmer's Market.
not_available There were police in the house and the front door's been kicked in.
not_available I told them to.
not_available Why? Long story.
not_available Vaseline gauze.
not_available You're not gonna tell me what happened? Nothing.
not_available It's just a bit of a scare.
not_available You' re all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available Call you later? 
not_available I told the police to stay until I called you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, he can go now.
not_available You' re not gonna tell me what's going on? Not right now.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Will you be off at 7? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I will be there.
not_available Okay.
not_available I love you.
not_available Me too.
not_available Elastoplast.
not_available Get ready for a portable chest.
not_available Keep the dopamine at 10 mics.
not_available Neuro checks, 30 minutes.
not_available A CBC in an hour.
not_available Any cord contusion? 
not_available No, extrinsic hematoma.
not_available Did they find Elizabeth? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available Good.
not_available What about her paralysis? 
not_available Ask me in 24 hours.
not_available What's this? 
not_available GSW to the renal parenchyma.
not_available Marge, clear OR 2.
not_available We got another customer.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Robert, I need to talk to you.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Anything but Legaspi.
not_available You're making a mistake.
not_available My main mistake was not firing her three months ago when I first found out.
not_available What? 
not_available That she is incompetent.
not_available That's not what you were gonna say.
not_available Really? In addition to your diagnostic skills, you're a mind reader.
not_available It's because she's gay.
not_available Of course I'm not.
not_available That would be politically incorrect.
not_available She's a pain in the ass.
not_available Like Maggie Doyle was? 
not_available Let's stop right there.
not_available And avoid your history of discrimination? If you don't rethink this, there's a good chance you'll be out of a job.
not_available Dr.
not_available Legaspi has demonstrated not only poor judgment but a reckless attitude towards patients and a blatant disregard for authority.
not_available She's out.
not_available She's fired.
not_available End of discussion.
not_available If she goes, I go.
not_available What? You heard me.
not_available Are you giving me an ultimatum? 
not_available I swear to God.
not_available I will walk out if you don't back off.
not_available I do not respond well to ultimatums! You had better choose your battles very carefully! You're the Chief of Emergency Medicine, not the county's lesbian advocate.
not_available That's where you're wrong.
not_available Because I am both.
not_available I am the Chief of Emergency Medicine, and I am a lesbian.
not_available If you pursue this matter, I will take it to the County Board of Supervisors the ACLU, the press, and anyone else who will listen! So I suggest you choose your battles very carefully! 
not_available BP's 100/60.
not_available Going in the right direction.
not_available Last HemoCue? 
not_available 9.5.
not_available You want me to bring him up? Mark? What? You want me to bring him up? 
not_available No, no.
not_available I got it.
not_available They are sending cross
not_available matched blood to the OR.
not_available Good.
not_available Could you bring the chart back down so I can write my note? Sure.
not_available He's gonna need some more Pavulon.
not_available Damn it! I forgot the drug box.
not_available Be right back.
