not_available Dear Michael, it's been months since I've heard from you.

not_available But I'm sure you 're taking care of yourself.
not_available Sorry I've been so out of touch.
not_available They keep me pretty busy here, what with all the parties.
not_available Everyone asks after you and I think about you often.
not_available Even at odd 
moments At the market, picking something up or just waiting for my coffee.
not_available I wonder how you 're doing.
not_available You guys probably don't even remember me by now.
not_available I'm the tall, good
not_available looking black guy with the best bedside manner in the place.

not_available And tell everybody I'm still here, still doing the doctor thing.

not_available I do miss County.
not_available All you guys.
not_available Sometimes in the middle of everything, I kind of wonder if what I'm doing here
not_available Is maybe the same as what you 're doing over there.
not_available It's good to believe it is.
not_available Makes me feel you 're not really as far away as it seems.
not_available And maybe it won't be so hard to get through this.
not_available And that sometime soon we'll see each other again.
not_available Estimated blood loss? As for work, well, some things continue to be a challenge for me.
not_available I know I'm good at some of it.

not_available Radial artery hasn't clamped down.

not_available Unjam it? 
not_available The saddle stitcher.
not_available You got to do 10 bound books a minute.
not_available You were inside a binding machine? Somebody must have turned it back on, without realizing I was still in there.

not_available Okay, good.

not_available Talk about pain management.
not_available The irony is, people think I know all the answers.

not_available Seen it performed? Well

not_available BP cuffs as a tourniquet on both biceps, keep inflated over 140.
not_available Still, I feel after all this time, people I work with should have more confidence in me.
not_available But how can they if I don't? Neela, adduct the arm like this.

not_available I grew up in a medium family.
not_available No.

not_available They'll take it from here.

not_available I find myself both proud and jealous at times, Michael.
not_available Supple, resilient limbs.
not_available Clean, straight amputations.
not_available I'm saying, if you had to have your arms cut off, this would be the dream scenario.
not_available Yeah, Lieberman's a brilliant guy.
not_available Worked a while in Germany with the military 
not_available training combat surgeons in burn care.
not_available You have a purpose and a role to fill.
not_available Most days I don't feel like that at all.
not_available Flexor digitorum superficialis.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Back in sinus.

not_available Wow.
not_available It won't last.
not_available He needs the O.R.
not_available Tape the tube in, hook him up to suction.
not_available I'll find Kilner.
not_available You're with me.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Where did you learn that? I worked three years at a county ER back in Chicago.
not_available Who do you have back there? Wife? Girlfriend? 
not_available Nope, not really.
not_available Not really? Okay.
not_available Don't ask, don't tell.
not_available I know what a lot of people think about this war.
not_available But when you're here, you have to believe that we're fighting for something real something that matters.
not_available Thought we could save it.
not_available Shattered femur.
not_available Femoral artery was a tattered mess.
not_available He was bleeding out, headed for DIC.
not_available That our guys we can't save and the ones we patch together are heroes, not victims.
not_available Sir, we got a hypotensive Iraqi GSW with exposed bowel.
not_available Good Iraqi or bad Iraqi? 
not_available He's on our side, sir.
not_available Send him here in 10 minutes.
not_available So 20 minutes if he's a bad Iraqi? You have to be careful about human bombs getting in.
not_available A unit in Kirkuk lost some people when a patient blew himself up on the table.
not_available It's crazy what your daily concerns become.
not_available You end up missing the littlest things.
not_available The stuff most of us take for granted.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, you get that lady up to Lieberman yet? 
not_available The replantation should be underway.
not_available Good, I gotta get back inside.
not_available Greg, do you miss him? Michael? You were good friends.
not_available We still are.
not_available I keep I don't know, thinking about him.
not_available Nothing wrong with that.
not_available Oh, I'm writing him a letter.
not_available Anything you want to say? You writing a letter? Sending an email? 
not_available An actual letter on paper.
not_available Well, tell him to hurry up and get his ass back here in one piece.
not_available I'm tired of waiting for my rematch.
not_available Now, let's get back inside.
not_available We got things to do.
not_available Pratt says he misses you.
not_available Lots of my time is spent babysitting.
not_available Even here there's all the small stuff right next to the stuff that rips you up.
not_available Are you feeling better, soldier? 
not_available Getting there.
not_available We've had a virus blasting through camp.
not_available Knocks you on your ass for about 48 hours.
not_available Whole kitchen staff came down with it.
not_available That explains why the food suddenly improved.
not_available You want to go back to the days of MREs? We started on rations when we were setting up.
not_available Now it's hot chow three times a day.
not_available Yeah, you're welcome.
not_available When fluid's in, we'll check orthostatics, send you to the border.
not_available Border? It's just for a day or two.
not_available We don't want her infecting the whole DFAC.
not_available Is there anything I can get you, soldier? 
not_available The hell out of here.
not_available They're sending a Medevac.
not_available Shouldn't be too long.
not_available It's tough, enlisted kids who go back with less than they came with.
not_available There are reservists and guardsmen who never expected to be here at all.
not_available They bit the bullet and showed up for duty only to get their tours extended as reward.
not_available Now they're here with no end in sight.
not_available "Weekend a month, " my ass.
not_available You got small? 
not_available Large.
not_available Did you get 18s too? Hey, Chicago, for you, I got it all.
not_available Name a tent after you.
not_available Hey, cap! Special pickup for you.
not_available Cubans, illegal in Kuwait.
not_available What's the word on our Bulls? 
not_available Flirting with 500.
not_available You think Jordan's got one more comeback? You smoke those? 
not_available No.
not_available Pregnant lady came here wounded from a building collapse.
not_available I delivered the baby.
not_available Hey.
not_available Scorpion sting.
not_available Got a minute? Scorpion sting? 
not_available Yeah, it's pretty common.
not_available No big deal.
not_available Hey, I need some help! You gonna help me? 
not_available Is it always like this? Multiply the usual busload of colds and coughs times 10 because it's February.
not_available Add seasonal complaints, frostbite, sled accidents, tongues frozen to metal poles.
not_available Double the car crashes, add your baseline chest pains, strokes, and GSWs.
not_available And this is what you 
get Hell frozen over.
not_available Suzannah Harris.
not_available Rash.
not_available Hello, I'm Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Yeah, I've got these red spots all over me and I have never itched so bad.
not_available Looks like insect bites.
not_available Fleas, maybe? 
not_available No, I don't have fleas.
not_available Have you ever had scabies? 
not_available Scabies? They're tiny insects that can cause severe skin reactions.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Benadryl, Elimite and home.
not_available I know I shouldn't complain to you.
not_available My troubles must seem pretty minor.
not_available Hey, Gus.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available I haven't thrown up in an hour.
not_available How about the other end? 
not_available Slowing down.
not_available That's what I like to hear.
not_available After the liter's in, PO challenge him, re
not_available check orthostatics.
not_available But I spend 99 percent of the time waiting for the 1 percent where it feels I make a difference.
not_available Neela, waiting time for a bed is up to 18 hours.
not_available Lewis wants to see about dispo
not_available ing the deadbeats out of Chairs.
not_available We're on that.
not_available Scorpion must've crawled up my arm.
not_available Never even felt it.
not_available Okay, IV, 500 cc NS bolus.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Sergeant Varga's mom sent him a box of Lucky Charms.
not_available Can he eat the crescent moons? Long as he's here, he's NPO.
not_available At Landstuhl he can eat what he wants.
not_available So no green clovers either? 
not_available What is that, a monitor? Larabee.
not_available Jackson picked it up in Kuwait.
not_available You can't use that.
not_available You want to borrow it sometime, make calls back home
not_available Will it call Florida? My old lady's in Sarasota.
not_available It's a security risk.
not_available The signal can be picked up by an enemy.
not_available Sir, you really think these insurgents have homing technology? Get a 12
not_available lead, keep him on the monitor.
not_available He's 112 degrees.
not_available Fahrenheit.
not_available I got 98.
not_available With all due respect, ma'am if your boy had a temp of 112, he'd be dead.
not_available Exactly.
not_available Here, show me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We're not up to you.
not_available Check with the triage nurse.
not_available I hurt my back.
not_available I was just tying a shoe.
not_available Here, let me take a look.
not_available This where it hurts? 
not_available Yeah, right there.
not_available Any meds, medical problems? 
not_available No.
not_available You have a lumbar muscle spasm.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available A backache.
not_available I probably should stay for a full exam.
not_available Listen, you could go home, take some ibuprofen have a glass of merlot, and get some rest.
not_available Or you could sit here and wait to be seen for 20 hours.
not_available Home sounds good.
not_available Thanks.
not_available These yours? Oh, yeah.
not_available Neela, did you just send that guy home? 
not_available Simple backache.
not_available He still needs a chart.
not_available Quick exam, pain was musculoskeletal.
not_available EMTALA violation.
not_available He left on his own.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, MI in two is ready to move.
not_available I thought you wanted me to dispo
not_available I do.
not_available But I don't want to get us sued.
not_available Please, we need help.
not_available My brother's in the car.
not_available He's very sick.
not_available You do triage outside the perimeter? If they're losing life, limb or eyesight, or are wounded as a result of U.S.
not_available action 
not_available we can bring them in.
not_available Otherwise, it's off to a civilian hospital.
not_available If we treated every civilian that showed up we'd run out of beds and supplies in half a day.
not_available No interpreter? 
not_available I'm fluent in Arabic.
not_available I was at the Pentagon on September 11th.
not_available On September 12th, I started studying the language.
not_available Over here, hurry.
not_available He's really sick.
not_available They went to the clinic.
not_available They couldn't help her.
not_available Pulse is weak.
not_available Barely moving air.
not_available They gave her this note.
not_available Please help him.
not_available "To County General doctor, rule out meningitis.
not_available Please evaluate.
not_available " What? Come on.
not_available She can't keep anything down.
not_available That hurt? Bolus her up and send her off to Balad? Yeah, she's only about 5 percent dehydrated.
not_available Not sick enough for us.
not_available Balad.
not_available You have to go to a hospital in Balad.
not_available You know where it is? Hold on.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hey, this will help.
not_available One cup every hour.
not_available It's good stuff, okay? You drink it.
not_available How is the hospital in Balad? That infrastructure's been neglected for a decade.
not_available Should be able to handle a saline bolus.
not_available It's so tough, turning them away when they're right here.
not_available Even in the States, they wouldn't admit her.
not_available Certainly can't justify treating her at CASH.
not_available Any requests from the big city? Hey, Jackson.
not_available You think you could score me some citrus? 
not_available I have a craving for some mangos.
not_available I don't think mango's a citrus fruit.
not_available How about some oranges then? 
not_available You've got it, Chicago.
not_available See if I can hunt us down some Red Hots too.
not_available You better get going.
not_available Okay, Rollins, let's go.
not_available Get down! Get down! Stay here! There might be more! Get them out of the truck! Get them out of the truck! I need two nurses and a Pedes mask! Set up for intubation.

not_available This kid's burning up.
not_available Supply driver's hurt pretty bad.

not_available Oh, my God.

not_available Gross deformity of the right clavicle.
not_available Oh, God! Doctor, what antibiotics do you want? 
not_available Clinda and Levaquin.
not_available Pharmacy's out of Levaquin.
not_available Amp and gent then.
not_available Blood in the canal.
not_available Okay, 10 of morphine.
not_available Let's go! Let's go! 
not_available Got it! Captain, we need you here.
not_available CBC, type and cross, get a second IV, call X
not_available ray for chest, abdomen and right shoulder.
not_available Only 87 percent on nonrebreather.
not_available Okay.
not_available She's stridor on carbonaceous sputum.
not_available Okay.
not_available Six
not_available O on a mac two.
not_available Okay, the inside of her airway is burned.
not_available We need to get a tube down there before it swells shut.
not_available Six of etomidate, 20 of Roc.
not_available It's a medicine to help her sleep.
not_available Etomidate's in.
not_available Pushing the rock.
not_available Tube.
not_available Talk to me.
not_available Sats up to 92 on a 30 per kilo fluid bolus.
not_available CBC, lytes and blood cultures sent.
not_available Chest film's on its way.
not_available Suction.
not_available He still needs a cath, UA and an LP.
not_available Dopamine's at 10 mics and ceftriaxone's infusing.
not_available How long has he been sick like this? 
not_available Two days.
not_available Fever.
not_available Also vomiting.
not_available I can't get through this.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available No.
not_available Let's try five and a half.
not_available There are times when all my worries, all the crazy thoughts in my head go away.
not_available All that matters is what I'm doing 
now Securing an airway.
not_available Got it.
not_available Bag him.
not_available That's when I know what I'm doing, who I am.
not_available You got a pulmonary contusion.
not_available Some bleeding and bruising in the lungs.
not_available We'll get you stabilized.
not_available You'll be headed off to Landstuhl on your way home.
not_available Home? It'll take weeks for your lungs and the fractures to heal.
not_available Your family will be glad to see you.
not_available I don't wanna ship out like this.
not_available Tech just dropped this off.
not_available Repeat chest on Gopher there.
not_available Okay, let me go take a look at your films.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available Contusions look worse.
not_available How are his sats? Holding, barely.
not_available Okay, they'll come back.
not_available Keep a bag mask at the bedside.
not_available Urine dip is positive for leukocytes and nitrates.
not_available Bingo.
not_available Found the source.
not_available That's my sterile field.
not_available You can re
not_available prep.
not_available You can be this sick from a bladder infection? If there's hydronephrosis.
not_available Probably septic from pyelo.
not_available We still need to rule out meningitis.
not_available It's unlikely.
not_available Kid's vaccinated for H
not_available Flu and pneumococcus.
not_available Pratt, Ml in 4 is crashing.
not_available Okay.
not_available Add five of PEEP, start gentamicin, and lean on the PICU.
not_available Let me know about the LP.
not_available What if PEEP doesn't work? In the NICU, we used a high
not_available frequency oscillator.
not_available I'm not sure if he's too old for that.
not_available Should I call RT? Let's wait and see what Pratt wants.
not_available Sir, there are no facilities in Iraq with the resources or the training 
not_available to take care of this girl.
not_available True.
not_available But you're telling me to stabilize and discharge her, sir.
not_available I'm telling you we've done what we can, captain.
not_available Move on.
not_available They cannot take care of her in a local hospital.
not_available Sometimes we have to accept our limitations here.
not_available Sounds like a fancy way of saying you don't care, sir.
not_available You've been here what, a year? I've been doing this for 20 so don't lecture me on who cares and who doesn't.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Maybe we could check a facility in Kuwait, sir.
not_available See about transferring her to Landstuhl for her recovery.
not_available Captain, Landstuhl's for U.S.
not_available servicemen.
not_available Maybe some hospital in Egypt or Jordan could take her.
not_available C
not_available 130's on the way for Perry and Jackson.
not_available We could get her on the flight.
not_available You need approval to bring that girl into the United States.
not_available I know that, sir.
not_available All right.
not_available See what you can do.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available Will he sleep in the hospital tonight? In the pediatric ICU, but we'll keep him here until the bed's ready.
not_available Hey, check this out.
not_available What's that? It's a highfrequencyHigh
not_available frequency oscillator.
not_available I had a talk with the PICU attending.
not_available He suggested we give this thing a trial.
not_available It uses highfrequency waves
not_available To carry oxygen to the alveoli.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, you're the expert.
not_available Tell us what he needs.
not_available Inspiratory time, 33.
not_available Amplitude, 40.
not_available Mean airway pressure, 18.
not_available That's what the PICU doc said too.
not_available I'll get you set up.
not_available Cool.
not_available Hey, way to stay on top of his pressure.
not_available One of us should call the state medical board.
not_available What for? 
not_available To report the clinic doc.
not_available You don't know what the kid looked like.
not_available Bad enough the doctor advised to come here with a note to rule out meningitis.
not_available Listen, clinic docs provide essential care in places where there's nothing else.
not_available I'm not sure bad care is preferable to none.
not_available The kid's vaccines are up to date.
not_available Amoxicillin's better than no meds at all.
not_available You shut a guy like this down, you're not doing anybody favors including this family.
not_available What? No, no, no.
not_available It needs to be immediately.
not_available Because this girl can't wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can I speak to someone else then? What? No, don't
not_available You okay? Two places in Kuwait said no and the administrator at Landstuhl practically laughed at me.
not_available It's real sweet, what you're doing.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What I'm trying to do.
not_available What's up? She's tachy with a widened pulse pressure.

not_available Yeah, goodbye to you too! Did you get it all out? 
not_available What? Whatever's been bothering you all shift.
not_available One minute I'm God's gift to medicine the next you're humiliating me.
not_available Humiliating you? 
not_available If you trust me, give me some room.
not_available If you don't, just say so.
not_available I don't.
not_available What? Neela, you could be the best doctor here.
not_available Hell, everybody knows that you're five times smarter.
not_available But most of the time you're in your head.
not_available You're right.
not_available I am.
not_available I blow things out of proportion.
not_available I obsess.
not_available So stop.
not_available Well, it's just I come here, do my shift.

not_available Just for a few days.
not_available It'll give me more time
not_available We don't have beds to give away.

not_available That's too bad.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available I'll try.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available She's talking to Gallant.
not_available Really? When is he coming home? 
not_available Sounds like he needs help.
not_available Don't forget to spread the love.
not_available Is he okay? 
not_available Yeah, they're yakking like teenagers.
not_available What do you suppose a long
not_available distance call from Iraq would run you? More important, what will it run the Army? It's we the taxpayers who are underwriting this little rendezvous.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available You too.
not_available You just hang up? 
not_available He couldn't talk.
not_available He said hello.
not_available Can we call him back? It was a one
not_available time thing.
not_available He got access to a phone.

not_available Your family will meet you at Walter Reed.
not_available You told them I'd be all right? Yeah.
not_available Somebody contacted them, yeah.
not_available You see that? Picked it up in Mosul for Laura, my little one.
not_available She's gonna love it.
not_available I wonder how cold it is in Joliet.
not_available My wife hates the winter.
not_available Now you make it quick, all right? Because if you get caught, I never knew you.
not_available Looks like you caught them both.
not_available Is that Lieberman with Dubenko? 
not_available They're looking at the lady you brought.

not_available Bit busy here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This can't wait.
not_available Wind's kicked up all through the Arabian Sea.

not_available Congratulations.
not_available A Dr.
not_available Lieberman in Chicago has agreed to underwrite Jamila's care.
not_available It came through.
not_available That's great, sir.
not_available County General? My guess is that's where you used to work.
not_available So how did you plan to get her there? Piggyback her on the transport to Andrews, sir.
not_available And who was gonna get that approved? It's lucky for you that the State Department and the Army okayed it.
not_available C
not_available 130 on the airstrip in Baghdad.
not_available We'll helo them over as soon as we get a chopper.
not_available Don't say I never did anything for you.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good news? Yes.
not_available I've got two Heinekens under my bed.
not_available They've been sitting there for weeks waiting for something to celebrate.

not_available Hot water's out at my place.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Ray said it was okay.
not_available You want? No.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Haven't listened to this CD yet? You familiar with this guy, Robert Johnson? Not really.
not_available Eric Clapton? Jimmy Page? Keith Richards? 
not_available Well, yes.
not_available Of course.
not_available Okay.
not_available There's a direct line between Robert Johnson and every dude who's ever picked up a Gibson.
not_available Robert Johnson is American music.
not_available Is that so? Yeah, that's so.
not_available His sats were trending down.
not_available Had to tube him.
not_available Getting hard to bag.
not_available He's bleeding into his lungs.
not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Still bradycardic, 48.
not_available Another epi.
not_available Let's go.

not_available Pericardial effusion.
not_available No.
not_available He's moving air.
not_available No carotid? 
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available Rate, 27.
not_available No pulse.
not_available His heart's not getting any oxygen.
not_available You know, they say he sold his soul to the devil.
not_available Really? Why? Well, he wanted to be the best.
not_available And he was.
not_available So that makes it worth it? Kind of depends on your opinion of the devil.
not_available I think it's a made
not_available up story.
not_available Of course it is.
not_available That's the best kind.
not_available But this guy
not_available I mean, listen to this.
not_available He's actually making a guitar talk.
not_available To play like that, I would give almost anything.
not_available Wouldn't you? It's good you feel that way about what you do.
not_available What way? I don't know.
not_available Passionate? Don't you? I mean, what Ray and you do, that's pretty amazI'm, like, in awe of you guys
not_available I wasn't talking about me.
not_available All I meant was you seem pretty passionate to me.

not_available Hold compressions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gallant.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gallant.
not_available Wait.
not_available Hold on a minute.
not_available I think you're great but I Are you laughing? I'm
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You're
not_available You're great, really.
not_available But I'm just not into it.
not_available Well, you seemed into it a minute ago.
not_available I need to go to bed now, because if I don't go to bed now I'm gonna stay out here with you.
not_available And what would be so bad about that? You know When you have a cut or some injury but all you have in the house is one of those tiny Band
not_available Aids that don't even stay on that don't really help the problem at all This would be very nice, I'm sure.
not_available It already was.
not_available Can you see what I mean? I'm a tiny Band
not_available Aid? I'm in a weird place and I don't want to do something just because I'm lonely.
not_available Isn't the cure for loneliness to be with someone? That is so totally reasonable.
not_available Good night.
not_available She's not stable, sir.
not_available Just get to the C
not_available 130.
not_available They'll take it from there.
not_available She's hypotensive and septic.
not_available You can go up on the pressors.
not_available She'll blow a pneumo at altitude.
not_available Fly low and bag her.
not_available Sir, you're not the one who'll be coding her at 5000 feet.
not_available She could die without the proper burn care.
not_available She can't get that here.
not_available She could die during transport.
not_available I'm not taking responsibility.
not_available Would you take her if a doctor went? You got 72 hours, son.
not_available Get her there.
not_available Thank you, sir.
not_available I try to be positive, Neela, but the truth is, it gets to you.
not_available Even if no one sees that, even if you never admit it.
not_available Sometimes I wish I could just get out wear civvies, drink beer and clear my head for a while.
not_available Then I'd come back and finish the job I started.
not_available There are things I can't say to anyone except in a letter except to you.
not_available Be safe, Michael.
not_available I know I worry a lot about everything.
not_available But most of all I worry about how long it will be before I see you again.
