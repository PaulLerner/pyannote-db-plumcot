not_available R.
not_available 10x10 "MAKEMBA" Getting bad out there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Merry Christmas Eve, huh? 
not_available If you say so.
not_available You're late.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had to walk from La Salle.
not_available My bus crashed into a UPS truck.
not_available Weak and dizzy in 6.
not_available LOL with bloody stool in 2.
not_available There's a kid who swallowed a Christmas tree ornament in 5.
not_available Work him up, send him to Kovac.
not_available My shoes are wet.
not_available Happy holidays, everybody.
not_available Where's she going? Home to wait for the ghost of Christmas past to show up.
not_available Thanks, Michael.
not_available I was afraid you'd already have it.
not_available No, it's great.
not_available A kid swallowed an ornament? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mom's worried about the wire hanging
not_available hook thing.
not_available Take a couple of minutes.
not_available The old lady with the bloody stool can wait for you to change your shoes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Did you get your trinket from Carter? What? 
not_available His Third World care package.
not_available Gone
not_available native junk for everybody.
not_available Kovac got some kind of voodoo mask.
not_available I think it's Bangala.
not_available Yeah, they use it to slaughter farm animals in some kind of satanic ritual.
not_available Oh, here.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available It won't bite.
not_available You ever send that box of stuff to Africa, Frank? Toys for Third World tots? Went out last week.
not_available What'd you get? A box.
not_available A tribal shaman's box.
not_available Medicine men use it to store their potions.
not_available Merry Christmas, everybody! Welcome to Calcutta.
not_available Come on, that's it.
not_available Hey, what is that? 
not_available A little bit of Sikh rap.
not_available A little Sikh rap.
not_available Are you ready to go? 
not_available No, keep dancing.
not_available She's good.
not_available Okay, I'll be back for the H &amp; P's.
not_available This one? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Don't you shake it.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Are you a paper saver? Mebendazole.
not_available How romantic.
not_available Open it.
not_available You like it? That is beautiful.
not_available It was my father's.
not_available I want you to have it.
not_available Come on, try it on.
not_available It suits you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what'd you get me? It had better be good.
not_available I hope you won't be disappointed.
not_available Come on.
not_available It's kind of sentimental.
not_available They were mine when I was little.
not_available Thank you.
not_available There's more.
not_available I want you to come back to the States with me.
not_available I want our baby to be born in America.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available Well, back to work.
not_available You really don't like the Dixie Chicks? Everybody likes the Dixie Chicks.
not_available Everybody? 
not_available Everybody with any taste.
not_available He's weak on the right.
not_available Toxoplasmosis? We got a CT? 
not_available No.
not_available So treat with sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, colonic acid.
not_available Spinal tap? 
not_available No.
not_available We have to save the taps for the patients who really need them.
not_available And he doesn't? If he doesn't improve in a week we'll tap him then.
not_available Hey, you looking for me? How's our Belgian dermatologist? Oh, suffering from first
not_available day shock.
not_available He'll be all right.
not_available So are you coming tonight? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Nine? Coming alone? 
not_available No.
not_available What? 
not_available I think it's great.
not_available It's nothing serious.
not_available Nine, then.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available It is not that simple.
not_available Imperialism is imperialism.
not_available No matter whether the conqueror claims that the conquered will be better off.
not_available Again? "The conqueror brings with him the seeds of his own destruction.
not_available " Heiner Muller.
not_available Müller, right.
not_available Americans are like sheep.
not_available I don't understand why they aren't rioting in the streets of Palm Springs or "Atlana"
not_available Atlanta! Two T's.
not_available And nobody riots in Palm Springs.
not_available They're too busy playing golf.
not_available Democracy has been a positive force for change throughout the world.
not_available Hiroshima, Chile, le Vietnam? Hungary, Poland, Romania.
not_available Coca
not_available Cola, Marlboro.
not_available McDonald's.
not_available What I would give for a Quarter Pounder.
not_available That's what I'm talking about.
not_available American commercialism is ruining music, film, indigenous culture around the world.
not_available Listen, from what I've heard of French rock 'n' roll you are well on your way to ruining French music all on your own.
not_available I thought this was supposed to be a celebration.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't so much mind American intervention in Iraq.
not_available The Baathists were rapists and murderers.
not_available Hear, hear.
not_available But I do mind America callously dismissing legitimate international concerns just trampling 50 years of carefully crafted diplomacy in pursuit of its own political and economic interests.
not_available Makemba Likasu, Dr.
not_available John Carter.
not_available Kem works with the Ministry of Health.
not_available And her friend, Peter.
not_available I have no idea what he does.
not_available What do you do? Ministry of Finance.
not_available Kem's setting up an ARV demonstration project for AIDS patients.
not_available That's great.
not_available Has everybody ordered already? I love this song.
not_available Come on, Walter! Let's dance.
not_available Come on, Walter.
not_available So, what project you working on? I'm starting a small HIV
not_available AIDS program with money from the Global Fund.
not_available Anti
not_available retroviral therapy.
not_available Really? 
not_available Triple cocktail here.
not_available Your skepticism is well
not_available founded.
not_available We have our doubters.
not_available Well, can you afford to treat millions of patients, right? Meds cost $15,000 a year per person.
not_available We can't even get IV antibiotics here.
not_available My point exactly.
not_available We're not using American drugs.
not_available Another example of American commercial self
not_available interest.
not_available I mean, blocking the use of generics.
not_available After the WTO ruled that poor countries could ignore drug patents India developed a generic.
not_available It only costs $200 a year per patient.
not_available Money we also don't have.
not_available What is your alternative, Peter? Just to watch 30 million Africans die in the next 10 years? If we can demonstrate that these programs work then we can appeal to the U.N., to rich countries, to our own governments.
not_available I think I just heard someone playing our song.
not_available Imperialist Yankee dollars to the rescue again.
not_available It's nice to know we're still needed for something.
not_available Oh, Peter, stop pouting.
not_available Let's dance.
not_available It's Bastille Day, you know? Vive la révolution.
not_available I won't be forced to say nice things about the French? No.
not_available He's not improving.
not_available When did we start him on sulfadiazine? 
not_available Ten days ago.
not_available Now do we do a spinal tap? Yeah.
not_available Is this his wife? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Tell her we need some additional tests.
not_available I speak English.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Your husband is not getting better.
not_available So we need to do some additional tests.
not_available He's very sick? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He will die soon? Not immediately.
not_available But, yes.
not_available How pregnant are you? 
not_available Six months.
not_available Do you know why your husband is dying? AIDS.
not_available And have you been tested? No.
not_available The children? It only takes a few minutes.
not_available Why? Is there anything you can do to help us if we are sick? If you are HIV
not_available positive we can give you medicine to try and keep you from passing it along to your baby.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Dad's dying, end stage.
not_available He's probably got a couple of weeks.
not_available Mom's pregnant.
not_available She's got two kids.
not_available One's 18 months, the other's 5.
not_available All the tests came back positive.
not_available You get a CD4 count? 
not_available She's stage 3.
not_available They've been in the refugee camp.
not_available She had to flee the fighting in Bukavu last March.
not_available Has she been to a VCT center? VCT? 
not_available Counseling, community support.
not_available She doesn't need counseling.
not_available She needs antiretroviral drugs.
not_available You wanna get her into my pilot program.
not_available She's a teacher.
not_available She'll be the sole support for her family.
not_available I'd think that would make her a candidate.
not_available I can only enroll 10 patients a month.
not_available We're only funded for 200 participants.
not_available Total? How long is your waiting list? The selection committee is very particular.
not_available How long? We take patients with TLC's under 1200.
not_available They have to live close to the clinic.
not_available They have to participate for five years and show consistency in taking previous drug regimens.
not_available If they fulfill all these they're included in a list that I present to the committee monthly.
not_available They, then, select 10 to get the ARV drugs.
not_available We have six fully occupied AIDS wards in this hospital, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Every patient in every ward wants to be in my program.
not_available Who would you like me to exclude so I can take your mother from Bukavu? Your AIDS drugs finally came.
not_available The pharmacy needs you to sign your credit card slip.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Twelve hundred bucks.
not_available Yep.
not_available Carter's paying me back.
not_available Carter needs antiretroviral? He get a stick or something? 
not_available No.
not_available Patient.
not_available Well, say hello to him for me, will you? 
not_available Why don't you write a note, stick it in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Leave a little for somebody else.
not_available You're Kovac, right? 
not_available Med student needs you down the hall.
not_available Call a pickup for me, will you, Frank? You get used to the heat.
not_available It's the food.
not_available That's another matter.
not_available It can't be any hotter than Sudan.
not_available Thank you, Charles.
not_available So you've volunteered before? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Every year for the last eight.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Lasagna.
not_available Made with potatoes? Excellent.
not_available Halloween candy? Anything chocolate? Who's Elizabeth? 
not_available She is a friend from work.
not_available Friend? Is she blond? She's a redhead actually.
not_available Are you in private practice back in the States? Yeah.
not_available I spent 15 years at Women and Children's, OB ward.
not_available Oh, yeah? I have a patient eight months pregnant, HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Husband's end
not_available stage.
not_available She's got kids that are HIV
not_available positive.
not_available Take a look? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Anytime.
not_available How about now? How's her CD4 count? 
not_available 175.
not_available But that should come up with the ARV's.
not_available Good heartbeat, Mommy.
not_available Strong.
not_available And the ARV's cut the transmission rate down to three or four percent.
not_available So if she uses formula, that cuts it down to one percent.
not_available Are you living in the refugee camp? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And are you still breastfeeding? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Celine, you can't breastfeed your new baby.
not_available You could pass the virus along in your milk.
not_available We'll get you formula, which is great stuff.
not_available And that will help keep your baby strong.
not_available My milk can make my baby sick? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Doctor, can I speak with you a moment? You're doing great, Mommy.
not_available Listen, she's gonna have to breastfeed.
not_available No.
not_available We get the formula in the UNICEF packs.
not_available It's powdered.
not_available You mix it with water.
not_available She's gonna have to get that water from a lake or a river.
not_available There's a 50 percent chance her baby's gonna die from dysentery or cholera.
not_available The three percent chance of contracting HIV from breast milk, it's a bargain.
not_available We'll get her bottled water.
not_available Eight times a day for six months? A year? Two years? 
not_available It's possible.
not_available Maybe.
not_available But it's not practical.
not_available What do you expect?! Of course they're going to start blowing things up.
not_available Nationalism, tribalism.
not_available You didn't figure it out with Vietnam? 
not_available No.
not_available We're slow learners.
not_available Now you come begging Europe for help.
not_available Soldiers, money.
not_available But not as partners, no.
not_available You just want us to legitimize your misadventures.
not_available What can I say? I voted for the other guy.
not_available Is it always like this? The conversation is turning into something of a perennial.
not_available If America is going to insist on bombing
not_available Enough.
not_available If they're going
not_available They get it! We all get it! Come on, let's dance.
not_available Come on.
not_available Dance? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Where's your friend? From the Red Cross? ICRC, food convoy to Goma.
not_available And yours? 
not_available Peter? He's at a conference in Nairobi.
not_available Something about currency fluctuations in the capital market.
not_available How's your AIDS study coming? 
not_available Fully enrolled.
not_available All 200.
not_available Really? Great.
not_available What about your adherence rate? 
not_available One hundred percent.
not_available We have this combination pill.
not_available So patients only have to take two a day.
not_available Really? In America, the patients have to take seven.
not_available Where are you from? I've been trying to place your accent.
not_available My father was Congolese.
not_available My mother's French.
not_available They met when he was in school in Paris.
not_available Where were you raised? 
not_available London, mostly.
not_available But my mother remarried.
not_available Moba in the summers with my dad.
not_available What about you? 
not_available I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois.
not_available The Windy City.
not_available Have you ever been to America? No.
not_available But I've seen it in the movies.
not_available You wanna dance? I am terrible.
not_available Good.
not_available So am I.
not_available All right.
not_available What's your most embarrassing moment? No, no.
not_available Not a chance.
not_available Come on.
not_available I just told you mine.
not_available It wasn't embarrassing so much as stupid.
not_available Come on.
not_available Give it up.
not_available It involved a lack of clothing.
not_available Thank God.
not_available Looks like we closed the place.
not_available What? You're not gonna tell me about how you got naked? What happened
not_available ? What happened to your patient? The mother, HIV and the kids? Celine? Oh, she's doing great.
not_available You got her to a VCT center? 
not_available No.
not_available I got her on ARV's.
not_available Antiretroviral drugs? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Her CD4 is over 400.
not_available Where'd you get the drugs? I had a friend of mine write a prescription back home and ship them over.
not_available You smuggled them in? 
not_available No, no.
not_available I used FedEx.
not_available What? What? She's doing great.
not_available Drugs entering the country have to be registered and approved by the Ministry of Health.
not_available You didn't have the resources to include her.
not_available AZT? 3TC? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And Nelfinavir.
not_available And that costs you $1000 a month? Twelve hundred.
not_available Where'd she get the money? 
not_available I paid for it.
not_available Yourself? I could treat four patients for a year with what you're spending on your patient every month.
not_available It took me two years to get all the approvals necessary to import the drugs arrange the funding and staff.
not_available And you're jeopardizing it by pulling out your checkbook and sending them.
not_available How am I jeopardizing your work? 
not_available It's not sustainable.
not_available What happens to that poor woman when you leave? You gonna keep shipping her thousands of dollars of drugs for the rest of her life? I was planning on it, yeah.
not_available And who's gonna monitor her progress, make sure she remains compliant? What if one of her kids gets sick and she decides to split her meds with the child? It happens! Or if she moves back to Kivu? Is your Mr.
not_available FedEx gonna chase all over the Congo tracking down your one patient? What happens to your patients when your funding ends? You cannot start a patient on drugs without guaranteeing you can maintain a supply.
not_available What? And you can guarantee a supply? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm trying to show my government that ARV therapy works here.
not_available And when they see our success, they'll realize we can save millions of lives.
not_available I'm just trying to save one.
not_available One's not enough! You want me to walk you home? This is mild jaundice.
not_available Three Fansidar tablets and tell her if she's not feeling better, just come back.
not_available Dr.
not_available John, Ms.
not_available Likasu is here from the Ministry of Health.
not_available She was looking for your HIV patient.
not_available Celine? She was quite insistent.
not_available Did you tell her where she was? She went to Angelique.
not_available They're already on the ward.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available You shipped in drugs.
not_available Okay, sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, what? What? I'm enrolling Celine in my pilot program.
not_available I thought you were full.
not_available Yeah, I was.
not_available Thanks, Angelique.
not_available So, what happened? I met this rich American who can afford to commit $15,000 a year to my study for the next five years.
not_available You can afford that, can't you? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available So that means I have funding for 40 additional participants and your patient seemed like the start.
not_available What about her two kids? Don't push your luck, doctor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I looked in the records room and it's not there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, happy Thanksgiving to you too, jack
not_available off.
not_available Hey, did Detroit win? 
not_available I have no freaking idea.
not_available What about Dallas? 
not_available Don't make me come and smack you.
not_available Are those from Christmas? Last year? 
not_available The year before.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Which one's Dr.
not_available Greene? I'll need a massive amount of caffeine if I'm gonna make it to sunrise.
not_available Here you go, Abby.
not_available Shred it.
not_available Look at this one.
not_available That's definitely 2001.
not_available The Secret Santa party.
not_available Anybody hear from Carter? 
not_available He sent us a postcard a month ago.
not_available Put that in the lounge.
not_available How's he doing? I don't know.
not_available Why did you come back? Well, you were raised in Paris, London? After you got your degree, why did you come back to the Congo? My father was killed.
not_available So I came back to settle his affairs.
not_available How was he killed? He was on his way from Manono to Kabitena.
not_available And his car was ambushed by rebels and CLF soldiers.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available He was an engineer.
not_available And he worked 30 years trying to upgrade the water supply in Kivu and Katanga.
not_available But he was a Banyamulenge driving in a Mai Mai area.
not_available So they pulled him from his car and shot him in the head.
not_available He believed in the goodness of people.
not_available I came back for him.
not_available Here he is.
not_available Hey.
not_available Need a helmet? Probably.
not_available What's the matter? Celine didn't show up at the clinic this morning for her testing.
not_available So when was the last time she came in? Two weeks ago, just after her husband died.
not_available And her lymphocyte count was still good? 
not_available Yep.
not_available It was excellent.
not_available Something must have happened.
not_available She knows she's supposed to be monitored.
not_available So how are we gonna find her? 
not_available She'll be with people from her village.
not_available How are we gonna find them? We ask.
not_available When did you first notice he was sick? 
not_available A week ago.
not_available Has he been coughing? Yes.
not_available But nothing is coming out.
not_available Any shortness of breath? He cannot run.
not_available He gets very tired.
not_available I know I was supposed to come to the clinic.
not_available But I wanted to wait till he was feeling much better.
not_available I have been taking my medicine every day.
not_available Start him on high dose trimethoprim sulfa.
not_available Twenty milligrams per kilo per day, divided Q six hours.
not_available Prednisone.
not_available Ten milligrams twice a day.
not_available How are we set for oxygen? 
not_available Not good.
not_available Hold off on the O2 for now.
not_available Is it the AIDS? 
not_available He has pneumocystis pneumonia.
not_available It's an infection that can take hold if the immune system is weakened.
not_available Will he get better? I hope so.
not_available We're gonna give him medicine, see how he does.
not_available He looks so small and sick.
not_available I only slept with my husband.
not_available No one else, ever.
not_available How bad? Well, if he gets through the pneumonia, he's gonna need ARV's.
not_available Do you have the pediatric suspensions? 
not_available No.
not_available We could grind up the adult tablets.
not_available Figure out the dosage for a 5year
not_available old.
not_available No.
not_available The little boy's gonna die.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can just stand there, not do anything? You can let that happen? 
not_available What?! I am doing something.
not_available I'm proving drug therapy works so we can save 1000 little boys, Then help me save this one! 
not_available Don't you yell at me.
not_available You go home.
not_available You yell at your president.
not_available You yell at your government.
not_available You tell them that we need real money.
not_available Not just these empty promises.
not_available You tell them 6000 people are dying out here everyDamn it! 
not_available They have to do something about it.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Great.
not_available Still mad? I wasn't mad.
not_available Well, Charles tells me that you're gonna take a C
not_available 140 flight into Kinshasa to get a couple more tons of rice.
not_available No, it's MONUC's plane.
not_available I'm just along for the ride.
not_available It occurred to me that I might be able to talk you into picking up a few things.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Oh, Christmas decorations.
not_available You know, tree, lights, ornaments, tinsel.
not_available Tinsel? Santa suit, snow globes, that sort of thing.
not_available Oh, and a couple of cylinders of oxygen.
not_available Oxygen? 
not_available You know, if you can find any.
not_available I made a list.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Just wrapping a few Christmas presents for some friends back home.
not_available Bangala.
not_available Hope you didn't pay too much for it.
not_available No, it was cheap.
not_available Fifty bucks.
not_available What? I'm just kidding.
not_available It was three.
not_available How was your day? 
not_available Endless.
not_available Who's Abby? She's, you know, a friend.
not_available Really? I hope she still is.
not_available Why? You jealous? A bit.
not_available I think I might be pregnant.
not_available What? How? When did? Oh, yeah.
not_available You angry? No.
not_available You're upset? No.
not_available You? I thought I would be, but It's strange.
not_available I think I might be happy.
not_available Do you want to have our baby? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Do you? You first.
not_available I've got my program.
not_available And we barely know each other.
not_available It's been, what, six hours? Six weeks.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm really in trouble.
not_available Getting bad out there? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Merry Christmas Eve, huh? 
not_available If you say so.
not_available Hey, Greg.
not_available Hey, Valerie.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available Just waiting for the holidays.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Except I got to work.
not_available Too bad.
not_available You waiting for Mike? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's supposed to be off in a couple minutes.
not_available All right then, merry Christmas.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Merry Christmas, everybody! 
not_available Hey, what the hell is that? Come on, that's it.
not_available Hey, what is that? 
not_available A little bit of Sikh rap.
not_available A little Sikh rap.
not_available Are you ready to go? 
not_available No, keep dancing.
not_available She's good.
not_available I found six tanks.
not_available The pilot couldn't handle the extra weight.
not_available He only let me bring on these three.
not_available Bilateral interstitial infiltrates and a high LDH? Yeah.
not_available We've got him on IV Bactrim and steroids.
not_available Pulse ox on O2 is only 78.
not_available Is he not getting any better? He should be resting more comfortably now with the oxygen.
not_available How about the other stuff? Dumped them in the hallway.
not_available Yeah? Decorations? Ornaments? That kind of thing? Someone offered to sell me a fruitcake.
not_available You like fruitcake? You didn't get any, like, decorations, or tinsel or garland? Hey, I did the best I could do.
not_available All right.
not_available What's that? 
not_available Oh, it's fantastic.
not_available Where did you get all this stuff? American embassy.
not_available A bunch of their old junk in the basement.
not_available Friends back home sent all this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The ER staff where I worked.
not_available I asked everybody to get one gift, nothing over $20.
not_available And looks like everybody chipped in.
not_available How are we gonna know what to give whom? They were supposed
not_available Yeah, they wrote on the back, see? Appropriate age, boy, girl.
not_available A few in here for the adults too.
not_available Package in here for you, John.
not_available This one's heavy.
not_available John is that some kind of doll? What'd you get? It is a card from work that everybody signed.
not_available What's "Martin, Hall and Jacobs? " That is a law firm back home.
not_available It's marked "Urgent.
not_available " Oh, my God.
not_available What? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano died.
