not_available And I'd recommend a face mask.
not_available Damn mutt farted all the way here.
not_available Abdominal pain, low
not_available grade fever.
not_available Doc was worried about appendicitis so he figured he'd get a surgical consult.
not_available The guy seems fine to me.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Nice to see you again.
not_available You didn't need to come in, Grandma.
not_available Of course I needed to.
not_available My eyes don't hurt.
not_available I'm checking for signs of head trauma.
not_available I was only going like two miles an hour.
not_available You were driving? Did you know about that? Did you tell your family everything you did when you were 12? I did not know.
not_available I wanted to pick up your prescriptions and still get to school.
not_available Let me see.
not_available What about your parents? Oh, uh, Ruthie's mother and father died when she was 6 months old.
not_available I was about a year, Grandma.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I would be too, if I remembered.
not_available Bob.
not_available Ooh, he's a regular wind tunnel this morning, isn't he? Ruthie, we have to keep you here for a while for observation.
not_available Grandma, maybe Dr.
not_available Lockhart can ask you about your cough.
not_available Sure, we'll check that out.
not_available What about the dog? Oh, I think it's his diet.
not_available No, he can't be here, even temporarily.
not_available Is there some place you can keep him? So should I call the SPCA? 
not_available Oh.
not_available Bob's 13 years old.
not_available Don't get me wrong, I support the SPCA.
not_available But they take him, I'm stuck here a day or two and my Grandma can't get him out they might put him down.
not_available So if Bob goes, I go with him.
not_available You're sure you don't want this? 
not_available You'll be sorry.
not_available Lenore, did you lose consciousness? No, Dr.
not_available Archie, I remember everything.
not_available Cleaning my windows

not_available Okay.
not_available Possible left 1 Oth rib fracture.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know
not_available ? You know what? If you don't mind.
not_available You want me to hold it? 
not_available What's with the suit, man? Uh, keep this on the QT, but I took a job with Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.
not_available Doesn't start till July 1 st, but signing bonus.
not_available Always been my dream.
not_available Pushing overpriced meds to people who probably don't need them.
not_available Always been my dream to hold Dr.
not_available Archie's coat.
not_available Okay, trauma panel, C
not_available spine, chest, page Surgery and let's get an ultrasound.
not_available Will Ruthie's x
not_available rays take a little while? Only about 30 minutes.
not_available Isn't that what you said? 
not_available Something like that.
not_available Can you take another deep breath in, please? How long have you had that cough? About three or four years.
not_available Since Jimmy Carter was president, I guess.
not_available Since you wish Jimmy Carter was president, right, Grandma? I write his name in every time.
not_available Still waiting for Radiology.
not_available Shouldn't be long.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Don't worry, dear.
not_available They said it'd only take about 30 minutes.
not_available Can you remind me again? When was Jimmy Carter elected? I think it was back
not_available Mrs.
not_available Pooler? Well, sometime before this latest bozo.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available You know, I don't much like any of them.
not_available You wanna know why? I don't think Dr.
not_available Lockhart cares much about our politics.
not_available Stamps.
not_available The price of stamps.
not_available They all keep raising them.
not_available This latest increase, can you believe it? Nineteen cents for first class.
not_available Nineteen cents? Come on, Grandma, you know it's gone up a lot more than that.
not_available Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't like to think about it.
not_available If Ruthie has to stay in here it won't be more than a couple of days, right? Because I really do want her home for Easter.
not_available Grandma 
not_available I think Easter was last week.
not_available Well, I certainly hope not.
not_available We're picking up the ham on Saturday.
not_available I've got four cases backed up in the O.R.
not_available so this had better be real.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Albright from Surgery.
not_available Does your belly hurt? 
not_available I guess so.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Fluid in Morison's pouch? 
not_available That looks like it.
not_available Blood anterior to the bladder and in the splenorenal recess.
not_available I've seen enough.
not_available Prep her for the O.R.
not_available I think we should get a CT.
not_available She's unstable, she's anemic.
not_available Could be chronic.
not_available She's hypotensive.
not_available BP normalized with a liter.
not_available She's bleeding in her belly, end of story.
not_available Get her upstairs.
not_available Guess you told her.
not_available Repeat the HemoCue, get a serum albumin and a urine protein.
not_available Yeah, but that could take
not_available Yes, Haleh, it could.
not_available I wanted to give you a heads up
not_available Steve's in Exam 2? I know.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's okay.
not_available We can get another nurse.
not_available Luka, thank you, but I can handle it.
not_available Hey, Sam.
not_available They thought it was appendicitis? Yeah, I was in a lot of pain on the drive over, but I feel okay now.
not_available Figured they'd assign me another nurse.
not_available Just doing my job.
not_available So things are going pretty well, huh? Alex writes me a lot of letters now.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Your temp's 99.4.
not_available I'm happy for you, Sam.
not_available New job, new place to live.
not_available What's with the cross? The chaplain gave it to me.
not_available Are you keeping up on your Bible studies? Yeah.
not_available I'm picking up a thing or two.
not_available And it doesn't hurt that those are the guys who'll watch your back.
not_available Your BP's 124/80.
not_available That's good, right? It's normal.
not_available You think I'm faking this pain, don't you? A lot of guys do just so they can get out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I can't say I blame them.
not_available If there's one thing you can say about jail, it's everything it's cracked up to be.
not_available One of the docs will be in to check you out.
not_available Steve Curtis, 35year
not_available old detainee with abdominal pain.
not_available Rule out appy.
not_available How'd we get a detainee? Pain was 10 out of 10.
not_available It's resolved.
not_available Resolved.
not_available That's convenient.
not_available I feel I should let you know that Mr.
not_available Curtis and Sam
not_available Neela.
not_available It's my ex, my kid's dad.
not_available Oh, that must be really tough on your little boy.
not_available It is what it is.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Curtis.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available Are you feeling any tenderness at all anywhere? No, it's better now.
not_available His white count's 10,000.
not_available That's not very impressive, is it? 
not_available Pulse is down after a liter.
not_available It was pretty painful for a while.
not_available Oh, yeah? Could be the stomach flu.
not_available You live in close quarters.
not_available That could run rampant through half the population.
not_available Close quarters? You're a riot.
not_available Anyway, anyway.
not_available Well, you're feeling better, right? And Dr.
not_available Rasgotra here will sign you out.
not_available He has a low
not_available grade fever.
not_available We should observe himCome on, it's barely a low
not_available grade fever, please.
not_available CBC shows a left shift.
not_available Yeah, but there's no leukocytosis.
not_available I can appreciate these guys wanting to get out of the can now and then.
not_available But we're not running a timeshare here, okay? Just release him.
not_available I'm sorry if you didn't want me to mention your relationship.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I just don't need people protecting me.
not_available You wanna write up his aftercare? 
not_available No, repeat the CBC.
not_available Neela, you don't have to do that for me.
not_available I'm not doing it for you.
not_available His history tells me to do it.
not_available History? What, lies and deception? 
not_available You never really thought he was sick? I don't know.
not_available Clemente examined him and released him.
not_available He's a patient like anyone else.
not_available Repeat the CBC.
not_available So it's not Alzheimer's? No, but there are similarities in how it affects people.
not_available And with this type of dementia, it can sometimes progress very quickly.
not_available But that means sometimes it can be slow.
not_available Ruthie, let the doctor talk.
not_available There are some concerns, Mrs.
not_available Pooler, about your ability to take care of Ruthie.
not_available To make decisions, to cook.
not_available I can cook, I can make decisions.
not_available Like you did about driving this morning? And Social Services is going to wanna talk to you.
not_available Most likely, they're gonna wanna discuss putting Ruthie into foster care.
not_available They can't do that.
not_available You can't do that, that's not fair.
not_available We're not gonna let them, are we? 
not_available Ruthie.
not_available I don't take the car much and I've never hit anything before.
not_available I know everything she needs, all of her prescriptions.
not_available Neurontin, 300 milligrams, twice a day.
not_available Ruthie.
not_available Diltiazem, 240 milligrams a day.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Lanoxin, 0.
not_available 125 milligrams a day.
not_available Stop it now.
not_available Please, please, don't let this happen.
not_available I don't want anything to change.
not_available Ruthie? When your mama and daddy died I thought that nothing would ever be the same.
not_available And then we took the worst possible moments and we turned it into years and years of the best possible moments.
not_available Didn't we? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, now, I know that at least about this one thing Grandma is not confused, am I? 
not_available No.
not_available No, that's my girl.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Okay, so you don't want me to hold the coat this time.
not_available Had a talk with myself this afternoon.
not_available I said, "Archie, you know what? You are Dr.
not_available Archie Morris.
not_available You don't need no stinking Prada suit.
not_available " What did you spill? 
not_available Coffee.
not_available Little numbing medicine here, Lenore.
not_available Morris, what the hell are you doing? 
not_available Peritoneal aspirate.
not_available Is your name Morris? 
not_available Her crit was stable.
not_available So I decided to do
not_available I've been waiting for half an hour.
not_available I discovered she's been on lithium for a year.
not_available Oh, and that changes everything? Not quite everything, but 
not_available Whoa, wait, she's prepped and draped.
not_available And bleeding internally.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available The lithium causes nephrotic syndrome.
not_available Tell me something I don't know.
not_available Her hypertension could be vasovagal from the rib pain.
not_available You wanna make that assumption? Where am I going? 
not_available Hold on, honey, they're figuring it out.
not_available She may not need the O.R.
not_available I feel very strongly about this, Dr.
not_available Albright.
not_available Oh, you do, do you? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Morris! Straw
not_available colored fluid, not blood.
not_available It's ascites from nephrotic syndrome.
not_available She doesn't need surgery.
not_available She needs steroids and a kidney biopsy.
not_available Double trauma pulling up if you're looking for action.
not_available No, I gotta head upstairs.
not_available Sorry we missed you in your suit.
not_available How'd you know about my suit? 
not_available I know everything.
not_available Everything? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Don't suppose I can get you to look at this open tibfib in 4? 
not_available Sorry, Chuny, I'm not on today.
not_available All right.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Dr.
not_available Albright.
not_available Don't worry, I am handling it.
not_available You haven't called Social Services.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available I said they put me on hold.
not_available I don't have the time
not_available You really think you're gonna make things easier by keeping them around? No.
not_available It's not easy.
not_available They've always had each other.
not_available I know, and it's horribly sad, but they can't stay that way.
not_available We don't know that a hundred percent for sure, do we? This woman has bilateral lacunar infarcts.
not_available She's gonna decompensate sooner rather than later.
not_available And what? She's gonna raise a 12yearold? Well, a very mature 12year
not_available old that seems so far to have done a very good job of holding it together.
not_available They're a family, Luka.
not_available Why aren't we fighting for that? Kids shouldn't be caretakers.
not_available Sometimes they have to be.
not_available I know in Croatia, you grew up like Ozzie and Harriet.
not_available I'm sorry, I know you don't know what Ozzie &amp; Harriet is.
not_available But whatever.
not_available The thing is, it's going to get harder and harder.
not_available That doesn't mean that they're not better off together.
not_available Like you were better off with your mother? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available You know, that girl is healthy.
not_available She's in school.
not_available She's in a loving environment.
not_available The grandmother is still functioning.
not_available She can handle her ADLs.
not_available Yeah, for now, but what
not_available ? If you asked me if I wanted to be taken away from my mother I would have said no.
not_available It's not our job to let the 12year
not_available olds decide.
not_available Ruthie? Hey, Ruthie, stop.
not_available Ruthie.
not_available Very mature.
not_available Neela, your repeat blood work's back on your no doubt unfairly prosecuted wrongly incarcerated, rule
not_available out appy.
not_available I told you to discharge him, didn't I? 
not_available His white count's up to 12,000.
not_available So what? 
not_available If his appendix burst on the way his pain might be temporarily relieved.
not_available Wait, see if he declares himself.
not_available I examined him.
not_available Here.
not_available His temperature's up to 100.4.
not_available Could be an appy.
not_available Right.
not_available No way.
not_available It's impossible.
not_available Let me take a look.
not_available The initial exam could've been in the post
not_available perforation window.
not_available But he'd have signs of peritonitis.
not_available Takes a while to develop.
not_available Steve.
not_available Hey, Steve.
not_available He's diaphoretic, barely has a pulse.
not_available Two liters, wide open, put him in Trendelenberg.
not_available Take the cuffs off, please.
not_available All right.
not_available His abdomen's rigid as a board.
not_available Can't be, can't be.
not_available It was completely soft.
not_available Pressure's only 70 palp.
not_available He's gonna need a second IV.
not_available Give him a gram of cefoxitin.
not_available Are you gonna take him to the O.R.?.
not_available If we get pressure up.
not_available He's septic.
not_available Dopamine.
not_available Run a V
not_available tach.
not_available Okay, get the crash cart.
not_available O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available They bumped your lap chole.
not_available Hey, how are you? 
not_available I wasn't faking.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available Rasgotra, Barney Fife here wants to know how long you're gonna detain him.
not_available I was thinking, what? As long as possible? Yes, that would be correct.
not_available Yeah? You've been working pretty long hours, Vic.
not_available Getting any sleep? Bobby, I'm not doing this.
not_available You hear me? I'm not doing it, man.
not_available I've been wanting to talk to you all day.
not_available Even stopped by to drop something off, but there was this sheriff's van outside.
not_available What did you do, go and hire protection? I'm not playing your game.
not_available You hear me? I'm not playing your little games.
not_available Okay, okay, calm down, buddy.
not_available I'll let you go.
not_available Oh, and one last thing, though.
not_available What time are you going home tonight? 
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Lockhart? 
not_available We'd have to check.
not_available Please tell her Ruthie Pooler's here and I'll be in with my grandmother.
not_available Exam 3? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Any word from Social Services? I think Dr.
not_available Lockhart called them, but no one has been down yet.
not_available It's just I haven't been getting any sleep lately.
not_available And the thing is that I've been really, really needing some.
not_available It's been kind of rocky since Jodie.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's great.
not_available It's just I was wondering.
not_available Can you write me a scrip for some Ambien? Is herbal tea not working? Ha
not_available ha.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Did you ask your doctor? Docs don't have docs.
not_available You know that.
not_available Abby, thank you.
not_available Thank you, I really appreciate it, I really do.
not_available Sure.
not_available What? You give me two? Just two? 
not_available Tonight, tomorrow night.
not_available And I'm sure by the next day, you'll have your own primary
not_available care physician.
not_available Ruthie Pooler's back.
not_available She's looking for you, she's in the room.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available Come on, you're killing me.
not_available Have you tried those nature CDs? Birds chirping? Waves crashing? I wasn't running away.
not_available I didn't think you were.
not_available I didn't think you would leave your grandmother.
not_available Or your dog.
not_available Ruthie Believe me, I know this is not gonna be easy.
not_available Keys to my grandmother's car.
not_available El passes.
not_available Three months' worth.
not_available Italian Cooking Made Simple.
not_available Rachael Ray's 30
not_available Minute Meals.
not_available Better Food for Dogs.
not_available This one's for Bob.
not_available This one's for us.
not_available Untranslated subtitle 
not_available I can do this, Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available We can do this.
not_available For this to happen, Social Services has to follow up with you.
not_available Probably once a week.
not_available You're gonna need home health
not_available care workers, probably every day.
not_available You said it wasn't going to be easy.
not_available ER.
not_available Don't you ever pull that crap on me again! 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available But the last time I looked, I was right.
not_available You were lucky.
not_available A hypertensive patient with a low crit and a positive ultrasound needs surgery.
not_available It was vasovagal, it was chronic anemia and it was ascites.
not_available I saved your ass.
not_available She could've bled to death.
not_available You would've sliced her open on the table for no good reason.
not_available Hey, Jerry.
not_available Olivia, how you doing? Where are we? 
not_available Pick your poison.
not_available Trauma 1 or 2.
not_available Thanks.
