not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available I took two Vicodin.
not_available Are you gonna tell Weaver? 
not_available I can't.
not_available I think you have to.
not_available And I thought we were really hitting it off.
not_available You're straight, and I'm not.
not_available Kynesha, who's this? This is Tiny.
not_available I hate the thought of her being in my house alone.
not_available Now she's bringing friends over? I'm sorry.
not_available That won't happen again.
not_available Peter, she's manipulating you.
not_available There has never been a more successful treatment for your tumor.
not_available If you believe that and mobilize your inner resources you're gonna survive.
not_available E.
not_available R.
not_available 7x11 "ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS" Hello? What? Who is this? Okay, tell me what happened.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Kynesha, slow down.
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available What's wrong? Did he put his hands on you? All right.
not_available Where are you now? What intersection? All right.
not_available No, just wait there.
not_available I'll pick you up.
not_available Yeah, I'll be there.
not_available You're going? She got into it with somebody at the halfway house.
not_available She got scared and took off.
not_available Did she report it to the manager? I don't know.
not_available I guess there's a problem there too.
not_available So where is she? South Federal.
not_available I thought that wasn't a safe neighborhood.
not_available That's all she knows, Cleo.
not_available Peter, don't you think that it's a little strange that she waited until 4:00 in the morning to call us? Yeah, but what you do you want me to do? Leave her out on the street? It's 10 degrees outside.
not_available You're never going to get rid of her.
not_available Hey.
not_available Mark, go to sleep.
not_available You feeling nauseous? No.
not_available Have a bad dream? Please, Mark.
not_available You've got to get your rest.
not_available So do you.
not_available You shouldn't be walking around.
not_available You could fall.
not_available Good thing you're a doctor.
not_available How long you been up? I never went to sleep, really.
not_available No point worrying about it.
not_available There's nothing you can do.
not_available Gordon didn't say anything else? Any indication why this meeting was so urgent? Just that Patterson's lawyers called it.
not_available It's probably not bad.
not_available They want to talk.
not_available Yeah, but what about? You'll know soon enough.
not_available Hurry! Open up! Open up! Hurry up! Kynesha, what the? Go! Hey, hey! 
not_available Open up! Hey, hey, right here.
not_available Go! You owe me, girl! 
not_available Hey man, come on back here.
not_available I'm gonna find you! I'm gonna find you! Kynesha, what the hell was that? 
not_available A bunch of fools used to be my friends.
not_available I told them you were a doctor.
not_available Ain't nothing on this radio? E.
not_available R.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available You don't like the food? The room
not_available service guy has seen all my pajamas.
not_available So we'll get up earlier.
not_available Or we could sleep in, at my place.
not_available The paramedics are 10 minutes out with a possible hip fracture.
not_available Can you take him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Guess you're having breakfast alone.
not_available John, how'd it go last night? With what? Weaver.
not_available Did you tell her? Right.
not_available I think I'm gonna wait 
not_available until after my midyear evaluation.
not_available When's that? Sometime today.
not_available You're procrastinating.
not_available You're nagging.
not_available I'm being your sponsor.
not_available It's different than being my mother.
not_available Don't you think? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lambert's in Curtain 3 with a fever Mr.
not_available Mohlsick in Exam 1 with frostbite.
not_available Carter, you got evaluation at 11:00.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Don't be late.
not_available You want Mrs.
not_available Furtado? She has vaginal bleeding.
not_available She had it last month too.
not_available It's called her period.
not_available What else? Roger Pilarsky's back.
not_available He has abdominal pain.
not_available Again? 
not_available It's the cold.
not_available When it dips below 20 
not_available I know.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Exam 2.
not_available Like a "bishop" bishop? 
not_available Yep.
not_available I think he may have confirmed me.
not_available Wow.
not_available Started a line.
not_available Gave him four of morphine.
not_available Were you able to get up after your fall? He tried, but several of us had to help.
not_available I can speak for myself.
not_available Peripheral pulses plus two.
not_available Call him "Your Excellency." 
not_available Bishop is fine.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get him inside and get him into a gown.
not_available All right.
not_available You have a rear window in stock? Great.
not_available Great.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available That shower felt good.
not_available Don't worry about the window.
not_available I'll pay for it.
not_available With what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Something.
not_available You know what, Kynesha? You need to learn how to start respecting people.
not_available I respect you.
not_available I called the halfway house.
not_available They said you started a fight and took off.
not_available I hate that place.
not_available The lady that runs it's a bitch.
not_available That's where you live now, so you better make it work.
not_available Well, I'd rather live with you.
not_available We've been over this.
not_available You can't stay here indefinitely.
not_available I could if you had your own place.
not_available Be a lot easier.
not_available What do you think you're doing? 
not_available Depends.
not_available What you want me to do? Kynesha, you betterWhere she at? At work? 
not_available Hey.
not_available It's all good.
not_available I'm too tired now anyway.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pilarsky, you haven't stopped taking your Mellaril, have you? 
not_available No.
not_available How long's your belly bothered you? A few days, but it's definitely gotten worse since I've been here.
not_available He's afebrile.
not_available BP's 180/70.
not_available Blood pressure's a little high.
not_available Are you upset, Mr.
not_available Pilarsky? Depressed mostly.
not_available I haven't had intimate contact in 11 years.
not_available It takes its toll after a while.
not_available Why don't we take a look at your belly find out what the problem is.
not_available Oh, for God's sake! Conni? Mr.
not_available Pilarsky, why do you do this to yourself? I'm an only child, you know.
not_available Are those ours? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Start a line, draw a trauma panel and set up the SonoSite.
not_available Never did get married.
not_available You want a Psych consult? 
not_available No.
not_available Put my career first.
not_available Let's clear him surgically first.
not_available You want to catch a movie later? 
not_available You didn't get my message, I take it.
not_available No.
not_available Did something change? The meeting was canceled.
not_available We took a conference call and agreed on a settlement figure.
not_available That means we accept guilt? It means the hospital's gonna take it in the shorts to the tune of $1.5 million.
not_available But our insurance will pay that.
not_available And so will we, with sky
not_available high premiums.
not_available It could've been worse.
not_available We're not getting off cheap.
not_available She didn't pay a dime.
not_available There was a general recall on the endoscopic curettes that you used.
not_available I didn't have trouble with the curette.
not_available Nonetheless, there was a recall.
not_available We signed a confidentiality agreement keeping the details of the suit private.
not_available So you can't speak about it.
not_available There was nothing faulty with the equipment.
not_available Apparently, there was.
not_available And the manufacturer has deeper pockets.
not_available Well, that's wrong.
not_available Look at it as a gift.
not_available We pay big and you get a ding at the National Data Bank.
not_available How lucky is that? Then my parents went through this whole charismatic phase.
not_available But they're still pretty Catholic.
not_available I mean, you know.
not_available So, what religion do they practice in your country? 
not_available This is my country, Dave.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available Smooth.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need
not_available Fill out your name and complaint.
not_available No, I need a laxative.
not_available Amira, why don't you get an emesis basin for Miss? Never mind.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Why don't you take a seat over here? 
not_available My stomach hurts.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I need to go to the bathroom and I can't.
not_available Tell me your name.
not_available Anne.
not_available Anne, I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Has this ever happened to you before? It started on the plane.
not_available From where? 
not_available Texas.
not_available You just flew in? Did you eat anything unusual? 
not_available Airplane food.
not_available Well, that could do it.
not_available Let's get you in a room and see if we can't find out what's going on.
not_available Oh, my God! It's blood.
not_available It's
not_available I'm gonna need a little help over here.
not_available Did you land on your side or on your back? On my keister.
not_available Several small children found it amusing.
not_available We were quite worried.
not_available Any tenderness here? Not so much.
not_available Joe, you're making me nervous.
not_available Go get yourself a cup of coffee.
not_available Please.
not_available Last thing I need is an entourage.
not_available Any physical conditions I should know about? Osteoarthritis.
not_available Runs in the family.
not_available Are you currently on any medications? Tylenol.
not_available And the occasional glass of wine.
not_available Where are you from? You have an accent.
not_available Croatia.
not_available Any numbness in this area? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you have a primary care doctor I should notify? He's playing golf in Arizona.
not_available Okay.
not_available Someone will take you to X
not_available ray.
not_available Would you like anything for pain? 
not_available I have a high threshold.
not_available Croatia is a very Catholic country.
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you Catholic? 
not_available No.
not_available That's it? That's all you're going to tell me? She got into a fight and took off to hang out with friends.
not_available So this whole "I was attacked" 
not_available was blown out of proportion.
not_available A little.
not_available Did you take her back to the halfway house? Not yet.
not_available Then where did you take her? 
not_available Well, she needed to take a shower.
not_available It's just for the day.
not_available You said that when she stayed three weeks.
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available Small Mallory
not_available Weiss tear.
not_available No active bleeding, though.
not_available Temperature's higher, 102.
not_available Wait.
not_available Foreign body obstructing the gastric outlet.
not_available Good call on the ultrasound.
not_available Okay.
not_available Grasper.
not_available Reminds me of one of those big claw things they have at the arcade.
not_available What do you call them? Big claw things.
not_available What the heck is that? Got it.
not_available Okay, slowly extracting.
not_available BP's rising.
not_available 160/100.
not_available Up.
not_available Up.
not_available And out.
not_available Pulse is 140.
not_available BP's high, 240/100.
not_available Is that a condom? Probably cocaine.
not_available Must have leaked.
not_available I need phentolamine and esmolol drips.
not_available and four of Ativan in case she seizes.
not_available She's a drug mule.
not_available I just heard that Roger Pilarsky was treated for a self
not_available inflicted injury.
not_available Yeah, with a pair of our suture scissors no less.
not_available You sent him home? 
not_available It was superficial.
not_available Didn't breach the peritoneum.
not_available There should have been a Psych consult.
not_available He's a frequent flier.
not_available A new injury every week.
not_available Could be an accelerating pattern.
not_available He's never had a serious suicide attempt.
not_available Your department's refused to admit him on three separate occasions.
not_available He tried to harm himself.
not_available We're supposed to be called.
not_available All he wanted was food and company.
not_available Frankly, I thought you'd be grateful thatKerry, I
not_available I think we should not let what happened between us interfere with patient care.
not_available What? 
not_available We're both professionals.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I did what I thought was medically appropriate.
not_available It had nothing to do with the fact you've been avoiding me? It doesn't, and I haven't.
not_available But if you'd like me to call you every time someone disturbed comes into the ER, you've got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where did you really fly in from? South America? Belize.
not_available Well, you're lucky you didn't pop at 35,000 feet.
not_available You might've died.
not_available Maybe that would have been better.
not_available You mind telling me how you got into all this? I was robbed.
not_available They took 
everything My money.
not_available My passport.
not_available My clothes.
not_available Even my shoes.
not_available So you decided to smuggle drugs to get back.
not_available I met this man.
not_available He was very nice to me.
not_available He said he would help.
not_available All I had to do was stop here in the United States for him.
not_available But you knew what he was asking you to do.
not_available I just wanted to go home.
not_available That's all.
not_available I wanted to go home.
not_available That whole celibacy thing was always the sticking point for me, though.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available But I got over it.
not_available Yeah, well Dr.
not_available Kovac, did you know that St.
not_available Peter was married? Anyway, I should get going.
not_available Nice talking to you, Bishop Stewart.
not_available Same here.
not_available You have a lot of degenerative changes, but no fracture.
not_available There will be bruising, but the worst should be over in a few days.
not_available Yeah, I know the drill.
not_available You fall a lot? Damned arthritis makes me wobbly, especially when it's cold.
not_available Ever use a walker? That would cramp my style, don't you think? Might save your hips.
not_available Last time I had a flareup, my doctor put me on this IV, gave me some some kind of steroid.
not_available SoluMedrol? 
not_available That's it.
not_available The stuff worked wonders.
not_available You realize it's a temporary fix.
not_available I'll take whatever I can get.
not_available Just so it gets me through the hard bits.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll give you the Solu
not_available Medrol if you promise to use a walker.
not_available What? Are we negotiating? 
not_available Not really.
not_available Do you want the steroids? I'll use a cane.
not_available Yosh? 125 milligrams of Solu
not_available Medrol for the bishop and order a cane from Central Supply.
not_available You got it.
not_available What was your confirmation name? Mihael.
not_available After the patron saint of the sick.
not_available How appropriate.
not_available "He has questioned the decisionmaking of senior physicians in critical
not_available care settings." I have a detailed list if you're interested.
not_available Probably not.
not_available Interpersonal skills, how you deal with patients and staff, all excellent.
not_available In fact, it's hard to find fault with your work.
not_available Really? You've made a remarkable comeback from a serious addiction.
not_available And I think I speak for everyone when I say that we're proud of you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good.
not_available We're pretty jammed up out there so unless there's anything you want to talk about, sign the bottom of the form.
not_available Is there something you want to talk about? Sorry.
not_available Multi
not_available victim trauma.
not_available We're gonna need everybody.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Sevenyear
not_available old hit in the crosswalk by a pickup doing 30.
not_available Complains of chest pain and shortness of breath.
not_available Tachy at 120.

not_available Can you tell me your name? 
not_available Amy.
not_available Where's my mom? 
not_available Next ambulance.
not_available Take a breath, Amy.
not_available Does your tummy hurt? No.
not_available Is my dad okay? We'll find out when we finish with you.
not_available We need a chest tube on the left.
not_available Julie Hembree, 32 years old.
not_available Chest and abdominal pain.
not_available I thought there were three.
not_available Father was DOA at the scene.
not_available Systolic of 80 in the field.
not_available Now up to 100.
not_available Where's Amy? Where's my husband? It might be a rib fracture.
not_available Okay, she needs an ultrasound.
not_available Let's get Surgery down here.
not_available Mandy, can you push the cholecystectomy to next week? 
not_available Sure.
not_available These are lovely.
not_available Glad you think so.
not_available They're for you.
not_available From Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available Yes.
not_available O.R.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, they need you downstairs.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available Should I put these in your office? 
not_available Please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Patterson, what are you doing here? I came to see you.
not_available I've been called to the Emergency department.
not_available I'll ride down with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Please allow me to say that I feel terrible about what's happened.
not_available Which part? Me being crippled or you getting sued for malpractice? My concern was for your situation, not mine.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Doesn't really compare, does it? Strange how it all comes down to faulty equipment.
not_available My lawyer tells me I can't really blame you.
not_available But I can't quite forgive you either.
not_available Imagine I'll always remember your face.
not_available I wonder whether you'll remember mine.
not_available Start in Trauma 1! Weaver needs that in 2.
not_available They'll need you right away.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Go, go.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available What is it, Conni? 
not_available Auto versus peds.
not_available Mother and daughter.
not_available Any critical? 
not_available The kid in Trauma 1 looks bad.
not_available Where's Benton? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Blunt chest, hemopneumo on the left.
not_available Did you scan the belly? 
not_available It seemed pretty benign.
not_available Where's ultrasound? 
not_available Next door.
not_available Why don't you examine her first? 
not_available Where's my mom? We'll take this collar off.
not_available You'll feel better.
not_available Okay.
not_available One percent with epi.
not_available Sats are down to 82.
not_available Put her up to 15 liters.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available How's the abdomen? Non
not_available tender.
not_available I can't clear her until we have an imaging study.
not_available That hurts! 
not_available Amy, it's okay.
not_available You want to intubate? 
not_available Let's wait for the chest tube.
not_available Green zone on the Broselow.
not_available Give me a curved Kelly.
not_available I want my mom! 
not_available Slow breaths, Amy.
not_available Slow, deep breaths.
not_available Pressure's down to 60.
not_available She's bleeding out.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hang two units of O
not_available neg on the rapid infuser.
not_available We need to intubate.
not_available Let's pre
not_available medicate with atropine.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, Dr.
not_available Weaver needs you right now.
not_available Let's keep up with the blood loss.
not_available You need me? Rebound and guarding in the right quadrant.
not_available Looks like a surgical belly.
not_available Please, how is she? My daughter.
not_available There's some bleeding in the chest.
not_available What does that mean? Is she okay? She's stable for right now, but it is serious.
not_available And what about my husband? Is he here too? Oh, God.
not_available No.
not_available Hey, we don't know anything for sure yet.
not_available We've got a liver laceration.
not_available You have some internal bleeding from the injury.
not_available We need to get you up to the O.R.
not_available now so we can stop the bleeding.
not_available Type
not_available specific's up.
not_available Squeeze in two units.
not_available Tell the O.R.
not_available we're on our way.
not_available Get her upstairs.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Over a liter out on the left.
not_available Get two more units of blood.
not_available Push the etomidate.
not_available We need to tube her.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Just bag her.
not_available Bring your patient in here.
not_available I'm red
not_available lining her to the O.R.
not_available We're not maintaining pressure.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Her daughter should see her first.
not_available I want to see her.
not_available She has a critical liver laceration.
not_available How much blood do you have? 
not_available Four units.
not_available You'll be just fine.
not_available Listen.
not_available Her systolic's down to 80.
not_available Get two pressure bags for the blood.
not_available Push the etomidate, then the sux.
not_available Amy, it's Mommy.
not_available You're gonna be all right.
not_available They're gonna take me to surgery now.
not_available But I'll see you real soon, okay? She's out.
not_available Fiveanda
not_available half tube.
not_available Amy? 
not_available That's it.
not_available We're going.
not_available Now! Cricoid pressure right there.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Okay, call X
not_available ray for a portable chest.
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available Pulse ox is up to 92.
not_available Set up a vent.
not_available FiO2, 100 percent.
not_available Rate of 20.
not_available Damn it! Lost her pulse! Starting compressions.
not_available Charge the paddles to 100.
not_available And get another 8 units from the blood bank.
not_available Keep pouring it in.
not_available Charged and ready.
not_available Clear.
not_available This the ex
not_available lap? Yes.
not_available Still a little shocky after five liters.
not_available Did you give FFP? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available What are you waiting for? 
not_available We were rather busy.
not_available Will you be doing an atrial
not_available caval shunt? I won't know until I open her up.
not_available It would help if I knew what you were planning.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, when I decide I'll tell you.
not_available I think Anspaugh's in the lounge.
not_available Can you ask him to assist? He's ready to go on a fem
not_available pop in 4.
not_available Any other Attendings around? They're all scrubbed in.
not_available It's just you on this one.
not_available Give another epi.
not_available Sats are down to 70.
not_available Two more liters out of the chest.
not_available Autotransfuse.
not_available Hang two more.
not_available She's losing it too fast.
not_available Hold the compressions.
not_available P.E.A.
not_available rate of 49.
not_available Set me up for pericardiocentesis.
not_available Take over here.
not_available Think she's in tamponade? It's our last chance for treating P.E.A.
not_available Give me the alligator clip.
not_available Hook it up to the V
not_available 1 lead.
not_available JVD's four centimeters.
not_available She's still hypovolemic.
not_available Bradying down to 40.
not_available Watch for any injury current.
not_available There.
not_available Back off.
not_available Anything in the pericardium? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available What's this? 
not_available I called for a consult.
not_available I'm admitting her.
not_available Why? 
not_available Danger to self.
not_available Does the pound of cocaine she swallowed figure into this? It wasn't a pound.
not_available We're not obligated to report drug use to the authorities.
not_available But I'd imagine in the case of drug smuggling we'd make an exception.
not_available She's not a dealer.
not_available She's a kid.
not_available She made a mistake and almost got killed.
not_available Maybe, but she's not suicidal.
not_available What's your problem, Kerry? What? 
not_available She's 18 years old.
not_available Could you excuse us, Dr.
not_available Carter? Her going to prison isn't going to benefit anybody.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Don't you ever talk to me like that in front of a resident again.
not_available I wouldn't have to if you didn't insist on interfering with my admission.
not_available She's an ER case.
not_available Which I was called into.
not_available I'm admitting her.

not_available Let me out of here! I gotta go! Let me out! Kevin Poole, 42, very drunk.
not_available Under police pursuit until he hit a concrete column.
not_available Needed the Jaws of Life to get him.
not_available Vitals are stable, but he's a pain.
not_available Settle down.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I'm going to examine your injuries.
not_available I need you to stay calm.
not_available What injuries? 
not_available Lovely.
not_available Why were the police chasing him? Hitand
not_available run.
not_available Took out a family at a crosswalk.
not_available They come here or Mercy? 
not_available Here.
not_available I gotta
not_available I gotta go.
not_available I gotta find my wallet.
not_available I'm gonna put a tube in your nose.
not_available Want me to numb him up first? 
not_available No.

not_available I can spray the back of his throat.
not_available Just keep swallowing.

not_available What's wrong? You ain't hungry? Hi, Kynesha.
not_available Who is she? 
not_available This is Adele Neuman.
not_available She's a social worker.
not_available Nice meeting you.
not_available I thought you called me here so I could be with you.
not_available I'm trying to find you a permanent place to live.
not_available I have a husband and wife in Riverside who are both African
not_available American.
not_available And they have two other foster children your age.
not_available I thought you said you cared about me.
not_available I said I care about what happens to you.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available You only doing all this because of Jesse.
not_available You think I don't know that? That's not true.
not_available I know that bitch Cleo don't like me.
not_available Kynesha.
not_available I knew that all along.
not_available You are underage without a way to provide for yourself.
not_available Now, it's either foster care or becoming a ward of the state.
not_available Which would you prefer? Fine.
not_available You don't want me.
not_available I'm gone.
not_available Kynesha.
not_available Kynesha! Just let me take it from here.
not_available She's got a stage
not_available three stellate fracture into the deep parenchyma.
not_available More suction, Shirley.
not_available Canister's full.
not_available Well, change it.
not_available She's oozing all over the place.
not_available How about platelets? 
not_available Already gave them.
not_available You need to correct her coagulopathy.
not_available ET and bleeding time are normal.
not_available It's your problem, not mine.
not_available All right.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm gonna try and pack the liver and get out.
not_available Okay, gel foam, Penrose.
not_available Come on! 
not_available BP's dropping.
not_available 90/60.
not_available You have to control the bleeding.
not_available The injury's too extensive.
not_available Maybe I can get caval control.
not_available Bovie, pickups.
not_available I can't maintain her vitals unless you get hemostasis.
not_available I know that! 
not_available She's lost another liter.
not_available Two more going up on the infuser.
not_available Call.
not_available Call for six more.
not_available BP's still dropping.
not_available Heart rate up to 120.
not_available There's too much blood in the field.
not_available I can't isolate the vena cava.
not_available She's bleeding out.
not_available Get Romano.
not_available I don't know if he's available.

not_available Your Morrison's Pouch is dry.
not_available Liver intact.
not_available Three DUIs, revoked license 
not_available the idiot still gets behind the wheel.
not_available Let me out of here, damn it! Sir, you have to hold still.
not_available His spleen looks good.
not_available She said stop.
not_available All right, what do we got? MVA with a lot of ETOH.
not_available No free fluid? 
not_available Crit is 42.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Sir, does it hurt here? Who the hell are you? Okay.
not_available How about here? All right.
not_available Some periumbilical tenderness.
not_available Okay, let's call Radiology, order a CT.
not_available Do you think it's necessary? It's hard to assess them when they're drunk like this.
not_available I like to be sure.
not_available Hey, it's Abby in the ER.
not_available Yeah, I can hold.
not_available How'd it go? The evaluation? It went very well.
not_available And? What? 
not_available Forget it.
not_available I didn't get a chance.
not_available You interrupted with the trauma.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Yeah, hello.
not_available What's going on? Sorry.
not_available Can you hold on? With what? 
not_available With you and Carter.
not_available Nothing.
not_available It seemed like you were fighting.
not_available We were.
not_available I'd tell you, but it's a privacy thing.
not_available His, not mine.
not_available Hi.
not_available Yeah, Benton's on his way up with a blunt abdominal trauma.
not_available Better be good.
not_available Liver fracture with uncontrolled hemorrhage.
not_available You called me out of a lunch because you can't tie off a liver? BP's 80/40, pulse rate 120.
not_available Ten units already in.
not_available Set up the argon beam.
not_available I tried to get caval control, but I
not_available You try the Pringle maneuver? You learned it in grade school, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available Ligate with 4.0 chromic while I occlude the hepatic artery.
not_available Get out.
not_available Argon's ready.
not_available All right.

not_available Tie off the vessels.
not_available Robert

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Get your ass over here now! Damn it! Mark? Hey, Luka.
not_available Need some help? 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So, what are you doing here? Radiation therapy.
not_available Every day for six weeks.
not_available Elizabeth's giving me a ride back, but she's stuck in surgery.
not_available Doctor Chen still out on leave? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You coming back to work soon? 
not_available Next week, I hope.
not_available Fast recovery, huh? Yeah.
not_available Speed of light.
not_available I heard you were doing immune therapy.
not_available As soon as the tumor vaccine's ready.
not_available So everything okay around here? Okay as ever.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I don't.
not_available Honest.
not_available Life's too short, you know? I know.
not_available So how are you, Luka? The same.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available Where is he? Who? 
not_available The bishop.
not_available I think he went to Trauma 1.
not_available What for? 
not_available To give someone their last rites.
not_available Are you sorry for your sins? What happened? 
not_available He crashed during CT.
not_available Yes.
not_available May our Lord Jesus Christ grant you absolution, and by his authority I can't hear! 
not_available May our Lord Jesus Christ Cross match another six.
not_available Pressure is 60.
not_available I absolve you of all your sins.
not_available Put him in Trendelenburg.
not_available He needs a central line.
not_available Let's get an eight French trauma kit.
not_available Okay, prep for a subclavian.
not_available Sats down to 75.
not_available He's not moving any air.
not_available Bag him.
not_available I'll intubate.
not_available You should leave.
not_available Oh, God Okay, one of Pavulon, 100 of sux.
not_available I need a sterile drape in here, people.
not_available Come on, let's move.
not_available Are you taking off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know a guy playing in a blues club later, if you're interested.
not_available No, I think I'm just gonna go home.
not_available Maybe tomorrow.
not_available He'll be here all week.
not_available Hey.
not_available I need to talk to you about this Weaver thing.
not_available Look, nothing happened.
not_available I threw them up.
not_available I know I'm fine.
not_available You know I'm fine.
not_available Weaver thinks I'm fine.
not_available So why give her any reason not to? I don't know.
not_available Maybe you can take that up with your next sponsor.
not_available What? I don't want to be your sponsor anymore.
not_available Where's that coming from? 
not_available I care about you.
not_available And I care about your recovery, but I can't keep saying the same things.
not_available Because it's hard enough for me to do it for myself.
not_available You serious? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available I'll get another sponsor.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch, you lose your compass? 
not_available I'm here to see Julie Hembree.
not_available One lucky lady.
not_available A Pringle maneuver courtesy of yours truly kept her from bleeding out.
not_available I thought Corday did the surgery.
not_available Long story.
not_available I'll tell you over cocoa sometime.
not_available She's all yours.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Hembree? You were one of the doctors for my daughter? Yes.
not_available Is she all right? Amy was hit in the chest at a very high speed.
not_available I know.
not_available I was there.
not_available She needed help breathing, so we intubated.
not_available We gave her transfusions to treat the blood loss.
not_available But despite all that, her heart stopped beating.
not_available No.
not_available We used intravenous drugs and shocked her heart for an hour.
not_available But her injuries were too severe.
not_available No.
not_available And she died.
not_available No.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available No! Okay With the type of injuries she had and the massive blood lossNo! 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No! No! 
not_available Calm down.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Just calm down.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm gonna have you take prednisone for the next four days.
not_available Bishop, our car is here.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available What happened to Kevin Poole? The drunk? He died on the table.
not_available At least he found absolution.
not_available You don't believe that.
not_available He ran down a family in the street.
not_available The mother's upstairs in surgery.
not_available I see.
not_available Does that make him any less worthy of salvation? He was more afraid than sorry.
not_available Yes.
not_available But he found God in his final moments, and he asked for forgiveness.
not_available So any fool can get into heaven if he's scared enough to say he's sorry right before he dies? Dr.
not_available Kovac Everyone deserves to be comforted in their darkest hour.
not_available Too bad you weren't there to comfort the little girl he killed.
not_available I didn't need to be.
not_available God was there.
not_available Was he? You should arrange to see your doctor this week.
not_available And use the cane for stability.
not_available Okay.
not_available Haleh, I am out of here.
not_available Good night, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, can I give you a hand with those? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You going home? 
not_available Yeah, shortly.
not_available Hey, do you have a minute to talk? Of course.
not_available In there? Okay.
not_available If you're concerned about what happened earlier, you don't need to be.
not_available I respect your judgment enough to say
not_available A couple weeks ago I took some Vicodin out of a patient's prescription bottle and I swallowed them.
not_available And then I went into the bathroom and I stuck my finger down my throat.
not_available Did you successfully expel them? Yes.
not_available I don't know
not_available I don't know why I did it.
not_available I really don't.
not_available I just found myself doing it.
not_available I just thought you should know.
not_available I appreciate you telling me.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow, Carter.
not_available What are you gonna do? Give it some thought.
not_available Meanwhile, keep going to your meetings.
not_available I can't believe you waited.
not_available I thought you would have taken a cab.
not_available Well, I thought you could use some company.
not_available Are you all right? Yeah.
not_available You should have seen me an hour ago.
not_available I could have danced a jig.
not_available How did the meeting go? We settled rather cheaply.
not_available Something to do with a recall.
not_available Great.
not_available Shall we go out and celebrate? Get a bite to eat? What? With you like this? Or we could just go home, take a nap.
not_available I don't feel like celebrating anyway.
not_available You're off the hook.
not_available It's okay to be happy.
not_available I can't.
not_available It's my fault, Mark.
not_available Elizabeth, we're not saints, okay? We just try to get it right as often as we can.
not_available I don't want to talk about it.
not_available Elizabeth Mark, please.
not_available You know what I noticed? What? Amy's shoes.
not_available They were brand
not_available new.
not_available When she woke up this morning, she had no idea.
not_available It's always harder when they're young.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, what am I doing in Pedes? You're good at it.
not_available You know what I want tonight? Climb into a hot bath get in bed and be taken care of? I won't hold you to the last part.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Look what she did to my house.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available No, it is not okay! Look at this! 
not_available I know.
not_available Come here.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Hey.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available I was just about to leave, if you want the table.
not_available Actually, I called your office and they said you might be here.
not_available I was hoping that we could talk.
not_available I don't know.
not_available We've already talked a lot today.
not_available I know that it's been tense between us and I really don't mean it to be.
not_available I'm sure it'll pass.
not_available Kim, I want you to know that I respect you as a colleague.
not_available Today notwithstanding? I miss you.
not_available Well, that'll pass too.
not_available In a few weeks we'll just be friendly co
not_available workers all over again.
not_available Yeah, I've been thinking and I'm not sure that's what I want.
not_available You have a good night.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Kim, please.
not_available I'd like you to stay.
not_available Look I know you might not want to hear this right now.
not_available I know it's been rough with everything Between us.
not_available I'm not easy.
not_available I haven't been there for you.
not_available Not the way you've been there for me.
not_available I've never worked at being with someone.
not_available I've never even wanted to.
not_available But I want to with you.
not_available I love you.
