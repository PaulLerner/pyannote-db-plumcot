not_available Could I have a minute? In all the commotion, you may not remember our new pilot study.
not_available The medical/surgical division of duty.
not_available One Attending gets real emergencies, the other hands out aspirin? One takes medical cases, one takes surgical.
not_available You wanted surgical? I wanted neither, because I think it's a bad idea.

not_available May I join you? 
not_available Oh, yeah, please.
not_available No offense, Peter Oh, thank you.
not_available No offense, I love a nice, juicy gut lecture but your intern bought me an extra half
not_available hour for my dictations.
not_available What did you think of LauraLee? 
not_available Who? Are you so busy running the projector that you can't follow up on cases? The film showed a dilated cecum, and she's at risk of perfing.
not_available She's in 203.
not_available Why don't you two go down and meet her? Answer her mother's questions, and then bring her to the O.R.

not_available Doug, Doug she's dead.
not_available I thought you'd gone home.
not_available My shift starts in five minutes.
not_available I just thought you wouldn't be up for working today.
not_available I feel bad for what happened to her.
not_available But if you're suggesting I'm responsible No, I just thought you were upset.
not_available I guess not.
not_available I'm confused, Mark.
not_available Is it a big shock that I was intimate with someone less than a soul mate? Doug, you didn't even know her name.
not_available Tox screen came back.
not_available Did you know she'd test positive for cocaine? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you think I'd withhold that? 
not_available I hope not.
not_available That's right.
not_available No.
not_available You were together all night.
not_available She tested positive.
not_available Are you asking if I did cocaine? Should I ask? You want me to piss in that mug? Would that satisfy you? 
not_available Use a specimen cup.
not_available You want to watch? Just send it to the lab.
not_available We've got a 3year
not_available old who drank shampoo.
not_available You want me to wait for Doug? 
not_available No, I'll handle it.
not_available Doug lives his own life.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available I'm just saying we can't live it for him.
not_available I think Dr.
not_available Keaton was inviting me to do the colostomy with you.
not_available She doesn't know how busy you're gonna be at the photo lab.
not_available Screw you! You can't make me.
not_available Get out of my way, Mom! 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I'm out of here! 
not_available You're having a major operation.
not_available The hell I am! I'm gone! Look, hold on.
not_available What is this? Do you want to die? Is that it? I'd make a good
not_available Iooking corpse.
not_available I'd want to die too.
not_available You're gonna, if you don't get out of my way! If I went to Proviso West I'd rather be 6 feet under before a championship game.

not_available It's a simple means to stress reduction and serenity.
not_available Whatever it is, sign me up.
not_available You couldn't cancel? 
not_available No, something's on her mind.

not_available She's never been a patient here.

not_available Usually he's on the other side of the piece, but the owner drew faster.
not_available He looks like a baby.
not_available Wait till you talk to the cops.
not_available It's either the protease inhibitor or the AZT that's making me nauseous.
not_available No, I understand.
not_available I haven't missed any doses.
not_available Thanks, Dr.
not_available D'Angelo, I'd appreciate it.

not_available Wendy.
not_available Wendy, splint.
not_available I lost my footing, my ankle went snap.
not_available If it hadn't been for Mickey's fast catch, I would've been a goner.
not_available Are you up for one more good deed? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Hold his foot steady at a 90
not_available degree angle, and we're gonna splint it.
not_available How's that? 
not_available Perfect.
not_available Didn't I see the food poisoning? 
not_available That was the giardia diarrhea.

not_available Compazine, clear liquids, et cetera.
not_available Let me know as soon as he's back.
not_available Mark, can we talk?

not_available I'm in.
not_available Hook it up.
not_available Hey, Carol, what's the hourly rate for babysitting these days? I am amazed, Peter.
not_available I thought you'd need backup.
not_available It wasn't easy.
not_available I've gone a few rounds with Laura.
not_available But you didn't have to call in the cavalry.
not_available I am impressed.
not_available You know, actually Carter was very helpful in breaking the ice.
not_available She's got a couple more questions for you.
not_available How would you like to scrub in with us? Unless Dr.
not_available Benton needs you elsewhere? When I was a kid, we boosted bags of chips.
not_available Now they want the whole store.
not_available Grab a cup of coffee? 
not_available I should probably stay close.
not_available Pardon me? Are you Dr.
not_available Ross? That kid, he's out.
not_available He's not gonna be up for a couple of hours, so Actually, doctor, we wanted to speak to you about Nadine Wilkes.
not_available Okay, fine.

not_available You wanted to see me? 
not_available We'll be out in a minute, Mark.
not_available Are you the Attending Physician? Pronounced Nadine Wilkes? 
not_available I did.

not_available No.
not_available I told you we'd just met.
not_available Last call, Roarke's Bar.
not_available I got that.
not_available That's right.
not_available What? 
not_available Roarke's Bar.
not_available Kind of a kinky crowd.
not_available At this joint, or later at your place, you never saw her take any drugs? No.
not_available I mean, she went to the bathroom a couple of times.
not_available In between? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available She didn't ask for a prescription? 
not_available No.
not_available You didn't give her a little something to keep her going? You're not that kind of guy? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can we speak to you outside, please? In a 16year
not_available old, the organs are identical to those of an adult.
not_available In a neonate, on the other hand, the liver is as big as Kansas.
not_available Needle holder.
not_available Boy, you could do this with your eyes closed.
not_available John, how did you get Laura in here without hired muscle or sedatives? 
not_available Gym pass.
not_available Gym pass? Yeah.

not_available So you wrote her a pass out of gym? And told her she probably wouldn't have the bag by championship game.
not_available And that's in? 
not_available Late November.
not_available She's in the band.
not_available I hope I didn't No, with any luck she should make it.
not_available Ortho could be backed up for a couple more hours.
not_available Mr.
not_available MclKenna said he'll take a cab.
not_available He doesn't want you to miss your class.
not_available Thanks, Miss Boulet, but I can wait.
not_available Anyone hungry? More pudding.
not_available They said that County's unfriendly.
not_available You're being taken care of.
not_available So what kind of class are you taking? I sort of moonlight as a dance instructor.
not_available What type of dancing? 
not_available All types, but country mostly.
not_available Like line dancing.
not_available There's more to country than that.
not_available Show us a few moves, cowboy.
not_available Here? Why not? 
not_available No music.
not_available We can fix that.
not_available The good news is, you're not pregnant.
not_available Can you understand me? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's good.
not_available Now we have to do a pelvic exam to find out why you're in pain.
not_available You do the exam? 
not_available No.
not_available A doctor will do the exam, but he's very good.
not_available No, I don't need.
not_available I'm fine, not pregnant.
not_available Miss Jung Koo Baek, what seems to be the problem? 
not_available No problem.

not_available Abdominal pain, fever's 101.
not_available She complains of vaginal discharge.
not_available She's not pregnant.
not_available Sounds like PID.
not_available I'll do a pelvic.
not_available She's a little jumpy.
not_available She's never had a pelvic.
not_available I think I can handle that.
not_available I'm afraid she's gonna bolt.
not_available But she'd probably let me take the cultures.
not_available You're secondguessing me too? 
not_available I don't give a damn about you.
not_available I'm trying to take care of a patient.
not_available What's up? Carol thinks she's better suited to perform a pelvic without me.
not_available Carol, you know that you 
not_available I just want to take the swabs.
not_available She's really afraid of men.
not_available Doyle, are you free? 
not_available That's my patient.
not_available Come help Carol do a pelvic.
not_available Okay? You're overreacting, Doug.
not_available What is it with you? Kerry Weaver's breathing down my neck.
not_available People part like the Red Sea when I walk down the hallway.
not_available The tox screen came back negative.
not_available You didn't get a blood alcohol.
not_available How many times have you and I had margaritas into the wee hours? Did you check your blood alcohol every morning? Unbelievable.
not_available Let me tell you something as a friend.
not_available You can't be my friend and my boss.
not_available You chose to be my boss.
not_available I don't need your sanctimonious approval of my life.
not_available Don't come to me for tips on women anymore.
not_available If I have a Roman orgy with farm animals, that's none of your business.
not_available That's none of anybody's business.
not_available I am a doctor here! I do my job! Nothing gets in the way of that! Nothing! Today you brought in a dying woman and messed up everybody else's work.
not_available That's a problem.
not_available If you don't see that, you don't belong here.
not_available I'll tell you what 
not_available Hello, everybody.
not_available I thought I'd see how your pilot study is going.
not_available Medical/surgical division? We still have a few kinks to work out.
not_available Let me show you the board.
not_available A singlevehicle, high
not_available speed TC's coming in.
not_available Looks extremely surgical.
not_available Do you want me to let Weaver know? 
not_available Screw the new system.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Call Surgical.
not_available Get a consult down here.
not_available Mark, we're not finished yet.
not_available Yes, we are.
not_available Oh, man! I haven't done one of these in six months.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I've assisted a million.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, just relax.
not_available Good.
not_available Now let your knees fall open.

not_available She's gonna be on IV antibiotics for five days.
not_available And then she's gonna be discharged in seven.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Armitage knows the drill.
not_available Hi, Abby.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Armitage's concerns are more related to Laura's overall well
not_available being.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sometimes they have problems making the adjustment.
not_available We have a psychiatrist on staff.
not_available Maybe they can help.
not_available Diane, you've got to stop babying her.
not_available She knows how to be a patient.
not_available She's done that for years.
not_available Now she's a teenager.
not_available She's gonna rebel.
not_available And you've got to be the bad guy.
not_available Set the limits.
not_available You're right.
not_available I know.
not_available God willing, this surgery will be her last.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available You called for a Surgical.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sounds like a spatula job.
not_available How's your day? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Great card from Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Only she would send a post card from O'Hare.
not_available You got a card? 
not_available Yeah.

not_available Thanks for all your help.
not_available Part of the job.
not_available I want to order a pelvic ultrasound.

not_available Ma? You're early.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available It'll take five to walk over.
not_available I'll get my purse.
not_available They don't have a locker for that? 
not_available No, Ma.
not_available And this is how you work? 
not_available Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available He's out in the ambulance pad.
not_available Come on, we'll show you.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available Hi, Helen.
not_available How have you been? 
not_available I have been well.
not_available And yourself? 
not_available I can't complain.
not_available This lady is looking for you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have a nice dinner.
not_available Hi.
not_available Do I know you? 
not_available I'm Claire Wilkes.
not_available You worked on my sister, Nadine.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I wish there was more that we could've done.
not_available Nadine died just like she 
lived Drunk, high and alone.
not_available Actually, a friend brought her in.
not_available I know what kind of friend she had at 4 a.m.
not_available Did she have a medical condition that we didn't know about? Wasn't she wearing her bracelet? Nadine was an epileptic.
not_available She knew she wasn't supposed to drink, but that didn't stop her.
not_available Can I see her? 
not_available Sure.
not_available The coroner's office still has to do an autopsy.
not_available That's why the tubes are still in there.
not_available She had so much to give.
not_available A fire in her.
not_available And then when the seizures started it just made her lose her confidence somehow.
not_available She could always find the guys to help her sink just a little lower.
not_available Chip away at her self
not_available esteem.
not_available Whatever you were looking for, Nadine I hope you found it.
not_available Oh, God! Come on.
not_available How about some twostep? That is a quickquick, slow
not_available slow.
not_available I like that.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Quickquick, slow
not_available slow.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Work it, Lydia.
not_available I just got a call from Ortho.
not_available Your friend's next up, I promise.
not_available How about some two
not_available step? It's really easy.
not_available Quickquick, slow
not_available slow.
not_available All right, Jeanie! All right, girl! Come on.
not_available X
not_available rays for Trauma 2.
not_available Good.
not_available Hey.
not_available You're quite a dancer.
not_available You're not half
not_available bad yourself.
not_available How's that pie, Ma? 
not_available At least here they don't overcharge.
not_available A good thing when you're on a budget.
not_available A lesson I hope you'll finally learn.
not_available So I got in a little over my head.
not_available Because you bought a big house.
not_available An apartment is big enough for one woman.
not_available A house is for a family.
not_available And you don't want to marry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross wasn't right, I agree.
not_available Dr.
not_available Taglieri wasn't either.
not_available But then you can't live like a doctor's wife.
not_available Ma, I don't need this today.
not_available A nurse is not a queen.
not_available I've noticed.
not_available A nurse has to watch her money.
not_available While teaching interns to make quadruple her salary.
not_available You can't change that.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Anyway, anyone can get into a little trouble.
not_available What's this? 
not_available To pay your plumber and roofer.
not_available And you can finish the plaster.
not_available I don't want you to live in a dump.
not_available Ma, that is so sweet.
not_available But I can't take this from you.
not_available From who, then? I can't even take that as a loan.
not_available You'd rather owe strangers than your own mother? Yeah.
not_available What if it's not a loan? What if it's more like a kind of rent? What kind of rent, Ma? "Pediatric Surgeon of the Year"? "The Price Award." Oh, man! That's very prestigious.
not_available I was really pleased with how the Armitage surgery went.
not_available Thanks for the opportunity.
not_available You're a gifted surgeon, and you do really well in the O.R.
not_available It's outside the operating room where you need work.
not_available Peter, pediatric surgery focuses on the child, not just the illness.
not_available That mother needed something from you today.
not_available You thought your job was over when you took your gloves off.
not_available You've got great hands.
not_available Now you gotta show some heart.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be sorry.
not_available Learn.
not_available I'm looking at it right now.
not_available "Onehour photo, guaranteed." It doesn't apply to slides? Slides are see
not_available through photos.
not_available Can I see your catalog of classes? 
not_available Help yourself.
not_available Benton's gonna kill me.
not_available Again? So, Carter, was it that bad living with your parents again? Pretty strange.
not_available Why? My mom moved to the burbs, and now she misses her friends at church.
not_available She wants to stay Saturday nights.
not_available Just one night a week? You can always sign up for work Saturday.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available We start Qigong next week.
not_available No.
not_available You mind if I tear out a page? 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Premed? 
not_available It's for a friend.
not_available He's still not up there? 
not_available He's in the car, crutches and all.
not_available Tell him to take it easy.
not_available I just wanted to say thanks.
not_available I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go out dancing sometime? Grab a bite.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm sorry, I can't date patients.
not_available I wasn't the patient, so 
not_available No, really, I can't.
not_available I'm a good guy.
not_available We'll go dancing.
not_available I'll buy you a steak.
not_available If you don't like me, at least you got the steak.
not_available I can't.
not_available All right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I got ya.
not_available See you around.
not_available Table for one? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is Carla working tonight? 
not_available Yeah, she's here every night.
not_available Can you tell her that Peter Benton is here? Oh, you're Peter Benton? I can seat you at the counter.
not_available Enjoy.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available Well, well, well.
not_available The place looks great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You haven't seen my baby since it was a little
not_available bitty greasy spoon.
not_available Grand tour.
not_available And come with me, sir.
not_available I'll show you the kitchen.
not_available You know Tyrone Harvey? He cooks here.
not_available This is it.
not_available We just got two sub
not_available zero freezers, which is very, very nice.
not_available Do you remember that little Italian place, Simeones, on Seneca? They closed and I picked up a bunch of stuff for almost nothing.
not_available Great.
not_available You've made quite a place for yourself.
not_available A lot of hard work.
not_available Well, you must have a taste in your mouth for something to come all the way up here.
not_available This isn't your line.
not_available That's a buck down the drain.
not_available That girl who came in this afternoon was Nadine Wilkes' sister.
not_available She came in to I.D.
not_available Her.
not_available She just thought I was another caring doctor.
not_available I let her go right on thinking that 'cause that's what I want everybody to think.
not_available Hey, Carol.
not_available I think I really did it this time.
not_available You came up here for what? Cry on my shoulder? Tell me how worthless you really are deep down inside? And I'd say, "No, you're not, Doug.
not_available You're one hell of a guy." And you'd be able to live with yourself until the next time? No.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'm just not playing.
not_available You're on your own.
not_available I didn't know she was sick.
not_available You didn't know her at all.
