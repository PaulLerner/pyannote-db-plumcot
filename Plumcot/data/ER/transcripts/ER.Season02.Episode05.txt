
not_available ER Previously on E.R.
not_available I am behind Kerry 100 percent.
not_available If you disagree with anything she's doing assume that she's acting with my approval.
not_available Shall we wait till someone dies? A dislocation in the interphalangeal joint.
not_available He may have a gun, you guys! It's my fault he has AIDS.
not_available I gave it to him.
not_available I was thinking of adopting Susie.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're not a mother, are you? 
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available "And Baby makes two" 
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available We alone? I'm alone.
not_available Are you? I thought I heard a woman's voice during the night.
not_available You eavesdropping? 
not_available Just, you know, kind of hard to miss.
not_available Didn't sound like Hulda.
not_available Want a bagel? 
not_available Fresh? Baked this morning by elfin hands.
not_available Works all day, entertains all night and he gets up at sunrise and goes to the bakery.
not_available What's your secret? I'm a virtuous man.
not_available Good morning, Jer.
not_available And a delightful morning to you.
not_available Fresh buttered popcorn? 
not_available I'm watching my triglycerides.
not_available Turfed the slipand
not_available fall to Ortho.
not_available Well done.
not_available Popcorn? Hello, all.
not_available Isn't it a wonderful day? Good morning.
not_available ER.
not_available Are the nitrous tanks leaking again? 
not_available Better.
not_available It's Weaver's day off.
not_available And if that's not cause for celebration, I don't know what is.
not_available Perfect.
not_available May I have this dance? 
not_available Of course.
not_available You guys are bad.
not_available Turn it up.
not_available Hey.
not_available Just getting on? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You? No.
not_available No, I spent all night in the O.R.
not_available Woman with a bowel obstruction crashed.
not_available Big mess.
not_available And I floated my first Swan
not_available Ganz catheter.
not_available You've done a lot of procedures lately.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Cutdowns, chest tubes opened a choley, closed an appy.
not_available Benton's bum finger's the best thing that happened to me.
not_available I even got to staple a stomach.
not_available Benton had to stand there and watch.
not_available The look on his face was classic.
not_available Just 
not_available Carter.
not_available I have a new procedure for you.
not_available Foreign body extraction.
not_available What kind of foreign body? 
not_available Flashlight.
not_available Claims he fell on it while changing a fuse.
not_available Naked.
not_available Adoption proceedings can't begin until 90 days after abandonment.
not_available So assuming we proceed the Hallorans would petition for custody in early January.
not_available However, they would like to take Susie sooner than later.
not_available How much sooner? 
not_available End of the week.
not_available They feel the change would be less traumatic now than in a month or two.
not_available Right.
not_available I mentioned your wish to continue to be part of Susie's life as her aunt, and they are willing to think about it.
not_available Right.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll come out.
not_available They're nice people, but there's no reason to feel you have to comply with their timetable and conditions.
not_available You need to feel comfortable with the arrangement.
not_available I know.
not_available And you should take all the time you need.
not_available I don't think time will make it any easier.
not_available Ready? Oh, what are their first names? 
not_available Kevin and Lisa.
not_available Lisa, Kevin.
not_available I'm so excited.
not_available I'd like you to meet Susan Lewis.
not_available Hello.
not_available Nice to meet you, Susan.
not_available This is Susie.
not_available So beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do you want to hold her? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available You are so precious.
not_available So precious.
not_available Not my shift, not my shift.
not_available Why are these old charts still here? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver usually weeds them out.
not_available You can tell when she's not here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where's Susan? She took a personal day.
not_available Let there be no doubt.
not_available Flu season has arrived I have half the board.
not_available One more.
not_available Chia
not_available Chia Loew.
not_available Oh, yeah, let me see that.
not_available Little boy with AIDS? 
not_available Yep, he spiked a fever.
not_available He can't sit up.
not_available I put him in 3.
not_available Kid in 2's done.
not_available You get the french fry out of his nose? I listened to his mother for 20 minutes.
not_available I'll be glad when I go back to Surgery.
not_available Look at the bright side.
not_available You've a chance to perfect your bedside manner.
not_available Here's another.
not_available Great.
not_available All yesterday he is in bed throwing up.
not_available He stopped talking.
not_available The first thing we need to do is bring his fever down and stop the vomiting.
not_available In order to know the right medicine to give him we're gonna have to do a lumbar puncture.
not_available It's where we take fluid from around his spine and test it to see what's wrong.
not_available That's what we're gonna do, okay? Yes.
not_available You make him well? Well, we can't cure the AIDS, you know that but we'll do what we can to make him feel better.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available It's a piercing sort of pain, like a spike through the temple.
not_available How long have you had migraines? 
not_available All my life.
not_available Do you get them? 
not_available No.
not_available You? 
not_available No.
not_available Count your blessings.
not_available I'll ask the doctor about giving you some Imitrex.
not_available Oh, I had that once.
not_available Gave me chest pain.
not_available Okay.
not_available In that case, Toradol? 
not_available Can't.
not_available It gives me hives.
not_available But they gave me something here that worked wonders.
not_available It began with a D.
not_available What was it? 
not_available Demerol? That's it.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available She's sweet.
not_available She's a junkie.
not_available What? 
not_available It's a snow job.
not_available She's faking migraines to get a quick fix.
not_available How can you tell? You learn to smell them.
not_available Have you ever seen the turkey file? Hey, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Still works.
not_available Just kidding.
not_available Different flashlight.
not_available I thought that splint was supposed to stay on till tomorrow.
not_available You got that circled on your calendar? 
not_available I handled a lot of dislocations in Ortho.
not_available Not interested.
not_available You're risking permanent joint laxity.
not_available Osteoarthritis.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available Tendinitis.
not_available Dr.
not_available B, got a lady here, beat up bad.
not_available Can you hear me, hon? 
not_available What happened? Anonymous call.
not_available Found her on the floor at home.
not_available Multiple contusions, bruises to the face and chest.
not_available Conscious but unresponsive.
not_available Okay, lift her on my count.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Here we go.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Do we have a name? 
not_available ID says Vickie Mazovick.
not_available Vickie, squeeze my hand.
not_available No blood in the canal.
not_available Negative Babinski.
not_available What's wrong with her? 
not_available May be psychotic.
not_available Vickie, talk to me.
not_available Tell me, who did this to you? All right, can you feel this? 
not_available Responds to pain.
not_available Leave me alone! Damn! 
not_available Should have kept your splint on.
not_available Extensive bruising to the ribs.
not_available Get X
not_available ray.
not_available Carter, how's her chest? 
not_available Good bilateral breath sounds.
not_available She's crying.
not_available It's a good sign, I guess.
not_available It's okay, sweetie.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Damn! What was her last name again? 
not_available Krupke.
not_available Krupke.
not_available Krupke.
not_available "Krupke, Lottie.
not_available Also known as Kamen, Laura.
not_available Also known as Kimball, Myrna.
not_available " "Addicted to narcotics, alcoholic, bipolar.
not_available " God, this is sad.
not_available What's sad is when they con you out of five or six doses before you catch on.
not_available Then you really feel like a chump.
not_available Nurse Hathaway? Carol.
not_available E.
not_available Ray Bozman.
not_available I'm your nurse trainee.
not_available Oh, yes, right.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Grab a lab coat.
not_available I'll be with you in a sec.
not_available Mark, I gotta do an LP on a 4year
not_available old.
not_available I could use a hand.
not_available Harper, you ever see an LP? 
not_available No, but I'd like to.
not_available I don't really wanna babysit a med student right now.
not_available Well, it's either Harper or the guy wearing Morgenstern's lab coat.
not_available Harper, let's do it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They seemed like nice people, didn't they? Yeah? Smart, funny.
not_available Not so perfect they're obnoxious.
not_available And they have a little boy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You could have a big brother.
not_available Someone to look out for you teach you stuff.
not_available Susie this is so hard.
not_available I just don't think I'd be a good enough mother.
not_available We have ways of screwing kids up in my family.
not_available I just want you to be happy.
not_available I love you.
not_available You know that? I do.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Orbit's okay.
not_available No fracture.
not_available She's got a cracked rib.
not_available Two cracked ribs, two healed fractures, old shoulder fracture, humerus.
not_available Hey, you put your splint on.
not_available Wise choice.
not_available She said anything yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Actually, she told me she wanted to go home.
not_available Not a good idea.
not_available She's been here three times before.
not_available First time, she said it was her husband 
not_available but wouldn't press charges.
not_available And the other times? 
not_available Said she fell down the stairs.
not_available All right, call the social worker.
not_available Give her some Vicodin for the pain and tell her to see her doctor.
not_available You're not going to talk to her? 
not_available Not my job.
not_available All right, kiddo.
not_available Let's get started.
not_available Okay, here we go, let's get going.
not_available Hi, Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available Hold onto the back of his thighs.
not_available With your other hand, you hold onto the back of his neck.
not_available Lean over.
not_available Hold on tight.
not_available No, no.
not_available Buddy, your mom tells me you like to play with the neighbor's dog.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available You have to hold him tight.
not_available That's just to numb it.
not_available The next one won't be so bad.
not_available Now, when I was a kid 
not_available I had a dog named Louie.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available No, Mama.
not_available Louie the dog.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Okay, there we go.
not_available Doing great.
not_available He stopped moving.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He surrendered.
not_available Just a little more.
not_available Not much longer.
not_available Jerry.
not_available If anybody calls for me, I'll be up in the O.R.
not_available with Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available Okay.
not_available Is it lighter in here? They repaint? The Weaver has lifted.
not_available Cake? Sure.
not_available Subtle.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Birthday party.
not_available Oh, yeah? Whose birthday? 
not_available Bob's.
not_available Bob's not working today.
not_available Well, it's still her birthday.
not_available In that case, how about a piece? Sorry, it's all gone.
not_available Hey there.
not_available Man, was that no fun.
not_available What? 
not_available LP on a little kid.
not_available Always rough.
not_available I'm on my way to resect a bowel.
not_available Wanna get some lunch after that? 
not_available Sorry, I gotta ride herd on this kid.
not_available How about dinner? 
not_available Possibly.
not_available Possibly.
not_available Probably.
not_available Possibly.
not_available Carter.
not_available You and Harper? Something extracurricular happening there? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Loretta.
not_available How have you been? Lousy.
not_available Threw my back out.
not_available How? 
not_available At work.
not_available Jerry, can you start a chart? Lydia? 
not_available Coming.
not_available Come on.
not_available So this is, like, a midlife career shift for you? Yeah, I tend to shift a lot.
not_available I've been a UPS deliveryman, a short
not_available order cook, a rodeo clown.
not_available And then in the mid
not_available '80s, I got into the Human Potential Movement.
not_available Doing what? 
not_available Lectures, inspirational speeches.
not_available I'm a nurturer.
not_available I like helping people.
not_available So nursing seemed like the next logical step in my life progression.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Keller.
not_available You take a seat right here.
not_available There you go.
not_available Great.
not_available I want you to shave his head, clean, irrigate the wound.
not_available I'll start a chart and get a doctor to stitch him.
not_available Okey
not_available dokey.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross I picked up Chia
not_available Chia's lab results.
not_available Did a cell count, differential, protein, glucose, Gram's stain and culture but they ran out of fluid for the India ink stain.
not_available I don't believe it.
not_available Is that the test for meningitis? 
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available Okay, tell me if this hurts.
not_available Keep your leg straight.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I don't see any sign of a slipped disc.
not_available Just a muscle strain.
not_available You need to stay off your feet.
not_available No problem.
not_available I mean bed rest, Loretta, emphasis on "rest.
not_available " Gotcha.
not_available It still hurts like hell, though.
not_available Can we give her something? 
not_available I'll write a prescription for Feldene.
not_available That ought to do the trick.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, Dr.
not_available Lewis is here to see you.
not_available Loretta, take care.
not_available Figures this would happen today.
not_available I was supposed to have a job interview.
not_available Really? Yeah.
not_available Answering phones for a place that makes clothes and stuff.
not_available The social worker put me up to it.
not_available Sounds like a good job.
not_available I never get these things, though.
not_available They take one look at me, they know the score.
not_available I wonder how.
not_available We have a closet full of clothes here.
not_available You could see if there's anything.
not_available Why do you got clothes? 
not_available Whoever needs them.
not_available Where do you get them? 
not_available Dead people.
not_available You gotta be kidding.
not_available There's some nice stuff.
not_available We get some pretty rich dead people.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need to do another lumbar puncture on Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available Another? 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If there were any other way I would do it.
not_available This is gonna be a small amount, not as much as before.
not_available Okay? I'm sorry.
not_available I met with a lawyer today about putting Susie up for adoption.
not_available Really? Is it definite? Before I make my final decision, I need to know what my options are at work.
not_available If I keep her, there's no way I could continue to do my residency full
not_available time.
not_available Could I do it parttime? 
not_available I'll look into it.
not_available Heard from Chloe? 
not_available No.
not_available It's been nuts here.
not_available Do you want to get some coffee? No, Mark, I don't.
not_available I need to know if a part
not_available time schedule is doable.
not_available I've only heard of that in Pediatrics.
not_available So it's not.
not_available I'll talk to Morgenstern, see if we can work something out.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available You beep me out of surgery to sew up a drunk? 
not_available Benton said you like doing procedures.
not_available Very funny.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Almost done.
not_available E.
not_available Ray, why did you shave his entire head for a 4
not_available centimeter lac? We've been talking about how to effect positive change in one's life and how changing the physical can be a symbolic first step in transforming the inner self.
not_available Are you Benton? McGillis, Social Services.
not_available I'm confused about your chart notes on Vickie Mazovick the woman who got beat up.
not_available You didn't note if she had hand and arm injuries.
not_available She didn't.
not_available Could you note that, please? It could be significant.
not_available If it was significant, I would have written it down.
not_available It suggests she didn't defend herself, which suggests she's given up which means, statistically, she's reached a stage where she's in danger of being killed.
not_available You didn't note what she said when you asked what happened.
not_available I didn't ask what happened.
not_available Did you suspect abuse? 
not_available Of course I did.
not_available I saw the chart.
not_available Then you're supposed to ask.
not_available So, what did she tell you? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available So, what makes you think she's gonna tell me anything? It's worth a try, don't you think? Oh, this would look good on you.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available It doesn't really quite fit.
not_available What do you mean? It looks great! Do you think so? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available It needs something.
not_available You see some stuff working here, I bet.
not_available Like you don't? 
not_available My clients don't die on me.
not_available Except for that one guy.
not_available That's it.
not_available You think so? You're doing another LP? 
not_available Lab forgot an India ink.
not_available I'll tap out a couple cc's and do the test myself.
not_available How's he holding up? 
not_available Not well.
not_available This is gonna be quick.
not_available It's only gonna take a few minutes.
not_available Hi, Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available How's it going? Get him over on his side.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Mazovick? I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I need to ask you a few questions about how you got hurt.
not_available I fell.
not_available There are people that can help you.
not_available I don't want any help.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm still gonna have to report it to the police.
not_available Won't do any good.
not_available Three drops in there.
not_available And a drop of ink.
not_available Then you slide it under the microscope.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Fine.
not_available You did really well in there.
not_available Better the second time than the first.
not_available Does it get easier? 
not_available No.
not_available Wait.
not_available Catch that light.
not_available I thought Pediatrics was the happy specialty.
not_available Most of the time.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here you go.
not_available What do you see? Yeast cells, some large capsules around them.
not_available Cryptococcus.
not_available He has cryptococcal meningitis? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's getting near the end.
not_available I need somebody to call the police for a suspected domestic abuse case.
not_available You got it.
not_available Carter, where are you going? Morgenstern's doing a hemicolectomy.
not_available He asked me to make the incision.
not_available Not today.
not_available A guy in 6 cut his finger.
not_available Please! Please, I need help! Get a gurney! 
not_available You'll need help.
not_available Got it.
not_available What if you need a cutdown? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Where are you hurt? 
not_available It's not me.
not_available It's my husband.
not_available He's in the car.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He was on his motorcycle outside our apartment and a truck hit him and took off.
not_available All right, let's get him out.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh, man, that's a lot of blood.
not_available Is he dead? 
not_available No, he's still breathing.
not_available I tried to get him here as fast as I could.
not_available I ran red lights.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available He's gonna need at least six units.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Where's his arm? 
not_available It's in the back seat! Oh, my God.
not_available It is the same thing he had before? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He's He's had a relapse.
not_available He's very sick.
not_available The best way to treat him now is to give him a high concentration of medication intrathecally.
not_available Which means? It means that we're gonna do the same procedure as the spinal tap but in reverse.
not_available Again? It's the only way to get a high enough dose of the medication.
not_available One more time.
not_available No.
not_available It has to be a full course.
not_available That means two times a day for 10 days.
not_available We'll admit him into the hospital.
not_available We'll put a catheter in his back.
not_available That way he won't have to have the puncture each time.
not_available It will stop the vomiting and the fever? If he responds to the medication, yes.
not_available Once his body has fought off the meningitis it'll be able to work harder against the AIDS.
not_available If you think this is the best thing for Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available I do.
not_available Yes.
not_available I work at Daley Plaza and my wife works at the Merchandise Mart so we got together for a picnic lunch by the fountain at lunch hour.
not_available Sounds nice.
not_available It was until I decided to cut the French bread with my Swiss Army knife.
not_available I knew I should have gotten soft crust.
not_available How long have you had that mole? 
not_available Oh, a while.
not_available It actually looks a little bigger than last time.
not_available I you want, I can excise it and run a test, just to be safe.
not_available What does that involve? 
not_available An anesthetic, surgically remove it.
not_available All right.
not_available Yeah? Great.
not_available I'll just run it past the Attending and I will be right back.
not_available Yes.
not_available Three units O
not_available neg.
not_available Put it on the infuser.
not_available He's still bleeding.
not_available Inflate the BP cuff to 150.
not_available What's going on, Peter? Hitand
not_available run amputation.
not_available He's hypovolemic.
not_available Where's the arm? 
not_available Wrapped and on ice.
not_available Get a vascular surgeon down here.
not_available Call the Reimplantation Team.
not_available Get a pulse.
not_available He's bradying down.
not_available Tube him.
not_available Not with this finger.
not_available Two more units here.
not_available ET tray.
not_available Atropine.
not_available One milligram, IV push.
not_available Number 8.
not_available I got a pulse.
not_available BP's 50 palp.
not_available That's something.
not_available Hang another two units O
not_available neg.
not_available We'll move him as soon as he's tubed.
not_available All right, let's move him.
not_available Cookie.
not_available Door.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available It's me, Mom.
not_available Do you have the baby? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Smile! 
not_available Mom.
not_available You bought a video camera.
not_available If you're gonna be a grandma, you may as well do it right.
not_available They cost a fortune.
not_available No wonder there's a trade deficit.
not_available Mom, would you do that later? 
not_available Don't be such a grouch.
not_available Hi.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Smile for Grandma.
not_available I need to sit down.
not_available Sit.
not_available Give me the little termite.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, there you go.
not_available Right over here.
not_available Look.
not_available Up, up, up.
not_available I need to talk to you guys.
not_available Look.
not_available Mom? 
not_available Hi.
not_available Oh, she's so cute.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I met with a lawyer today about giving Susie up for adoption.
not_available But she's not even your baby.
not_available Mom, Chloe is never coming back.
not_available Would you turn that thing off? I don't know how you could even consider that.
not_available You don't wanna give her away, do you? 
not_available Of course I don't.
not_available It kills me to even think about it.
not_available Then don't.
not_available How am I supposed to raise her alone and finish my residency? People do these things all the time, don't they? Dad, I work 12
not_available hour shifts five days a week.
not_available I won't put her in daycare for that long.
not_available There must be something you can do.
not_available Could you guys keep her three days a week? Maybe we could do it.
not_available Three days a week? Sure! We know what that means.
not_available I'll be doing all the work, running her around.
not_available I'm here.
not_available You haven't left this house in years.
not_available You hardly leave that chair.
not_available I'm retired.
not_available You make me sound like a nut.
not_available It's not normal.
not_available At least I don't drink all day.
not_available Two vodka gimlets for breakfast.
not_available Whose report is this? 
not_available Finger lac in 6.
not_available I saw a growth on his arm and tested it.
not_available Melanoma.
not_available Bingo.
not_available And I found an axillary lymph node on exam.
not_available It needs to be excised.
not_available I spoke to Pereira in Surgical Oncology.
not_available He agreed to let me do the biopsy.
not_available Peter, cop's in with Mrs.
not_available Mazovick, in case you wanna talk to him.
not_available Right.
not_available I just picked up an interesting case.
not_available Yeah? Yeah.
not_available I excised a mole on a 36year
not_available old male.
not_available It's melanoma.
not_available I get to biopsy the lymph node.
not_available A 36year
not_available old has cancer and you get to do the biopsy.
not_available Well, congratulations.
not_available I hope you have an easier time convincing her to make a statement.
not_available And who are you? 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I was in charge of her case, Officer Mazovick.
not_available Come on, babe, let's go.
not_available What goes through your head when you're beating her? What a big man you are? Michael, please.
not_available Please.
not_available Your husband just went up to the O.R.
not_available They're trying to reattach his arm.
not_available They can do that? 
not_available Well, they can try.
not_available With complete amputation, the success rate's small.
not_available We only have insurance left for three days.
not_available I wouldn't worry about that.
not_available They'll cover it.
not_available Jason lost his job three months ago, benefits too.
not_available I'm a waitress.
not_available No benefits.
not_available Is there somebody I can call for you? 
not_available No.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I keep having this weird thought that Jason's dead and you're not telling me.
not_available He isn't, is he? 
not_available No.
not_available He's in the O.R.
not_available You're just feeling the stress.
not_available Carrie? Would you like to come and lie down in the lounge? No.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Forchet? I'm starting to worry a little bit, actually.
not_available Is something wrong? Dr.
not_available Carter, they said you might need some help with a lymph node biopsy.
not_available A biopsy? Do I have cancer? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Forchet your mole was identified as a malignant melanoma.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available The good news is that we caught it which means we can treat it immediately.
not_available What's the worst
not_available case scenario? There's no way to gauge that until we stage the cancer and see if it's spread.
not_available Which is why we're gonna do the biopsy.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available I mean, I came in for a cut on my finger and I need to call my wife.
not_available I How am I gonna tell her? What am I gonna say? It's okay.
not_available I can't believe this is happening.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Just let it out and work through it.
not_available You think the injuries resulted from battery? 
not_available Yep.
not_available No question.
not_available You wanna testify if we need you? 
not_available I guess.
not_available You think that's gonna happen? 
not_available It's up to her.
not_available If she won't make a statement, no witnesses, I can't help her.
not_available The fact he's a cop, does that make a difference? No.
not_available Not to me.
not_available Have you seen these? The first time she came in.
not_available Missing two teeth, broken jaw.
not_available Second time, bruises on her back and buttocks.
not_available Third time, broken arm.
not_available And these? These are from today.
not_available She used to work dispatch at the 14th.
not_available You know her? 
not_available Used to.
not_available Doug, I signed for the amphotericin B you ordered for Chia
not_available Chia.
not_available Got it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's the plan? The plan is to buy that kid and his mother some time together.
not_available He didn't respond last time.
not_available This time I'll give it intrathecally.
not_available That's a pretty rough procedure, especially on a 4year
not_available old.
not_available What are you saying? 
not_available I was wondering if the treatment's extreme for the best prognosis.
not_available Not in my opinion.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Tell me if you're getting dizzy.
not_available Stop.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can you see? Can you see? Do you remember the nice lady from this morning? Wanna go on the slide? Let's go on the slide.
not_available Come on.
not_available What do you think? You designed that yourself? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You can swim in it or you can wrap a scarf around your waist and wear it out on the town.
not_available Who does she mean by "you"? I'm meeting with investors next week about designing a whole line.
not_available I'm gonna call it "Randi
not_available Wear.
not_available " Catchy.
not_available Well, if you want to invest, now is the time.
not_available On that note, I bid you all a fond good eve.
not_available It's been a wonderful Weaver
not_available less day.
not_available Nighty
not_available night.
not_available Is he single? Yeah.
not_available Carrie, your husband's out of surgery.
not_available They were able to reattach his arm.
not_available You said the chances of that happening were small.
not_available We're not out of the woods.
not_available We still have to wait and see if the tissue can survive the trauma.
not_available Do you have any Valium or something? I'd have to write a prescription.
not_available But I can start a chart for you.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available I'll try a cigarette first.
not_available You can't smoke in here.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Carrie.
not_available This is good news.

not_available I was talking with Dr.
not_available Ross about the treatment you agreed to.
not_available I wanted to make sure you understood everything that was involved.
not_available Yes.
not_available The side effects of the medicine can be very painful.
not_available Worse sometimes than the symptoms of the meningitis.
not_available Worse? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I wanna be sure that you know that if you don't want to go through that we can give you medicine to make him comfortable and you can take him home.
not_available But he will be sick.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Loew the fact that the medicine failed once before means that there's a strong possibility that it may fail again.
not_available Even if we could cure the meningitis your son's AIDS is very advanced.
not_available With or without treatment realistically, we're really only looking at a matter of days.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You need to decide how you and your son want to spend those days.
not_available But Dr.
not_available Ross But he He said You went over his aftercare? 
not_available I did.
not_available He needs his boil drained.
not_available We got a first trauma pulling in.
not_available Carter, you take him.
not_available Did you take the syringe in Room 2? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? I just lost 5 milligrams of morphine.
not_available What do we have? 
not_available This cop is beat up pretty bad.
not_available Missing teeth, look like his jaw's broke, busted ribs.
