not_available Well, we'll deal with that.
not_available I don't know why you'd want to.
not_available I can think of a reason.
not_available This place is too small.
not_available Maybe you should both live with me.
not_available What? My apartment has two floors.
not_available Alex can sleep downstairs.

not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Getting out of your way.
not_available Oh, please don't leave me.
not_available Neela, they're just your parents.
not_available You think you've seen trauma at work? You don't know the Rasgotras.
not_available I know this may not be the best time to ask but how long do you think you'll be needing my couch? Damn it.
not_available Mom.
not_available Dad.
not_available You remember Abby.
not_available You look like hell.

not_available All right, CBC blood and wound cultures, LP, ceftriaxone, and a head CT.

not_available Herman.
not_available Howard.
not_available There is a God.
not_available Took me five minutes to track down a strep culture.
not_available What are you waiting for on this ankle sprain? Needs a wrap, as soon as I swab my football player's throat.
not_available How many patients do you have? 
not_available Ten.
not_available Twelve.
not_available Can't be efficient if you get hung up doing jobs other people can do.
not_available Sometimes it's easier
not_available Your job is to move patients not wrap ankles or go on hunts for strep cultures.
not_available Learn to delegate to nurses and med students.
not_available Go see the migraine in 1.
not_available Abby, your med student ordered a bolus on the dehydrated kid.
not_available My med student?

not_available Nice to be the boss.
not_available Sam, can you prep my forehead lac in 2? 
not_available Yeah, I'm on my way.
not_available And can you do a throat swab 
not_available for the guy in Sutures.
not_available Fine.
not_available Something the matter? 
not_available I'm getting slammed here.
not_available In the time it took you to ask me, you could have swabbed him yourself.
not_available You can do a setup for Dr.
not_available Tigerbeat over there.
not_available That's my patient.
not_available It's okay, Sam.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Thanks, Haleh.
not_available No problem.
not_available Haleh, I think you might have been off a decimal point 
not_available on my pyelo patient's dopamine.
not_available Excuse me? I noticed it was running at 3 cc's instead of 30.
not_available I caught it early, but next time maybe you could double
not_available check.
not_available Double
not_available check the concentration before you mess with the IV pump.
not_available I mixed it ten to one.
not_available Don't we always mix it one to one? 
not_available No, you always mix it one to one.
not_available I always mix it ten to one.
not_available I didn't realize.
not_available If you concentrate the drip 
not_available the bag will last longer.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I'll go turn down her rate, make sure her BP hasn't hit the roof.
not_available You know, nurses really are the backbone of a place like this.
not_available It's good to get on their good side.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll keep that in mind.
not_available So when are you going to tell us what's going on? Ajay, relax.
not_available I don't know if I wanna be a doctor.
not_available What? I'm not sure I'm good at it.
not_available Of course you're good at it.
not_available You're good at everything.
not_available Some send their children to medical school, get a Nobel Prize on the mantel.
not_available Ajay, please.
not_available Why does she punish us? I'm not trying to punish you.
not_available I'm trying to figure things out.
not_available What's there to figure out? 
not_available Like how I want my life to be.
not_available Neela, you're not a child anymore.
not_available Then stop treating me like one.
not_available What about your brothers and sisters? Don't you think they want to go to university? We don't make enough to pay for all that.
not_available You promised to help out once you began your Residency.
not_available I'll help soon enough.
not_available You'll have to wait a little.
not_available Is that what you're going to tell them? Their futures have to wait? Because their sister is not sure what she wants to be? I'll have a job soon and I'll send money.
not_available What job? Where? 
not_available Here at the hospital, I hope.
not_available That's possible? 
not_available I've talked to my supervisor.
not_available She's trying to arrange it.
not_available Starting when? 
not_available I'm supposed to discuss it today.
not_available If the third neb doesn't break her, call her up.
not_available Call her up? 
not_available To Medicine, to be admitted.
not_available Call the Resident.
not_available Should I write this down? What year did you say you were? 
not_available Labs are back on your guy, Dr.

not_available Abby? 
not_available What? Anterior glenohumeral dislocation.
not_available I was hoping you could take a look.

not_available She's crying a lot.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.

not_available She doesn't speak much English.
not_available Okay.
not_available Three of Versed, 50 of fent.
not_available You sure you wanna use both? Yes.
not_available Can you hook up some blowby? Blowby?

not_available I think it will be too painful.
not_available Marta Sheet.
not_available Okay? Here you go.
not_available Versed's in.
not_available Penny, come here.
not_available I'm not really familiar with this technique.
not_available It's okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Go ahead with the fent.
not_available O2's not ready.
not_available Fifty of fent sounds like a lot on top of the Versed.
not_available That's what I was saying.
not_available Listen, team.
not_available We're shoving a bone back into its socket.
not_available You'd want all the meds in the hospital.
not_available It could suppress her respiratory drive.
not_available I'm aware of that, Howard.
not_available That's why I asked for oxygen.
not_available Okay.
not_available On the count of three, I want you to lean back as hard as you can.
not_available This is gonna go fast.
not_available Okay, one, two, three.
not_available Cool.
not_available We can go now? There's a cut here too.
not_available We should clean that out.
not_available Ceftriaxone's in.

not_available Little pinch.
not_available When was he wounded?

not_available Okay, you can sit up now.
not_available Why don't you try and get some sleep, and I will be back in a little bit.
not_available Can't sleep.
not_available I will see what I can do about moving you to a
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Try and get some rest, huh? In my dreams, I'm still the guy I used to be.
not_available But I always wake up.
not_available Did you get a history? And they didn't have any paperwork, so And no address and no phone number.

not_available Tranquila, okay? I'm not gonna hurt you.
not_available I'm not going to hurt you.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available I wasn't aware that there was a dress code.
not_available I just don't want you to create any discomfort with the patients.
not_available The patients, or the other doctors.
not_available It's the jewelry, isn't it? 
not_available No.
not_available Fingernails, tattoo, the hair? It's the whole package.
not_available Okay.

not_available Okay, ma'am.
not_available You need to settle down.
not_available I am the solution to the problem! 
not_available Hard restraints.
not_available I am not the problem! Actually, right now you are.

not_available What did you tell him? 
not_available I lied.
not_available I didn't wanna be there.
not_available I'm not even sure I want to be a doctor.
not_available So, what can I do for you? Give me a position, a job, any kind of job, just until I get myself refocused.
not_available But you don't want to be a doctor? No, what I meant

not_available during a tank cleaning.
not_available What the hell is that? Ginglymostoma cirratum, a nurse shark.
not_available Damn fish just latched onto me.
not_available We need them disconnected.
not_available You think? It's important that neither Mr.
not_available Fahey nor the shark be damaged in any way.
not_available I'll get a gurney.
not_available Wheelchair.
not_available Keep pouring water on him, Mort.
not_available He's suffocating.

not_available Not her aunt.
not_available Chuny, can you change the pressure dressing in 1?

not_available He'll only live for 30 minutes like this.
not_available What? 
not_available Not you, Mort, the shark.
not_available You're just making it worse.
not_available Get me three grams of Unasyn IV.
not_available Can you feel this?

not_available I've heard enough.
not_available Ajay, will you go get us a cab? Excuse me? We are getting your things.
not_available We rent a car.
not_available And then we go.
not_available And that's final.
not_available He doesn't get it, Mom.
not_available You think he doesn't get it? We get it.
not_available You're the one that doesn't get it.
not_available Don't you start in on me.
not_available Neela, when I married your father, I was younger than you are.
not_available Sure I loved him.
not_available But do you think I didn't have grander ideas for my life than running a curry house in Southall? Then let me find my own path.
not_available Passing up the opportunity that you have been given is not the way to do it.
not_available I've worked hard for it.
not_available So have we all.
not_available All those years at the restaurant, saving, planning for your future.
not_available I just need some time.
not_available Sorry, love.
not_available Time's up.
not_available I've always done everything you've asked.
not_available Everything.
not_available Even the damn viola.
not_available I had to learn to play the sheet music perfectly.
not_available I was never allowed to play what I wanted.
not_available You wanted to play rock music.
not_available Or to improvise, or be creative.
not_available You can't improvise the viola.
not_available You can try.
not_available So you want to be a musician now? 
not_available No, Mom.
not_available I want to improvise.

not_available When did this happen? You were 12? How old are you now? So, what happened after the man took you? They made me daÃ±ada.
not_available Damage girl.
not_available What is "damage girl"? The men, they hit her, or do what they want.
not_available Anything they want.
not_available When's the last time you spoke to your family? Once, a long time ago, she snuck off and called her parents.
not_available She told them she didn't know when she'd be home.
not_available She told them not to cry.
not_available Okay, Marta.
not_available We're gonna help you now, all right? Okay? My name's not Marta.

not_available Home.
not_available Neela's staying here.
not_available What? I love you, Mom.
not_available Get in the car, Ajay.
not_available I hope you know that we can't help you anymore.
not_available I'll find a job.
not_available I'll send something for Rajiv when I can.
not_available When you were little, you used to tell me that you always dreamed of being a bird so that you could fly far, far away.
not_available Well, you've finally done it, haven't you? I called the factory where Tesoro's parents work.
not_available Did you talk to someone? 
not_available Through a translator.
not_available Secretary gave us this number.
not_available Great.
not_available Get Chuny for me, will you? She's a real piece of work.
not_available Asking for asylum saying she's as much a victim of the Lenones as the girls.

not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm off at 8.
not_available We can talk then.
not_available I'll wait around.
not_available You're waiting around for three hours? I've got nothing better to do.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, you don't speak Spanish, do you? Punjabi, French, a bit of Farsi, smattering of German, some
not_available All right, all right, all right.
not_available Hi.
not_available How's your shoulder? 
not_available What happens now? Maybe you can go home to Mexico? They don't love me.
not_available They don't want me.
not_available Of course they do.
not_available No more.
not_available Wanna call them? I have a number where I think they'll be.
not_available Maybe we should try.
not_available Too long now.
not_available I'm gone too long.
not_available Let's try it.
not_available It's ringing.
not_available Get any sleep? 
not_available What do you think? So your mom says that you don't want the surgery? It's relatively minor.
not_available They're just gonna touch up your cheek implant.
not_available A drop in the ocean, right? Whatever.
not_available Okay.
not_available You a Democrat? Yeah, most of the time.
not_available People rag on this war.
not_available I say it was a good thing.

not_available I hear you got engaged.
not_available I was.
not_available Her name's Karen.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She tried to come see me at Bethesda.
not_available I wouldn't let her.
not_available You think she would've given up on you that easy? Karen's a good girl.
not_available She's the best.
not_available Sometimes things happen that even the best people can't get past.
not_available Maybe in a few years I won't think about her anymore.
not_available What kind of shark was it? 
not_available A nurse shark.
not_available We got a few of those working here.
not_available It says here they adapt well to captivity.
not_available Sounds like a nurse to me.
not_available Not all of us.
not_available "They tend to move slowly within a relatively small range during the day.
not_available " 
not_available Hey, easy.
not_available Watch it.
