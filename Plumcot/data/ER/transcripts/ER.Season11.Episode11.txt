not_available I take full responsibility for what happened with Sanders.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available You gotta help.
not_available I think he's dying.
not_available Hey! That man's just been told his cancer has spread.
not_available Don't you think he has a reason to cry? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Fix my brother, bitch, before I blow your head off! I'm telling you to trust yourself enough to comfort.
not_available I said, let's go.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Lay down.

not_available Today is Monday and this is Morning Edition from NPR News.
not_available He's too young and he shouldn't listen to that music.
not_available I didn't know you already said no.
not_available I'm trying to teach him the value of a dollar.
not_available You give him everything.
not_available It was only 50 bucks.
not_available For a concert ticket for a 10year
not_available old? No.
not_available I don't think you should be worried about money.
not_available Look, Luka, I appreciate your generosity but I'm not gonna let you pay for everything.
not_available You don't have to pay half the rent and the bills every month.
not_available I managed to support me and Alex for 10 years.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available You know what? This isn't about money.
not_available You're worried about losing your independence or something.
not_available And about my role in Alex's life.
not_available What, you're worried about losing control over him or what? 
not_available You know, you always do this.
not_available Do what? Telling me what I'm really mad about.
not_available Most of the time you don't know what you're really mad about.
not_available Sam, this isn't our stop.
not_available Hey.
not_available Sleep okay? Yeah.
not_available Better than the night before? You wanna eat anything before you smoke? No.
not_available But thanks.
not_available I can make French toast.
not_available Aren't you on your way out? 
not_available I have time.
not_available Want anything to drink? I bought groceries.
not_available We've got milk, juice.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Were you vacuuming last night? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Did I keep you up? 
not_available No, I just No.
not_available That was very nice of you.
not_available Your shift starts at 2, right? You ready to go back? Well, I can't keep hanging around here.
not_available I gotta get going again.
not_available Everyone's been asking how you are.
not_available So you're sure you're okay? 
not_available What I really need is a little space.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I just
not_available You're right.
not_available I should find a place.
not_available I'll start looking.
not_available You don't have to rush.
not_available No, really.
not_available I'll see you at work.
not_available They're not closing the ER, are they? The county health system ran out of money.
not_available They say that so the government will bail us out.
not_available They're not meeting on the match.
not_available No.
not_available The applications aren't in.
not_available That's why it's not the match.
not_available It's an Attendings meeting.
not_available But they usually meet upstairs.
not_available Enough with the paranoia, people.
not_available Let's get back to work.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Attending meeting.
not_available Why? Why here? Why now? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe they're cutting a Resident.
not_available No.
not_available You think that's what this is? I don't know.
not_available But whatever it is, it can't be good.
not_available What color are you painting the room? 
not_available Lime green.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because it's my favorite color.
not_available Okay, the Attendings note.
not_available It's not enough just to co
not_available sign the chart.
not_available You have to write your own history, medical assessment and plan.
not_available On every patient? 
not_available It's the only way we get paid.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Very long shift.
not_available Yawning's contagious.
not_available Cosmo's teething.
not_available I was up all night.
not_available I'm exhausted.
not_available We're down two nurses.
not_available Anything else? If we don't get our patient
not_available satisfaction scores up we can't start pursuing HMO contracts.
not_available Okay, who's low? 
not_available Ray, Neela, Morris.
not_available Abby's the only one with a decent score.
not_available Even Pratt's on the low end.
not_available Pratt's okay with the patients.
not_available It's the other doctors he has a problem with.
not_available Need the room for a brachial artery laceration, 10 minutes out.
not_available And Neela brings up the rear with a score of 2.21.
not_available If we wanna make our patients happier, we need to teach our residents to connect with them better.
not_available What are you, the Croatian Dr.
not_available Phil? 
not_available They can't communicate with each other.
not_available Have you seen Neela and Pratt work together? Ray and Morris? We can teach them to make eye contact, introduce themselves.
not_available Act like human beings in front of the patients.
not_available That would change their personality structure which would be great if we could make their parents love them more.
not_available Med schools churn out scientists.
not_available It's up to us to turn them into physicians.
not_available Try it.
not_available They can't do any worse.
not_available I'm gonna get coffee.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available How long you been waiting? 
not_available About six hours.
not_available Six hours? A little longer, my friend, and you're looking at a big cash settlement.
not_available Here.
not_available Take one of my cards.
not_available Out of my way! 
not_available Give one to your buddy.
not_available Out of my way.
not_available My first job was working in an orange juice factory.
not_available Amy, could you sit down, please? 
not_available But I got canned.
not_available Couldn't concentrate.
not_available I'd rather stand.
not_available The seats are too small for her.
not_available Oh, shut up, Cullum.
not_available I'll get you in soon, okay? Pratt, knee contusions, slipped at work, can't bear weight.
not_available I've got a hot Ml so it's gonna have to wait.
not_available I didn't say it can't wait.
not_available I said "can't bear weight," as in stand up.
not_available I'll get to it when I get to it.
not_available Plan to help Residents communicate, you might wanna start with Pratt.
not_available Tell me the truth.
not_available How many Vicodin will it take for you to go away? I'll write it down.
not_available I'm doomed.
not_available Morris! Relax and come talk to me when you're done.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Going home? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna go home, sleep off my shift, come back in 12 hours and pick you up.
not_available Oh, really? 
not_available Puccini's can take us at 9:00.
not_available For me, it'll be breakfast.
not_available For you, it'll be whatever you want.
not_available Fantastic.
not_available I'm craving a pound of pasta and some oily garlic bread.
not_available She's carbo
not_available loading for a marathon.
not_available Enjoy your honeymoon.
not_available I'm gonna be fighting with Sam.
not_available Okay.
not_available Have fun with that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, can you get gastritis after 16 ibuprofen? Why's your patient taking that much medicine? Is he depressed? I was just about to check.
not_available There you go.
not_available Neela.
not_available Amy Packer, an obese 15year
not_available old with a forehead lac.
not_available What happened? Brother hit her over the head with a lamp.
not_available Hi, Amy.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available This is Cullum.
not_available I can't get up.
not_available Oh, here.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available Here.
not_available She's too fat to get up.
not_available Oh, my goodness.
not_available That was quite the fall, young lady.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you believe it? There you go.
not_available All this ice and not a speck of salt to be seen.
not_available I think the hospital is negligent and responsible for your injury.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I don't have an injury.
not_available Well, gonna feel okay probably for the first 24 hours.
not_available And then the pain develops.
not_available You could be looking at long
not_available term disability from for example, lumbar myofascial strain or disc herniation syndrome with radiculopathy.
not_available It's just a bruise.
not_available I think an MRl is indicated definitely.
not_available Are you a doctor? 
not_available No.
not_available Attorney.
not_available Herb Spivak, attorney at law.
not_available My card.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, OIG, line 2.
not_available Claiming we transferred an unstable patient.
not_available You're a doctor, huh? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let me tell you something.
not_available You never know when you're gonna need more protection.
not_available These hospital bigwigs will let you hang out to dry if you ever get sued.
not_available If you solicit any more patients in my bay, I will have you forcibly removed.
not_available How about a free pen? Follow my finger.
not_available Amy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Neela, present to me when you're done.
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Am I in some sort of trouble? 
not_available No, no.
not_available Just keep going.
not_available It's Mr.
not_available Meacham, right? 
not_available The one and only.
not_available Tell me about your pain.
not_available Did you have an injury? 
not_available I was moving boxes at work.
not_available Where do you work? I used to work as a lumberjack.
not_available But I couldn't hack it, so they gave me the ax.
not_available Is it worse when you walk? 
not_available Can I help with something, Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Just observing.
not_available You have pain in any of the joints? 
not_available No.
not_available Can you get a postural vitals for me in Exam 2? Getting slammed.
not_available I'm setting Neela up for suturing, I got a Foley an NG, two IVs to start, and a fivepage patient
not_available transfer summary.
not_available I got your tray.
not_available Amy, I talked to your mom.
not_available She's on her way.
not_available Oh, my foster mom.
not_available He's her real son.
not_available How long have you been with them? 
not_available Since last March.
not_available Sorry.
not_available That was lidocaine to numb up your cut.
not_available Die! I hope he's referring to his game.
not_available Cullum needs his meds adjusted.
not_available That's why he has tantrums.
not_available Die, die, die.
not_available Is that what happened? He lost his temper? 
not_available Kind of.
not_available What meds is he on? 
not_available Adderall and Depakote for ADHD and ODD.
not_available I'll be back to sew you up.
not_available Does it seem like every 10year
not_available old boy you see nowadays has ADHD? ADHD, a Game Boy and an iPod.
not_available Foster kid, head injury, unsupervised home 
not_available We should call Social Work.
not_available I think Wendall's on.
not_available Look, I know how to do an H &amp; P.
not_available Excuse me, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Hold on.
not_available How long did you let him talk before interrupting him? 
not_available Twenty, 30 seconds.
not_available Four.
not_available What color were his eyes? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We weren't on a date.
not_available Didn't make eye contact.
not_available Listen to his heart? 
not_available The guy had a twisted knee.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Listen to his heart to show you care and that you're paying attention to detail.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available It takes one minute.
not_available Makes a difference between your patient feeling taken care of and feeling ignored.
not_available We got patients that have been waiting over nine hours.
not_available Believe me, they already feel ignored.
not_available You ready to present? 
not_available I think I need to redo my exam.
not_available Listen, it's about connecting better.
not_available If your patients trust you, she'll heal faster.
not_available That's what all the studies say, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available I find it really distracting working with somebody so good
not_available looking.
not_available Who? Dr.
not_available Kovac? Oh, come on.
not_available Don't pretend he's not hot.
not_available I don't know, you just get used to it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But he's gorgeous.
not_available Who's gorgeous? Got a John Doe.
not_available Looks about 16.
not_available Multiple GSWs to the chest.
not_available Any vitals in the field? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Luka.
not_available Tier one, no BP.
not_available Never had a rhythm.
not_available Fixed and dilated.
not_available You wanna call it? 
not_available Let's see.
not_available Should we get some Oneg? Am I missing something? 
not_available No.
not_available Let's stick with saline for now.
not_available I thought asystole in the field meant zero percent survival.
not_available Sam, start compressions.
not_available You want labs too? 
not_available No.
not_available Just check a crit.
not_available Oh, this is like some sort of practice.
not_available Apparently.
not_available Oh, can I do a chest tube? No.
not_available Neela's gonna do a saphenous cutdown.
not_available She is? 
not_available I am? Okay, let's prep and drape the ankle.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now make your incision from the anterior tibia to the medial malleolus.
not_available You a doctor? I think I'm having an aneurysm.
not_available Sir, please wait back inside for a doctor to get to you.
not_available Pratt, you got a sec? I could be having a stroke! 
not_available Probably a headache.
not_available They might cut a resident? I'm gonna sue you if I end up paralyzed.
not_available Why are you following me? 
not_available I'm not.
not_available Gentlemen, please! 
not_available I'm serious.
not_available My attorney's office is right there.
not_available Did a doctor screw you up? Come visit the Mobile Law Office of Herb W.
not_available Spivak.
not_available He's had two rounds of epi and atropine.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available One more tie on the distal segment.
not_available Okay.
not_available Asystole.
not_available How much longer? Until the third liter's in.
not_available Sam, resume compressions.
not_available Now, get your femoral pulse.
not_available Can't quite get one.
not_available It's because he bled out.
not_available Third liter's in.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Okay, that's it.
not_available Time of death, 9:52.
not_available Thanks for showing me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Write up your note.
not_available I'll co
not_available sign.
not_available Any identifying marks? Brand
not_available new sneakers, blue.
not_available Wonder what he was thinking when he put those on this morning? What? 
not_available Had it been just us you would've pronounced him dead.
not_available He was hypovolemic.
not_available He never had a pulse.
not_available There was a chance he might respond to a fluid bolus.
not_available If you were really serious, you would have ordered the O
not_available neg.
not_available Someday they might find themselves with no rapid infuser or a central
not_available line kit.
not_available If they know how to do a cutdown, they could save a life.
not_available I can't afford to waste time on teaching cases when there's real work to do.
not_available This is what we do.
not_available We train doctors.
not_available Sometimes that means running through codes so residents learn procedures.
not_available I mean, it's a teaching hospital.
not_available Yeah! It's also a real hospital with patients who didn't get antibiotics because I was in here doing compressions.
not_available So you did some extra compressions.
not_available What are you really mad about? Are you in all seriousness telling me for the second time today that I am not mad about what I'm really mad about? I have no idea what you just said.
not_available Forget it.
not_available Nine hundred dollars for a studio in Andersonville.
not_available What happened? Abby kick you out? 
not_available No.
not_available Yes.
not_available When's she coming in? Shift starts at 2.
not_available You know, I've missed her.
not_available What? I have.
not_available I just got a two
not_available bedroom sublet on North and Oakley for just 1000 a month.
not_available Wicker Park.
not_available But my roommate just flaked out on me.
not_available Back in rehab, huh? You wouldn't happen to be interested in? You mean you and me? 
not_available Five hundred's better than a grand.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available Morris.
not_available Hey, isn't that our local shyster? 
not_available Damn.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Allow me.
not_available Go for it, Archie.
not_available Hi, I'm looking for a Dr.
not_available Ras
not_available goostra.
not_available Rasgotra? That's me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Kitty Peyser.
not_available I'm Amy's foster mom.
not_available Is she okay? She's fine.
not_available She's just needs some stitches and a tetanus shot.
not_available I heard they got in a fight.
not_available Cullum's not bad.
not_available He needs his meds.
not_available Perhaps you'd like to talk to our social worker? No, I just wanna see my daughter.
not_available I should tell you, I had to notify Social Work.
not_available They'll probably be contacting DCFS.
not_available What? When children come in with suspicious
not_available No, no, no, come on.
not_available Hey, kids fight.
not_available It's a standard situation.
not_available There is no situation.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Peyser Look, don't do this to us.
not_available We love Amy.
not_available They'll take her away.
not_available Amy, I'm here.
not_available Hi.
not_available Multiple GSWs.
not_available Gang shootout on the corner of 51st and King.
not_available Tachy at 138.
not_available BP, 85 palp.
not_available I'll take the airway.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available Three gunshots to the abdomen.
not_available Run it, Pratt.
not_available No breath sounds on the left.
not_available Morris, chest tube.
not_available Jane, subclavian.
not_available Ray, stop staring at the monitor and concentrate.
not_available I've never done a subclavian.
not_available Hey! It's time to buck up.
not_available Central
not_available line kit.
not_available Did you get rid of Herb yet? No.
not_available He says he has a client at the hospital revising her will.
not_available He is wily, that one.
not_available Stay in the midline, Ray.
not_available I got it.
not_available Does he need atropine or epi? No.
not_available He needs oxygen.
not_available The tube's not in.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available You have to see it go through the cords.
not_available Give me the blade.
not_available Let me try again.
not_available Maybe next time.
not_available Tube.
not_available Pratt, why don't you try teaching? 
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available You did it wrong.
not_available Watch me.
not_available Call Surgery.
not_available This guy needs an ex
not_available lap.
not_available And I'm in.
not_available See? It's just that simple.
not_available Thank you, Greg.
not_available Anytime, Ray.
not_available Am I gonna have a scar? Just a little line.
not_available We'll take you to Darlene's salon tomorrow.
not_available We'll get you bangs.
not_available That'd be nice.
not_available Keep the wound dry till the stitches come out.
not_available So no baths and no swimming.
not_available I should go check on Cullum.
not_available Mary, can you take Mrs.
not_available Peyser to the family room? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Don't worry, Amy.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available So Neosporin twice a day and come back if it's red, painful or draining fluid.
not_available Does your cut hurt? What's wrong? 
not_available I know what's gonna happen.
not_available Once you call in Social Work
not_available Amy, don't get ahead of yourself.
not_available I can't leave.
not_available They need me.
not_available I give Cullum his pills every morning, and I get him ready for school.
not_available That's a lot of responsibility for a girl your age.
not_available It's the only home where I haven't been beaten up or ignored.
not_available Kitty loves me.
not_available She needs me.
not_available My whole life, I've never felt that before.
not_available Sam.
not_available Yeah? Did you already call Social Work on Amy Packer? Yeah.
not_available Wendall will be down soon.
not_available What is that? It's still caffeine.
not_available Call Wendall back and tell her not to bother? Why? 
not_available I was too quick.
not_available I should have waited.
not_available She's a foster kid.
not_available We always call Social Work.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Stabbing me to death.
not_available I think he's dehydrated.
not_available Do I look like a pincushion to you? He's my patient.
not_available Why are you torturing my patient? Jane said Dr.
not_available Kovac told her you needed some help today.
not_available Sats, 79.
not_available Barely any pulse.
not_available Let me do it.
not_available You can practice later on a dummy.
not_available I can't get the tube into the space.
not_available Use a twisting motion.
not_available Systolic's only 60.
not_available Cycle the DynaMap.
not_available Your incision big enough? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Morris.
not_available You've done a chest tube before, right? 
not_available P.E.A.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available Give me the tube.
not_available Out of the way.
not_available No, I got it.
not_available You need to manage your team.
not_available I don't know how to explain any better.
not_available Bradying down to 50.
not_available Amp of epi.
not_available You criticize and make them nervous.
not_available What do you think you're doing to me? Kid doesn't have time for them to learn.
not_available Hello.
not_available We can hear you.
not_available We're standing right here.
not_available He's pulseless.
not_available Check it again.
not_available Good carotid.
not_available Tension pneumo.
not_available It's a common cause of P.E.A.
not_available His sats are rising.
not_available So do you mind if I ask our Residents to roll him up to the O.R.? Or do you think that that would hurt their feelings? What was that all about? That was an intubation, a chest tube and a central
not_available line in under 15 minutes.
not_available The point is not to do it all yourself.
not_available Because you all had a group hug this morning do I have to listen to this touchyfeely crap all day? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm not an intern, okay? So stop acting like one.
not_available You have people under you.
not_available You're responsible for teaching them.
not_available So are you gonna build their confidence or destroy it? Well, if the choice is between building up self
not_available esteem and saving my patient I'm gonna have to go with my patient every time.
not_available I don't know, they were unsupervised.
not_available The mother seems overwhelmed, the brother has problems.
not_available This is her fifth home.
not_available It's not a perfect family, but she says it's the best she's ever had.
not_available I haven't spoken to their caseworker.
not_available Safest thing is pull her from the home.
not_available She's happy there.
not_available No guarantee things will be better anywhere else.
not_available You guys talking about that foster kid? They're happy together.
not_available The family seems to be working.
not_available If the mom agrees to parenting classes, I'll consider reevaluating
not_available Neela, some landlord for you on line two.
not_available I'll take it in Admit.
not_available She'll do whatever you need.
not_available I tell you, I find hospital conditions absolutely woeful.
not_available Are you overworked and underpaid? 
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available You can't be back here.
not_available Get out.
not_available You can't kick me out.
not_available I'm a patient.
not_available What? 
not_available That's right.
not_available Very bad sore throat.
not_available Sore throat? 
not_available I signed in.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I know you guys are backed up, so don't worry, I'll wait.
not_available Just take all the time you need.
not_available I'm gonna fetch me a lozenge.
not_available Haldol and hard restraints? We could treat him like a psych patient with delusions of being a lawyer.
not_available Abby? 
not_available Abby.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yeah, I'm okay.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available You too.
not_available Oh, my God, Abby.
not_available Did you get my card? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I prayed for you.
not_available No windows at all? Shared bathroom? Is that even legal here? Abby finally kicked her out? 
not_available Well, how much a month? It's ugly out there.
not_available You usually do early shifts, right? So you can go for gigs with your band? Yeah.
not_available And if you stick to your late shifts and overnights
not_available Weeks could go by, we might never see each other.
not_available Months even.
not_available Welcome, roomie.
not_available God, I'm gonna regret this.
not_available Excuse me, please.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I need to see my grandson.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Michael.
not_available Michael Barnes.
not_available His friends said he got shot.
not_available I don't see the name.
not_available He's 16.
not_available He was wearing jeans, a gray T
not_available shirt and sneakers.
not_available Blue sneakers? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available You saw him? A patient came in earlier matching that description.
not_available Is he okay? If you'd like to take a seat 
not_available I can get the Attending for you.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Has something happened? Ma'amIs he dead? I can't give any more information untilIs he okay? Why can't you tell me? 
not_available Ma'am, please calm down.
not_available Where is he? I need to see him.
not_available If you'd like to take a seatWhere's my grandson? We can't confirm anything until
not_available His name is Michael Barnes.
not_available Michael? We can't confirm anything until the body's been ID'd.
not_available What? Oh, God.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to
not_available Just let me go and get the Attending.
not_available I'mMa'am, if you'd just like to take a seat, and I'm sure the Attending can
not_available Oh, Michael.
not_available God.
not_available Where's the grandmother now? 
not_available Crying it out in the family room.
not_available I guess Neela needs to work a little on her death notification.
not_available A little? Grandma's traumatized.
not_available I can't believe we didn't have to sedate her.
not_available You can't teach basic people
not_available skills.
not_available You know how to relate to people or not.
not_available Croissant? 
not_available I'll go talk to her.
not_available You realize you're just encouraging him.
not_available Just because he's a shark doesn't mean we can't eat his pastries.
not_available Hey, who's on call for general surgery tonight? 
not_available Sung.
not_available Okay.
not_available I have to track down an abdominal series from Radiology.
not_available And I have a puking lady that had a dystonic reaction to phenothiazines.
not_available Zofran? 
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available So how are you doing? 
not_available Good.
not_available Really? 
not_available Never better.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yes, yes, yes.
not_available I processed feelings of anger, shame and guilt in an emotionally safe environment.
not_available I've addressed the urge to use alcohol.
not_available And I've consulted both a shaman and a guru, so I'm all good.
not_available That was Wendall, our social worker.
not_available She's getting information from your foster mom.
not_available She's not gonna take me away? 
not_available No.
not_available Your foster mom's gonna take some classes.
not_available You and Cullum will start an after
not_available school program so you can go home together.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Thank you, thank you.
not_available Mary, can you take Amy up to the seventh floor, please? 
not_available Sure.
not_available They'll be waiting for you.
not_available So you convinced Social Work, huh? 
not_available It seems so.
not_available Good job.
not_available I took your advice.
not_available I tried to connect.
not_available Didn't do such a good job with the grandmother though.
not_available You and Dr.
not_available Lewis must think I'm a complete idiot.
not_available No, no.
not_available You're just inexperienced.
not_available Hey, hey, hey, come here.
not_available First, you bring them into the family room for a death notification.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Somewhere away from the patients and the staff.
not_available She just got so hysterical.
not_available Make sure they are sitting down.
not_available Don't be evasive and don't use euphemisms.
not_available Use the word "dead" and the word "is.
not_available " 
not_available I know all this.
not_available Give them a tissue.
not_available Look them in the eye and make a connection.
not_available Then just say, "I'm very sorry.
not_available " 
not_available It's okay.
not_available I suck.
not_available No, you don't suck.
not_available You're still learning.
not_available I can't believe this.
not_available I'm in a wedding next weekend.
not_available One percent lido with epi, 6
not_available 0 Vicryl.
not_available God, I'm gonna ruin all the photographs.
not_available They won't look at you, they'll be looking at the bride.
not_available You owe me one.
not_available What? No, I don't.
not_available Yeah, you do.
not_available I put down the NG on Mrs.
not_available Leerburger.
not_available I didn't ask you to do that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac did.
not_available What? He said you were a little overextended today, unlike the rest of us.
not_available Abby, will you excuse me? I have to go yell at someone.
not_available Have fun.
not_available Okay, Miss Tobel, in the future, try not to pluck your eyebrows in a moving car.
not_available Okay, numb and prep the wound.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Get away from me! I know what you want! You wanna make me suffer! Security! 
not_available Lockhart, you're back.
not_available Welcome back.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I called John Manning at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies We're looking for our son.
not_available We've been waiting for an hour.
not_available His name is Tevin.
not_available Tevin Burrough.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll check.
not_available We've been here an hour.
not_available Where you going? Get back, bitch! 
not_available effective in the treatment of traumatic disorders.
not_available You focus on the most vivid image, emotion or sensation in traumatic memory, simultaneously focusing on an external impulse.
not_available I printed out a bunch of the studies for you.
not_available You can take a look at them.
not_available We can talk about them tomorrow.
not_available Okay, thank you.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Abby, eyebrow lac's ready.
not_available You were gonna show me how to do a running subcuticular.
not_available Right.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available This won't leave a mark, will it? Dr.
not_available Lockhart is using a special technique to minimize scarring.
not_available Abby? I'm sorry.
not_available I can't do this right now.
not_available What? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Joe, what happened? 
not_available He threatened to sue me.
not_available He's parked in front of a hydrant.
not_available What's with the motor home? 
not_available I'm getting rid of it.
not_available Susan.
not_available Yeah? I think maybe I came back too soon.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm not in the right frame of mind to do this.
not_available Take all the time you need.
not_available Ray's staying late to cover.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available God.
not_available You'll catch the next one.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Spivak, get out here now.
not_available Hello, doctor.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available We fixed you up.
not_available Jerry.
not_available The guy has really great coffee.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Are you ready to discuss this morning's fall? 
not_available Did you sign Mr.
not_available Fayen in to CT? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had to go up to CT to push morphine instead of doing it here.
not_available Just trying to help.
not_available No.
not_available You're being passive
not_available aggressive.
not_available Why are you so mad? Because 
not_available I'm used to having control over my life.
not_available Sam.
not_available What? Do you know where Neela is? You're the Attending on Amy Packer, the foster kid? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is Mari Hinojosa from DCFS.
not_available I have bad news.
not_available I think that's everything.
not_available Thank you.
not_available "Desensitization reprocessing"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's some crazy stuff Dubenko gave me.
not_available Want me to give it a try? 
not_available No.
not_available I think it's dead.
not_available Procrastinating.
not_available Didn't miss it at all.
not_available Work, over the holidays.
not_available I must've made an impression on you.
not_available You didn't notice I was gone for a week.
not_available No, I remember.
not_available You're the guy with the beard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where did you go? 
not_available Yellowstone.
not_available The most beautiful place on earth.
not_available You ever been? I didn't realize it until I was smack in the middle of the geysers but the whole thing is actually one gigantic active volcano.
not_available Did you know that? 
not_available No, I did not.
not_available It could blow at any second.
not_available It's actually 30,000 years overdue.
not_available And what would happen if it did? It would wipe out most of the western U.S.
not_available Cover the rest of the country in ash.
not_available Wreak havoc on the global climate.
not_available Is that all? 
not_available We'd be gone in an instant, just like that.
not_available That's how fragile life is.
not_available You know that.
not_available You work in the ER.
not_available Yeah.
not_available The human life span is so short anyways.
not_available It's almost irrelevant.
not_available Are you high? There's your train.
not_available See you later.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Between the paramedics and the doctors here, we worked on him for 45 minutes 
not_available but his injuries were too severe.
not_available His mother died when he was 5.
not_available Your son did well in surgery.
not_available They were able to control the bleeding in his liver.
not_available Since then, it's just been the two of us.
not_available He wasn't in pain, and he didn't suffer.
not_available I knew something like this was gonna happen.
not_available His heart and his brain were spared.
not_available He'll probably do just fine.
not_available He was talking about going to college.
not_available I'm very sorry.
not_available He's gonna be groggy, but he might be able to hear what you're saying.
not_available Take as much time as you need to say goodbye.
not_available This isn't my grandson.
not_available This isn't my son.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Hello? Hi.
not_available No.
not_available No, they can't refuse to admit her.
not_available She's got post
not_available op adhesions.
not_available The surgeon's gonna rip our heads off 
not_available Haleh.
not_available Haleh.
not_available Listen.
not_available Listen.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just push four of morphine, and I'll be there in a minute, okay? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Bye.
not_available How the hell did this happen? I'm not sure yetWere they mislabeled? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Did they look the same? Was there a computer glitch? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available All I know is that there were two John Doe's both 16, gunshot wounds, gang
not_available related.
not_available Both treated in Trauma 1 a few hours apart.
not_available Susan, I just do not understand how this happened.
not_available There was a massive communication failure.
not_available Well, it's your job to make sure that people communicate.
not_available I take full responsibility for it.
not_available We screwed up.
not_available We didn't know there were two John Does.
not_available We didn't speak to each other or check the board.
not_available Who was in which trauma? Neela, Sam and I worked on a kid with a saphenous cutdown.
not_available Morris, Ray, Pratt and I had the other.
not_available There was no overlap between the traumas? I was in both.
not_available Who's that? 
not_available Med student.
not_available I put a name alert on the board.
not_available Why didn't you say anything? No one listens to me.
not_available No one even remembers I was in the room.
not_available You look like you could use a vacation.
not_available No.
not_available I got this great time
not_available share down in Boca Grande that I let friends use.
not_available Friends? 
not_available You know, friends that refer friends.
not_available It's got a great house and this beautiful boat and a pair of Jet Skis.
not_available Spivak? Security.
not_available Come on, give me a break, will you? 
not_available You're back.
not_available Yep.
not_available Thought your shift was over.
not_available No, not till 10.
not_available So you were just taking a break? 
not_available I guess so.
not_available Up on the El tracks? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I love it up there.
not_available Me too.
not_available Never know who you might run into.
not_available We just put them through hell.
not_available What will you say? I'll tell the truth.
not_available Families of dead patients don't remember much.
not_available The only thing they remember is if it seemed like you cared.
not_available If you were honest and direct with them.
not_available Did Dr.
not_available Lewis tell you to keep me away from them? Yeah.
not_available I wanna go in with you.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's unconstitutional.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Do not cross this line, or I will have you arrested.
not_available I don't see any line.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You can't come back here.
not_available This is a public institution.
not_available It doesn't matter.
not_available Well, you're violating my civil rights.
not_available I never got to see a doctor.
not_available So sue me.
not_available Your office is being towed, by the way.
not_available Hold it, hold it, hold it.
not_available Come on! Come on! Have some pity! 
not_available So much for Herb.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You know he'll be back.
not_available Amy? What's going on? Who are you? 
not_available I'm her doctor.
not_available I'm bringing her to the Haley Home.
not_available She lied to me.
not_available Go talk to your social worker.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Stop.
not_available I have two more kids to pick up.
not_available Don't make my job any harder.
not_available Amy, wait.
not_available She told me I could go home.
not_available Thirty days? 
not_available You can have visitors after two weeks.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available Cold turkey, just like that? Well, they give you medication to help ease the withdrawal.
not_available Think about it, okay? How could you pull Amy out of her home behind my back? It wasn't behind your back.
not_available We got new information.
not_available We had a plan.
not_available Her caseworker was out of townWhy didn't you tell me? If you would stop interruptingYou're supposed to consult the doctor
not_available Kovac signed off.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm hating doctors right now.
not_available Neela's mad, Ray practically accused me of elder abuse.
not_available Morris laughed when this kid kicked me in the shin.
not_available I was gonna ask if you were ready.
not_available That's all you have to say? You know, we come from different perspectives sometimes and sometimes we disagree.
not_available But whatever happened, you were right.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about Amy? 
not_available I was going to.
not_available When? 
not_available When I had time.
not_available Thought it might be better if you found out after your shift.
not_available I'm an adult.
not_available I don't need you to protect me.
not_available I wasn't trying to.
not_available You made a good decision based on information you had.
not_available But there was a pattern of incidents.
not_available Like what? 
not_available Like April 16th, scald injury to shoulder.
not_available Sounds pretty minor to me.
not_available July 14th, bite inflicted by brother.
not_available Who we know has behavioral issues.
not_available October 20th, clavicular fracture after a fall.
not_available November 30th, 14
not_available centimeter leg lac after tripping on stairs.
not_available Her history wasn't consistent with her injuries.
not_available Okay.
not_available Each one is not a big deal, but together
not_available I got it.
not_available I thought it was a done deal, told Amy everything would work out.
not_available I got her hopes up.
not_available Well, in the end 
not_available we're doing the right thing for her.
not_available So why not just tell me that? I was worried that finding out would make you lose your confidence.
not_available And I didn't want that to happen, so If I was trying to protect you, I'm sorry, okay? You know, I didn't always used to be a mobile lawyer.
not_available I used to have big money.
not_available Big, big money.
not_available I lost my shirt on niftypets.
not_available com.
not_available Can I get something for the pain? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Soon as we finish this paperwork required by our lawyer 
not_available to guard against frivolous lawsuits.
not_available I ain't signing nothing.
not_available This document gives us permission to treat you.
not_available This second one specifies whether you have an advance directive or living will.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available If your heart stops do you want us to use measures to resuscitate you? Just put me out of my misery.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm leaving for the day.
not_available I'm waiting on a transfer patient so I'll walk out with you.
not_available Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I've been camping on your couch for six months.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I didn't mean to be a jerk about it.
not_available No.
not_available I needed a good kick in the ass, and I found a place with Ray, actually.
not_available So I'll be leaving at the end of the week.
not_available Well, take your time.
not_available There's no rush.
not_available And by the way, are you nuts? Yes.
not_available Yes, I am.
not_available So random question.
not_available Yes? Do you ever get crushes on people you work with? What do you mean? 
not_available You know.
not_available Crushes on people you work with.
not_available Yeah, I guess.
not_available Sometimes.
not_available Why? I don't know.
not_available What? What? Are you leaving for the night? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good night, guys.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available Night.
not_available See you at home.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know, you're really good at teaching other people how to communicate.
not_available Thanks.
not_available We should try it ourselves sometime.
not_available Yeah.
not_available My English, you know? Still working on it.
not_available Now you're gonna pull the Croatian card? That is low.
not_available You were right about one thing.
not_available Oh, only one thing? Fifty bucks was too much for a concert ticket.
