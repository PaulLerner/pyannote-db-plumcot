not_available So, what now?.

not_available Good enough.
not_available Maybe he hit his head on the way down.
CLAUDlA How's he doing?.
MORRlS Not great.
not_available Minimally responsive, we had to put a tube in to breathe for him.

not_available Didn't happen at the club, happened at the station house.
not_available lt did?.

not_available Why?.
not_available That's for sick people.

not_available Multiple blows from different directions, probably from a blunt object.
not_available You can tell that?.
not_available I don't know details but this picture doesn't match the history I'm getting.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, eh

not_available No, no, no.
not_available We can't.
not_available We don't have training or the authority to do

not_available Ugh.
not_available Well, there's another thing that's different.
not_available That kid got like a foot taller.
not_available I know.
not_available He's under the influence of a bunch of fun hormones.
not_available Well, don't let him drink whatever Jerry's drinking.
not_available Forget it.
not_available So, Sam, what do you hear from Abby and Luka?.
not_available She e

not_available Sounds like it's, uh, going great.
not_available Great for them.
not_available Can you check status of the transport team?.
not_available I want to know when they get here.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'll call the coordinator.
not_available lt is good to see you.
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available So you're a popular guy.

not_available I spent some time in lndonesia after the tsunami.
not_available Really?.
not_available So now you're ready to come back to the real world?.
not_available Well, that felt pretty real to me out there, but yeah, you could say that.
not_available I know there's a lot of re
not_available learning required and if you're not fully invested in it.
not_available I don't know how long I'll be in Chicago, how many shifts I can pick up but I do know patients that come through those doors and I know quite a bit of your personnel.
not_available And I know not to use the snack machine on 3 and how to get to the clinic without going outside in winter and the bottom right hand
not_available drawer of the admit desk sticks unless you brace it with the bottom of your foot.
not_available I wasted a lot of money in that snack machine.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available So tell me, when did you first work here?.
not_available I was a med student in the ER in 1 994.
not_available You know Mark Greene, then.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I knew Mark Greene.
not_available Yep.
not_available I learned a lot from him.
not_available When can you start?.
not_available ls he gonna be all right?.
not_available No.
not_available What you guys did, I thought
not_available Well, we probably saved his life.
not_available But there's no way to know if he'll ever wake up be able to talk or understand anything.
CLAUDlA You know.
not_available I can tell you know.
MORRlS Know what?.
not_available Don't do that.
not_available I can tell when something's bothering you.
not_available It was like I froze.
not_available I didn't know what to do.
not_available When?.
not_available What happened?.
not_available They took this guy into interrogation.
not_available I stayed at the desk filling out some forms.
not_available I go back there and there's three of them tuning him up good.
not_available Three cops?.
not_available I see them through the window.
not_available So, what do I do?.
not_available Go in there and tell them to give it a break?.
not_available Get somebody else involved?.
not_available No.
not_available I walk away.
not_available Come back 1 O minutes later.
not_available By then he's moaning on the ground, crying for help.
not_available Eventually, they let me call 91 1.
not_available Did you tell Detective Mallory?.
not_available I didn't have to, because he was in there with them.
not_available Okay, you can't just bury this.
not_available What am I supposed to do?.
not_available I'm the new guy, I follow orders.
not_available I wouldn't even be there if he hadn't backed me up.
MORRlS You can't just let this go.
not_available You don't get it.
not_available No, I do.
not_available Things happen, deal with it.
not_available You mean ignore it?.
not_available There's a code on the job, you don't turn on your own.
not_available That's something you never come back from.
not_available Walk in, there are all picking up organs for recipients.
not_available Dr.
not_available Robbin steps up, takes her scalpel
BRENNER Dr.
not_available Robbins?.
not_available The transplant attending.
not_available She whips out the heart like it's no big deal, holds it up inspects it for a minute, then says to the room ""Looks good, thanks.
not_available "" Thirty seconds later we're back up in the air like superheroes.
not_available Well, you kind of are.
not_available I don't know if I could do transplant surgeries full
not_available time but this is kind of high.
not_available Robbins wants your butt in here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Coming.
not_available Are you off shift now?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, but I'll wait with Lucy until you're done.
ROBBlNS Adson with teeth.
not_available Dr.
not_available Rasgotra, you're missing all the fun.
not_available SVC, lVC are done, saved the aorta for you.
not_available Wow, are you sure?.
ROBBlNS My 8
not_available year old could do it.
not_available Most important thing is to cut the great vessels as close to the heart as you can.
not_available That way we have tissue to work with when we're sewing.
NEELA Okay.
not_available Scissors.
not_available Ready?.
not_available Less talk, more action.
NEELA Okay.
not_available Uh.
not_available The aorta is divided.
not_available Take it out.
NEELA The heart?.
not_available No, the kidney.
not_available Yes, the big, dead organ you disconnected from circulation.
SHlRLEY Bloomington wants a doctor.
not_available Tell them it's going fine.
not_available Pick it up with a clamp and pull.
SHlRLEY Dr.
not_available Robbins, they need to speak with you.
NEELA Voila.
SHlRLEY They say we need to stop the transplant, there's been a mistake.
BANFlELD Go ahead and discharge but make sure you do phone follow
not_available up.
not_available All right.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Thanks.
NEELA Lucy.
not_available Are you done?.
NEELA No.
not_available ls the new heart in yet?.
not_available What's going on?.
not_available I, uh.
not_available Do you know what a blood type is?.
not_available Sort of.
not_available Your mom is a type O which means she can only get a heart from another O.
not_available There was a mistake at the Bloomington hospital.
not_available The donor's blood type was mislabeled.
not_available She's an A.
not_available If we'd put that heart in your mom, she would have died.
not_available Fortunately, they found out before it was too late.
not_available Your mom will get a new heart, Lucy.
not_available So, what now?.
not_available We, uhWe re
not_available implant the LVAD and then we wait?.
NEELA Well, the thing is.
not_available The thing is, we didn't learn of the mistake until we had already taken out the old heart.
not_available Your mom's on a cardiac bypass machine.
not_available She needs to stay on it until we find her a new heart.
not_available She can't talk?.
not_available No.
not_available But she'll know you're there.
CLAUDlA Any changes?.
not_available Well, his intracranial pressure is still spiking, it's not a good sign.
not_available As I'm sure you're both aware, I'm required by law to report this.
not_available Report what?.
not_available Whenever the history doesn't match the injury we need to follow protocols.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available I don't think I do.
not_available I've sent scalp lavage fluid to the lab where pathologists will look for substances fibers that could perhaps help fill in the blanks.
not_available You know, standard procedure.
not_available I see.
not_available And of course I'll need to notify the state authorities start an official investigation.
not_available What do you think you're doing, doctor?.
not_available My job.
not_available See that game last night?.
not_available The Bulls were really, uh, shooting from outside the paint.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Me, either.
not_available Basketball banter.
not_available Just trying to approximate guy talk.
not_available Well, thanks for trying.
not_available Women.
not_available Can't live with them, can't shoot them.
not_available Look, I'm no expert but if I've learned one thing it's you get your heart stomped on it's best to take all that energy and channel it into something positive.
not_available Hi, Lucy.
not_available Your foster dad's not here yet?.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I want to say good night to my mom before I go.
not_available Well, she should be settled upstairs soon.
not_available I always knew she wasn't my mom.
not_available I found a picture of another lady in a hospital bed holding me when I was a baby.
not_available So I figured it out.
not_available You're a very smart little girl.
not_available It never bothered me.
not_available Because she always loved me so much, and made me feel so happy.
not_available And I knew that's what a real mother did even if she's not your real mom.
not_available Mr.
not_available Lempel, what are you doing?.
not_available If we hold the ceremony in the next hour, we'll beat sunset.
not_available You can't leave now.
not_available Why, am I dying?.
not_available No, you're not dying.
not_available That's fantastic.
not_available Stupendous.
not_available All the more reason to start celebrating.
not_available But your bronchoscopy showed a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
not_available It's an immune reaction to fungal spores.
not_available Mushroom worker's lung.
not_available You've heard of it?.
not_available Of course I've heard of it.
not_available Pleurotus cornucopiae is a likely culprit.
not_available I knew it was just a matter of time.
not_available Gentleman, lady, thank you very much.
not_available This place is nowhere near as bad as its reputation.
not_available Wait.
not_available You need to stay and be treated.
not_available No.
not_available What do you mean, no?.
not_available I don't know why you need me to tell you this but, uh, the only definitive treatment for mushroom worker's lung is to stay away from mushrooms.
not_available And that, my friends, is not an option.
not_available You'd rather have lung disease than stay away from mushrooms?.
not_available If mushrooms be the food of love, play on.
not_available If we shadows have offended, Say but this and all is mended 
not_available What was that?.
not_available Sorry?.
not_available Why you pull that stunt?.
not_available Put the squeeze on him like that?.
not_available T o see that the right thing happens.
not_available I was gonna tell him, handle it.
not_available Well, it didn't seem like that.
not_available Ha, now you wanna judge me?.
not_available I'm trying to help.
not_available Well, stop.
not_available Last thing I need is them knowing I opened up my mouth.
not_available Just the two I was looking for.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morris, it turns out, there was an incident that some of the guys didn't feel they wanted to be up
not_available front about.
not_available It's being dealt with now.
MORRlS Dealt with?.
MALLORY Mm
not_available hm.
not_available The officers involved will be disciplined, maybe even prosecuted.
not_available We can't abide that kind of infraction.
not_available Can we, Detective Diaz?.
not_available No, sir.
MALLORY I appreciate your help.
not_available Make sure to get you a report so that your records can accurately reflect the cause of injury.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So you got any shifts you want me to work?.
not_available Banfield said yes?.
not_available T ook a little persuading.
not_available Oh, she's no pushover.
not_available I'll be around.
not_available That's great, man.
not_available You seem good.
TRACY Thanks for showing me how to tube the effusion.
NEELA No problem.
not_available Check a film in an hour and call me if the fluid reaccumulates.
not_available Grasshopper, the student has become the teacher.
not_available I heard you were lurking about.
not_available How have you been?.
not_available Oh, I've had better days.
not_available I hear the Carter Center is opening.
not_available Had a few setbacks but official opening, a few weeks.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You and Kem must be so proud.
not_available Y eah.
not_available So I'll be around, I'll buy you a cup of coffee 
not_available and tell you tales of Africa.
not_available I look forward to hearing them.
not_available From Dr.
not_available Brenner.
not_available John.
not_available John! Call me.
NEELA Uh, what are you doing?.
not_available It's freezing out here.
not_available Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
not_available I think I just called you my sweet idiot.
NEELA Simon, what are we doing here?.
not_available This is the closest that we've got to a canal for now.
not_available But I am determined
not_available So determined to do better.
not_available What's this?.
not_available That's an lOU.
not_available We take a week off in April and the spring, as you know, is the perfect time to visit Venice.
not_available You wanna go to Venice?.
not_available Yeah.
not_available With you.
not_available Grappa?.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available I think this qualifies as a romantic gesture.
not_available Y es.
not_available No, this is nothing.
not_available This is just the beginning.
