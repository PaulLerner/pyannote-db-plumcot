not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.
not_available R.
not_available I saw Charlie Pratt at Ceasefire.
not_available He said he stopped by here last week.
not_available How'd it go? 
not_available Quick.
not_available Did the oncologist you spoke with mention anything about prophylactic surgery? You mean having my breasts removed? There have been advances in reconstructive surgery.
not_available And you need to protect yourself.
not_available Can you promise me that giving up my breasts would protect me? I had my annual PSA screening.
not_available Needle biopsy showed a moderately differentiated prostate cancer.
not_available I am so sorry.
not_available Does this hurt, Blaire? 
not_available She's in a coma, Inez.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available What's the last thing you remember? 
not_available Were we in an accident? E.
not_available R.
not_available 12x05 "WAKE UP" The reason I'm calling, Dr.
not_available Clemente, is that you were supposed to start today.
not_available So unless your plane went down or you got hit by a bus you'd better get in here as soon as you get this message.
not_available Luka, I need you to wait.
not_available Pratt's running behind.
not_available The new Attending is a no
not_available show.
not_available First day.
not_available He'd wanna make a good impression.
not_available You never did.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Page me if he doesn't show up.
not_available Morris, run through the moonlighting list.
not_available See if we can find someone to come in.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Where are you rushing off to? 
not_available Upstairs.
not_available Why? Uh
not_available Never mind.
not_available Last time I reached out to someone, Dubenko tried to make me his concubine.
not_available Hello, my people.
not_available You're late.
not_available Not according to me.
not_available According to me, I got 20 patients on the rack.
not_available Chest pain, I need a monitored bed.
not_available Don't have one.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Lewis coming in? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis is never coming in again.
not_available She took a tenured track position in Iowa City.
not_available Just like that? 
not_available Just like that.
not_available That's why Dr.
not_available Clemente is supposed to be here now.
not_available Who's this Clemente guy, anyway? He was residency director at Jacobi in the Bronx and he did a stint in Newark.
not_available Is he gonna be the new department chief? We're forming a search committee.
not_available The guy must be angling for it, right? 
not_available Abby, vomiting blood.
not_available My favorite.
not_available Ray, nosebleed.
not_available Sorry, I'm on my tox elective.
not_available I was just rolling down here to remind everybody about my gig tonight.
not_available Oh Pogo Lounge.
not_available Isn't that a strip club? It's behind the Lava Lounge, which used to be the Aqua Lounge.
not_available Roomie, are you gonna come? That's why I wake up in the morning.
not_available Okay, med students.
not_available Burning urination, seafood allergy.
not_available We're not really doctors.
not_available That never stopped Morris.
not_available Roswell and Marshall are premed.
not_available They're working for my grant tracking patient throughput time.
not_available If we don't start moving the meat, they'll be unemployed.
not_available You want me to supervise everyone and take on three new patients? You're an R
not_available 4, stop whining.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available To the Weaver Lounge.
not_available To work on my presentation.
not_available Anything short of a meteor crash, don't bug me.
not_available Pratt.
not_available EKG looks good.
not_available All right.
not_available Where's your pain, sir? It's not a pain.
not_available I just feel something right here.
not_available BP 124 over 78.
not_available What's it feel like? It feels really heavy, like a boulder.
not_available I can't breathe, doc.
not_available Say no more.
not_available Sir, would you do me a favor and open up? No, no.
not_available I did two lines of coke last night.
not_available What? 
not_available Yeah, and a bottle of tequila.
not_available You did? 
not_available Yeah, not to mention three Viagra.
not_available Why didn't you say something? Aren't you supposed to take my history? Who are you? 
not_available Victor Clemente.
not_available Your new Attending.
not_available And congratulations, doc.
not_available You just killed me.
not_available Usually, Dr.
not_available Pratt is very thorough.
not_available We're getting slammed.
not_available It's okay, death becomes me.
not_available I've got a Q&amp;A; upstairs, but maybe I should stay down here.
not_available No, go ahead, take it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kevorkian and I will hold down the fort.
not_available Hey, Jerry.
not_available You know where to find me? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available You sure know how to make an entrance.
not_available I was just trying to get the lay of the land.
not_available You take it too far.
not_available You should have seen me at St.
not_available Mary's.
not_available I took it all the way to a rectal.
not_available She was cuter than you, though.
not_available Look at that.
not_available You guys still using x
not_available ray film? I thought everybody was digital by now.
not_available Oh, hey.
not_available Nice job shaving my chest hair.
not_available No problem.
not_available Now, it took 24 minutes to get my vitals.
not_available Twenty
not_available four minutes.
not_available Come on.
not_available I know we can all do better than that.
not_available Yes, we can.
not_available Yes, we can.
not_available It's totally what I think.
not_available Archie Morris, chief resident.
not_available It usually takes me about 10 minutes to figure out who the kiss
not_available ass is.
not_available At least we're breaking records somewhere, huh? Now, the EKG was prompt, but the resident's evaluation was sloppy.
not_available You know we were busy.
not_available It's always busy, it's always chaos, always out of control.
not_available I know you don't have enough hours to spend with every patient.
not_available But our job is efficiency and excellence.
not_available We're marksmen.
not_available We hone in on what's important, hit our target with one shot and move on.
not_available We should call Psych on this guy.
not_available And who are you? Abby Lockhart.
not_available R
not_available 2.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Weaver was talking to me about you.
not_available I'd like to say it was all good, but it wasn't.
not_available Can we start by clearing this stuff? 
not_available Okay, in Trauma 1, we have Grease board? God, I haven't seen one of these since the '80s.
not_available That's pretty cool.
not_available Look, unless anybody has any objections, I prefer walking rounds.
not_available We all learn.
not_available Okay? Let's go.
not_available He's kind of hot.
not_available I thought you had a boyfriend.
not_available He's at war, and so are my hormones.
not_available Come in.
not_available How are you? This toothbrush feels like a hundred
not_available pound weight.
not_available Well, it's normal after such prolonged bed rest.
not_available Please tell me you brought rocky road and a cheeseburger.
not_available I just came by to test your muscle tone again.
not_available So no fries? Well, at least you're not Dr.
not_available Schulansky.
not_available He brings tours here like I'm a freak from the wild animal park.
not_available He's excited that you're awake.
not_available She's alive.
not_available She's alive.
not_available Squeeze my hand.
not_available Okay.
not_available That feels a little stronger than last week.
not_available Try to lift up your leg.
not_available That's good.
not_available Very good.
not_available Well, it's more than you could do the last time.
not_available That's thanks to three hours a day with Helga, the therapist from hell.
not_available Well, I see you had some visitors.
not_available Yeah, that was my best friend from college.
not_available I haven't seen her since graduation.
not_available I asked her for a joint and she brought me a teddy bear.
not_available Good for her.
not_available The last thing you need is anything interfering with your recovery.
not_available I need, heh, to take the edge off.
not_available Waking up and finding out that your mom's dead, your fiancé's MIA and you've literally slept through your 20s, it's just a little stressful.
not_available Has Dr.
not_available Schulansky said anything about the accident? All I know is you and your mom were driving and there was some kind of traffic collision.
not_available Yeah, that much I remember.
not_available We were on our way for my final fitting for my wedding dress.
not_available It was strapless with a tulle skirt.
not_available I wouldn't even let Jason see it.
not_available Your fiancé? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Have you spoken to him? Oh.
not_available That would fall under the heading of "Scared as hell, don't know how to do that one." Lowered tidal volume of 6 cc's per kilo decreased mortality from 40 percent to 31 percent.
not_available You twirl a knob, you're gonna save a life.
not_available Okay? All right, let's go.
not_available Those are cool shoes, man.
not_available Are they Adidas? Get laid, Morris.
not_available Boris Nadinovitz, presenting with fever, lymphadenopathy and night sweats.
not_available No obvious source.
not_available Ya bolen, doctor.
not_available So, what's your diagnostic approach? Skin test for TB and cocci histo? Good, good, good.
not_available Dorsey Watson.
not_available Greg Pratt.
not_available Man, what's it been, like five years? Six.
not_available I was in second year when you graduated.
not_available Wow.
not_available So, what are you doing here? 
not_available I work here.
not_available What's your excuse? I heard you were in Winnetka doing lipo on rich chicks.
not_available Still am, man.
not_available Still am.
not_available But one of my patients got a half
not_available price tummy tuck from a hack, landed upstairs.
not_available Hey, killer, come on.
not_available We got patients to clear.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I gotta roll, man.
not_available Hey, do your thing.
not_available I'll holler at you before I go.
not_available Definitely.
not_available Be relaxed.
not_available Try to sound calm.
not_available It will be weird for him at first.
not_available You think? 
not_available It's ringing.
not_available Okay, take a deep breath.
not_available What's going on? Oh! Hi.
not_available Is this Jason Clark's house? She's calling her fiancé.
not_available Blaire Collins.
not_available I'm an old friend of his from the Art Institute.
not_available She's doing great.
not_available I'm amazed by her progress.
not_available I've been trying to help her for over four years and all of a sudden, this.
not_available Yeah, it's really me.
not_available What were you treating her with? Most recently, an experimental cocktail.
not_available Fluoxetine, Sinemet and dextroamphetamine.
not_available Is she still on them? 
not_available Not anymore.
not_available I know.
not_available It's weird.
not_available She's asked me about what happened, how she got hurt.
not_available Um I think it's better not to talk to her about it yet.
not_available Is there something she shouldn't know? The accident was violent, to say the least.
not_available Blaire and her mother were carjacked.
not_available Her mom was raped.
not_available And shot? Blaire tried to fight and was pistol
not_available whipped.
not_available They would have killed her, but someone pulled up.
not_available Still, she has the right to know.
not_available She's in a fragile state.
not_available Telling her could set her back.
not_available Let's get her healthy first.
not_available She needs to hear this from someone close to her.
not_available She has no family.
not_available She'll be told, doctor.
not_available All in good time.
not_available A 22year
not_available old female presenting with recurring headaches.
not_available No history of migraine
not_available Right.
not_available But there is a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
not_available They usually take out a bunch of spinal fluid.
not_available We don't do that anymore.
not_available We don't? 
not_available No.
not_available Now that we know that llH is caused by sagittal sinus thrombosis resulting in a decreased CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid sinuses.
not_available I didn't know that.
not_available Heparin is the treatment of choice.
not_available Here you go, doc.
not_available I'm just gonna place a drop in your eye.
not_available Lean back.
not_available She still needs an LP for diagnosis.
not_available Hey, hey, not so fast, not so fast.
not_available Annals of Emergency Medicine, May 2000.
not_available 2000? Five? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Three? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Four? Ten points for the winner.
not_available Intraocular pressure correlates with intracranial pressure.
not_available Fifty
not_available four.
not_available Diagnosis made, and you don't get a spinal tap.
not_available Abby, Oncology's on the phone.
not_available If you ever say he's hot again, I'll kneecap you.
not_available Some patient of yours is freaking out.
not_available In Oncology? Mm
not_available hm.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Stephanie Lowenstein.
not_available She's upset because we couldn't do the reconstruction.
not_available Why not? 
not_available They found an enlarged lymph node.
not_available We told her pathology isn't back, but she won't listen.
not_available She says it's all your fault.
not_available She smashed the mirror.
not_available Stephanie.
not_available I don't want you here.
not_available I just wanna help.
not_available You call this helping? This is not helping.
not_available Okay, I understand how you feel.
not_available You have no idea how I feel.
not_available Miss Lowenstein, wait.
not_available You just have to let the doctors get the results back from the tests.
not_available We'll figure out how to proceed.
not_available To do what? To cut me up some more? To hell with your damn tests.
not_available Stephanie, listen to me, please.
not_available Just listen.
not_available You ruined me.
not_available I know you're scared.
not_available Is that what I am? Just because they found a node doesn't mean you have cancer.
not_available I need a cab.
not_available Where's a cab? You need to come inside and let us treat you.
not_available I have money.
not_available Where's my stupid book? Listen to me.
not_available Everything you're feeling right now is normal.
not_available It's just gonna take time.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Who's gonna marry someone who could need chemo for 10 years? Someone who could die before the kid goes to high school? If they had trouble making a diagnosis, it may not be cancer.
not_available And if it is, because you had the surgery, they caught it early.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available You did what you had to do and it was incredibly brave.
not_available Then why do I feel like this? 
not_available Because it's scary.
not_available It's scary, but you don't have to go through this alone.
not_available Get the hell away from me.
not_available Stephanie, please.
not_available Just let me take care of those cuts.
not_available Just come inside with me and Stephanie, please.
not_available I've tried all the Internet dating sites.
not_available I rewrote my profile so many times, you would have thought it was my thesis.
not_available What happened to Lou? 
not_available I liked Lou.
not_available Ah.
not_available I don't think he could handle this.
not_available He said he would come back after the surgery, but I never liked Lou.
not_available Guy's a jerk.
not_available It's a good thing you found out early.
not_available I don't wanna freeze my eggs or buy milk on the Internet.
not_available I wanted to breastfeed.
not_available This is a little bit of Neosporin.
not_available Aren't you afraid you'll wind up the auntie? Be forced to adopt some kid from Cambodia? I think Cambodian kids are cute.
not_available You know what I meant.
not_available Stephanie, if all goes well, you'll get the reconstruction.
not_available You'll have an uneventful recovery and a perfectly normal life.
not_available That's doctor talk.
not_available You don't get it.
not_available My mother's sister died of breast cancer.
not_available So did my grandmother.
not_available And you? I have never even had a mammogram.
not_available Tony Dejesus, single stab wound to the neck, vitals stable, good airway.
not_available Hey, having trouble breathing? No.
not_available Time of arrival, 1442.
not_available Was this gangrelated? 
not_available My old lady stabbed me.
not_available Why did she do that? 
not_available Because she's a psycho bitch.
not_available Where are my residents? This is a great case.
not_available Get my residents.
not_available Hey, who are these clowns? We are not putting on a show for you.
not_available What the hell is wrong with you? Get the hell out of here.
not_available The woman who answered Jason's phone was his wife.
not_available Six years is a long time.
not_available Ha.
not_available You know, the thing that's so hard about all of this is that everything has just gone on and I still feel like Jason and I were just finalizing our wedding list yesterday.
not_available I'm sure he stayed by you as long as he could.
not_available He came by twice.
not_available Schulansky told me.
not_available No wonder he wanted us to write our own vows.
not_available He probably planned on omitting the whole "in sickness and in health" part.
not_available Did you want him to spend the rest of his life hoping for something everyone said wouldn't happen? Maybe I can be his mistress.
not_available Which anatomic landmarks define zone two of the neck? The cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible.
not_available Very, very, very good.
not_available Because management of zone two injuries is very controversial.
not_available Actually, some people advocate surgical exploration for everything.
not_available I'm pretty sure surgeons would not wanna explore an asymptomatic patient with a superficial wound.
not_available Can you guys hurry up? My old lady's gonna burn my truck.
not_available Maybe next time, you won't double dip at your mom'sin
not_available law.
not_available You seen my wife's mother? 
not_available Then don't criticize.
not_available My bad.
not_available I'm sure you guys are aware of all the indications for immediate exploration.
not_available Right, Dr.
not_available Morris? Airway compromise, severe hemorrhage or expanding hematoma.
not_available He has none of those.
not_available Good, so then let me go.
not_available Right, but we can always learn from every case, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Talk to me about management with neck injuries.
not_available What? 
not_available Brother, keep it short.
not_available Don't go Al Sharpton on his ass.
not_available Duplex scan, endoscopy, gastrograffin swallow which you would only do if he had symptoms.
not_available Well, slow your roll, bro because what proportion of zone two vascular injuries are asymptomatic? Dr.
not_available Rasgotra? With a significant injury, he might have signs of bleeding or a hematoma.
not_available The guy is stable.
not_available Maybe, maybe.
not_available But nine in a hundred times, asymptomatic patients have lesions that require surgical repair.
not_available How about that, Dr.
not_available Pratt? How about that? Talk to me now.
not_available You know what? How about I go check on my asthma patient in Curtain 2? There's no asthma patient in Curtain 2.
not_available Yeah, well, maybe he went out for a smoke.
not_available I'll go find him.
not_available Yes, Eve, I did.
not_available I put up the sanitizer.
not_available No, I didn't hand out pens.
not_available I am putting up the poster as we speak.
not_available Yes, that special tape that won't ruin the walls.
not_available Okay, bye
not_available bye.
not_available Don't tell me.
not_available Eve? It's her day off and she still calls in.
not_available Here.
not_available She wants everyone's hands to be sanitized before they touch a patient.
not_available "Scrub or rub"? It sounds kinky.
not_available We should be so lucky.
not_available Heh
not_available heh.
not_available I was thinking we could get something to eat.
not_available You know, maybe catch a movie or something.
not_available No, I haven't seen that one yet.
not_available All right, cool.
not_available I'll meet you out front.
not_available Hey.
not_available How are you doing, Greg? What, you're stalking me now? No.
not_available I'm here for a sick friend.
not_available Sure you don't have another illegitimate kid up in there? We need to talk.
not_available What are you doing after work? I've got a date.
not_available With Olivia Evans? Nice girl.
not_available I've known her since she was in high school.
not_available That's great.
not_available What about tomorrow? Maybe we can have dinner.
not_available You like gumbo? I know a great place on King Drive.
not_available And down the street, there's a cat with a pool hall
not_available Listen, we're not eating any gumbo together or playing pool.
not_available All right? Then what would you like to do? I would like for you to leave me alone.
not_available For real.
not_available We're done.
not_available Okay.
not_available You don't wanna have anything to do with me.
not_available What about your little brother? 
not_available Don't use him like that.
not_available He'd like to get to know you, Greg.
not_available He just met me.
not_available I don't know what your mother told you about me.
not_available But I have an idea it wasn't everything.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available I could explain 
not_available but only if you give me the time.
not_available I do not have the time.
not_available I'm trying here.
not_available Then stop.
not_available Fine.
not_available If you wanna drop it forever, that's your call.
not_available But you'll have to live with it.
not_available Your choice.
not_available I never got the whole marriage talk from my mom.
not_available But the moment that I told her that Jason proposed, she pulled out this trunk.
not_available She had every detail of my wedding planned.
not_available It was crazy.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Stop, stop.
not_available She wasn't gonna pressure you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She wanted it to be special.
not_available Which way is Lake Michigan? That way.
not_available You can see it from the other side of the hospital.
not_available Can we go? 
not_available I shouldn't even have you out.
not_available Please? 
not_available No.
not_available Come on.
not_available What does a girl have to do to get a break with you? I hope Clemente doesn't become chief of the department.
not_available You liked him.
not_available I did until I had to present.
not_available Patient doesn't have flesh
not_available eating bacteria now but what symptoms might he have? Is that muscle spasm in the jaw? Acute tetanus? I'm all for teaching, but this guy doesn't stop.
not_available Yeah, he's annoying.
not_available You said you liked his bloody shoes, you wanker.
not_available Just because he's annoying, doesn't mean I can't like his shoes.
not_available Are you going to Ray's gig? 
not_available To hell with Ray.
not_available He's upstairs having a blast.
not_available Jerry, it's Ray.
not_available Save me.
not_available I'm bored stiff.
not_available Try picturing every woman up there naked.
not_available That always works for me.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available Are there any drug cases down there? Couple of traumas rolling in.
not_available Lola Simon, 7year
not_available old with crush injury.
not_available BP 70 palp.
not_available What crushed her? 
not_available Your next patient.
not_available Move your legs for me.
not_available Sevenyear
not_available old girl, no sign of drugs.
not_available Yeah! I'm king of the world! Looks like you forgot how to fly, king.
not_available Tommy Bonetti, stood up on the TiltA
not_available Whirl at the St.
not_available Ignatius fair.
not_available Is he on drugs? 
not_available He might have just hit his head.
not_available Sounds like drugs.
not_available I'm on my way down.
not_available Move away from the light.
not_available We're trying to take care of you, man.
not_available You look like an alien.
not_available Don't probe me.
not_available Please sedate him.
not_available I have to assess his neural status first.
not_available Taking the HemoCue.
not_available Process the spinal films before you take the rest.
not_available Hey, I'm rolling out, man.
not_available What, you scared of a little blood? 
not_available Squeeze my hand.
not_available Systolic's 65.
not_available All right, no fluid in the abdomen.
not_available Pericardium is clear.
not_available Looks like spinal shock with a high thoracic injury.
not_available Am I right? I'm way out of my league, man.
not_available Don't you remember Bartlett's lecture on blunt trauma? Sweetie, listen, I'm gonna poke you.
not_available Tell me when you feel this.
not_available Start dopamine at 5 mics, Sensory level at T4.
not_available How you doing, Lola? 
not_available That's a big bug.
not_available You just killed our mascot.
not_available Here she goes.
not_available Log roll.
not_available Keep her on the backboard.
not_available Suction.
not_available Look, some of the old U of I crew's are hooking up at Cherry Red tonight.
not_available You got plans? 
not_available Pratt, we need you in here.
not_available I'm gonna try to roll through.
not_available Pratt, now.
not_available Go see what's up.
not_available I'll intubate.
not_available You don't stay still, I'll put this needle through your heart.
not_available Can we sedate and paralyze? 
not_available He took his IV out.
not_available Since when did Alfred E.
not_available Neuman become a doctor? 
not_available What about I.
not_available M.
not_available Versed? 
not_available Gave him five.
not_available It's not touching him.
not_available What did he take? 
not_available Maybe ice, coke.
not_available Tracheal 140.
not_available What the hell are you on? 
not_available Her in a minute.
not_available I can't find the vein.
not_available How about Haldol? 
not_available No, he could seize.
not_available Morris, let me try the line.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Go ahead, push the sux.
not_available This guy's unstable as hell.
not_available We can't get a line.
not_available I'm tied up.
not_available We need help.
not_available You gotta get Clemente.
not_available Is there another Attending on? 
not_available Clemente's the only one.
not_available No, we can handle this ourselves.
not_available I'll do a femoral cutdown.
not_available Are you serious? 
not_available He needs access.
not_available Pulse keeps going up.
not_available Mix up esmolol, slow down his rate.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available We got sugar in here? Oh, wow, we got a trauma.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Pager's probably not working.
not_available No, my pager's working.
not_available Twenty
not_available foot fall complicated by unknown intoxication.
not_available What are you guys doing? 
not_available A femoral cutdown.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa, everybody take a deep breath.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available Get my briefcase under admit.
not_available Banana cheese.
not_available Yeah, banana cheese.
not_available What did he take? 
not_available He won't say.
not_available Tachy with mydriasis.
not_available My guess is sympathomimetic.
not_available Bad, bad guess.
not_available Skin and membranes are dry.
not_available It's an anticholinergic.
not_available Electrolytes back yet? Right here.
not_available Hyperchloremia.
not_available Anion gap is minus four.
not_available How could that be? Skittles, people, skittles.
not_available Very popular with the kids these days.
not_available It's cold pills with dextromethorphan hydrogen bromide.
not_available The lab analyzer thinks bromide is chloride.
not_available You get a reversal of the gap.
not_available Aaah! Anything to calm him down? Two mics of I.
not_available M.
not_available physostigmine.
not_available He still needs access.
not_available Here you go.
not_available I'm Rick James, bitch.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available Go to your happy place, son.
not_available What time did the chem panel come back? He's got weird anatomy.
not_available We couldn't find the subclavian.
not_available There it is, there it is.
not_available Right there.
not_available See, the probe allows us to cannulate the vein under direct visualization.
not_available That's very cool.
not_available You carry that with you all the time? 
not_available It's just a demo.
not_available I ran the phase
not_available three trials.
not_available Beautiful, beautiful.
not_available It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
not_available Heart rate's down to 80.
not_available I guess we didn't need the beta blockers, did we? I trust you guys can finish without me.
not_available No problem, boss.
not_available Hey.
not_available Even if you think I'm a pain in the ass it should never get in the way of patient care.
not_available You with me? Good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lockhart? Hey.
not_available What's up? Well, everything.
not_available And almost twice a day.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available I hear you're getting out today.
not_available If you thought it stunk to work here, try being a patient.
not_available By the way, thanks for the date.
not_available She told you? 
not_available I had to pay her.
not_available It was supposed to be a freebie.
not_available Just the first time.
not_available Initially, it kind of turned me off when I learned that she was a professional.
not_available But then when I thought about it, it turned me on.
not_available We're both professionals.
not_available So you didn't need me after all.
not_available Well, I guess not.
not_available Hey.
not_available I don't remember your name.
not_available Abby.
not_available And you're a little late, Lou.
not_available I came to see how Stephanie was doing.
not_available She had her breasts removed.
not_available Pick up a pink ribbon on your way out.
not_available What? She did? 
not_available Yeah, she did.
not_available What are you talking about? Stephanie says you disappeared on her.
not_available She told the nurse not to let me in.
not_available And every time I called, she wouldn't say why she was here and kept going on about how she couldn't handle dating anyone right now.
not_available Why would she do that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available All I know is I can't stop thinking about her.
not_available And I'm a little worried.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available Do it, do it, do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available Oh, damn it.
not_available Do you have a moment? You should really consider getting one of these.
not_available It might keep you from hacking up the patients.
not_available I'm sorry I didn't call you in earlier.
not_available Bonetti's gone up to the ICU.
not_available We've got to consider preemptive orders.
not_available It was really unprofessional of me.
not_available Nurses transporting patients? What a waste of resources.
not_available Are you listening to me? 
not_available Actually, no.
not_available I lost.
not_available Okay, look.
not_available A femoral cutdown has to be a lastditch effort in a peri
not_available arrest patient.
not_available And skittles boy wasn't quite there yet.
not_available Well, I thought he was.
not_available Oh, you thought he was.
not_available Look, I know.
not_available I was a resident too, I thought I had the keys to the kingdom.
not_available But the great thing is that we can always learn.
not_available That's why I'm here.
not_available Well, sometimes you wanna do it yourself.
not_available Sometimes your ego does, but the patient would rather that I do it.
not_available Believe me.
not_available You're right.
not_available You know what? It's not about being right.
not_available Okay, look, I consider you, Pratt, Morris, every resident, every student here an investment in the future.
not_available My dividend comes when something that I've taught you saves a life.
not_available That's it.
not_available You should really consider surgery as an elective.
not_available Well, why do you say that? Because you're quick to cut and you like to use a scalpel more than your brain.
not_available Come in.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hey.
not_available I brought you some company.
not_available Lou.
not_available I heard what happened.
not_available Hi.
not_available Come in.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Chocolate.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'd like to schedule an outpatient mammogram.
not_available Sure.
not_available Patient's name? Abby Lockhart.
not_available First you missed morning rounds and now they tell me you're avoiding Poison Control.
not_available No, I got stuck with a consult.
not_available Look, a bunch of Zen monks made tea from this plant in their garden.
not_available Now they have vomiting, diarrhea.
not_available Some are tachycardic, some bradycardic, some hypotensive, some hypertensive.
not_available Not a clear toxidrome.
not_available I haven't identified this on the Internet.
not_available I even sent digital photos to the Botany Department, but It's not jimsonweed, not foxglove, not oleander.
not_available Well, maybe it's tabaco gigante.
not_available You know something? You may be right.
not_available I saw this once in Mexico.
not_available It's a tobacco plant.
not_available Your patients have nicotine toxicity.
not_available Oh.
not_available Good call.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available Why are my research assistants sitting in the waiting area? The parking garage is too cold? They're collecting data for me.
not_available The looky
not_available loos were getting in the way of the work.
not_available Then you just tell them to step back.
not_available I didn't wanna overstep.
not_available Maybe that should come from you.
not_available Overstep? You pulled the plug on my study.
not_available Look.
not_available I meant it as more as a time
not_available out kind of thing.
not_available You told them that my study was useless.
not_available Look, I know what happened in Newark.
not_available And I really do not want a repeat here, okay? All right, look.
not_available Bottom line, you hired me to make this place more efficient.
not_available And that's what I am trying to do.
not_available And if and when we start bedside registration is gonna make your study
not_available I don't know, irrelevant? I've got a $ 100,000 grant that says that it won't.
not_available You've got $ 100,000, why don't we go digital? Listen, I run this hospital.
not_available If we start bedside registration, that goes through me.
not_available If you put my students on a time
not_available out, that goes through me.
not_available If you wanna wash the floors differently, that goes through me.
not_available Do I make myself clear? I got one more question for you.
not_available Does my answer go through you? My mom loved seeing the lake.
not_available Look at the water.
not_available At least some things stay the same.
not_available We should really get back.
not_available Have you always been such a worrier? I've always had things to worry about.
not_available Do you think this was God? What? Me waking up.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You think it was science, don't you? I've seen deeply religious people come into the hospital.
not_available Prayer did nothing for them.
not_available And then I've seen plenty of skeptics experience miraculous recoveries.
not_available So you think it was fate? I think I'm glad we're both here able to wonder about it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available How you gonna punk me like that? What's up, little man? You know where Olivia is? 
not_available Yeah, she's down the hall.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I hear you, fellows.
not_available But you sound like a bunch of knuckleheads.
not_available Hey, all I'm saying is, you can't feel nothing with no jimmy on.
not_available Get used to them.
not_available There's no alternative.
not_available Getting a girl pregnant is 18 years of lockdown.
not_available Half your check going to Uncle Sam.
not_available The other half going to your kid and? 
not_available The baby's mama? And what happens if you miss a child support payment? Who's gonna be blowing up your pager? My baby's mama.
not_available Having a kid at your age ain't what you wanna do.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Do you miss Croatia? I have family there.
not_available But there are more opportunities for me here.
not_available I like Chicago.
not_available Except the winter sucks.
not_available Yeah, you can always go inside and warm up.
not_available You know how I keep asking you about the accident? It's because I keep having these flashes that don't add up.
not_available What kind of flashes? I remember being scared.
not_available We had just gotten coffee and I remember seeing my mom's face.
not_available Her eyes were petrified.
not_available And I hear her screams, but her screams are muffled by the radio and there's blood and laughter.
not_available Lots of laughter, and at first I thought it was just a dream but the images are so vivid.
not_available They're so clear.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Something else happened that night.
not_available And not knowing what it is is killing me.
not_available But I need the truth.
not_available Blaire.
not_available I want to be out Figure it 
not_available Blaire? Come on, Blaire.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Hey, I need a monitored bed.
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Page Schulansky in Neurology.
not_available Hey, I'm Dr.
not_available Clemente.
not_available So, what's the problem? She's not talking.
not_available Get me an Accu
not_available Chek, a HemoCue and a pulse ox.
not_available She doesn't need that.
not_available Can we have her friend wait outside? 
not_available I'm not her friend.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Kovac, one of our Attendings.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available I'm sorry, I had no clue.
not_available Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? 
not_available Her name's Blaire.
not_available Can you hear me? 
not_available Schulansky's at the VA.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Gaze is fixed to the right.
not_available I need a CBC, chem panel and a head CT.
not_available No, she needs fluoxetine, Sinemet and dextroamphetamine.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available Abby, run up to the pharmacy and get the meds.
not_available There's an approach dealing with altered mental status.
not_available This is not a standard patient.
not_available She's been on experimental cocktail.
not_available Abby, fluoxetine, Sinemet and dextroamphetamine.
not_available Abby, please go.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available I need some help.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's up? Fluoxetine, Sinemet, dextroamphetamine.
not_available Yeah, write it up.
not_available Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy? You can't go back here.
not_available Crit's fine.
not_available Sodium and potassium are normal.
not_available I told you that.
not_available CT is ready.
not_available Okay, let's move her now.
not_available She needs the meds.
not_available We could be missing a brain bleed or a mass effect.
not_available I know.
not_available We don't have time to screw around.
not_available The meds woke her up from the coma.
not_available If they did, we'd have coma patients waking up everywhere.
not_available All I know is they worked for her.
not_available Got them.
not_available You're not gonna actually let him do this? Are you confident these meds are gonna work? If not, there's gonna be a tall guy in a cheap suit from the state asking questions.
not_available It's worth a try, Kerry.
not_available Right.
not_available Hold the scanner.
not_available I'll give him five minutes.
not_available You know what? Don't sweat it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, you're the physician of record.
not_available I'm not on the chart when the family sues.
not_available Well, I'm in luck.
not_available There is no family.
not_available And fluoxetine in at 2019.
not_available Let's get her up to CT.
not_available As soon as I get a portable monitor.
not_available Blaire? Blaire? Eyes opening to pain.
not_available Incomprehensible verbal activity.
not_available You got a GCS of 2, 2, 4.
not_available Check her gag.
not_available Whoa.
not_available She's seizing.
not_available Two mics of Ativan now.
not_available One hundred percent oxygen, non
not_available rebreather.
not_available She has a history of seizures? 
not_available No.
not_available Well, any of the meds you pushed could have caused this.
not_available So could falling drug levels, so could withdrawal.
not_available Another round of Ativan.
not_available Heh.
not_available I really liked that last one.
not_available Is it new? Yeah.
not_available It's called " Blood Wine." Oh, "Blood Wine." How did you think of that? I cut my finger opening a bottle of merlot.
not_available So you and your friend headed home? I don't know what she's doing.
not_available Do you know what you're doing? 
not_available Yeah, I know what I'd like to do.
not_available Hold that thought.
not_available I'll settle with the boys.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Yo, Ray.
not_available You guys are late.
not_available We were the opening act.
not_available Clemente had us pull journal articles to justify the treatment of every patient.
not_available You wanna get something to eat? 
not_available I have plans.
not_available Do your plans have friends? Let's see.
not_available Zoe.
not_available Yes? 
not_available This is my boy, Archie.
not_available What up, ladies? You guys hungry? 
not_available We wanna meet the band.
not_available I play drums.
not_available Yeah, I'm serious.
Like That's my marching band.
not_available We won the nationals.
not_available Turning into pooh, pooh, pooh, and then we Guys? Ray! Blaire? Blaire, open your eyes.
not_available Maybe she's postictal.
not_available Or the Ativan didn't wear off.
not_available Or I shouldn't have pushed the meds.
not_available You don't know why she had a seizure.
not_available Maybe we overloaded her sinuses.
not_available Luka, there is no way to know why she fell back into this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I have to go.
not_available Are you okay? The state conservator agreed to admit Blaire to the hospital for two days to see if there's any improvement.
not_available If not, she'll go back to the nursing home.
not_available I could have been a doctor But why poetry? Why I? Why me? Why I? I could have been a lawyer But why poetry? Poetry.
not_available Why? Poetry.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where's our waitress? 
not_available To hell with her.
not_available What do you want? Uh Light beer.
not_available Lipo doctor's scared of getting handles.
not_available Don't hate.
not_available I look good.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hey, what's up, bro? I'll get two beers, one light.
not_available You want something? 
not_available A conversation would be cool.
not_available You haven't said anything to me.
not_available We can barely hear.
not_available You could hear everyone just fine.
not_available What did I do, Greg? 
not_available Tell me what I did.
not_available You should've told me he was in there.
not_available You want me to survey the building? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Look, he's down there helping those kids.
not_available And who sews up those kids once they leave your place? Your father tries to help them before they get to you.
not_available I see.
not_available Charlie Pratt may be a lot of things.
not_available But he's not my father, my dad or my pops.
not_available He's just a guy who got my mom pregnant.
not_available So basically, he made the same mistake he's warning those kids about.
not_available Greg, wait.
not_available Uh
not_available You wanna hate him, I can't stop you, but Charlie's a good guy.
not_available Twenty hours a week with the kids, runs a basketball league 
not_available rehab houses for poor people.
not_available Yeah, see, that's the problem.
not_available I've waited my whole life to spit in my old man's face.
not_available He's not lying in the gutterPeople change, Greg
not_available He's building houses for people for free.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Greg.
not_available Blaire, I hope you can hear me.
not_available On that night, you and your mom were driving.
not_available You stopped at a red light.
not_available Another car pulled up next to you.
not_available There were three men inside.
not_available They pulled a gun and dragged your mom
