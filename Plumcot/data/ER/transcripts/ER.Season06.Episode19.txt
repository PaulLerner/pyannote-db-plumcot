not_available Such a fuss.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't worry, the ICU will take good care of you.
not_available I know.
not_available They did last time after my operation.
not_available You were here for an operation? For what? Oh, dear, let me think.
not_available What was it called, Ralph? Gee, I'm not sure.

not_available The infield fly rule is when the batter hits the ball and it goes way high up, you know, like over the pitcher's mound the guy on 2nd must go to 3rd before the guy on 1st can go.
not_available I thought they're not supposed to run on a fly ball.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available You don't have any idea what the infield fly rule is, do you? Can we go now? I mean, you may have a new used car, but I don't.
not_available My first vehicle was a tractor.
not_available A tractor? Yeah.
not_available My grandpa's farm.
not_available He let me drive when I was about 11, 12.
not_available Till I took out some fences and one of his cows.
not_available Was your dad a farmer too? 
not_available He was a train conductor.
not_available I'd ride on his lap when I was little.
not_available Sometimes my brother and I would go all the way to Zagreb with him.
not_available We'd run through the cars, looking at the passengers, 
thinking "My father drives the train." You spent a lot of time with your dad? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did you come here a lot with your father? Learn about baseball? Why? Because I know so much?

not_available We gonna buy a car or not? 
not_available We're going to buy a car.

not_available I love being out on the water.
not_available Sometimes in the middle of the night you get a storm.
not_available Thirty
not_available foot waves coming in different directions.
not_available Rocking and rolling like you wouldn't believe.
not_available Still, it puts you to sleep like a little baby.
not_available I'd wake up at dawn, go out to the tip of the bow and the water would be clear and calm.
not_available Ships slicing through it like cool air.
not_available Calmest place on earth, I used to think.
not_available Like the storm never even happened.

not_available No.
not_available Mom, I want to stay.
not_available She's a child.

not_available I don't care about him or anything to do with him! 
not_available Mom, calm down.
not_available Don't tell me to calm down.
not_available Please, leave.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Lomax, if you could just
not_available I asked you to leave.

not_available You're enjoying this.
not_available Now, here we go.
not_available Special deal.
not_available Very low price.
not_available $3300.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It's a Dodge Dynasty.
not_available 1989.
not_available Good year.
not_available And only 90,000 miles.
not_available It's a Dodge Dynasty.
not_available Okay, it's not your thing.
not_available How about a '91 Mercury Sable for $2900.
not_available What more could you want? Four doors, windshield wipers, antenna 
not_available Hey, Malucci.
not_available Yeah, chief? Come here.
not_available Your little runaway is hiding down the hall.
not_available What's he doing? 
not_available Spying on me.
not_available Get him back to Exam Two.
not_available We're treating her with antibiotics.
not_available But her oxygen level is low.
not_available Pneumonia can be a peaceful way for an elderly person to die.
not_available We don't want her to die! 
not_available She'll fall asleep, stop breathing.
not_available There's no pain or suffering.
not_available Can she put her on a breathing machine? It may be best for nature to take its course.
not_available Last month I saw her sit up and eat.
not_available She stopped eating a while ago according to the nursing home.
not_available She's being fed through a tube now, directly to her stomach.
not_available We can't just let Grandma die.

not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available No.
not_available I keep having these thoughts.
not_available It's like I see moments of the accident.
not_available Something reminds me.
not_available Accident? I'd call it an attack.
not_available A brutal attack for which you had no warning.
not_available Right.
not_available Well, that's the thing.
not_available See, I assisted on the spinal tap on Paul Sobriki.
not_available And he was aggressive.
not_available And he was overreacting.
not_available And he'd had Ativan.
not_available And I numbed him with lidocaine.
not_available But his response was as if we were stabbing him.
not_available In his mental state, he thought you were.
not_available I should've realized something was very wrong.
not_available So should have Lucy, but she didn't either, did she? There's always "what ifs." What if I did the psych consult sooner? It'd be easy to see it as an accident.
not_available But we can't.
not_available I know.
not_available I just want to get these thoughts out of my head.
not_available It'll take some time.
not_available Have you seen him? 
not_available Paul Sobriki? Have you seen him or his wife? No.
not_available You're curious about what's happening with them? No.

not_available She has no quality of life.
not_available If we intubate her, they'll take her to the ICU.
not_available Hook her up to tubes and wires and machines.
not_available And she'll die in perhaps two, three weeks.
not_available If we leave her as she is now she'll die today, maybe tomorrow but peacefully.
not_available You need to think carefully about her wants.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hemmings, your mom's letting go.
not_available You think we should do that? You should spend some time with her.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll tell you what the head CT shows.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available All right.
not_available You? I'll pack up the old man and take him for a spin.
not_available His labs and films aren't back yet.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll call the lab.
not_available You call Radiology.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, boy! 
not_available What? Remember that leukemia case? Hi, Jessamyn.
not_available Are they here? 
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Hi.
not_available They're waiting for a bed upstairs.
not_available I wanna do this.
not_available I want to help out if I can.
not_available What do I have to do? Okay, wellDid your mother drive you here? 
not_available No, I drove myself.
not_available Does she know you're here? 
not_available I'm old enough to decide.
not_available When it comes to this subject, there's no talking to Mom.
not_available So she hasn't given consent? 
not_available My dad wants this.
not_available I want this.
not_available That has to count for something.
not_available It does.
not_available It counts for a lot.
not_available But the rules are very clear.
not_available It's your mother's decision.
not_available She said she can't understand this.
not_available A life's at stake.
not_available I can't either.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Abby, let me know when those labs are back.
not_available Let's see your dad.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available He'll love that you want to do this.
not_available I don't care what he thinks.
not_available I'm only helping Delia.
not_available Good eating today.
not_available Hot dog, hamburger.
not_available French fries? Thank you.
not_available I haven't been through a drive
not_available through for so long.
not_available Would've been a pity to leave the car alone its first day.
not_available Yes, I agree.
not_available When I came to Chicago, I came here a lot to look at the city.
not_available It's so beautiful.
not_available You grow up in a city? 
not_available No, by the coast.
not_available Were you there during the war? No.
not_available Then we were in Vukovar.
not_available A small apartment.
not_available I didn't have much money.
not_available We kept the children in all the time for safety.
not_available They'd get crazy.
not_available What do you call it? 
not_available Cabin fever.
not_available I was going to the market.
not_available Not for much.
not_available Just for cheese and bread.
not_available And they were climbing all over me.
not_available "Please let me come.
not_available Let me come." The answer was the same as always.
not_available "No, it's not safe." My wife stayed with them.
not_available Luka.
not_available No, it's okay.
not_available I was just 50 meters away when I heard the whistle in the air.
not_available Artillery shell hit the building.
not_available It's all redone now.
not_available People rebuilt all during the war.
not_available One day you're in a café, the next day it's bombed.
not_available The next day, they're rebuilding.
not_available That's what you do.
not_available Something happens, you rebuild, you go on.
not_available We should go.
not_available Your mom will think you're joy riding.
not_available Hey, Randi, where is Dr.
not_available Malucci? 
not_available He was in Exam One a while ago.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, Malu
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Can I speak to you for a moment? I don't want to hear your reasons or justifications.
not_available Did you know I could fail you for that? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What are you? 
not_available I wanted to help.
not_available Her coming here was brave.
not_available What you did is stupid.
not_available Her sister will be in chemo two months before the transplant.
not_available The mother will know.
not_available She wanted to try.
not_available It's our sometimes lousy job to say no.
not_available There are rules this department must and will follow.
not_available Clear? Yes.
not_available Make sure she can drive home.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available I don't think trying to help is ever stupid.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Hope I didn't get you in trouble.
not_available I'll live.
not_available While you're here, why not see your dad? 
not_available No, I'm gonna leave.
not_available I really wish you wouldn't.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, I'm having trouble with an HMO.
not_available A 76year
not_available old guy.
not_available They want to transfer him, we should keep him here.
not_available Any EKG changes or ectopy? 
not_available No.
not_available What insurance? 
not_available Blue Beacon.
not_available We transfer their stable patients.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available His wife's in the ICU.
not_available They won't authorize it.
not_available It's best if they're together.
not_available They won't authorize it.
not_available He can't be transferred.
not_available He's dehydrated.
not_available Rehydrate him.
not_available He's hypokalemic.
not_available Replete his potassium.
not_available He's anemic.
not_available Actively bleeding? 
not_available No.
not_available It's chronic.
not_available He can go.
not_available He wants to stay with his wife.
not_available Does he want a $2000 hospital bill? All right, well, I'm leaving.
not_available I don't know if I can oversee the transfer.
not_available Then I'll do it.
not_available They were filming a Swedish movie near my grandpa's farm.
not_available They needed animals.
not_available So you just rented out cows and chickens? Sheep and horses too.
not_available My brother and I.
not_available We made a lot of money for teenagers.
not_available But it was a huge messLuka? What's happening? 
not_available I don't believe this.
not_available I'm gonna kill Herb! We didn't meet Herb! This happened when I bought mine.
not_available Herb said it was a fluke.
not_available You're telling me this now? 
not_available I can fix it.
not_available So you brought me to the water.
not_available Good boy.
not_available Good boy.
not_available It's funny, Mark.
not_available You know some years seem to pass faster than others? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This year's been the fastest.
not_available I was thinking how strange things can be.
not_available You know in all the wars I served in I never watched a man die? On some ships you get lucky.
not_available But I must have told you about that time we had an explosion at the base motor pool.
not_available When you were stationed in Guam? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I was little.
not_available Mom and I were at San Diego.
not_available You called and told Mom about it over the phone.
not_available We lost seven men.
not_available I was in the Exchange when it happened.
not_available I was looking for some shaving cream or something.
not_available Everybody scrambled out.
not_available I started to, me and a lieutenant in the aisle next to me.
not_available The shampoo section, as I recall.
not_available The next thing I know, I hear a crash.
not_available I turn and all these bottles had come flying off the shelf.
not_available And this poor son of a bitch is collapsing on the floor.
not_available He had a heart attack.
not_available What'd you do? 
not_available I screamed for help.
not_available No one came.
not_available They were all at the motor pool.
not_available I got down.
not_available I loosened his tie and unbuttoned his collar.
not_available He grabbed onto my hand begged me not to leave him.
not_available So I stayed.
not_available And I pulled him into my arms and I held him.
not_available Just the two of us.
not_available For the next four minutes I watched him die.
not_available The longest four minutes of my life.
not_available But in a crazy way four of the best minutes of my life.
not_available There was some kind of value in just being there.
not_available Thank you, Mark for bringing me out to the water.
not_available You're welcome, Dad.
not_available Sam? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Sam, I'd like you to meet my dad, David Greene.
not_available Dad, Sam MacKenzie.
not_available Sarah's husband.
not_available How do you do, sir? 
not_available What the hell? Dr.
not_available Carter tried to keep me here.
not_available It's tough with HMOs.
not_available New Western will take good care of you.
not_available Could you tell my wife I'll call as soon as I'm settled? There's no patient phones in ICU.
not_available But you can call the main number to ask how she is.
not_available Good.
not_available Thanks again for everything.
not_available My wife and I appreciate it.
not_available You're welcome, sir.
not_available How's Paul doing? He's at Chester.
not_available I guess that's the main place for Illinois.
not_available They put him on medication.
not_available What did you want to talk about? I don't know.
not_available I just keep thinking about what happened You're not the only one.
not_available Sometimes my thoughts seem as loud as the voices Paul hears.
not_available I lived with him, I slept with him.
not_available I'm about to bear his child.
not_available How could I not see it? I don't know.
not_available Keep trying! 
not_available I am trying.
not_available It's not starting.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available It'll start.
not_available "Keep trying.
not_available It'll start." 
not_available It'll start.
not_available It's not starting.
not_available It's been an otherwise really nice day.
not_available Thank you for calling.
not_available I'm sorry about all this.
not_available Where are they? Your ex is in the cafeteria.
not_available I'll take you to Jessamyn.
not_available Everybody wants this, Mrs.
not_available Lomax.
not_available A lemonade stand? Yeah.
not_available Me and my friends would set up a card table with a sign that 
says "Lemonade, 10 cents a glass." Not as lucrative as the cow trade.
not_available We rode high if we made $1.50.
not_available But less cleanup than the cow trade.
not_available True.
not_available I look forward to that with Kate and Tess when that'll be a very important thing.
not_available Wondering if they used enough sugar and when a car will drive by.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I expected the tow truck by now.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But then nothing has gone as expected today.
