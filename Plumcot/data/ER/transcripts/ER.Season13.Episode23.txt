FRANK Doesn't anybody here watch the news? Homeland Security raised our threat level to orange this morning.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available It's an election year.
not_available It means there's a severe risk of terrorist activity and the hospital is on full alert.
not_available Here.
not_available What is that? 
FRANK Emergency protocols.
not_available Biohazard preparedness plan, evacuation procedures.
not_available There's your basic guide to the apocalypse.
not_available Are we supposed to do anything differently? Keep ID handy, report anything strange or suspicious.
not_available Everything down here is strange or suspicious.
not_available Which reminds me, the new warden is here.
NEELA Moretti? 
not_available Oh, lucky you.
PRATT Yeah, right.
not_available I heard the ICU nurses used to take vacation when he was on service.
not_available Can you blame them? The guy fired half the ICU Attendings when he took over up there.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Moretti.
not_available I wish we could all go.
not_available It's probably better this way.
not_available I'll get my father settled and be back soon so we can go on that honeymoon.
not_available I don't need a honeymoon.
not_available I do.
not_available Besides, I'd like to meet your father.
not_available And Joe wants to meet his grandpa.
not_available Don't you, Joe? Unless you don't want me to meet your family because I'm hideously ugly by Croatian standards.
not_available I'll miss you both.
not_available I already do.
not_available Be good for your mom, okay? 
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'll call you when I get there.
not_available Or you could call me from the airport.
not_available Or when you land in Frankfurt.
not_available Or from the plane.
not_available Say bye to Daddy.
not_available Bye.
not_available He's been sitting there for 20 minutes.
not_available It's a little creepy, if you ask me.
not_available The guy's a burnout.
not_available That's why they sent him here.
not_available The ER is the elephant graveyard for doctors.
not_available You're an eternal ray of sunshine, Frank.
not_available Think about it.
not_available Where did they send Romano after he lost his arm? Last year, it was Clemente.
not_available Now it's this guy.
not_available Dollars to doughnuts, we find him hanging in an exam room by July.
MORRIS What are you doing here? 
not_available What, you and Kovac split up already? No, Luka's father got sick.
not_available He had to fly back to Croatia.
not_available Hope he's not flying today.
not_available Why? 
not_available Frank.
not_available What? 
not_available What's going on? 
SAM Need a doc here.
not_available Uh, what happened? 
not_available Horsing around.
not_available Put it through a glass coffee table.
not_available He lost a lot of blood.
not_available All over my carpet.
not_available Get him a room and clean him up.
ABBY All right, keep this up.
not_available Calder? That's me.
not_available Ninety
not_available eight over 56.
not_available Yeah, I always run a bit low.
not_available Do paramedic patients stop at Triage? If they're ambulatory, they can.
not_available What meds are you on? 
CALDER Enalapril, Lipitor and glyburide.
SAM You diabetic? Let's get your blood sugar.
not_available How often is your Glucometer QA'd? Every morning at 7 by the day shift.
not_available You ask a lot of questions for somebody who's in charge.
not_available Well, he's new.
not_available Blood sugar is 128.
not_available It's been worse.
not_available It's not so bad.
not_available Once we get you registered they'll make you a chart and a doctor will see you.
not_available Is that you? 
not_available Oh, no, no.
not_available Not today.
not_available I'm just a fly on the wall.
not_available Ow! 
ABBY Oh, sorry.
not_available You're through the fascia into the extensor muscles.
MORRIS That one will need layered closure.
not_available Any medical problems? Yeah, I got a detached retina.
not_available I had a run
not_available in at the local bar.
not_available I got a bad back, service
not_available related.
not_available You in the military? 
not_available Army, we did a tour in Iraq together.
not_available I decided to head to a peace rally, pick up some chicks.
MORRIS Were you three in combat? 
MAN We were.
not_available Kyle here drove a desk.
not_available Hardly, man.
not_available You can tell I'm the brains of this trio.
not_available I was with Intelligence as a translator.
not_available He taught us how to swear in Arabic.
not_available Where'd you pick that? Some missionary work in Jordan for two years after high school.
not_available Heh, heh.
not_available He's our " Stormin' Mormon.
not_available " 
ABBY Can you wiggle your fingers? 
not_available Oh, it hurts.
MORRIS Let's check the volar wounds.
MORRIS Oh.
ABBY Whoa.
not_available That would be an arterial injury.
not_available Okay, 4 milligrams morphine.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available I got one for you.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available It'll be quick.
not_available Hand through a glass table.
not_available Neurovascular? 
not_available Maybe some tendon damage.
not_available I got Moretti circling around down here like a turkey vulture.
not_available Have you heard from Ray? 
not_available He's taking some time off.
not_available He won't return my calls.
not_available I've tried even his parents.
not_available He's not at his apartment.
not_available Heard his band is back in town.
not_available Maybe he's playing rock star again.
not_available All right, does it hurt when I press? 
not_available No.
not_available All right.
not_available How about, uh? How about here? 
not_available Ah, bingo.
not_available It's bearable, though.
not_available What's in your chem panel, doctor? Lytes, BUN, creatinine, calcium, LFTs.
not_available These are liver
not_available function tests.
not_available I thought you weren't working today.
not_available Well, you make it very hard to resist, Mrs.
not_available Calder.
not_available You're cute, but he's a flirt.
not_available Are you ready to present? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available She's my supervisor.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available Type II diabetic with gastroenteritis and dehydration.
not_available Afebrile, abdomen's benign, and she's getting fluids and Compazine.
not_available Try Reglan in case it's gastroparesis and show me the labs.
not_available Okay.
ABBY Nice to meet you.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We haven't officially met yet.
not_available I'm Kevin Moretti.
not_available I'll be replacing your husband.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available No, as chief, only as chief.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm Abby Lockhart.
not_available Yes.
not_available You used to be a nurse.
not_available Yes, I was.
not_available That must give you an interesting perspective.
not_available Uh, I guess so.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Being married to one of the Attendings must prove very challenging at times.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Could use some help over here.
not_available We got Saltzman, 27, fell off a roof with his brother.
not_available Brotherin
not_available law.
not_available I landed right on his back.
not_available I think I knocked the wind out of him.
ABBY What were you doing? Just putting up a satellite dish.
not_available How tall was the building? What, like, two stories? He refused to be boarded and collared.
not_available He's all yours.
not_available Come on, let's go.
not_available Exam 3.
not_available Is, uh, he gonna wake up? Let's just take care of you first.
not_available Okay.
not_available I need to talk to him as soon as he does.
not_available Can you give our soldier guy another four of morphine? 
not_available First dose didn't touch him.
not_available There was no first dose.
not_available He's addicted to codeine.
not_available What? He's followed at the V.A.
not_available They have to be notified of all ER visits.
not_available His caseworker said he has a no
not_available narcotic contract.
not_available We can't assess injury without anesthesia.
not_available What, you want him backsliding back into addiction? Do an axillary block.
not_available A nerve block will control the pain without narcotics.
not_available I know.
not_available I was hoping to give our Resident a chance to figure it out.
not_available You've done it before? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I mean, usually it's a pain team kind of thing but it was just a couple cc's of lido in the axilla, right? Well, more like 40.
not_available I'll walk you through it.
not_available My husband was a lieutenant stationed near Mosul.
not_available What unit? He was a doctor with the 57th CSH.
not_available He's out now? No, uh, he was killed in country a little over a year ago by an IED.
not_available Sorry to hear that, ma'am.
not_available So, what's the verdict? There's a partial lac of the flexor carpi ulnaris.
not_available Needs a volar splint.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Maybe I'll see you at the rally.
not_available Maybe.
not_available And my arm still hurts like hell, doc.
not_available You gotta give me something.
not_available I got a high tolerance for pain meds because of my back.
not_available Tolerance or addiction? 
MORRIS We talked to the V.A.
not_available They told us about your contract.
not_available So, what, they said I was an addict? That's crap, man.
not_available Look, I was at Walter Reed for six weeks.
not_available I was supposed to go get physical therapy, see a pain guy.
not_available But they're so busy with amputees and guys worse off than me that the wait was like four months.
not_available Got discharged before I even got an appointment.
GATES Hey, Neela.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm just on my way home.
not_available It's been a long night.
not_available Yeah, well, no one ever told you to become a surgeon, right? Well, actually, yes, they did.
not_available A number of people.
not_available Listen, this whole thing is weird to me.
not_available I don't know how to do this.
not_available What? Break up? Yeah, you know, I know it's probably over and I deserve it but I just wondered if we could still be friends if I could maybe call you later and we could talk.
not_available Well, I might go to this rally.
not_available Kind of feel like I should.
FRANK Gates.
not_available Mr.
not_available Pollard stopped breathing.
not_available Ah, he's just holding his breath.
not_available He does that for attention.
not_available He's been holding his breath 10 minutes.
not_available I'll try to get ahold of you tomorrow? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you wiggle your fingers? Hey, Dawn, can I get some bacitracin and some sterile gauze, please? 
DAWN Take it easy, sir.
not_available Well, it looks like your brotherin
not_available law is waking up.
not_available Can I talk to him now? 
SALTZMAN What the hell? 
not_available Just relax, you're in County Hospital.
not_available You had a little fall, but you're doing okay now.
not_available Yeah, I just need a minute with him.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available In private.
not_available All right, make it quick.
not_available I'll be right back.
PAXTON Hey.
not_available Hey, hey! What's he doing here? Oh, oh, no.
not_available I can explain.
not_available No, somebody call the cops.
not_available No, this is not what you think.
not_available Your brotherin
not_available law accidentally landed on you when you two fell off the roof.
not_available What roof? He's not my brotherin
not_available law.
not_available He's got a woman tied up in his apartment.
not_available I heard her screaming.
not_available No, I can explain.
not_available No! 
not_available He beat me up.
not_available Explain it to the cops.
not_available Abby, that lady you and Gates worked? Gave her 2 liters of saline.
not_available Her pressure's down to 90/65.
not_available Oh, crap.
not_available Well? I'm listening.
not_available Okay.
not_available Are you familiar with RACK? Risk
not_available Aware Consensual Kink? No.
not_available I really need something for the pain.
not_available We gave you a nerve block.
not_available It should've kicked in by now.
not_available Well, it didn't.
not_available It's killing me.
not_available Know why they named the largest military hospital in the world after Walter Reed? No.
not_available Yellow fever was wiping out the troops during the Spanish
not_available American War and Walter Reed was the one who discovered that the disease was being transmitted by mosquitoes.
not_available And he greatly reduced infection with aggressive insect control.
not_available Of course, everybody ended up dying of cancer from the pesticides but it was a valiant effort.
not_available Excuse us.
not_available Can I talk to you for a second, Morris? 
MORRIS Maybe the injection didn't get into the sheath.
not_available I drew blood from his hand with a needle.
not_available He didn't even flinch.
not_available Well, he's a soldier.
not_available No.
not_available He's lying.
not_available He can't feel his arm.
not_available No problem with the nerve block.
not_available Think he's faking? I think he's either drug
not_available seeking or he has issues.
not_available I'll call Psych.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Not here.
not_available At the V.A.
not_available They have better continuity of care and a good support It could be months before he gets an appointment there.
not_available They're overwhelmed.
not_available Then do a hospitalto
not_available hospital transfer.
not_available They'll have to take him today.
not_available Belly's still benign.
not_available Could be an occult infection.
not_available An infection? But I feel so much better, even my nausea is gone.
not_available With diabetes, there can often be nerve damage so you can develop an abdominal condition without feeling any symptoms.
not_available She's septic? 
not_available No fever, no white count.
not_available You can't always count on those.
not_available Let's get two sets of blood cultures, start dopamine at 5 mics, CT with IV and oral contrast.
SAM Got it.
not_available More tests? Kevin Um, you're a bit of a mystery, but we're gonna figure out what's going on.
not_available I came here to get medicine to stop the vomiting.
not_available Been here for six hours.
not_available We can't risk sending you home with a serious condition.
not_available Oh, it's not serious.
not_available Do you think it could be serious? Well, I've seen a lot of doctors in here, but if you think it could be serious You're the touchstone, Kevin.
not_available Okay.
not_available We're gonna get started on these right away for you, Mrs.
not_available Calder.
not_available You're on top of this, doctor.
not_available Touchstone? What's that all about? It's a black, siliceous mineral used to test the purity of gold.
not_available The miners used to take 
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available Then you should take it as a compliment.
not_available You might turn out to be gold.
not_available Fool's gold.
not_available Yeah, pyrite.
not_available But only an expert can tell the difference.
FRANK Who's your boyfriend? 
HILARY Um, his name is Paxton.
not_available He came in with his brotherin
not_available law, I think.
FRANK And his name is? 
not_available You know what? I got this, Frank.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Hillary Milbauer.
not_available So you saw my boyfriend? I did.
not_available And you're the woman that was tied up? And gagged and screaming? That's me.
not_available All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available I told you I was just trying to defend myself.
not_available Then why didn't you call the cops? I'm not supposed to run a business out of my apartment.
not_available That's her.
not_available That's his victim.
not_available That is my girlfriend.
not_available Abby, what's going on? 
not_available This is Hillary Milbauer.
not_available These two operate an adult website out of their apartment.
not_available I already got that part from Scorsese here.
not_available He broke in and attacked us.
not_available You were screaming.
not_available I was trying to save you.
not_available It's just an act.
not_available It's like erotic performance art.
not_available Is it possible you misinterpreted the situation, Mr.
not_available Saltzman? I know what I saw.
not_available What he was doing to her was unnatural.
not_available Unsanitary.
not_available It's still throbbing.
not_available You gotta give me something for the pain.
not_available We're transferring you to the V.A.
not_available Someone there will see you.
not_available I recommend you speak with a psychiatrist.
not_available You think this is all in my head? Is that what you think? I can't get a finger out without tearing it apart, can you help me? Yeah.
not_available I'll be right back.
KYLE Why am I being punished? It's real, okay? My pain's real! 
not_available Vivian loads her own shotgun shells.
not_available My father taught me years ago.
not_available He used to pay me a penny a shell.
not_available Now I sell custom loads on the Internet.
not_available I love this country.
not_available It's wedged in there, right? 
not_available We gotta get the skin out of the spring.
GATES I'm trying to open it.
not_available I'm trying to get the Look.
not_available Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? Hang on.
not_available Kyle, you need to stay in bed.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Hey! 
MORRIS Kyle.
not_available Kyle.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Can you open it? 
not_available He took my swipe card.
MORRIS Find another one.
not_available Security! Kyle, Kyle, don't do this.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available Come on.
not_available Stop.
KYLE Leave me alone, man.
MORRIS Kyle, open this door.
GATES Hey, open the door.
MORRIS We'll get you something for the pain.
not_available Come on, don't! 
GATES Security! 
not_available Kyle, stop.
not_available Please.
not_available Come on, Kyle.
not_available Stop! 
not_available Sam! Where the hell's that key? Move away from the door.
KYLE Nobody knows more than me about pain.
SAM Move away from the door.
MORRIS Kyle! 
GATES Move, move, come on.
SAM Watch your head.
GATES Come on, spit it out, spit it out.
SAM What did he take? 
GATES You name it, he took it.
MORRIS Set up to lavage.
not_available Let's go.
not_available No.
not_available No! No! Kyle, Kyle.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Monitor, Foley, start a line.
not_available What labs do you want? 
not_available Acetaminophen and aspirin levels.
KYLE Don't, please.
not_available No, there's no point sending that now.
not_available We'll get a four
not_available hour level.
not_available Foley, alkanalize his urine and let's put in an Ewald tube.
not_available That's the plan.
not_available Just mixing up nebulized lido for the OG.
not_available No.
not_available There's no time for that.
not_available You gonna place an Ewald without anesthesia? 
not_available The thing is like a garden hose.
not_available I don't know anything! 
not_available Hard restraints, please.
MORRIS Come on.
not_available Lidocaine neb takes five minutes.
not_available Yeah, 12 percent of gastric transit time.
not_available Do you want him to get 12 percent poisoned? Twelve percent of the arrhythmia and the liver failure? I don't think so.
not_available Not when we have time to get the junk out of his stomach.
not_available Okay, okay, okay.
KYLE No.
not_available Okay, okay.
KYLE No, get off! 
MORETTl Okay.
not_available Okay.
KYLE Get away from me! 
not_available Okay, it's okay.
not_available Sir, please, we're trying to help you.
not_available Could you put a little muscle into it, please? All right.
not_available Okay.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on, screw the V.A.
not_available This guy needs fentanyl and Versed.
not_available Nope.
not_available The risk of aspiration is too high when you try to sedate during lavage.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll intubate, protect his airway.
not_available No, the risk is too high.
not_available It's not worth it.
not_available GI bleeder just puked a liter of blood.
not_available Okay, put the tube in and lavage until all the pill fragments come out and until that fluid runs clear.
not_available Please, please, please.
not_available Please.
not_available They tried to save my legs.
not_available But the The crush injuries were too severe.
not_available But it could be a lot worse, you know? I could be dead.
not_available They're gonna fit me for prosthetics as soon as the flaps heal.
not_available So I guess, in the meantime, I can pimp out my wheelchair maybe put some flames down the side.
not_available Ray.
not_available I'm gonna have a new set of legs.
not_available A cool van.
not_available Hey, I can park in the good spaces now.
not_available Ray, stop.
not_available Uh, do you want something to drink? I'm gonna get a coffee.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I'll call your parents, see if I can get an ETA.
not_available That's great.
not_available Is there anything I can do? No.
not_available Would you like me to tell anyone at County? No.
not_available I really don't want you to do anything.
not_available You know, I was so worried about you.
not_available I even went to our Your apartment.
not_available Well, it's up for a lease if you wanna move back in.
not_available No ramps.
not_available You know, the night this After you left the wedding I tried calling you because I wanted to talk.
not_available I was hoping I know.
not_available I know.
not_available I was checking the message when I got hit.
not_available So I know.
not_available How much bicarb is he getting? Two amps per liter is quarter normal at 200 per hour.
not_available Okay.
not_available Check his urine pH.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available What's going on with this guy? 
not_available Looks like textbook PTSD to me.
not_available He never saw combat.
not_available His buddies said.
not_available He was an interpreter.
not_available He saw plenty.
not_available Who do you think translates during those interrogations? I seem to have misplaced Hello, what's this? Uh, we had to intubate.
not_available I thought I specifically told you not to.
not_available Maybe I was using my inner voice again.
not_available That's a bad habit.
not_available He was just losing his gag reflex.
not_available He became hypoxic.
not_available I don't see anything about hypoxia here.
not_available Well, it was, you know, hectic.
not_available I haven't had a chance to update the chart.
not_available Do you have any pill fragments? Yeah.
not_available We, uh, did.
not_available Got this.
not_available Not enough.
SAM Gates.
not_available It's Sarah.
not_available She doesn't sound good.
not_available Move away from that, please.
not_available Can I see that? 
not_available Toxic bradycardia.
not_available We're on it.
not_available Yeah? Are you? Really? On it? Because one might argue that you are in fact underneath it.
not_available If you hadn't dicked around with the intubation you wouldn't be digging your way out of an overdose right now.
not_available Let me know when you learn to roll over.
not_available Parents coming to take you home? My mom's been here for a few days.
not_available I've never been to Baton Rouge.
not_available Maybe I could come visit you.
not_available Don't.
not_available What? Just don't tell me you're going to do something when I know you won't.
not_available Why don't you think I would come visit you? Because that's what our relationship is, Neela.
not_available You give me hope and I, like a fool, believe you.
not_available Ray, that's not true.
not_available It is true.
not_available I've waited for you.
not_available I trusted you.
not_available I fought for you.
not_available And I even fell in love with you.
not_available But for what? So you could just keep running back to Gates.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available That's what I've been trying to tell you.
not_available It's over.
not_available Tony and I are done.
not_available Well, it doesn't really matter now, does it? 
HILLARY Baby, don 't stop.
PAXTON Oh, yeah.
not_available You like that, don 't you? 
HILARY Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna spank me? 
PAXTON Yeah, I'm gonna spank you, bad girl.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available What's going on in here? 
not_available I told you it was too loud.
not_available Come here.
PAXTON Oh, yeah.
not_available What are you guys watching? Oh, it's a website hosted by a couple of our patients.
not_available Does that look consensual to you? 
not_available Oh, yeah, that's sensual.
not_available Consensual.
not_available What, did you fail anatomy? You cannot do that with your body unless you really want to.
not_available Is that woman in this hospital? 
SAM Abby.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Calder, her pressure dropped to 65 systolic.
not_available I gave orders for dopamine an hour ago.
not_available She maxed out at 20 mics.
not_available She's hypotensive? 
not_available That's impossible.
PAXTON Come on, baby.
HILARY Don 't stop, baby.
PAXTON Yeah, you like that, don 't you? How do you like that? Is that what you want? 
HILARY Oh, yeah, baby.
not_available That's good.
not_available Don 't stop.
PAXTON Yeah.
not_available You like that, don 't you? 
HILARY Am I a bad girl? You wanna spank me? You are a very bad girl.
not_available And I would love to spank you.
PAXTON Spank you.
not_available Oh, yeah, girl.
HILARY Yes! Hi, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available I didn't mean to startle you.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available I was looking up something medical.
not_available What's going on? Sorry I called you at work.
not_available I didn't know what else to do.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Where are your grandparents? 
not_available They're inside.
not_available Hey, Jim.
not_available Hey, Tony.
not_available What's going on? We're taking Sarah this weekend, remember? Yeah.
not_available So, what's with all the boxes? Helen and I think it would be best for Sarah to spend the summer with us.
not_available That's what you think? Shouldn't that be something we should talk about? 
not_available I never said I wanted to go.
not_available Sarah, you love staying with us, huh? This isn't helping.
not_available We're trying to make it easy for her.
not_available Oh, you think this is easy? 
HELEN Jim? It's okay.
not_available She doesn't want to go.
not_available We appreciate everything 
JIM Let me handle this, Helen, okay? 
not_available You know what? No.
not_available She's not going with you this weekend.
not_available Yes, Tony, she is.
not_available You can't make me.
not_available What's this? It's an emergency court order for custody.
not_available We heard you hired a lawyer.
not_available I'm calling the police.
PRATT All right, let's mix up Levophed.
ABBY Radiology is reading the CT right now.
not_available Why don't you run in another liter? Is she bleeding? 
SAM Repeat crit is 38, stable.
PRATT Could it be anaphylaxis? 
ABBY No, no new foods or drugs.
not_available She doesn't have any skin lesions.
not_available Let's do early goal
not_available directed therapy.
not_available She needs a central line with an O2 sat monitor.
not_available Is there anything else that we can be doing? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Moretti? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available We could use some help in here.
not_available Man, that guy's a real weirdo.
not_available Levophed is up.
not_available Okay, thanks a lot.
not_available No intra
not_available abdominal pathology whatsoever on the CT.
PRATT What? No abscess? 
ABBY Nope.
PRATT Diverticulitis? 
ABBY Nothing.
not_available What is going on? 
ABBY I don't know.
not_available Maybe it's an infection from another source? Urine? CSF? 
SAM Pressure's not moving, sats are dropping.
not_available Wanna intubate? Yeah, I'll tube her.
not_available Abby, you do the central line, come on.
not_available Hey, Mrs.
not_available Calder? Hang in there, okay? 
ABBY One percent lidocaine.
not_available Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.
not_available I'd wait on that Let's get the suction on high.
not_available Somebody check the cuff.
not_available Pressure is up to 110/70.
not_available Oh.
not_available Am I dying? 
not_available Not anymore.
not_available What'd you give her? Epi? No.
not_available Please.
not_available That would be too easy.
not_available What did you inject? 
not_available You tell me.
not_available Mr.
not_available And Mrs.
not_available Riley have legal custody of the girl.
not_available Raised her since she was this big.
not_available Practically my own kid.
not_available Technically, she's not, and they are the next of kin.
not_available She doesn't wanna go.
not_available Go ask her if she wants to go.
not_available She doesn't have a choice.
not_available You know what? Let's just settle down.
not_available We'll handle this like adults.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Hey, this is getting way out of hand.
not_available Settle down, sir.
not_available So you're just gonna let them take her? 
not_available Get yourself a lawyer.
not_available Try to work something out.
not_available I have a lawyer.
not_available Can I at least go say goodbye to her? Please? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, it's gonna be okay.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available Don't let them do this.
not_available It's okay, all right? I'll make sure it's okay.
not_available It's not gonna be for that long.
not_available You'll have fun.
not_available You'll ride horses.
not_available That will be good.
not_available I don't care about the stupid horses.
not_available I don't wanna go.
not_available I'll come visit you this weekend, I promise.
not_available This is not permanent.
not_available Okay? Look at me.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you more than anything in this entire world.
not_available Right? Right? Okay.
not_available So I need you to be strong for me.
not_available I need you to go with your grandparents, but you have to trust me, okay? All right.
not_available And it's not gonna be for a long time, I promise.
not_available I promise you.
not_available I love you, baby girl.
not_available Did you figure it out yet, Pratt? Huh? What I gave to Mrs.
not_available Calder? Come on.
not_available Think, think, think.
not_available Where is that intern? The one with the temper problem? The one who started all this? What, you mean Gates? He had to go.
not_available Go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Family emergency.
not_available Well, he caused an emergency here.
not_available He was the primary caregiver and dropped the ball from the get
not_available go.
not_available Come on.
not_available It was a tough call.
not_available There's enough blame to go around.
not_available Backing up your interns? That's good.
not_available Shows maturity which, based on your record I didn't think you were capable of.
not_available Bravo, Pratt.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yup.
not_available There is plenty to go around, all the way up to the Attending level.
not_available That's why I called a staff meeting.
not_available It wasn't perfect, but she's okay.
not_available She got good care.
not_available The hell she did.
not_available Let me ask you something.
not_available I mean, what's going on with you? I mean, you stand around here all day like some strange peeping Tom now all of a sudden, you're king of the ER.
not_available This is our department, Moretti.
not_available I don't care how long you've been a doctor, you haven't been here.
not_available You haven't worked with all of us.
not_available Gee, I am so sorry that I skipped my daily dose of testosterone.
not_available We do the best we can with limited resources.
not_available No.
not_available You know, see, that's where you're wrong.
not_available It is not the resources that are limited.
not_available It is the minds of the people working on the floor.
not_available Hydrocortisone.
not_available That's what you gave her.
not_available I would've gotten there if you'd given me another minute or so.
not_available Neela.
KATEY This is Jacy, Ray's mom.
not_available Oh, hello.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available No.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available Ray and I are good friends.
not_available He said you were the best roommate he ever had.
not_available Oh, well, that's because I did all his laundry for him.
not_available I used to think sometimes that was the only reason he came home.
not_available I'm gonna take him home now.
not_available I'm gonna I'm gonna get him better.
not_available You'll get through this.
not_available I promise.
not_available Thank you, Katey.
not_available You've been wonderful.
not_available You come on down to Baton Rouge whenever you can get away.
not_available You know I will, ma'am.
not_available Okay.
NEELA You're a good person, Katey.
not_available You shut up.
not_available Shut up.
not_available Well, I know you're upset 
not_available You did this, you selfish bitch.
not_available Nobody else, okay? You did.
not_available So you live with that.
MORRIS Okay, you're gonna be a little hoarse for a while.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is gonna help you breathe a little easier.
not_available You wanna tell me why you did this? Kyle, obviously you're hurting, man.
not_available Let me help you.
not_available You were You were shouting in Arabic when we were trying to help you.
not_available Something 
about " Med" 
not_available What does that mean? " Please don't hurt me.
not_available I've done nothing wrong.
not_available God have mercy.
not_available " I must have translated it a million times in Iraq, man.
not_available Not that it mattered.
not_available They didn't listen to me any more than they listened to the prisoners.
not_available Who didn't listen to you? The interrogators.
not_available The interrogators, they 
not_available You saw them beat the prisoners? Beat, burn, other things.
not_available What, you mean torture? Most of the men they questioned didn't even know anything.
not_available They were innocent.
not_available I tried to convince the interrogators, but they didn't believe me.
not_available So they just kept hurting them.
not_available And I just kept translating their cries.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available We're gonna get you some help.
not_available I don't wanna go back to the V.A., man.
not_available You're not.
not_available Not right now.
not_available You're gonna stay with us for a while, okay? Okay.
NEELA Hi, it's Neela.
not_available I'm not in, but leave a message after the tone.
not_available Forgot about this thing.
not_available It might take a while.
not_available Uh, I'll get out here.
MAN What do you see? I see faces of every different color.
not_available Men and women, young and old.
not_available We love our country.
not_available We might have gotten here in different ways through a family member or a loved one, through serving in Iraq through an evolving sense not only of right and wrong but also the division between what is justified and what can never be explained.
MAN Peace now! 
not_available Let's begin at the beginning.
not_available Triage.
not_available Threehour wait for vitals, eightto 12
not_available hour wait for a bed.
not_available Well, we push them through as fast as we can.
not_available We almost pushed Esther Calder 6 feet under but a combination of blind faith, dumb luck her resilience and my attention to detail thwarted all the attempts that we made to kill her.
not_available I triaged her.
not_available She did not wait very long.
not_available She waited two hours with intense nausea.
not_available Then, after that, another two hours before she got back to a bed.
not_available And then, after that, another hour before a doctor saw her.
not_available What's that? Like, five hours? That's not so bad.
not_available It can be better.
not_available It will be better.
not_available What if the triage nurse had standing orders for labs IV fluids and antiemetics with a patient like this? What would happen? The very charming Mrs.
not_available Calder would be brought right back.
not_available She would get relief.
not_available She would be registered at her bedside.
not_available We would knock four hours off her stay time and we would be on top of her problems before she crashed.
not_available That is a wonderful theory.
not_available You're taking this personally, Sam.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm a nurse, I do triage.
not_available I take it personally when you criticize the job I'm doing.
not_available Good.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good.
not_available I'd worry about you if you didn't.
not_available Now the interns.
not_available The peripatetic Dr.
not_available Gates did an inadequate history.
not_available He ordered tests without consulting an Attending.
not_available It was busy.
not_available That's not unusual.
not_available Again, you're arguing that incompetence and sloppiness are the norm.
not_available And that's no way to impress me.
not_available The Resident Abby, right? You assumed that Gates had done a thorough H &amp; P and he had not.
not_available It looked like gastroenteritis.
not_available Based on the incomplete H &amp; P which he took and you accepted at face value.
not_available Your intern led you down the primrose path.
not_available You sold that to the Attending, Dr.
not_available Pratt and then the three of you blithely walked Mrs.
not_available Calder along with you to death's door.
not_available Oh, come on.
PRATT Sepsis was a viable diagnosis.
MORETTl Viable? 
PRATT Yeah.
not_available Viable? Nobody took a decent history! 
Fact 80 percent of all diagnoses can be made on the basis of history alone.
not_available But nobody bothered to talk to the patient.
not_available You knew what meds she was on now, the easy part.
not_available But what meds was she on a month ago? One month ago, she did a twoweek course of highdose prednisone for URl
not_available associated bronchospasm.
not_available The steroids suppressed her adrenal glands.
not_available She had adrenal insufficiency.
not_available Fine, but that's a pretty rare condition.
not_available We don't see it that often.
not_available No, you see it.
not_available You just don't recognize it.
MORRIS We get the point.
not_available You want us to be more careful.
MORETTl That's a very reductive version of what I want.
not_available What I want is for us to live in mortal fear of doing something wrong, of missing something and having somebody else pay the price for that.
not_available And I want us to use that fear to make us better.
not_available I am not here because I need the work.
not_available I'm here because I wanna save the world.
not_available The way we're gonna do it is to reinvent the way we practice medicine every day.
not_available Right now, right here, on the front.
not_available I have another shift to start, so go.
not_available I've worked here for a long time.
not_available And you might think that this is the way to motivate people, but it's not.
not_available Thank you for your input.
not_available Listen, all I'm saying is you 
not_available I know.
not_available I said thank you.
not_available All of you are gonna have to take time to get used to my management style.
not_available And you are going to have to take time to get used to working with a chief that you're not sleeping with.
WOMAN It's not political.
not_available It's not about Republican or Democrat.
not_available It's about young lives lost every day.
not_available Every day.
not_available And knowing when to say we've done what we could and maybe it's time for us to go home.
not_available Let those people sort this out for themselves.
not_available That's what my brother came to think eventually.
not_available MAN 
1 Finish the job! 
not_available Shut up! Let her talk! 
not_available And seeing what was going on, and seeing what the results were Get off the stage! Unfortunately, the letter in which he expressed that was written Neela.
not_available MAN 
2 Let's go.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available MAN 
3 Hurry up.
GATES Get out of the way! Neela! MAN 
4 Get out of the way! 
not_available Neela! Neela!
