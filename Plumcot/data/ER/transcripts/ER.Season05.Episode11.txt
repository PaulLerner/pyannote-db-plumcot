Previously on ER Having a drink sounds great.
not_available What? You went out with her? 
not_available Just dinner.
not_available We should embrace our mistakes and learn from them to improve the system.
not_available I'm going to put the microphone
not_available holder right behind the ear.
not_available I wanted to postpone Reece's operation.
not_available Are you coughing up blood? If that woman has tuberculosis, it's highly contagious.
not_available Something about me brings out the worst in people.
not_available Merry Christmas, Amanda.
not_available Got a beautiful snowstorm last night.
not_available I should really get up.
not_available Me too.
not_available You seen my pajama bottoms? You should talk to IKerry about the heat.
not_available It was pretty hot in here a minute ago.
not_available So I'll pick you up tonight around 9? I said I'd think about it.
not_available My friends are dying to meet you.
not_available Girls' night out? I'd feel like I was on display.
not_available It'll beat babysitting a med student on a Friday.
not_available Lucy's presenting Chief rounds tomorrow.
not_available It's a big deal.
not_available And Lucy is a big girl.
not_available I'd rather spend the night with you.
not_available But only with you! John, what is that? That is a major drag.
not_available Hey! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available You were an easy target.
not_available Quite an arm.
not_available My grandfather was a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds.
not_available Isn't this is an emergency entrance? The plow comes in and pushes the snow from one side to the other.
not_available I'll call Maintenance.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available By the time they get here, it'll be spring.
not_available Snow reminds me of the year I spent working in Alaska.
not_available You've done it all.
not_available I try.
not_available You've got something on your back.
not_available You think that's funny, huh? Are you okay? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm vibrating.
not_available What? It's my pager.
not_available See you inside.
not_available So Mark said dinner plans are, quote, "optional." If everything's going well, we should vamoose.
not_available I hope things go well.
not_available He deserves it.
not_available Think they've slept together? Well, if they observed the three
not_available date rule What's that? One, you go out.
not_available Two, you get invited in.
not_available Three, you close the deal.
not_available It's their fourth.
not_available Lf you recall we closed the deal on one.
not_available Well, yeah.
not_available I was never much for rules.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Call in a Code White.
not_available Get a gurney and a crash cart.
not_available Joi Abbott fainted in the cafeteria, tachycardic at 130.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Really.
not_available She's probably dehydrated.
not_available Exam Two's open.
not_available We got it from here, Doug.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Yo! Can I help you? Who are you? Who are you? 
not_available Who is this guy? Doug Ross, Pedes ER Attending, meet Tony Fig, Transport Dispatcher.
not_available He's here while Jerry and Randi are sick.
not_available Some dude from NASA called about your Phase Two application packet.
not_available "NASA" as in the space program? Probably "Nassau" as in trying to sell me a timeshare.
not_available There's no number.
not_available Said they'd call back.
not_available Bet it was Jerry.
not_available He's made two crank calls from home already.
not_available Doug, I DC'd the otitis media.
not_available We're free and clear.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available For a nanosecond.
not_available Yes, officer? What can I do for you? Scott Pew.
not_available Thought it'd be cool to bumper
not_available ski on my patrol car.
not_available Until I made a U
not_available turn and he shot into a hedge.
not_available He says he broke his arm.
not_available It's more like his elbow.
not_available Looks like a fracture.
not_available I'm gonna sit you down.
not_available He could be a good candidate for our pain medication study.
not_available I'll get his parents' consent.
not_available Would you take a look at my hand? I got a splinter.
not_available I'm working in Pedes.
not_available I'll find you someone.
not_available I'm a kid at heart.
not_available I'll meet you in the Suture Room in a minute.
not_available I need to go.
not_available Could you be pregnant? No, my husband and I are separated.
not_available When was the last time you ate? I don't know.
not_available Lunch, yesterday.
not_available Your body's malnourished.
not_available My son's getting an MRI.
not_available If I'm not there when he's done We can call and explain.
not_available They'll keep an eye on him.
not_available He gets scared if I'm not there.
not_available We have to get to the clinic.
not_available We have a clinic here.
not_available Ricky goes to the Genetics Clinic.
not_available Will you take this out, please? What's your son's medical condition? ALD.
not_available Adrenoleukodystrophy.
not_available Advanced? Are you giving him oils? It's too late.
not_available We'll have your results in an hour if you'd like to come back when you're through upstairs.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Well, we tried.
not_available I'm looking forward to our double date.
not_available Oh, me too.
not_available If you don't mind me asking have you and Mark ever been intimate? Me and Mark? No, why? Well, I just wondered if he makes a habit of seducing coworkers.
not_available He's been so aggressive.
not_available Oh, don't get me wrong.
not_available I have never been as satisfied with anyone as I am with this man.
not_available But when someone's that inventive you suspect he's a Don Juan.
not_available We are talking about Mark Greene? Last night on his fire escape I'll drop these at the lab.
not_available I must have gotten it from that woman.
not_available Any night sweats or fever? A positive test doesn't mean TB, just that I'm exposed.
not_available You need a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available And INH prophylaxis for at least six months.
not_available I know the drill.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The risk of being a doctor.
not_available I'm glad you're negative.
not_available Carter, Roxanne, line two.
not_available Thanks, Lily.
not_available I have to cancel our study plans this evening.
not_available Something's come up.
not_available No problem.
not_available Maybe you and Bernard can review together.
not_available Hey, what's up? 
not_available You hated it.
not_available Well, no.
not_available I haven't read it thoroughly.
not_available Do you think I can get it published? 
not_available It is controversial.
not_available That's bad? For you? Right now? Oh, yeah.
not_available We'll see if Anspaugh agrees.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? The patient's grandmother requested you personally.
not_available Dr.
not_available Parks.
not_available This is a surprise.
not_available Where's your interpreter? I can do that.
not_available My name is Gwen.
not_available Oh, you can hear.
not_available Grandma thinks I have appendi Appendicitis? 
not_available That's it.
not_available Where does it hurt? 
not_available Around my bellybutton.
not_available When did it start? Grandma was driving me to school.
not_available She had to pull over so I could vomit.
not_available I think you have gastroenteritis.
not_available Can you spell that? I'm sorry.
not_available Stomach flu.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available There's no localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant.
not_available Grandma wants to do the ultrasound.
not_available I'll re
not_available examine her later.
not_available See if the problem declares itself.
not_available What did she say? She says she wants to do the ultrasound.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine.
not_available I don't see a splinter.
not_available But there is something.
not_available I'd hate for you to think I made it up to spend time with you.
not_available That smile is worth a thousand splinters.
not_available Easy.
not_available Got it.
not_available I didn't mean to hurt you.
not_available Make it up to me by letting me take you out.
not_available I didn't hurt you that bad.
not_available You will if you say no.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You've decided not to like me.
not_available I don't even know you.
not_available Right.
not_available So we go out, and you get to know me.
not_available Officer 
not_available Call me Reggie.
not_available Reggie, I'm just not looking to go out with anyone right now.
not_available You know, if it's because you're HIV
not_available positive, I'm cool with that.
not_available You're cool with that? Lucky me.
not_available I didn't I wasn't talking about sex.
not_available I like to get to know a woman first.
not_available So how about we cross that bridge if we come to it? Dr.
not_available Weaver, I almost forgot.
not_available Your mom called.
not_available My mom? 
not_available This morning before I left.
not_available What did she say exactly? Just that she'd try you again later.
not_available Am I supposed to get that? 
not_available I got it.
not_available Did she ask for me by name? Your mom? Be advised of a commuter plane crash at Meig's Field.
not_available Anticipating up to 14 trauma patients.
not_available How many can you handle? We can take three major, seven minor.
not_available Do you have an ETA? Over.
not_available Negative.
not_available Awaiting reports from the scene.
not_available Over.
not_available All right.
not_available Clear on Med Nine.
not_available We have a mass casualty incident.
not_available Implement disaster protocol.
not_available Set up Curtains 1 and 2, Trauma 2 and 3 for critical patients.
not_available John, will you put IV stands and gurneys in the hallway? I need warm saline, rapid infusers, and O
not_available negative available at every bedside.
not_available I appreciate your work.
not_available I don't think it's appropriate for publication.
not_available How can we effect change without an open forum? I support change, Elizabeth.
not_available But I don't believe your paper is the proper tool.
not_available You object to me mentioning my mistake because it paints us in a poor light.
not_available No, it paints you in a poor light.
not_available It has a confessional quality that concerns me.
not_available I suggest you find out the true motives for writing this paper before you become hell
not_available bent on sharing it with the world.
not_available Nothing like a multivictim trauma.
not_available I'm Dale Edson, third
not_available year Surgical Resident.
not_available Lucy IKnight, third
not_available year student.
not_available Working with Carter, former Surgical Intern.
not_available Wait until you do a Surgical rotation.
not_available It makes emergency medicine look like child's play.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me help you with that.
not_available You ever been on a riverboat casino? Like in New Orleans? Like in Elgin.
not_available It's a stellar boat, The Grand Victoria.
not_available I'm heading up there this evening.
not_available Would you like to join me? I've never been gambling before.
not_available Don't you need to prepare for Chief rounds tomorrow? When you're through, check the O
not_available neg.
not_available I can help you on it during the drive up, if you want.
not_available That would be great.
not_available We've got work to do.
not_available It won't be the same without you.
not_available Am I going someplace? You don't have to play dumb, Doug.
not_available Matt Richmond phoned.
not_available I downplayed you.
not_available I'm not an idiot.
not_available I am, because I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Who's this Richmond guy? He runs an HMO headquartered in Portland.
not_available They want someone to set up pediatric ERs around the country.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lee, blood bank's on the phone.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available You applied for the space program? My second year of Residency.
not_available I made the first cut.
not_available What happened? Rachel was just barely out of diapers and Jen was starting law school.
not_available They wouldn't let me defer.
not_available So that call from NASA could be real.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Trauma Room's ready.
not_available Great.
not_available Thanks, you guys.
not_available You two seem to be moving along.
not_available She's kind of playing hard to get.
not_available Carter, Lucy and Lily will handle minors in the main hall.
not_available Mark, you and Carol to Trauma One.
not_available IKerry, you and Chuny in Trauma Two.
not_available Lydia and I will float.
not_available Come in, County General.
not_available Jeanie and I will take critical pedes in Curtain Three.
not_available This is County.
not_available Over.
not_available Everybody, Critical pedes, Curtain Three.
not_available Be advised your facility has been instructed to stand down.
not_available Over.
not_available Come in, Center.
not_available We're ready to handle patients.
not_available Over.
not_available Stand down? 
not_available Stop prepping.
not_available There were no survivors on scene.
not_available Repeat, no survivors.
not_available Over.
not_available Copy that, Dispatch.
not_available Any messages for me? 
not_available And you are? Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Weaver.
not_available One.
not_available It sounded important.
not_available From my mother? 
not_available Your dentist.
not_available Any calls for me, business or otherwise, page me.
not_available I got you covered.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Overnight delivery.
not_available Check out the return address.
not_available "NASA"? You deserting me? No, of course not.
not_available Got another one behind us.

not_available Possible pneumothorax.
not_available I want a CBC, chem panel, send off cardiac enzymes.
not_available We gotta rule out an MI.
not_available She's young for an MI.
not_available I don't want to take any chances.
not_available Do you mind checking on IKerry? Pressure's holding at 100.
not_available He's a psychologist.
not_available He was treating your patient.
not_available What were you treating her for? 
not_available Agoraphobia.
not_available Edie's terrified of public places.
not_available Including hospitals? 
not_available Pulse ox 98.
not_available I was using a desensitization approach.
not_available She went outside for the first time in five years and a chimney fell on us.
not_available Call CT.
not_available Right upper quadrant tender.
not_available Does she have panic attacks? 
not_available 30 a day.
not_available Great.
not_available CT can take him now.
not_available Let's get him up.
not_available She has relaxation music with her.
not_available That may help.
not_available EIKG normal.
not_available Lips numb.
not_available My name is Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available You're in a hospital.
not_available Nothing bad can happen.
not_available Hospitals bad.

not_available IKeep breathing.

not_available Yeah, there's fluid around the edematous appendix.
not_available ED
not_available E Mom! That's my mom.
not_available She was on a field trip with her students while Grandma called.
not_available What does this mean?

not_available Do me a favor.
not_available Tell your mother and grandmother Never mind.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, excuse me.

not_available Appendix.
not_available Yeah, yeah, right.
not_available I'm gonna have an operation? Yeah.
not_available But it's fine.
not_available Mom needs a signer.
not_available Grandma's not a surgeon.
not_available I need to ask questions.
not_available The hospital needs to provide one.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Look, I'll take care of it.
not_available It's no problem.
not_available Am I gonna be okay? You're gonna be fine.
not_available Edie, this mask will help you breathe.
not_available Just inhale like this.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Mask off! 
not_available No, no, no.
not_available Mask on.
not_available Mask off! Bad news.
not_available CT's down.
not_available I don't want to put her on sedation until we rule out intracranial bleed.
not_available We may have no choice.
not_available Let me try something.
not_available Okay, Edie.
not_available I want you to close your eyes.
not_available I can't.
not_available Sure you can.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available I want you to imagine yourself as a little girl someplace warm and safe.
not_available It's dark.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Close your eyes.
not_available It's light and it's airy.
not_available And it's warm and it's safe.
not_available Can you tell me where you are? IKitchen.
not_available Who's with you there? 
not_available Mom.
not_available Your mom.
not_available She's baking something.
not_available It smells really yummy.
not_available Can you tell me what she's baking? 
not_available Cookies.
not_available Cookies.
not_available Very good.
not_available That's good.
not_available That's good.
not_available I'm sorry if I offended you earlier.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm thinking of something to tell you to make it even.
not_available It's not necessary.
not_available How I'm broke or got suspended once.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available Nothing in my life compares to what you're going through.
not_available Don't feel sorry for me.
not_available I'm doing great.
not_available Where did you learn that? I did research on phobias in school.
not_available I actually got published in the Cornell Medical Journal.
not_available I'd love to read it.
not_available Do you still have a copy? 
not_available Filed in a box somewhere.
not_available Ambulance pulling up.
not_available I'll take that.
not_available It's poorly written psychobabble.
not_available You'd be bored.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Carol! I just got the labs back on Joi Abbott.
not_available The woman who fainted in the cafeteria.
not_available She has microcytic anemia.
not_available Give her iron.
not_available She'll be fine.
not_available Well, I doubt it.
not_available Her son has ALD.
not_available How old is he? 
not_available Eight.
not_available Why? They usually don't make it past 10.
not_available He had an older brother who died of it three years ago.
not_available It's X
not_available linked.
not_available Inherited from the mother.
not_available It only strikes boys.
not_available No wonder Joi looks like hell.
not_available Simon says, "Fly like a bird!" 
not_available I can't believe you paged me for this.
not_available When a child acts out, it's usually an indication of a bigger problem.
not_available If Reece bit a kid, he was probably provoked.
not_available Actually, this isn't the first time he's disrupted class.
not_available Yesterday Reece threw a fit when it was sing
not_available along time and he wanted to continue painting.
not_available Maybe because he can't sing along.
not_available We don't have the personnel to let each child do their own activities.
not_available I already spend extra time talking to him and making sure Okay, okay, listen, listen, what do you want me to do? Perhaps he needs a special
not_available needs environment where he'll get more personal attention.
not_available It may be the best for all concerned.
not_available Good breath sounds bilaterally.
not_available You're doing awesome.
not_available Fetal heart tones present at 140.
not_available Are you feeling any pain here? Only with the contractions.
not_available Is our baby okay? 
not_available So far, so good.
not_available Hemoglobin is 12.8.
not_available What have we got? 
not_available Robin Gambrell, 28.
not_available Restrained frontseat passenger, involved in a two
not_available car MVA.
not_available Full
not_available term and she's in active labor.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available I shouldn't have been driving so fast.
not_available They brought the other victim.
not_available I think they need you next door.
not_available Hope that guy's okay.
not_available Never saw him coming.
not_available We're gonna have to do a pelvic exam before we bring you up to OB.
not_available Mike, did you hurt your back? Don't worry about me, baby.
not_available Let's get a trauma panel on Mr.
not_available Gambrell for kidney damage.
not_available Oh, here comes another one! Okay, baby.
not_available Breathe.
not_available Breathe through the pain.
not_available Aaron Drane.
not_available He's a private in the Army.
not_available BP's 60.
not_available Could be intra
not_available abdominal hemorrhage.
not_available I need a peritoneal lavage kit.
not_available Prep the belly.
not_available Another two units of O
not_available neg.
not_available Heart rate's 130.
not_available All right, Lucy.
not_available Hook up the adapter to the syringe.
not_available Okay, I'm in.
not_available Pull back on the syringe.
not_available Gross blood.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Crash cart! Charge to 200.
not_available Clear! Do you know how to use the Internet? My middle initials are "WWW." I'm trying to find an article on the Cornell Medical School Journal site.
not_available You got back slashes instead of forward slashes.
not_available Common beginner's mistake.
not_available Author's name? 
not_available Amanda Lee.
not_available Subject would be "phobias." A.W.
not_available Lee wrote something called "Fearing Fear." Could you print that? 
not_available Already did.
not_available Oh.
not_available Listen, call down to the library and have them send up any articles by the same author.
not_available Hey, for you, Dr.
not_available G.
not_available One more time.
not_available Charge to 50.
not_available Charging.
not_available Clear.
not_available Still asystole.
not_available Me and some friends were hanging out after my shift when Robin called and told me that her water broke.
not_available I kind of freaked out.
not_available That's common with first
not_available time dads.
not_available Mike's been working doubles so he can take time off after the baby's born.
not_available I don't want Robin going through this alone.
not_available Sounds like you'll make great parents.
not_available That's a good
not_available Iooking baby.
not_available Placenta looks fine.
not_available Thank you, God.
not_available How's the other driver doing? Everything's fine, baby.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available "This time, with the wind aft, and a good one the swallow fairly raced to the island with her wing" 
not_available Hi, Joi.
not_available I'm sorry I couldn't make it back down.
not_available I decided to come to you instead.
not_available That's nice of you.
not_available This must be Ricky.
not_available I'm Carol.
not_available He just started having trouble talking.
not_available He used to be such a chatterbox.
not_available So I got some terrible disease too? Your blood test confirmed you're anemic.
not_available If you take these iron pills, you'll feel a lot better.
not_available I'd like you to come back in three weeks so I can recheck your blood.
not_available It's hard for me to plan that far ahead.
not_available Time to eat.
not_available I got chocolate today.
not_available Do you have any help with Ricky? My daughter, Celia, plays with him.
not_available I was actually thinking more medically.
not_available I take care of all that.
not_available I could arrange for respite care.
not_available Someone who could watch Ricky a couple hours a day while you regain your strength.
not_available I appreciate the offer, but Ricky's my responsibility.
not_available If you don't take care of yourself you won't be much help to him or your daughter either.
not_available It's my job to see him through this.
not_available Good effort in there, Amanda.
not_available You win some, you lose some.
not_available I was trying to find your journal article, and I found 
this Written by A.W.
not_available Lee, picture of 40year
not_available old Asian guy.
not_available He was a classmate of mine at Cornell.
not_available And not a very good one.
not_available People were constantly getting us mixed up.
not_available You wrote the article, but they printed his photo.
not_available They printed a correction in the next issue.
not_available And this was on the Internet.
not_available A global source of misinformation.
not_available Why don't you get the editor of the Cornell Journal of Medicine for me? It's really not necessary.
not_available You should get credit for your work.
not_available Where's Cornell? Yes, officer? I'm following up on the MVA.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Gambrell and the baby are doing fine.
not_available Unfortunately, the driver of the other car expired.
not_available And Michael Gambrell, the driver who caused the accident? Just some minor cuts and abrasions.
not_available He was driving erratically.
not_available Did you get a blood alcohol on him? Just a CBC and a chem panel.
not_available Can you get a B.A.L.
not_available Off that? 
not_available I don't think that's necessary.
not_available It's standard procedure.
not_available I can take him down to the station 
not_available I'll add it to his orders.
not_available Appreciate it.
not_available Just try and relax, Mr.
not_available Wong.
not_available Pulse ox 87.
not_available I can't find the radial artery.
not_available Try a brachial stick.
not_available I've got a pulse.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wong, I'm gonna stick you now.
not_available I'm getting blood.
not_available All it takes is a little practice.
not_available Lily, take over for Lucy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Go to the Suture Room and flush out the wound.
not_available Sounds like an astronaut to me.
not_available It's not like I'm gonna fly it.
not_available What's a payload specialist do? On
not_available board experiments.
not_available A guy I went to school with is heading up a medical team for next year.
not_available That's some pretty intense training.
not_available I'm not physically in shape? They let John Glenn back up there, and he's, what, in his late 70s? Thanks, Carol.
not_available Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime.
not_available It's not like you have Rachel and Jen to tie you down.
not_available "Tie him down"? It's not like I was looking for it.
not_available Yo, Dr.
not_available G.
not_available Those A.W.
not_available Lee articles you wanted? They're checked out.
not_available All of them? By who? 
not_available I didn't ask.
not_available When? 
not_available Didn't ask.
not_available Did that editor from Cornell return my call? Listen, check with the library and see what else you can find out.
not_available Donald, can I talk to you? 
not_available I'm late for surgery, Mark.
not_available Do you know anybody over at the Cornell Medical School? Why don't you talk to Dr.
not_available Lee? That's her alma mater.
not_available You never spoke to anybody about her? I didn't see the need.
not_available Her letters of recommendation were glowing.
not_available Yes, they were.
not_available And an old Army buddy of mine said she's the best Resident he's ever had.
not_available That's good to hear.
not_available Lf there's a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available CT just called.
not_available They're ready for the freaky chica.
not_available Why don't you stick with me? I may need your transpo expertise.
not_available Lucy, I am so sorry.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available I should've warned the patient that I was gonna stick him.
not_available Like you said, risk comes with the job.
not_available What do I do? We'll send a sample of his blood down to the lab for a rapid HIV test.
not_available Without his permission? Yes, since we already have a sample.
not_available And if he turns out to be HIV
not_available positive which I'm sure he won't then we'll tell him the test results.
not_available If he's positive, I'm gonna have to start prophylaxis.
not_available Well, let's just take this one step at time.
not_available Okay? Okay.
not_available Hasn't the interpreter arrived? The nurse says she's busy.
not_available Another one is driving in.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know, we really shouldn't wait on this.
not_available She said okay.
not_available Grandma wants to watch.
not_available No, no, it's not necessary.
not_available Okay, okay, fine.
not_available I love you.
not_available I love you both.
not_available We're gonna be in and out of there in less than 20 minutes.
not_available Don't leave.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available How's it look? 
not_available The coast is clear, captain.
not_available Why don't you close your eyes and imagine yourself in outer space.
not_available What? 
not_available You're floating around the galaxy in the black expanse.
not_available Earth is a tiny speck in the distance.
not_available Okay? Are there cookies? 
not_available Sure, they have cookies in space.
not_available Wash them down with Tang.
not_available Coming through! I need blood now! Don't let me! Let's go back.
not_available We're gonna go back.
not_available Let's take her back.
not_available We're gonna take you back.
not_available We've been waiting for over 45 minutes and no one will tell us about our son.
not_available I'm sure the doctor's tied up.
not_available I want to know about my son! What's going on? What's your son's name? Aaron Drane.
not_available He's a private in the U.S.
not_available Army.
not_available He was in a car accident.
not_available I don't know, but let me see if I can find out.
not_available He was home on leave, driving back to base.
not_available Look, we're gonna go back there! You can't stop us.
not_available Mr.
not_available Drane, Mrs.
not_available Drane, I'm Officer Moore.
not_available I'm very sorry, but your son, Aaron, was very seriously injured and he died.
not_available The doctors here did everything they could to save him.
not_available What are you doing in here? I'm cutting out some fascinating articles on Conn's Syndrome.
not_available Aren't those hospital copies? Yeah, they were extras.
not_available Unfortunately, I have to cancel on tonight.
not_available This migraine's like a train running through my head.
not_available Have you ever tried just? You name it, I've tried it.
not_available I think the best thing is to go home and pull the covers over my head.
not_available But Mark and I will definitely reschedule.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Mike Gambrell's blood alcohol came back.
not_available .086.
not_available He's just over the limit.
not_available Not good at all.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Nothing bad can happen to me.
not_available I am in control.
not_available Just keep nice, positive thoughts.
not_available That's good.
not_available I am in control.
not_available I am okay.
not_available How weird is that? 
not_available What?! We're just gonna wait for the next elevator because this one's full.
not_available All right, there it is.
not_available One inflamed appy with fibrinous exudate.
not_available I've never come across a deaf doctor.
not_available Quite an amazing feat she pulled off.
not_available Preparing to clamp.
not_available How did she manage a Residency? Especially a Surgical rotation with a mask on, her hands occupied? She can't read our lips.
not_available It's rude to talk about her when she's right in front of us.
not_available You're absolutely right.
not_available My apologies.
not_available Where have you been? I was helping Dr.
not_available G.
not_available Get a patient to CT.
not_available It was no picnic.
not_available He wanted this Cornell call.
not_available I should find him.
not_available I'm heading that way.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available Look, he had a couple of beers with no intention of driving.
not_available Then his wife called in labor.
not_available He killed a man.
not_available He's willing to take responsibility.
not_available He wants to stay with his wife through delivery.
not_available I don't like this, but my job is to arrest him now.
not_available Should his wife and child have to pay as well? He can stay until she delivers.
not_available Then I'm taking him in.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Great news.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wong's test results came back.
not_available He's negative.
not_available Are you sure? 
not_available I went to the lab myself to confirm.
not_available Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much.
not_available I'm the one that got you into this.
not_available I appreciate you sticking through it.
not_available I still want you to get tested again in six months, just to be safe.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available Man, I'm so relieved! Tell me about it! Done? You passed with flying colors.
not_available I'll be right in.
not_available Go ahead and process those.
not_available I am okay.
not_available Yes, you are.
not_available The scan confirmed that there's no bleeding in the brain.
not_available Edie, if you want me to unstrap you, you'll have to let go of my hand.
not_available I thought you were different.
not_available I thought you understood the real me.
not_available Obviously, I was mistaken.
not_available Amanda, what's going on? 
not_available Unstrap.
not_available I'm a fine doctor.
not_available I have what it takes.
not_available I know.
not_available Then why did you doubt me?! If this is about the article, we can talk Why is this door locked? 
not_available Locked? I loved you more than any man has a right to be loved.
not_available What? I never expected to feel like this.
not_available I hate feeling like this! I don't know what you're talking about! If you'll open the door Please! It's too painful for me to be near you.
not_available Can we talk about this? Can't breathe! It's all right.
not_available It's okay, keep breathing.
not_available Amanda, I want to understand.
not_available It's too late for that, Mark.
not_available It's over.
not_available But I will never forget you.
not_available Amanda, wait.
not_available Amanda, wait! Let us out of here! Dying! They were locked in there how long? 
not_available An hour.
not_available The tech took a long lunch.
not_available Have they found Dr.
not_available Lee? 
not_available Still missing.
not_available Get this.
not_available Amanda Lee, also known as Barbara Hardin and Janice Engelhart.
not_available She never even got her MD.
not_available She's not a real doctor? Unbelievable! She stole A.W.
not_available Lee's medical school transcripts and used them to get into a Residency program.
not_available Why didn't I think of that? 
not_available It's not her first time.
not_available She also posed as a lawyer and an architect.
not_available Think how many patients she treated.
not_available We'll have a huge liability.
not_available I thought she was a good doctor.
not_available She certainly had me fooled.
not_available Me too.
not_available I wonder if my job offer was made up.
not_available What job offer? Edie? Dr.
not_available Greene, I want to thank you.
not_available For what? Getting you held hostage by a crazed lunatic? I haven't felt this good in years.
not_available That's great.
not_available I mean, if I can survive this hellhole, I can survive anything.
not_available Can I call you a cab? I think I'm just gonna walk.
not_available Cervix is at seven centimeters.
not_available Shouldn't be long.
not_available We'll get you upstairs right now.
not_available Is that him? Is that the guy? I'm treating a patient! That son of a bitch killed my son! 
not_available Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean for this to happen.
not_available Arrest him! The baby's heart rate is slowing.
not_available Don't leave me.
not_available I'm right here.
not_available He wants to see his wife through labor.
not_available He only needs a few more hours.
not_available I would have liked a few more hours with my son.
not_available I've gotta do this.
not_available You should go with the officer.
not_available You can post bail.
not_available Hopefully, you'll be back before the birth.
not_available I'm not leaving.
not_available I think you have to.
not_available No, he doesn't.
not_available We're gonna take very good care of her.
not_available Good pickup.
not_available How do you think she's gotten away with it? Obviously Dr.
not_available Lee's a first
not_available class pathological liar.
not_available ER.
not_available If you're sick, we'll fix you quick.
not_available Hey, Dale.
not_available Listen, Lucy's a good kid.
not_available So try to be nice.
not_available I'm always nice.
not_available She told me about getting needle
not_available stuck.
not_available The guy tested HIV
not_available negative, right? Yeah.
not_available Thank God.
not_available I'll say.
not_available It means I got a chance at scoring tonight.
not_available Do you have a lucky number you want me to bet on? No, thanks.
not_available I'm not feeling lucky tonight.
not_available I am.
not_available Shall we, Lucy? Yes, if I must.
not_available I'm trying to apprise the CEO about Dr.
not_available Lee, and he puts me on hold.
not_available I thought you should know.
not_available A patient died under hers and my care today.
not_available That's just what I didn't need to hear.
not_available However, I don't believe either of us made any errors.
not_available The hospital attorneys will want to speak to you about it.
not_available I've also been thinking about what you said earlier and I intend to pursue the publication of my paper.
not_available Yes, I'm here.
not_available Can you hold one second, please? Well, in light of the Amanda Lee debacle it's obvious none of us are above reproach.
not_available I admire your directness.
not_available Give me a list of the journals and I'll attach a cover letter.
not_available Thank you, Donald.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where were we? How are we doing? 
not_available She's crowning.
not_available Mike's not gonna make it, is he? No, but we're gonna get through this, Robin, okay? Take a deep breath and push.
not_available There you go.
not_available I'm guiding the head out.
not_available Deep breath and push again.
not_available Good.
not_available Mark's made some bad choices in women, but he outdid himself this time.
not_available I knew there was something off.
not_available I don't want to talk about it.
not_available Can I just ask you a question? Was the fire escape thing for real? What fire escape? Never mind.
not_available Think we should open it? 
not_available Too thin to be a bomb.
not_available What is it? "This is for you.
not_available It is a poem you inspired me to write.
not_available Because two bodies naked and entwined Leap over time They are invulnerable Nothing can touch them.
not_available " They return to the source.
not_available "There is no you No I 
not_available No tomorrow.
not_available " 
not_available No tomorrow.
not_available Octavio Paz, my favorite poet.
not_available There you go.
not_available You inspired her to plagiarize.
not_available Just go.
not_available So dinner for three? 
not_available I'm gonna hit the gym first.
not_available Carol? I thought I'd missed you.
not_available Hey, Joi.
not_available Is something wrong? I've been thinking about what you said about respite care.
not_available And my daughter has a dance recital next week.
not_available It would mean a lot to her if I was there.
not_available I'll make some calls first thing in the morning.
not_available I'd appreciate that.
not_available How are you? Fine.
not_available He's got a little conjunctivitis.
not_available I meant to have the doctor upstairs take a look.
not_available I'll write him a prescription for gentamicin.
not_available It'll get him cleared up.
not_available This is getting ridiculous.
not_available I was coming by to see the Gambrell wife and baby.
not_available Both mother and daughter are fine.
not_available I'll call in and have them tell the dad.
not_available It's a shame.
not_available He was not a bad guy.
not_available Just made one really dumb mistake.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available It is a shame.
not_available You have a good one.
not_available Hey, Reggie.
not_available I've got plans tonight.
not_available You want to catch a movie tomorrow night? Let me think about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Hey.
not_available INH.
not_available You've converted, huh? Hey, your mom, she never called back.
not_available My mom's dead.
not_available I was adopted.
not_available It's possible that call was from my birth mother.
not_available Wow! I didn't know.
not_available Yeah, well, probably a wrong number.
not_available A false alarm.
not_available Have you been looking? I put my name on the Internet a month ago.
not_available My parents My adopted parents have been gone about a year now, so I'd think that there'd be agencies Yeah, there are.
not_available There are.
not_available Go on.
not_available It's Friday night.
not_available I'll miss my curtain if I don't go.
not_available Have a good time.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available What's happening, Reece? What? Hey, you know who I am? Do you know who I am? Who am I? Can you say "father"? Come on, man.
not_available Let me show you.
not_available Look.
not_available Can you say "daddy"? See what I learned? "Daddy." See? Come on, Reece.
not_available Never mind.
not_available Yeah! Hey! Hey, man! That's it.
