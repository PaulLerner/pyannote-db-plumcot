not_available But he keeps at it, who knows?.
not_available Yeah, but, doc.
not_available You know what they say about a fighter like that?.
not_available He's a stiff.
not_available A bum.

not_available Know what I'm saying?.
not_available And for what?.
not_available Oh, man, I was good.
not_available And still, I was barely good enough to turn pro.
not_available And Derrek ain't half the fighter I used to be.

not_available Now, he won't listen to me, but maybe he'll listen to you.
not_available Maybe you could talk to him.
not_available Help me out.
not_available Give him a real reason to stop, huh?.
