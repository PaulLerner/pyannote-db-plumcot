not_available Runs of six.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Get Gates and Pratt in here.
not_available His K's going up again.
not_available Ejection fraction is 10 percent.
not_available What does that mean? It means his heart's not pumping well enough.
SAM He have an advanced directive? 
not_available You mean like a DNR? No, I talked to the other doctor about this.
not_available Well, why are you asking about a DNR? We need to know how far he'd want us to go.
not_available Whatever you can.
not_available We knew he was sick I talked to him, he said he was having problems with his diabetes and some trouble with his congestive something.
not_available He called you? Yeah, in June, when I graduated.
not_available What are his chances? Well, it's possible if we put him on dialysis, avert a cardiac incident Can he take all that? He's very resilient.
not_available He's been through a lot.
HAROLD He's been sick for years.

not_available Well, your brother and I have discussed these matters.
not_available We need a few minutes to figure this out.

not_available Thank you, this is a family matter.
not_available We appreciate all you've done.
not_available We'd like some privacy now.
not_available Oh, yes, all right, I'll just step outside.
SAM QRS complex is widening.
TECHNICIAN Ready to start the run.
PRATT Wait a minute.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Sam? Where's Gates, and why is this chart blank? He goes fast.
not_available He probably fills out the paperwork later.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Amp of calcium chloride.
TECHNICIAN We doing this? 
not_available Yeah, in a minute.

not_available Once we do, we'll figure out what's next.
not_available Okay.
WEAVER Hey, Haleh? Pass me a head sheet and Vicodin? Get him started on something for the pain.
not_available Sorry, we got rid of head sheets about a year ago and we're not allowed to dispense meds from the ER anymore.
not_available What's a patient supposed to do if they can't get to a pharmacy? You are preaching to the choir, sister.
not_available I liked it better when you ran the joint.
PRATT Charged.

not_available fib.
not_available Resuming compressions.
not_available What happened?

not_available Why isn't he dialyzed? QRS widened.
not_available Gave him calcium, and now he's crashing.
not_available Is my uncle dying? 
not_available What's that alarm? It's his meds.
not_available He gets afternoon doses of glyburide, Lasix and didge.
not_available What? Did you say didge? 
not_available Digoxin, 0.25 milligrams.
not_available It's right here.
not_available Can everybody step back for a minute while we work on him, please? Charge to 360 again.
LORRAINE You help my brother with his medication? 
BENNETT Sometimes, yes.
not_available No one said didge.
not_available You showed me Diovan.
not_available That's what I was told.
not_available By who, the paramedic? What does Zadro's sheet say? Digoxin.
not_available You didn't look at his med bottles? 
not_available We didn't have them yet.
not_available He has high levels of intracellular calcium from the didge and I pushed more, enough to stop his heart.
not_available Why? Because you couldn't slow down enough to read the med sheet right.
BENNETT Can you tell me what's going on? 
not_available The drugs we gave him to treat his QRS has irritated his heart.
not_available Clear.
not_available Clear.
not_available No change.
not_available Uh, so, what now? What else can we do? Hey, what about Digibind? Depends on his DNR status.
not_available Have you all come to a decision? We've decided it's enough now.
not_available It's time to let him go.
not_available What? No.
not_available Our brother's an old man.
not_available He's been sick for a long time.
not_available No.
not_available He wants to fight.
not_available He's got no one.
not_available He has friends.
not_available A support system.
not_available And who's gonna take care of him? You? 
not_available I always have.
not_available We're his blood.
not_available We don't think he'd wanna suffer through all this.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available You don't know him.
not_available But I do.
not_available And that was his choice, not ours.
not_available I love him.
not_available I love him.
not_available I asked you once politely to go.
not_available You have no part in this.
not_available We can treat your brother with Digibind.
not_available It'll give him a fighting chance.
not_available He's been in arrest for seven minutes.
not_available His heart isn't salvageable.
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Cray, but if this is what his family wants Please, wait.
not_available We'll continue CPR as long as there's hope for a meaningful recovery, but 
SAM You can all come closer if you'd like to be with him.
not_available Call it in five minutes.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'll be right back, okay? Hey, we caused this to happen.
not_available No, you caused this to happen.
not_available So give me a shot at fixing it.
not_available You're never gonna save him.
not_available The family are not the caretakers.
not_available That man is.
not_available No living will, no durable power.
not_available Go with blood relatives.
not_available We have a chance.
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available Teach me.
not_available Oh, you wanna learn.
not_available Okay, well, here you go.
not_available That man's gonna die.
not_available That's what needs to happen right now, so forget about the Digibind.
not_available Lidocaine, one more round of epi, and then you can pronounce him.
not_available Understood? 
not_available You need a break? Sure.
not_available All right, a hundred of lidocaine.
not_available Get ready for some more epi.
not_available And, uh 
not_available Ten vials of Digibind.
not_available Wait.
not_available I thought the other doctor said Your brother expressed a clear desire for resuscitation earlier.
not_available This is a fixable condition.
not_available We're gonna give it a go.
not_available Did you discuss this with Pratt? 
not_available Yes, we discussed it.
not_available Am I going blind? Oh, bless your heart.

LORRAINE Harold.
not_available He's not a degenerate.
not_available His life hasn't been a waste.
not_available I know it'd be easier for you to believe that.
not_available He lied to us for years.
not_available Well, he didn't want to.
not_available He didn't see any other way.
not_available You need to go now.
not_available I'm not going anywhere.
not_available You wanna take care of him? Fine.
not_available It doesn't have to be like this.

not_available He looks more like Kovac.
not_available They usually look more like the father in the beginning.
not_available It's nature's way of making sure Daddy doesn't get insecure and club us to death.
not_available Can I hold him? Sure, he wants me to hold him.
not_available Whoop, a little spit
not_available up there.
not_available No problem.
not_available Oh, a little bit more.
not_available I missed this part with my kids.
not_available Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
not_available I was going crazy so I thought I'd take a walk.
not_available I tried paging you.
not_available How's surgery? Oh, I thought it would be nice to get back to work and distract myself from stuff but my new chief is such a rectal tissue.

not_available Okay.
not_available Come on, Mr.
not_available Rodriguez, wake up.
not_available Got a 14
not_available gauge in the right wrist.
not_available You got a 14
not_available gauge in? You're gonna have to teach me that one.
not_available This the ruptured spleen? Foley's in.

not_available It's a catheter, Mr.
not_available Rodriguez.
not_available Abdomen is flat.
not_available Pressure's up to 100 systolic.

not_available Based on Kerr's sign.
not_available You caught that? That's my boy.
not_available Everybody knows you be tripping off some phat laced powder Tony's the one you want pushing that Narcan.
not_available High praise indeed.
not_available Check him out now with his fancy M.D.
not_available Chest sounds clear.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Examining him.
not_available It's a little crowded.
not_available Step back, write up the H and P.
not_available Well, I can't do that un 
not_available I will dictate to you.
not_available Chest clear.
not_available Cardiac S1, S2 without murmur, rub or gallop.

not_available Her name is Hope.
not_available I think it's okay.
not_available Good, well, we're done in there.
not_available You guys called it? Uh, no, actually, the Digibind worked.
not_available Neela, check a quick rectal.
not_available I have to do the rectal exam? Gates, what part of " no Digibind" did you not get? 
not_available It worked.
PRATT So what? You got his heart back, but his brain is shot.
not_available Now he'll be comatose for three weeks until his organs fail.
not_available You don't know that for sure.
not_available What did you just say to me? I'm an intern, not an idiot.
not_available Been patching up Then maybe next time, you'll know the difference between Diovan and didge.
not_available If what I'm told doesn't make sense to me, you got that? I've been in this ER for five years working my way up as an Attending so if you think that you're gonna spout some crap like that to me then we got a lot more to talk about.
not_available Now get the hell out.
not_available Okay, I was out of line.
not_available Can I check the rapid infuser? 
not_available Get out of here.
not_available I'm working.
not_available Not anymore.

CRENSHAW Good.
not_available Let's squeeze in two units, portable monitor, let's move him up.
not_available Thank you, Jesus.
not_available I thought you were gone.
not_available Working on my charts.
not_available Listen, I know I made a mistake, but that guy would have needed calcium anyway.
not_available If I had known about the didge, I'd have used a lower dose.
not_available Pushed it very slowly.
not_available I said I was wrong.
not_available What do you want from me? How about, " I won't ever again flat
not_available out disregard something you tell me to do or not do"? He would have wanted the Digibind.
not_available So what? 
not_available So what? That's gotta matter.
not_available It was a judgment call that wasn't yours to make.
not_available If you can't give weight to my judgment on a patient that I've been treating 
not_available What? 
not_available No.
not_available No, no, no, go ahead.
not_available Finish the sentence.
not_available Nope.
not_available Yeah.
not_available From now on, you chart as you go.
not_available No more of this saving the paperwork for the end of the day.
not_available And next time you don't do what I tell you to do or any other Attending tells you you're gonna find yourself getting bum rushed right out of this program.
not_available I was wrong from your point of view 
not_available From my point of view? Because of the Digibind, that guy has a chance.
not_available You really think that you saved him? Is that what you think? Oh, then he's gotta have a corneal reflex.
not_available No.
not_available Cold calorics? Absent.
not_available And negative doll's eyes, right? That means no sign of brain activity.
not_available No chance for recovery.
not_available So as your, uh, favorite new mentor, let me just say, great save, Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's your first day going? Guy comes in with a few scrapes, ends up with a splenectomy.
not_available Well, sounds like a good case.
not_available Yeah, it does sound like one.
not_available I wouldn't know, because Dr.
not_available Crenshaw won't let me scrub in.
not_available Sent me to do dressing changes.
not_available Yeah, he's a stern taskmaster, that Dusty.
not_available I'm an intern, Lucien.
not_available Nurses do wound changes.
not_available You know what? That's his call.
not_available You assured me this would be a step up.
not_available Two months ago, I was harvesting saphenous veins for a CABG procedure.
not_available Now I can't hold a retractor? 
not_available It's only the first day.
not_available Why recruit me if you won't allow me to do anything? He's tough, I know that, but his methods work.
not_available He needs to break you down to un
not_available learn you of your bad habits.
not_available What am I, a pony? I don't need to be broken.
not_available I'm not gonna learn or un
not_available learn anything by standing out in the hall.
not_available Neela, you're in a different culture now.
not_available This is how we shake the ER out of you and build you up again as a surgeon.
not_available Well, does it have to be so humiliating? No, it's just much more effective that way.
not_available Oh.
not_available I was wondering where you went.
not_available Yeah, I was taken off the case.
not_available Yes, I thought I detected some tension.
not_available Where are the Andersons? 
not_available Oh, they won't stay as long as I'm here.
not_available Even Brian.
not_available Well, it's nice your friends came.
not_available They want me to go to the club.
not_available Do the show.
not_available Well, they're gonna move him to ICU.
not_available We won't know anything for 24 hours.
not_available Maybe you should go.
not_available He's not coming back from this, is he? There's something I should tell you 
not_available No.
not_available You made a mistake, got something wrong about the didge.
not_available It contributed to his heart problems.
not_available I've been around hospitals long enough to get that much.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available No.
not_available You treated him well.
not_available Both of us.
not_available We appreciate it.
not_available Maybe they were right.
not_available Maybe he was ready.
not_available This has been coming for a long time.
not_available But here's the thing.
not_available As bad as it all may sound, I belong to a rare tribe constitutionally incapable of giving up on fantasy.
not_available If I can get up like a lady and sell a torch song to a crowd then I sure as hell can hold onto the hope that maybe, somehow Jimmy's gonna be okay.
not_available You make me wish I were a drag queen.
not_available No.
not_available We are all liars, just like they said.
not_available The makeup, the wig, the padded dress.
not_available All a beautiful lie we tell ourselves.
not_available But it makes us feel better.
not_available Nothing wrong with that.
not_available No, nothing at all.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available Hope, impacted cerumen needs a washout in 1 and migraine lady needs an H and P The abridged version, please.
not_available In Curtain 4.
not_available Oh, and hey, uh, you know, once we're done here maybe we could go over some procedures and stuff.
not_available Help orient you.
not_available Maybe over dinner? You're asking me out? No, no, I mean, not exactly.
not_available I mean, you know, yeah.
not_available Have you accepted Jesus in your life? Jesus in Accounting or? Oh, yeah, well, sure, yeah.
not_available I mean, I've thought about it.
not_available You haven't, have you? 
not_available Yes, yes, I have.
not_available Jesus is totally cool.
not_available I mean, to me, anyway.
not_available You should come to my Bible group sometime.
not_available I think you'd really like it.
not_available Bible group? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Great.
not_available The next one's Wednesday night.
not_available Bible group.
not_available That's hot, right? Trust me, carrot boy, you ain't anywhere near tapping that.
not_available You know, if there's anything you need I mean, if I can help make your adjustment smoother.
not_available In any way.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available Um, things are a bit complicated right now.
not_available Yeah, for me too.
not_available But maybe we can get some? Coffee? Coffee or something? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sometime? 
not_available Coffee would be good.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Well 
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, kiddo.

not_available Do you not like her? 
not_available Scoot.
not_available Now, you've been through a lot, you know.
not_available We both have.
not_available I just wanted you to have her to talk to.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yeah, you can.
not_available That's what she's there for.
not_available No, Mom, I can't.
not_available I saw.
not_available You know, Dad on the ground, just sleeping.
not_available I saw what you did.
not_available Did you remember the wine? I knew there was a reason I let you live here.
not_available So were you the best one there? How many people did you save? Did you rock?
