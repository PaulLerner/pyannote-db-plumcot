not_available Your mom had me drag that camera all over.
not_available I made an appointment for you on Monday with the oncologist.
not_available I said I didn't want that.
not_available Can you just talk to him? You got that bulb? Don't get fingerprints on it.
not_available They said the cancer was incurable.
not_available Doesn't mean we can't treat it.

not_available This was in the closet.
not_available I always pack that last.
not_available Be a dear and empty me the top drawer.
not_available I can't stay long.
not_available I've got an incarcerated hernia in the O.R.
not_available What shall I do with this? Would you return it to David?

not_available Much like his son.
not_available Does that mean you approve? 
not_available I've seen you glow whenever he's around.

not_available Get him some soft restraints.

not_available So the colon cancer spread? Yeah.
not_available They said it could happen.
not_available I didn't respond to chemo.
not_available We should tap your belly.
not_available That's pretty tender.
not_available Could I interest you in some morphine? 
not_available Really? Last time they wouldn't give it to me until I saw the surgeon.
not_available Well, nobody should sit around in pain.
not_available You've been paying attention on rounds, huh? Be back with the morphine.
not_available What's this? 
not_available Nursing schedule.
not_available You need to be monitored.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available You know the drill.
not_available Let's hook you up.

not_available Connie, page the renal fellow.
not_available This guy needs dialysis.
not_available All right.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Know who shot him? 
not_available No.
not_available Probably a drug deal gone bad.
not_available Abby, glove up.
not_available You're gonna put in a central line.
not_available On my count.
not_available One.

not_available spine.
not_available There's gray matter everywhere.
not_available Start mannitol and hyperventilate.
not_available We have an organ donor here.
not_available BP's 80 palp.
not_available Let's get his pressure up.
not_available Is this a good angle? Aim it towards the sternal notch.
not_available Hit the clavicle.
not_available March it down slowly until you slip under the bone.
not_available Lower the angle or you'll give him a pneumothorax.
not_available I'm up against the bone.

not_available He needs dialysis.
not_available Dialysis is not used in Benadryl overdose.
not_available I read a case where hemoperfusion worked.
not_available Extra
not_available corporeal elimination won't work.
not_available We should try.
not_available I'm not putting this man at risk for hemolysis for an unproven procedure you read about.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available This is not a renal case.
not_available Like hell it isn't.
not_available Push more bicarb? 
not_available Won't help.
not_available Run of seven.
not_available Damn it.
not_available I'll write the dialysis orders.
not_available A nephrologist has to do that.
not_available The article says exactly what to do.
not_available Kerry did hemoperfusion on an O.D.
not_available We should do it.
not_available I know this will work.
not_available Write out the orders.

not_available Exam 2 is set up for charcoal hemoperfusion for that O.D.
not_available Good.
not_available Keep me posted.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Dropped his pressure.
not_available Lily, two more units.
not_available You don't have much time.
not_available I know.
not_available We need to get him to the O.R.
not_available You find his family? 
not_available It's a phony license.
not_available Kids buy them on the street.
not_available Has he been reported missing? 
not_available Sent his photo out.
not_available So far, nothing.
not_available We need that consent.
not_available Pressure's up to 90.
not_available That's encouraging.
not_available It could take hours to line up the procurement teams.
not_available Be realistic.
not_available I'll save five lives with his organs.
not_available He could arrest.
not_available I won't let him.
not_available Let Kate sleep for an hour.

not_available You okay? 
not_available I contaminated my gloves.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Just give me another pair.
not_available Did Dr.
not_available Krupp say why he's using citrate? He always uses heparin.
not_available I'll page him.
not_available He say when to check an A.C.T.? Do it 30 minutes into the run.
not_available I better check.
not_available He's very particular.
not_available Dori, these aren't his orders.
not_available He won't help us.
not_available We got them from a journal.
not_available I won't do this without him.
not_available His complexes are narrowing.
not_available I'll lose my job.
not_available Save his life.
not_available No.
not_available We're stopping.
not_available I'll take responsibility.
not_available Carter, can you explain? 
not_available I told you about it.
not_available He told you nephrology said no? 
not_available It's working.
not_available Let us finish.
not_available Carter, step out.
not_available Carol, monitor his vitals.
not_available Keep the dialysis going.
not_available Sorry, Dori.
not_available I'll speak with the renal service.
not_available You have a problem, come to me.
not_available He's improving.
not_available You didn't give me

not_available I can handle this.
not_available It's your first day back.
not_available Mark, we need you.
not_available I wanna know everything you do.

not_available No.
not_available I want to stay with the baby.
not_available Come on, honey.
not_available Please.
not_available Can I stay with my baby? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Still normal sinus.
not_available How long? 
not_available Until your lytes come back.
not_available And my patients? 
not_available Told the unit you took a sick day.
not_available Then I guess I'm your prisoner.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Greene? He's supposed to help me.
not_available He's in Trauma.
not_available I can do it.
not_available Kim, this is Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available I've numbed the left quadrant.
not_available Use a Z
not_available track so it won't leak.
not_available And what labs should I send off? Cell count, glucose, protein, Gram's stain, and culture.
not_available Thanks.
not_available No problem.
not_available There's the fluid.
not_available Good flow.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be in Exam 4.
not_available Well, it wasn't so bad.
not_available Actually, it's starting to hurt.
not_available I'll readjust the catheter.
not_available If I were you, I'd order an upright chest film, stat.
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available In V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge the paddles to 20.
not_available Bag her.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Septic or meningitis.

not_available I can come back.
not_available Charge.

not_available 12.
not_available He's off pressors.
not_available Clear.
not_available Go on.
not_available Can I extubate him? 
not_available Charging.
not_available In a half hour.
not_available Clear.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Checking labs.
not_available No patients allowed.
not_available He's a nurse.
not_available I let him.
not_available Frank, why are you here? 
not_available My labs came back.
not_available Your patient has a low sodium.
not_available That's all the water I drank.
not_available Just need to fluid
not_available restrict.
not_available Let's go back to bed.
not_available She wants to keep me here.
not_available He's a piece of work.
not_available You're not? What's that mean? Eating cereal out of an emesis basin? Randi, did my nanny call again? 
not_available No, thank God.
not_available What is that? Nothing around except cereal and a jar of milk.
not_available A jar of milk? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, God, Malucci! What? 
not_available Resume compressions.
not_available She's in V
not_available fib.

not_available Last epi? 
not_available Four minutes.
not_available Another cc.
not_available Get a court order? Not in this case.
not_available I'll keep him up till we find family.
not_available Fine.
not_available Shock again.
not_available Clear.
not_available The black stripe is air under the diaphragm.
not_available The needle perforated the colon.
not_available It hurts like hell.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available Perforation is a known complication of the procedure.
not_available What do we do now? 
not_available We could operate to repair the defect.
not_available How long will I be in the hospital? A week.
not_available But then a two
not_available month recovery.
not_available Doc, they don't expect me to live that long.
not_available What happens if I don't have the operation? The hole could seal off.
not_available But you'd probably develop an infection, peritonitis.
not_available And then I'd die.
not_available Yeah.
not_available More atropine.
not_available Pacer pads ready.
not_available Holding compressions.
not_available Still flatline.
not_available CBC and lytes are normal.

not_available Come on.
not_available Still no capture.
not_available Turn up the rate.
not_available Can't feel a pulse.
not_available More epi? How many rounds so far? 
not_available Seven.
not_available Stop bagging.
not_available That's it.
not_available We're done.
not_available Clean up the baby before I bring in the mother.
not_available I don't want the surgery.
not_available It's the only way
not_available I understand.
not_available But I don't want another surgery.
not_available Well, then we
not_available We could treat you with antibiotics and hope for the best.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Would you excuse me? I'll be right back.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Aren't we supposed to fix our mistakes? Usually.
not_available Your patient has end
not_available stage cancer.
not_available Sugery is only going to prolong is suffering.
not_available You have to respect his wishes.
not_available He's gonna die because I made a mistake.
not_available He's gonna die anyway.
not_available We need you over here.
not_available What is it? Doctor, please help me.
not_available My baby.
not_available Give her something? 
not_available No.
not_available My baby.
not_available Pilar.

not_available Pilar, she's dead.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Cops found him under the El.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Kiss my ass.
not_available Start a banana bag, order a head CT and prep him for sutures.
not_available What do you got? 
not_available CVA and two new patients to present.
not_available And Frank's workup? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available He saw us get slammed so he pitched in.
not_available There's a complication with my colon
not_available cancer patient.
not_available Thought I was gonna supervise.
not_available You were busy.
not_available I asked Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available If you'd given a history, you'd have tapped the midline 
not_available instead of perfing the bowel.
not_available He spiked a fever.
not_available He's septic.
not_available Make sure he's comfortable now.
not_available I'd like to stay with him.
not_available We need you here.
not_available Nurses can take care of him.
not_available After your shift, go to Pathology and practice procedures with Dr.
not_available Upton.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, got a live one here! What happened? I'm feeding my buddy's Gila monster, when it bites me.
not_available He won't let go.
not_available We have to kill it? 
not_available As a last resort.
not_available Grab a couple of vascular clamps.
not_available I'm not going near that thing.
not_available I got it.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Please, don't hurt him.
not_available I'll do my best.
not_available Those jaws are awfully strong.
not_available Malucci, get ready to catch him.
not_available In what? Grab a kick bucket.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Nice and easy.
not_available Do it together.
not_available Almost.
not_available Almost.
not_available There! Now what do I do? 
not_available Call Animal Control or the zoo.
not_available Need some help? Why don't you monitor his vitals, three grams of Unasyn and irrigate the wound.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He's on dopamine and Levophed.
not_available He won't last.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Charge the paddles.
not_available No, he's a DNR.
not_available Let me code him.
not_available It's futile.
not_available I'm pushing lidocaine.
not_available You're tying up nurses and a trauma room on a case going nowhere.
not_available Stop.
not_available His organs are viable.
not_available His family would want some good out of this.
not_available Normal sinus.
not_available Want a lidocaine drip? 
not_available I'll start one.
not_available Don't keep flogging him.
not_available I mean it.
not_available He's a DNR.
not_available Labs are back from Trauma 2.
not_available Tox screen's positive for amphetamines.
not_available Let me see.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available What? 
not_available It's the baby.
not_available She was killed with amphetamines? The labs came back on Estrella.
not_available She tested positive for amphetamines.
not_available My baby died from drugs? Could anyone have given something to her? 
not_available No one has drugs at home.
not_available Know anyone who uses? Friends or relatives? Pilar, what is it? 
not_available I work two jobs.
not_available I get so tired, I take something to stay awake.
not_available But I never bring it home.
not_available Are you nursing the baby? Pilar, do you nurse your baby? The drugs are in the breast milk.
not_available I love my baby.
not_available I would never hurt her.
not_available God forgive me, I would never hurt her.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Really, I didn't know.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available Mother, are you there? I'm involved in a case.
not_available I can't make it for coffee, so page me.
not_available I completely forgot to give you a message.
