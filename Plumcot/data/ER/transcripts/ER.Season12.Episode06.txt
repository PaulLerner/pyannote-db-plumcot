not_available R.
not_available Previously on E.
not_available R Who are you? 
not_available Victor Clemente.
not_available Your new Attending.
not_available And congratulations, doc.
not_available You just killed me.
not_available Look, I know what happened in Newark.
not_available And I really do not want a repeat here, okay? I hear you're getting out today.
not_available If you thought it stunk to work here, try being a patient.
not_available Zoe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you know what you're doing? 
not_available Yeah, I know what I'd like to do.
not_available I'm your half
not_available brother.
not_available Good to meet you, man.
not_available This is my wife, Evelyn.
not_available My daughter, Jocelyn.
not_available This is Greg.
not_available My son.
not_available You don't wanna have anything to do with me.
not_available What about your little brother? 
not_available Don't use him like that.
not_available I'm trying here.
not_available Then stop.
not_available Getting ready for a roast? 
not_available We gotta clean this place up.
not_available Gallant won't be here for three days.
not_available It's gonna take a week to disinfect.
not_available I want it nice for him.
not_available He's been there a long time.
not_available Come on, we're gonna be late.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hi, I'm Zoe.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I remember.
not_available You have a cool place.
not_available Thin walls, though.
not_available Oh, sometimes we really get it going.
not_available Have you seen my toothbrush? Sorry.
not_available Keep it.
not_available I have gum.
not_available You're just leaving her here? Afraid she's gonna steal something? 
not_available She already took my toothbrush.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available She'll lock up.
not_available You gave her keys? 
not_available It's different with Zoe.
not_available There's something real between us.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Real loud.
not_available Wouldn't admit him because what? Too young? Yeah, we got a NICU but it's not exactly SOP.
not_available "SOP"? Standard operating procedure.
not_available It's military talk.
not_available Ah.
not_available That must mean you like him.
not_available Haha
not_available ha.
not_available It's gonna take a little more than that.
not_available All right, all right.
not_available But you owe me, man.
not_available Lockhart? 
not_available Abby.
not_available Incoming.
not_available I need a room with a warmer set up for an infant, Miller 1 and a 2.5.
not_available Yeah, but
not_available We got it, thanks.
not_available You can see it in his eyes.
not_available It's starting to sink in on the poor sucker.
not_available What is? 
not_available That he actually works here.
not_available Hmm.
not_available This is a special case.
not_available Needs to be treated on the DL, you follow? Is it your illegitimate love child? Try to be cool, okay? Nineweek
not_available old, two days vomiting, diarrhea, fever.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available Tachy.
not_available Couldn't get a BP.
not_available How about a sat? 
not_available Probe wouldn't stick to the fur.
not_available Easy, easy.
not_available Lockhart, this is Darwin.
not_available That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen.
not_available Okay, folks, the good news is the hospital has approved 
4 1 ratios.
not_available Finally.
not_available That means extra full
not_available time equivalents and zero, zero, tolerance for excessive OT.
not_available Let's hope we have enough people to fill those shifts.
not_available Sam, you got a haircut.
not_available No.
not_available It's just highlights.
not_available Good morning, ER staff.
not_available So it's true.
not_available We're not alone.
not_available What's going on? Well, this device was designed to offer remote surgical consults.
not_available So since I'm still at home recovering thought I'd give it a test drive.
not_available Okay.
not_available Meeting ' s over.
not_available Nurses, for the sake of the trial, I'm gonna need a few things.
not_available I miss the Bronx.
not_available This is why I don't have cable.
not_available How are you doing that? 
not_available I have a joystick in my lap.
not_available All right, that is too much information.
not_available Sam, we're gonna be in sutures.
not_available You need help? 
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available We got it.
not_available Morning, Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Some kid in triage asking for you.
not_available Tell him to take a number.
not_available He says he knows you.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Set him up in 2, okay? Okay.
not_available Haleh, walk with me.
not_available You sure like to walk.
not_available Remember that little chat we had? No more OT.
not_available I did what I promised.
not_available You're picking up extra time by taking shifts in ICU.
not_available You never said I couldn't.
not_available I also didn't say you couldn't flip burgers or turn tricks in Lincoln Park.
not_available Excuse me? It's overtime.
not_available You know what I'm talking about.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available Okay, his temperature's only 94.
not_available I must have skipped school the day they taught monkey veins.
not_available Word is you give good neonate.
not_available Human neonate, Dr.
not_available Moreau.
not_available Bet you didn't know chimps and humans share 96 percent of their DNA.
not_available I know, it's fascinating.
not_available So this is what 
happened Darwin's handler calls me up and tells me that the vet's kind of nervous.
not_available He figures this little guy's best shot is with me.
not_available Oh, of course he does.
not_available Tachy, carotid's weak.
not_available This handler, he knows you because you went to clown school together? How did you guess? No, I'm serious.
not_available I was at NYU while he was at Ringling Bros.
not_available I had kind of a circus thing.
not_available Okay.
not_available We need access, Lockhart.
not_available Right.
not_available Abby.
not_available I'll try to find a transilluminator.
not_available Is there anyone else we can trust? 
not_available What are we doing? I'm an attending.
not_available I can't spend all day with a chimp.
not_available I know.
not_available So, what are we doing? Go, go, go.
not_available Okay, okay, go, go.
not_available Don't forget to knock, okay? Please, go.
not_available I heard you have a baby there.
not_available You need help? No.
not_available I
not_available We got it.
not_available Is it cute? 
not_available Yes, it's a hairy little monkey.
not_available I love babies.
not_available Babies love me.
not_available I have a way with them.
not_available Can you get me a transilluminator? 
not_available I'm like the wind.
not_available Oh, hey, Neela.
not_available Do you have a minute? 
not_available We could use an extra set of hands.
not_available "We"? Clemente and I have a patient.
not_available Sure.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available Transilluminator was MIA, but I Forget that, I got a 24 into the antecube.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? You two do realize that's a monkey.
not_available Chimp, actually.
not_available Ninety
not_available six percent human.
not_available Who knew? So how did this happen? I was just horsing around.
not_available Looks like you did a bit more than that.
not_available I got in a fight.
not_available Where? At school? No, at home.
not_available With Dad.
not_available Did he hit you? 
not_available No, man, he doesn't do that.
not_available So, what were you fighting about? I always felt there was something going on in my house I didn't know about.
not_available Then I met you, and I got it.
not_available It was like
not_available It was like a cloud was lifted.
not_available But the cloud came back.
not_available You mean, because I cut off Charlie? 
not_available Not just him, man, you cut me off too.
not_available I don't want it to be like that.
not_available I mean, ain't we brothers? This may be worse off than it looks.
not_available Sounds like they need this room for an actual patient.
not_available Thing they share with humans is a tendency to get sepsis as neonates.
not_available So let's go with a CBC, D
not_available stick, cultures, portable chest and 20 cc's per kilo bolus.
not_available Oh, that's all? No Foley, no LP? Tap might be jumping the gun, but Foley's not a bad idea.
not_available Hold on a second.
not_available Hello, Dr.
not_available Clemente? 
not_available Yes, Eve.
not_available We 're over here in Trauma 2 with our friend Jessie who has multiple fractures from a fall.
not_available We were just wondering if it would be possible for you to get your ass in here.
not_available All right, all right, all right.
not_available Shake a leg, okay? Because if this chimp gets sepsis, he could crump at any minute.
not_available And lock the door.
not_available We should take core temp.
not_available I'm not sticking anything up this monkey's ass.
not_available If I had a nickel for every time I said thatHow about we flip for it? 
not_available Fine.
not_available The transilluminator's missing a bulb but I thought I'd give you a little help with this sweet little
not_available Hah! By all that is good and holy what diabolical spell have you cast on this child? Dr.
not_available Pratt, can you sign off on this chart? Who's it for? 
not_available The kid in 2, got into it with his father.
not_available Wait.
not_available What? 
not_available Social work's in with him now.
not_available You weren't supposed to do a chart.
not_available I have to.
not_available No, it's not like that.
not_available Eve's strict with this stuff.
not_available Suspicion of abuse, I have to call them in.
not_available I don't need any help.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available That's not how it looks.
not_available Why do I gotta go through this with her? 
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Liz Dade, social work.
not_available Can I talk to you outside? 
not_available When I'm finished.
not_available The thing is
not_available I'm not finished yet.
not_available Well, I think you should be.
not_available Look, the nurse jumped the gun, okay? I know this family.
not_available It's a stable home.
not_available It's an innocent argument.
not_available The kid got a little too steamed.
not_available Is that so? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And nobody hit anybody? 
not_available I just got real mad at a chair.
not_available That's not gonna do it.
not_available Okay, look here, all right.
not_available He's my brother.
not_available Okay? 
not_available His brother? Yeah.
not_available Same last name, check it out.
not_available Why didn't you just say so? I'll do a follow
not_available up phone call.
not_available Sally.
not_available Tom Cruise? Retarded.
not_available Sally.
not_available Sammy Sosa's retarded.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Sam.
not_available Ah! Yeah, I just 
not_available No, that's all right.
not_available How retarded was that, huh? Listen, I overheard you talking to Inez.
not_available Oh.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available It's just sometimes she needs a little guidance.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available I'm actually really impressed.
not_available You have fantastic interpersonal skills.
not_available The younger nurses respect you, the older ones trust you.
not_available Oh.
not_available Thanks.
not_available So I think it's time you moved up the ladder.
not_available What ladder? 
not_available Nursing administration.
not_available I'm pretty happy doing what I'm doing.
not_available Job wouldn't change much.
not_available You'd help out with staff education, implementing policies and procedures.
not_available Sounds like a lot of work.
not_available There'd be a big pay hike.
not_available How big? ShoppingonMichigan
not_available Avenue big.
not_available Well, if you put it that way When do I start? Right away.
not_available First thing I need you to do is fire Haleh.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What? 
not_available Welcome to management.
not_available Eve.
not_available Is it done? 
not_available No.
not_available Inez, how's that new pulse ox probe working out? Fine.
not_available I'm not gonna fire Haleh.
not_available Hey, management's a bitch.
not_available Yeah, not the only one.
not_available You know, Haleh's been warned three times, twice in writing.
not_available She has? 
not_available With all the OT she's doing we could hire two nurses and still have enough for a wet bar in the lounge.
not_available Well, then let's counsel her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're confusing me with Oprah.
not_available Dr.
not_available Clemente, did you sign in this patient in sutures? No, no, no.
not_available VIP.
not_available What, is he the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama or something? No, no, it's a privacy issue kind of thing.
not_available Well, he still needs to be tracked.
not_available Give me a name, any name.
not_available Darwin.
not_available Darwin what? Magilla.
not_available Are you gonna need a NICU bed? No, no, because we were transferring him back to the referring facility.
not_available It's closer to where he lives.
not_available The mom doesn't drive.
not_available I'm not doing it.
not_available I don't need the job that bad.
not_available Either way, Haleh's gonna go.
not_available But she's a great nurse.
not_available You've never fired anyone before.
not_available No.
not_available All right, okay.
not_available It's a new skill, it needs to be developed.
not_available We'll do it together.
not_available What? 
not_available Cheer up.
not_available It won't be so bad.
not_available Listen, my EMT trainees are waiting for their 12
not_available lead class.
not_available I'll come find you after.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, you left the door open.
not_available All right.
not_available So, doctors, what's the status report? Heart rate's down.
not_available He's on 100 percent room air.
not_available Took 8 ounces PO.
not_available Oh, that's great.
not_available Good little guy.
not_available Good little guy.
not_available Let's ship him out before they put us on a psych hold.
not_available Shouldn't we keep him a while? 
not_available Yeah, for observation.
not_available He's awfully young.
not_available Guys, guys, it's just a bad viral GE.
not_available That's all.
not_available We should recheck the cultures.
not_available A vet can do that.
not_available Well, he's gonna need another round of antibiotics.
not_available I thought you didn't like monkeys.
not_available I never said that.
not_available And anyway, he's not a monkey.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't know if I'm touched or if I'm nauseous, but you know what? We're done here.
not_available So D/C the lock and let's get a move on.
not_available There's a giraffe out there clogging up triage.
not_available Twelveyear
not_available old crushed under scaffolding.
not_available What's your name, little man? 
not_available Barry.
not_available Is my pop all right? Chest injury, respiratory distress, vitals stable.
not_available What happened to his father? 
not_available Everything fell.
not_available Had an Ml trying to dig him out.
not_available Ray, that's you.
not_available I'll check on him.
not_available Both lungs up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Cardiac arrest during exertion.
not_available Downtime? Maybe 12 minutes.
not_available Shocked him three times with epi and atropine.
not_available Full compressions.
not_available Pulse is V
not_available tach.
not_available Let's go, let's go.
not_available Okay, kiddo, deep breath now.
not_available It hurts.
not_available A little bit of stridor here.
not_available Pulse ox 92.
not_available Chest, C
not_available spine, pelvis, CBC.
not_available You hang in there, Bar.
not_available Thank you, ma'am.
not_available Chem
not_available 7, UA, type and screen.
not_available Five hundred cc saline bolus.
not_available Okay.
not_available Simon says squeeze my fingers, pal.
not_available Good man.
not_available Now wiggle those toes for me.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Oh! I didn't say "Simon says.
not_available " Shock again at 360.
not_available Rhythm.
not_available I got a pulse.
not_available Check the BP.
not_available It's hard to keep track of the Splenda in here.
not_available Pupils sluggish but reactive.
not_available Let's hope for neurological function.
not_available God.
not_available What, no response? BP's 100 over 70.
not_available His GCS is only 3.
not_available Fellas, if we save the heart and lose the brain, we might as well go home.
not_available Worsening respiratory distress in here.
not_available Okay, I'm coming.
not_available Pop! Pop! We need to paralyze and intubate.
not_available Yeah, hold on.
not_available Is he okay? He will be.
not_available Why is he so stridorous? Laryngeal injury? No.
not_available No neck injury, no midline shift.
not_available Okay, give me some lido and a towel clip.
not_available Clavicle's displaced? I think it's compressing the trachea.
not_available He needs an airway right now.
not_available Draw up etomidate and sux.
not_available Don't push anything yet.
not_available Pratt.
not_available So, Barry, what's your dad building? Our dream house.
not_available Oh, yeah? It's for my mom.
not_available That sounds nice, buddy.
not_available Okay, buddy, you're gonna feel a little stick here.
not_available I'm helping him.
not_available Pratt, push the etomidate.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I just need to get a good grip.
not_available Okay.
not_available So, Barry, what kind of house is it? Craftsman.
not_available Ah! Is he all right? Sats coming up.
not_available Pulse is normalizing.
not_available Vitals are stable, tenderness over the lower ribs.
not_available Get a CT abdomen and chest.
not_available What's next door? V 
not_available tach arrest.
not_available We got him back.
not_available Is that a robot doctor? Oh, yeah.
not_available We're very advanced here.
not_available How's it going? 
not_available He's not waking up.
not_available We've got ROSC without RONF.
not_available Come again? Return of spontaneous circulation without return of neurologic function.
not_available The downtime was over 10 minutes.
not_available Not good enough for brain cells.
not_available Cath lab? 
not_available No, I don't think so.
not_available All he's got is a little ST depression.
not_available I think ICU.
not_available No, no, not yet.
not_available We're gonna go with a portable chest 
not_available and a cardiac echo.
not_available What for? A little ditty I like to call "induced hypothermia.
not_available " I'll be right back.
not_available How you doing? Me? I'm okay.
not_available The board's not too backed up.
not_available You need anything? No.
not_available I'm good.
not_available I kind of like this new energy.
not_available You mean Eve? She's tough, but it's gonna be good for all of us in the long run.
not_available Yeah, I hope so.
not_available This new nurse manager's working out, huh? She's a terrorist, Neela.
not_available Zoe.
not_available Hi.
not_available Heh.
not_available Are you looking for Ray? Oh, no.
not_available Actually, I was hoping you could help me.
not_available Where did you get this thing? I stole it from the last place I worked at.
not_available Hey, but that's between us, okay? How cold do you set it? Thirty
not_available three degrees centigrade.
not_available Which many consider dangerous.
not_available We're decreasing his metabolism? Six percent per degree centigrade.
not_available Might get his brain started again.
not_available What about effect on oxygen demand in low
not_available flow regions? The studies show a 23 percent improvement in neurologic outcome.
not_available Yeah, I'm familiar with the literature.
not_available Okay, that's it.
not_available I'm done arguing with a television set.
not_available It's believed to suppress radical formation
not_available Did you just call me a television set? That's pretty funny.
not_available This isn't surgical consult, my friend.
not_available It's believed to suppress radical formation
not_available If you can't come to work, I don't see why we should listen to you.
not_available You little mechanical bitch.
not_available It kind of burns when I pee.
not_available It sounds like a bladder infection.
not_available Oh, I figured.
not_available You can get it from many things, like having sex.
not_available A lot.
not_available I've been doing that.
not_available Don't I know it.
not_available Look, I hope you don't mind.
not_available I just didn't wanna ask Ray to do this, you know.
not_available It's fine.
not_available I'll need a urine sample and run some tests but first I'll need to get some information.
not_available Name? Butler.
not_available Zoe Butler.
not_available Okay.
not_available Address? Okay.
not_available Date of birth? December 12th 1990.
not_available Sorry? 
not_available December 12th.
not_available No, I know Almost 15.
not_available My birthday's coming up.
not_available Heh.
not_available When will he wake up? Soon, we hope.
not_available He cheated.
not_available On a business trip, with some lady from work.
not_available When my mom found out, she wouldn't let him come home for a month.
not_available He lived in a hotel.
not_available You know, parents make mistakes too.
not_available He's trying to make it up to her.
not_available Is that what the house is for? He wants everything back the way it was.
not_available Barry.
not_available Are you okay? Yeah, Mom.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available He's got some broken bones and a small injury to his liver but we don't think he'll need surgery.
not_available And Paul? Your husband's had a heart attack.
not_available His brain's been deprived of oxygen.
not_available We're doing our best to help wake him up.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's the big hurry? 
not_available Zoe's here.
not_available She's in Exam 2.
not_available She is? 
not_available Yes, she is.
not_available Oh, and I almost forgot, she's 14 years old.
not_available Shut up.
not_available She was born in 1990, Ray.
not_available What? That's the decade immediately preceding the one that we're in.
not_available Are you for real? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And in prison math, I believe 14 equals five to ten.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available Exam 2.
not_available And here's the kicker, Jerry 
Lee Your prepubescent penis pal has chlamydia.
not_available I had no idea she was that young.
not_available Young? She's still teething.
not_available Although, I don't know, maybe you enjoy that.
not_available She didn't say anything.
not_available How was I supposed to know? Take her out for a coffee, converse with her a bit before you start boffing and handing out house keys.
not_available I don't card my dates, okay? 
not_available Maybe it's time you started.
not_available 1990? 
not_available It was a very good year for chlamydia.
not_available Why didn't you tell me? I thought it was a bladder infection from all the sex we were having.
not_available No.
not_available God, not that.
not_available Why didn't you tell me how old you are? Well, you never asked.
not_available Heh.
not_available You said you were a student.
not_available I am.
not_available In what, ninth grade? Eighth.
not_available But I didn't think you'd like me if you knew.
not_available Well, you know, you're right.
not_available Because I also don't like courtrooms and prisons and men named Hank who'd make me their bitch.
not_available What is the big deal? We like each other.
not_available It's fun.
not_available Wait, who's Hank? Zoe, I'm gonna give you a prescription for doxycycline for the chlamydia.
not_available You're gonna need to be tested for a bunch of other STDs, okay? Like gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV
not_available Sure, whatever.
not_available And under the circumstances, no parental consent is required.
not_available That's good.
not_available Wonder who I got it from.
not_available Not me.
not_available Heh.
not_available How many other candidates are there? Wait, were we being monogamous? 
not_available Starting to shiver.
not_available All right, try 25 of Demerol, IV push.
not_available Is his wife coming in? 
not_available Not just yet.
not_available Sam.
not_available Ready? For what? 
not_available Haleh's in the family room.
not_available Go ahead, I got this.
not_available I'll push the meds.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Wait a second.
not_available Can we not do this? It's wrong.
not_available You think I find this enjoyable? Firing Haleh will send a message to every nurse in this joint.
not_available Joint? We're not in jail, Eve.
not_available No, but it should feel like we are.
not_available Haleh.
not_available Is something wrong? Well, we've had quite a few meetings about your overtime, right, Haleh? And I've discussed those meetings with Sam.
not_available Right, Sam? Yeah, I guess.
not_available Haleh you are a wonderful nurse.
not_available And I'm sure that you're gonna continue to do great work.
not_available But It's gonna have to be at some other hospital.
not_available Excuse me? It's just that you've been warned three times and We're gonna have to let you go.
not_available You're not serious.
not_available Is she serious? You can report to HR tomorrow.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available And you can turn in your badge and you'll collect your last paycheck.
not_available Sam.
not_available Oh, Haleh, I'm so sorry.
not_available You just getting out? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I read some magazines.
not_available Never realized a human esophagus could be so complex.
not_available Hey, look, man.
not_available You know, I'm sorry about all of this.
not_available But you got to understand, it's like this because of the choices that Charlie made.
not_available It's not all me.
not_available Dad's a hard guy to figure.
not_available I think maybe some stuff happened that he never talked about.
not_available Maybe so.
not_available I think there's some stuff you don't know too, Greg.
not_available Some stuff that maybe your mom didn't tell you the truth about.
not_available Is that what he told you? Yeah.
not_available Radiology faxed down these results.
not_available I just got here, Frank.
not_available What patient? It's me, actually.
not_available I had a mammogram last week.
not_available It's normal.
not_available Oh.
not_available Hey, congratulations.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available The kid in 1 's stable.

not_available Anybody says " next of kin, " I'm gonna lose it.
not_available I think you've already lost it.
not_available Because I tried to help a guy and it didn't work out? Just game over, that's all.
not_available In it this far, why not let the mother in? 
not_available There's no need.
not_available There was no need to treat a chimp, but here we are.
not_available The chimp was sick.

not_available Forget it.
not_available You guys are getting carried away with this.

there I still have a ways to go with my recovery.
not_available Where'd you get your surgery? County.
not_available Must be downstairs.
not_available It'll only take a minute.
not_available Excuse me for a minute.
not_available Why didn't you tell me about Evelyn? That she was the one at County that day.
not_available Maybe I could've helped.
not_available You didn't seem in the mood for helping.
not_available Here.
not_available A bunch of things I sent your mother that she sent back.
not_available A few notes she wrote me.
not_available And this.
not_available An act of mercy, her sending me that picture.
not_available I don't even remember when this was taken.
not_available I made mistakes, Greg.
not_available I never denied it.
not_available Got busted for some stupid petty stuff and went away for a while.
not_available Regretted it ever since.

not_available He's blinking on command, starting to move his fingers.
not_available See, sometimes you're good and then sometimes you're lucky.
not_available Which one is this? 
not_available This is "sometimes you're not sure.
not_available " We're waiting on ICU.
not_available Good, good.
not_available Hey.
not_available Why don't you go bring his kid in? Yeah.
not_available Hey.
not_available You know, patients come and go.
not_available And some days, some of them don't even register to me.
not_available So how is it that a hairy little chimp crumps on the table and it's like? In any case, it sounds like you'll forgive me.
not_available For what? 
not_available Well There's gonna be some kind of disciplinary suspension.
not_available What, did Eve found out? 
not_available She's not an animal lover.
not_available No, more like an animal strangler.
not_available It's funny, because when I was a kid, I always wanted a robot and a monkey.
not_available That doesn't shock me.
not_available No, no, I'm serious.
not_available Me too.
not_available Well, I'm over it.

not_available I used to play out here.
not_available She would watch me from the window.
not_available So you tried to come back.
not_available She pushed you away.
not_available She lied to you.
not_available She lied to me.
not_available And no, I didn't know any of it.
not_available But the question is, what did you do to make her hate you so much? I got into trouble.
not_available Maybe she felt she was protecting you.
not_available When I got out of the pen, I wanted us to be a family.
not_available I was still a kid when she died.
not_available What about then? I was living in Gary with Evelyn.
not_available I came here to find you.
not_available But they told me you had gone to Detroit with your cousin's people.
not_available So you gave up? That was the biggest mistake of all.
not_available But I had a second life that I was trying to hold together.
not_available I've done my penance.
not_available I do it every day.
not_available But there's only one person I still need forgiveness from.
not_available I hear you.
not_available I hear everything that you say.
not_available But you and me, we're here now.
not_available None of that other stuff matters anymore.
not_available Because even if the story's more complicated than the one I spent the last 20 years believing you still were not there for me.
not_available And I don't give a damn why or who said what.
not_available Hey, Greg
not_available You were not here.
not_available Please listen to me.
not_available And we can never change that.
