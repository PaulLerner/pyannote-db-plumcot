not_available Who's your Resident? 
not_available I suppose I'll find out in a minute.
not_available Why? Did you vie for me? You're too much for me to handle.
not_available Hopefully, whoever I get feels the same way.

not_available No.
not_available So why are you putting them on now?

not_available Trade secret.
not_available Can you get a cup of ice, please? 
not_available Sure.
not_available We're out of gloves.

not_available You didn't even move.
not_available Lucy.
not_available The blood gas.

not_available I'm regular, not a machine.
not_available You gonna do a pregnancy test? 
not_available You're really sweating this.
not_available Aren't you? A little? 
not_available I don't feel pregnant.
not_available Have you been pregnant before? I shouldn't have said anything.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Syncope.
not_available Fourth episode.
not_available Seizure? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available You want to use the Pedes room? No waiting.

not_available Transport's slow.
not_available Need the room?

not_available A diamond in his penis? Haleh said it was tricky getting in the Foley.
not_available Want to peek? 
not_available I've seen one.
not_available I bet.
not_available Hey, watch it.
not_available It's your lucky day.
not_available It seems I'm your intern.
not_available You missed rounds.
not_available It's the first day.
not_available I wasn't sure how this would work.
not_available You need to be here at 5 a.m.
not_available Sharp.
not_available I hope you don't expect special treatment.
not_available I don't know what you've been told.
not_available This is more of a formality.
not_available Maybe for you.
not_available You're the only intern I have.
not_available Finish pre
not_available rounding before 6.
not_available I need all the vitals.
not_available T
not_available max, mental status, I's and O's.
not_available After rounds, check the labs and run down all x
not_available rays.
not_available Go over the x
not_available rays yourself.
not_available Don't trust the radiologist.
not_available Buff the electrolytes as needed.
not_available You take all floor calls.
not_available If we have clinic that day, you do H and P's.
not_available And, of course, all pre
not_available op 
orders CBC, lytes, UA, EKG, PT.
not_available I know how to pre
not_available op a patient, thank you.
not_available Good.
not_available If surgery's canceled because you miss a lab, it's your ass.
not_available We'll start with Mr.
not_available Anderson.
not_available I reduced his O2.
not_available Redraw an ABG in 30 minutes.
not_available Monitor urine output Q one hour.
not_available Advance drains on beds three and five.
not_available One, two and six need wetto
not_available dry dressing changes.
not_available You're serious? This is how it works.
not_available As third
not_available year, I'm busy operating.
not_available This stuff is not my job.
not_available But the scut has to be done, by an intern.
not_available I have three cases today.
not_available If you finish, you can scrub in for one.
not_available Oh, and this is for you.
not_available Interns wear short coats.
not_available Hold the elevator! Hold it! Are you all right? 
not_available I said, hold the elevator! Where are we? We got multiple stab wounds to the extremities.
not_available One in the forearm and chest.
not_available BP's 120/75.
not_available Pulse ox 99.
not_available Did the guy have friends? 
not_available Lungs are clear.
not_available Four plus right radial and ulnar pulses.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Bo.
not_available Bo, we'll take care of you.
not_available You're very lucky.
not_available The chest wound is superficial.
not_available Bo, do this with your hand.
not_available How about a car, Bo? Spread your fingers.
not_available Don't let me close them.
not_available I'm tired of this game.
not_available Tell me who it was.
not_available Does he have to be here? 
not_available Can you wait outside? You were stabbed in daylight.
not_available You didn't see anything? You know what? Wait outside.
not_available Okay, let's roll him.
not_available He'll try to settle this on his own.
not_available Now we have to treat him.
not_available You know what? Forget it.
not_available Have it your way.
not_available You could've pressed that hold button.
not_available Damn, these elevators are slow.
not_available I'm gonna catch that lunch traffic.
not_available I know it! Do you drive? 
not_available Do I? My son used to have one of those.
not_available Gave him a heart attack.
not_available Nothing but stress.
not_available Come on, come on.
not_available No, I didn't watch the whole thing.
not_available The part I saw looked benign.
not_available It was my fault.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Well, you did.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Problem? Did you know that Romeo and Juliet is PG13? 
not_available I wasn't aware of it.
not_available It is.
not_available I showed it at Rachel's slumber party.
not_available Now all the mothers are calling me.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Elizabeth! Can you come take a look at a pulseless foot? I've been waiting 40 minutes for a surgical consult.
not_available Normally, I would.
not_available But I'm only an intern.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available I don't want to believe it.
not_available I already have five admissions.
not_available Lab turnaround time is pathetic.
not_available And Radiology already lost three of my films.
not_available Dale has me sitting for a bleeding time on your Ewing's sarcoma amputation.
not_available Waste of time.
not_available Dana Ellis? 
not_available She doesn't have a clotting problem.
not_available Is that today? 
not_available Yes, surgery's at 4 p.m.
not_available Five minutes.
not_available 54year
not_available old male, peripheral vascular disease calf pain at rest.
not_available I'm thinking arterial thrombosis.
not_available Did you get a Doppler pulse? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr.
not_available Darcy, this is Dr.
not_available Corday, our Surgical Resident.
not_available How long will this keep me down? I choreograph a video next week.
not_available Let me examine you, and I'll have a clearer idea.
not_available Are you a smoker? What's that got to do with my leg? Is this the Vascular consult? 
not_available I asked Dr.
not_available Corday to examine.
not_available I'll take over.
not_available Did you get the labs on the perfed diverticulum? They're not ready yet.
not_available Better sit on them.
not_available You know Romano.
not_available Gotta start on time.
not_available Of course.
not_available Come on.
not_available Lucy? What?! Is something wrong? 
not_available No.
not_available Can you work up this guy with vertigo for me? You know how to check for cerebellar function? Find me when you're done.
not_available We'll discuss the differential.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's the extension for the morgue? 
not_available 5001.
not_available See this guy? He's looking for Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My brother died last night.
not_available They gave me his valuables.
not_available But something's missing.
not_available I need to get some jewelry off him.
not_available Oh, right! Right! 
not_available Your brother's down in the morgue.
not_available Last name Naughton? Definitely down in the morgue.
not_available Can you tell me how to get there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available No.
not_available They don't allow family down there.
not_available It's They make you wait.
not_available It takes forever.
not_available It's chilly.
not_available You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go down there and get it.
not_available Your brother.
not_available And bring your brother up here.
not_available Great.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't mention it.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Checking in on you.
not_available How you feeling? Well, they're chopping my leg off.
not_available Your decision? 
not_available You could call it that.
not_available I wouldn't have had a say at all if it wasn't for you.
not_available You gotta go with the odds, right? You scared? I thought, "Okay, I'll just get used to it." But In pain? A little.
not_available I'll tell them to increase the dosage.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I sort of like to feel it.
not_available It'll be gone in a few hours.
not_available Hello, Mr.
not_available Ellis.
not_available What's going on? I came to check in on Dana.
not_available She's being taken care of.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I wanted to talk to you about her pain.
not_available Dana's having surgery in a few hours.
not_available If you don't mind, Dr.
not_available Romano is gonna handle everything from here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Are you in charge of transport? Depends who's asking.
not_available I know this sounds weird.
not_available I was wondering if you by any chance found a body? Transport! Yeah, what floor? Okay.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Half
not_available hour.
not_available Damn! What did you want? 
not_available I lost a body.
not_available Did you try to move it yourself? 
not_available You guys were taking so long.
not_available What was I supposed to do? 
not_available It's our fault? No, it's not your fault.
not_available I just want to find the body.
not_available I'll call the morgue.
not_available I checked.
not_available He's not there.
not_available Yo, Gerald! Yo, it's Tony.
not_available Have any unclaimed bodies? Yeah, she's here now.
not_available Hold on, I'll ask.
not_available Would this body fit down the incinerator chute? The incinerator?! Yeah, that got her.
not_available Yo, thanks, G.
not_available Okay, I'll be right down.
not_available You're in luck.
not_available Someone stuffed some fat stiff in the closet of the ICU.
not_available Why? Why do you have to go? I just gotta.
not_available Well, what's the hurry? The doctor said it's okay.
not_available Well, it will be okay.
not_available He has to stitch it up first.
not_available Besides, I like having you around.
not_available There's not very many interesting people here today.
not_available So maybe I'll come back.
not_available You've gotta help me out.
not_available You'll get me in trouble.
not_available I'll write you a note.
not_available Besides, you do not want to get that infected.
not_available Just a few minutes.
not_available I'll get a doctor.
not_available We'll take care of it.
not_available All right.
not_available Good.
not_available Lynette? Yeah? Could you get his mother for me? 
not_available He's 18.
not_available He got stabbed.
not_available I'm afraid he'll bolt to settle the score.
not_available Mark! 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold on a minute.
not_available You admitting that thrombosis? He's got a high
not_available grade lesion.
not_available You taking him up? 
not_available I need to present him to Romano.
not_available Then we'll bring the team.
not_available When? 
not_available As soon as I can.
not_available Can you stitch Bo? He's antsy.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Can you clear this neck for me? He looks okay.
not_available I ordered a trauma panel.
not_available Sure.
not_available You got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available How are we doing? 
not_available Vitals are normal.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? 
not_available No.
not_available This really isn't necessary.
not_available Any chest or abdominal pain? Can I go home? We need to get an x
not_available ray of your neck first.
not_available Have you ever had hepatitis? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Why? Your eyes are a little yellow.
not_available On any medication? 
not_available Prednisone, cyclosporine, Imuran.
not_available Those are transplant meds.
not_available Well, I had a new liver two years ago.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's get a ProTime, LFTs and a cyclosporine level.
not_available Something's wrong? 
not_available Doctor! Doctor! One minute.
not_available You're jaundiced.
not_available I can go see my doctor.
not_available We need to do those tests now.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Here you go, Jeanie.
not_available Thanks.
not_available This is her card.
not_available Rosa Munoz.
not_available That's social security card.
not_available She said her name was Carmen.
not_available And your name? 
not_available Luisa.
not_available Her sister? 
not_available Cousins.
not_available I understand you're concerned.
not_available This would be fraud.
not_available It doesn't matter if he's illegal.
not_available No, that's her number.
not_available This is your card.
not_available No.
not_available She say that he need a special doctor? There could be a problem with Angel's heart.
not_available Please take this number.
not_available Other hospital no take him We're a county hospital.
not_available We treat all emergencies.
not_available True? 
not_available True.
not_available When we're short on beds, we stick the bodies in the storage room.
not_available Why didn't you call us? 
not_available We did.
not_available Guys, I gotta get back.
not_available You want to take him back? 
not_available He's black.
not_available Is that a problem? Dana Ellis.
not_available What about her? 
not_available I'm worried about phantom limb pain.
not_available Don't be.
not_available She's on morphine.
not_available That won't do it.
not_available I want her on a preemptive analgesia to rewire the motor nerves.
not_available She's still your patient? Dr.
not_available Greene's on line 3, waiting on a consult for an ischemic leg.
not_available Does he have a pulse by Doppler? 
not_available I'll check.
not_available It's a simple lumbar epidural.
not_available It'll put the surgery off a few days.
not_available One night course does not a pain management specialist make.
not_available The patient has a Doppler pulse.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene wants an ETA.
not_available When I get there! 
not_available There's no reason not to try.
not_available I don't know that she's psychologically ready.
not_available Three days won't make much difference.
not_available How's that new intern working out? 
not_available She'll get the hang of it.
not_available Let her scrub in.
not_available I'm gonna talk to the family.
not_available No, you're not! That girl has a cancer that could spread very rapidly.
not_available I won't sit idly by and watch you experiment with a technique you read! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano? 
not_available What?! You should talk to Greene.
not_available He wants something definitive.
not_available If the guy has calf pain, tell him to do an ultrasound.
not_available Don't go! Rule out DVT.
not_available That'll shut him up.
not_available Leave it alone! I have to go upstairs to this interview.
not_available Will you page me when Romano graces us with his presence? Don't hold your breath.
not_available You'll tear your stitches! Let me out! I gotta go! So you can get the guy that did this? What's going on? 
not_available Bo here wants to retaliate.
not_available You said the doc would stitch me up and I could go.
not_available We want you to be safe, Bo.
not_available Save it, lady.
not_available Look, thanks for fixing me! I'm going.
not_available If you want me to sign, I'll sign.
not_available You'll rip your vein open.
not_available I don't want you bleeding.
not_available Then take it out.
not_available You want to leave that bad, fine.
not_available Let me get the right instrument.
not_available You can go about your business.
not_available Please, wait here.
not_available Wait one minute.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available He can't leave.
not_available When's the mother getting here? 
not_available I haven't reached her.
not_available I'm calling Psych.
not_available He'll be gone by then.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Versed.
not_available I have to sedate him until the mother gets here.
not_available That might be an option if it wasn't unethical.
not_available Not with someone's life at stake.
not_available You can't restrain him with drugs.
not_available He was agitated.
not_available To finish the treatment, we had to sedate him.
not_available Security can keep him down here until Psych puts him on a hold.
not_available They'll have to prove that he's a danger to others.
not_available He knows the system.
not_available He'll lie.
not_available Maybe we'll find his mother.
not_available I'm gonna make sure.
not_available Not with that.
not_available You have a better idea? 
not_available I'll handle it.
not_available You know what he'll do if you don't.
not_available I understand your motive.
not_available I know I asked for your help.
not_available Why don't you stick with the clinic patients? Leave the ER ones to me.
not_available Good luck.
not_available It don't matter what I do.
not_available It's my business.
not_available I don't want you here again, maybe dead.
not_available If it goes down like that, it does.
not_available Wouldn't be the first time.
not_available You don't mean that.
not_available Yo, what's the renta
not_available cop doing here? So you can talk to somebody.
not_available I trusted you! 
not_available I'm trying to help you.
not_available Save it! I ain't talking to nobody.
not_available We'll wait until your mom gets here.
not_available My mom? You called my mom? 
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't let him leave.
not_available Pay attention, Dale.
not_available Peter's one of our fastest colon dissectors now that Lizzie's gun's in the holster.
not_available We've got an open abdomen, people.
not_available Let's turn up the heat, please.
not_available Elizabeth, would you retract the descending colon? My pleasure.
not_available Actually, Dale, why don't you retract and bovie and give Lizzie the sucker? Right.
not_available Lizzie, suck out this oozing area, would you? If you don't mind, I don't care for being called Lizzie.
not_available Really? Dr.
not_available Romano calls you that.
not_available Dale, what structure am I dissecting? 
not_available Ilioinguinal nerve.
not_available Elizabeth, would you help him out? Owing to the slight peristalsis, it's obviously the left ureter.
not_available Better get faster with that suction, Lizzie.
not_available I freed the sigmoid.
not_available Elizabeth, ligate the proximal side while I clamp the vessels.
not_available Certainly.
not_available Dale, move over and start irrigating.
not_available I prefer Dale do any ligating.
not_available Just as soon as we finish the mesenteric vessels.
not_available Sorry to bother you, Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene is calling again.
not_available Lizzie, I think you just contaminated yourself.
not_available I did not.
not_available Better be safe.
not_available Change gowns.
not_available I didn't contaminate myself.
not_available I saw it.
not_available She's clean.
not_available Thank you.
not_available So don't pick on her.
not_available Lizzie, scrub out and go pacify Greene, would you? You're still here? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're putting a lot of effort into this Pedes ER.
not_available I'll give you that.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Hey, guys.
not_available This is our new Pedes ER Attending and full
not_available time delivery boy, Doug Ross.
not_available What do you got for us? 
not_available You're cut off.
not_available This is Claudia Olson.
not_available She's a candidate for the new Chief of Emergency Medicine.
not_available A masochist? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Kerry Weaver.
not_available The Interim Chief? Yeah.
not_available It's nice to meet you.
not_available You're interviewing today as well? How did you guess? Well, at least I got to go first.
not_available It was nice to meet you.
not_available You too.
not_available It could be hepatitis.
not_available But our major concern is that you're rejecting the liver.
not_available Well, I feel fine.
not_available A little tired.
not_available Do you ever forget to take your meds? No.
not_available I set my watch daily.
not_available My cyclosporine level's therapeutic, isn't it? We should arrange for a liver biopsy.
not_available If it's all the same to you, I would rather see my own doctor.
not_available I understand.
not_available He hasn't said anything about your abnormal LFTs? I got busy, missed a couple of checkups.
not_available You know how important follow
not_available ups are after organ transplantation.
not_available I think part of me always suspected but didn't want to know for sure.
not_available Now I do.
not_available You can put yourself on the UNOS list again.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available It's the second time around.
not_available You qualified the first time.
not_available You could get lucky again.
not_available Do you have the Munoz kid? 
not_available I do, yes.
not_available Excuse me one more time.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is it cardiomyopathy? 
not_available He needs a full EP workup.
not_available Did he have an ectopy? The echo ruled out an outlet obstruction.
not_available The cause of his fainting? 
not_available It's probably arrhythmia.
not_available Arrhythmia.
not_available I'm going to try to induce it in a cath lab.
not_available If so, he'll need an internal cardioverter defibrillator.
not_available I'm glad we caught it.
not_available I'll call the surgeon.
not_available Can you get consent? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't thank me.
not_available The kid needs it.
not_available It's about time.
not_available Where's Romano? 
not_available Just me, I'm afraid.
not_available So can you admit him? Based on my responsibilities, I'd say no.
not_available So you're here to stall me.
not_available Something like that.
not_available I'll pass him through Radiology.
not_available He needs an angiogram.
not_available But tell Romano you only bought him 20 minutes.
not_available Don't leave him long.
not_available Radiologists have a way of snatching the procedures if the surgeons are slow on the uptake.
not_available Noted.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available Here's the BA on your MVA.
not_available On who? 
not_available Lipson, Trauma 2.
not_available I didn't order a BA.
not_available I did.
not_available It's part of the trauma panel.
not_available Randi put it in my box.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available Blood alcohol's.04.
not_available That's below the limit.
not_available It means he drinks.
not_available I finished my write
not_available up on the vertigo.
not_available And I got you coffee.
not_available You don't need to do that.
not_available I was in the cafeteria looking for something.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Why don't you start the IV on the Be careful, she's dehydrated.
not_available Could be tricky.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available I feel so much better.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available Call me if you'd like some free tickets to my show.
not_available Are you okay? 
not_available How'd that get there? There you go.
not_available I didn't want things disappearing on you.
not_available Hey, you haven't by any chance seen a body Carol, could you help me start an IV? She's dehydrated.
not_available I don't want to hurt her.
not_available Have you tried? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available So you haven't even started an IV? 
not_available Honestly, no.
not_available This is ridiculous.
not_available Everyone thinks you can.
not_available I'll talk to Dr.
not_available Carter today.
not_available Lf you don't, I will.
not_available Hey! Hey! What happened? 
not_available He took off.
not_available You were supposed to stop him.
not_available There was no talking him down.
not_available You weren't supposed to negotiate, just stop him.
not_available I can't keep him without the hold.
not_available He didn't know that! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Oh, God! Hold still.
not_available I'm gonna secure this catheter.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available How much longer? 
not_available A little bit.
not_available Just a second here.
not_available Roll back over on your back, okay? Nice and easy.
not_available There you go.
not_available How long does it take to work? 
not_available 20 minutes for the full effect.
not_available You'll start feeling things soon.
not_available I'm gonna put you on a six
not_available day cycle.
not_available That's three days before the surgery.
not_available And three days after for the drug.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Hey, Dana.
not_available I decided I wanted the epidural.
not_available You did? You were in surgery, so I explained the protocol.
not_available The parents? 
not_available They're onboard.
not_available Terrific.
not_available You got a second? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Be right back.
not_available You did great.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You postponed the surgery.
not_available You didn't leave me any options.
not_available Pedes Attending barely happened.
not_available I thought, "The guy's a maverick.
not_available Good to shake things up." If you want to play John Wayne, do it in the ER, not with my patients.
not_available This girl is in a very vulnerable place.
not_available This is not about being right.
not_available Hell, we all think we're right.
not_available Doesn't make you special.
not_available Fine.
not_available Did you give the kid the cheeseburger before or after the parents agreed? Thought I might need 24 hours to talk them into it.
not_available Do you know what you're doing? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available Let me get a smaller gauge.
not_available Oh, hey! You.
not_available Hi.
not_available I have been looking for you.
not_available You forget about me? Well, no, I didn't forget about you.
not_available I've been waiting for three hours.
not_available Okay, I went to the morgue.
not_available Me too.
not_available He's not there anymore.
not_available No, he isn't.
not_available So where did you put him? 
not_available I don't know how to How to what? How to tell you how sorry I am about your loss.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But where did you put him? Where did I put him? 
not_available You don't remember.
not_available Of course I remember.
not_available I couldn't find you.
not_available I got very busy here.
not_available So I put your brother Where did I put him? Radiology.
not_available I put him in Radiology.
not_available But he was kind of in the way there so I left him here in the hall.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No problem.
not_available I can't believe I didn't see him there.
not_available He's easy to miss.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available There aren't any pregnancy tests.
not_available How could we be out of them? 
not_available I don't do inventory.
not_available It wasn't an accusation.
not_available What is that all about? 
not_available What? The scarf.
not_available Where'd you get it? I got it at the gift shop.
not_available You don't think it works? What about your jacket? 
not_available I wanted something different.
not_available Lose the earrings.
not_available It throws the whole thing off.
not_available Carol.
not_available Carol.
not_available No, no.
not_available I can get it.
not_available I can't have students starting IVs on kids.
not_available Can you do it for me? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Is there a problem? 
not_available No.
not_available I just want experienced staff starting IVs on kids.
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available Not when pain's inflicted on kids.
not_available Lucy's great.
not_available It's not about Lucy.
not_available It's a policy I'm setting.
not_available You're setting a policy.
not_available Well, first time for everything.
not_available I'd be in a hurry to get out of here too.
not_available What? We found out why your liver's failing.
not_available You've been drinking.
not_available You're not gonna believe me.
not_available One time.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available I checked with UNOS.
not_available You've been on the list for another transplant for two months.
not_available Did you tell them? 
not_available Did I tell them what? That you drank through the first one and you want another? It wasn't like that.
not_available It was today.
not_available My son passed his bar examination.
not_available I knew I was rejecting, so I figured what could it hurt? We had champagne at brunch.
not_available That's it.
not_available You've been lying ever since you came in here.
not_available Please.
not_available You can't tell UNOS.
not_available I don't have a choice.
not_available You're doing this to me over one glass of champagne? There are people on that list who haven't had any champagne.
not_available If I lose my place, I won't last six months.
not_available You report me, I'm dead.
not_available I'm begging you.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available There was traffic.
not_available You take the EI.
not_available Who's on? 
not_available Weaver.
not_available She's interviewing for Chief of Emergency Medicine.
not_available I thought she was Chief.
not_available Where have you been? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? 
not_available He's upstairs interviewing her.
not_available So we have no Attendings.
not_available Watch it, Jerry.
not_available Sorry, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Is he an Attending? Normally I wouldn't say anything.
not_available But don't you think that attire is a little inappropriate? It's business.
not_available I was helping out Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Great job, Kerry.
not_available We'd be lucky to have you.
not_available It was a formality.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available I appreciate the opportunity.
not_available Your presentation was everything we expected.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll walk you down.
not_available It went great, Kerry.
not_available The pie charts weren't too much? 
not_available Charts are good.
not_available Did anybody else use them? 
not_available You were the first.
not_available Lf I came across as too eager 
not_available No, it went terrific.
not_available Thank you, Mark.
not_available I never know how to answer that question about my weaknesses.
not_available I could've helped you out there.
not_available That's a nice leather jacket.
not_available I said I wanted to run some tests.
not_available But I can't without Medicaid.
not_available What's wrong? 
not_available This patient is illegal.
not_available Yes, but it doesn't matter.
not_available Oh, yes, it matters.
not_available The state won't pay for thousands of dollars worth of tests.
not_available You won't treat him? 
not_available I'll give him beta blockers.
not_available He could have a cardiac arrest.
not_available He's had no arrhythmias.
not_available That's why we need the EP studies.
not_available His father died from this.
not_available Did you document an arrhythmia? 
not_available No.
not_available All right.
not_available Then there is nothing else that I can do.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kayson! 
not_available What? This boy could drop dead.
not_available Well, so could a lot of people.
not_available He's not emergent.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available You said he was stable.
not_available Single GSW to the arm.
not_available He was.
not_available He's intubated and hypotensive.
not_available Things change.
not_available What's the problem? Botched gang shooting.
not_available They were ready for him.
not_available Is this the guy from this morning? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available His name's Bo.
not_available We thought it was his arm.
not_available He crashed in the rig.
not_available Carter, we need your help.
not_available Come on.
not_available Welcome back, Bo.
not_available Okay, everybody, on my count.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Why didn't you recontact? 
not_available Things got pretty crazy.
not_available Carol, put him on the monitor.
not_available What do we got? GSW, mid
not_available tricep area.
not_available Where's the probe? 
not_available Run it, Carter.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the right.
not_available Tracheal shift to the left.
not_available Tension pneumo.
not_available BP's down to 70.
not_available Pulse ox 89.
not_available Damn it! And then I'm gonna need a 36 French.
not_available I want to decompress into the second intercostal space, mid
not_available clavicular line.
not_available Okay.
not_available Pulse is getting stronger.
not_available Lucy, get a blood gas.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I showed her how.
not_available Ten blade.
not_available Get the pressure back on the line.
not_available Entrance wound, right mid
not_available axillary line.
not_available Bullet went through the arm into the chest.
not_available Why couldn't you undress him? 
not_available We had to run.
not_available Where's that chest tube? You didn't see this chest wound? 
not_available Not now, Carol.
not_available I can't get the blood gas.
not_available Move over.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Chest tube is in.
not_available That's okay, Lucy.
not_available Those can be tough.
not_available Help me with the second line.
not_available Okay.
not_available 50 cc's out.
not_available I need four by fours.
not_available I need elastoplast.
not_available I'm gonna call X
not_available ray, get a portable chest.
not_available I got the blood gas.
not_available BP's up to 100/70.
not_available How's that second line? 
not_available I can't.
not_available Move the drape for more room.
not_available I can't do it.
not_available Focus.
not_available We need the second line.
not_available I really can't do it.
not_available It's like any other IV.
not_available I haven't started an IV.
not_available Never.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Whoa! He's bradying down! Okay! His chest tube is pouring blood! Let's get two units of O
not_available neg in and call the O.R.
not_available You cost me a procedure.
not_available Am I supposed to ask how? You should've babysat that pulseless foot.
not_available Greene let the radiologist set him.
not_available I didn't realize that was part of my job description.
not_available Well, you're still learning.
not_available How was your first day? 
not_available As expected.
not_available You are either a masochist or the stubbornest woman I've met.
not_available But I admire your fortitude.
not_available I couldn't handle taking orders from a weasel like Dale.
not_available Is that supposed to be a compliment? 
not_available Sounded like one to me.
not_available And you can wear the long coat.
not_available It looks better on you.
not_available 700 cc's out the chest tube.
not_available Take him up, Carter.
not_available Do they know he needs a thoracotomy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available O.R.
not_available 3.
not_available Have the blood bank send up four units, type
not_available specific.
not_available We weren't prepared for a trauma.
not_available You should've called.
not_available Sorry.
not_available We were busy protecting his airway.
not_available You guys should've called ahead.
not_available There was no way And we have to be prepared for anything.
not_available I would've been prepared 
not_available Nobody's to blame.
not_available We treated the patient.
not_available Let's move on.
not_available Do you want to review the run tape? 
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available Doggy.
not_available Yeah! You want to pet the doggy? Oh, that is good.
not_available You want him to respond in some way.
not_available To point or to make some kind of sound.
not_available Kitty says Do you want to pet the kitty? Don't like the kitty? 
not_available It's okay, man.
not_available That's okay.
not_available One quick hug.
not_available Then back to work.
not_available What? 
not_available He's gotta learn to focus.
not_available Give him a break.
not_available He's only a year old.
not_available You can't give him a break.
not_available He's not like other 1 year
not_available olds.
not_available He needs constant verbal stimuli.
not_available You try.
not_available All right, man.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Doggy.
not_available Doggy.
not_available Hey, doggy.
not_available I can't do this.
not_available You're gonna have to learn.
not_available Coming here twice a week isn't gonna do it.
not_available I might've been able to keep that kid here this afternoon.
not_available But he would've gone out and done the same thing tomorrow.
not_available His mom's in Chairs.
not_available You want me to go talk to her? No.
not_available No, I'll do it.
not_available Did you get a number? 
not_available No.
not_available You still here? Yeah.
not_available I got sidetracked.
not_available You could use some help.
not_available Okay, take rashes.
not_available No, something more permanent.
not_available Allergies? Actually, I meant being your full
not_available time P.A.
not_available I'd like to work with kids for a while.
not_available I'm good at it.
not_available Somehow it seems more worthwhile.
not_available Well, I don't know about that.
not_available At least you know whose side you're on.
not_available You know, I'd love to.
not_available I think I've used up all my chips with Anspaugh.
not_available I've got some pull.
not_available I could work it out.
not_available Great.
not_available I'd love that.
not_available Excellent.
not_available Yeah, hi.
not_available May I have the transplant coordinator for UNOS, please? 
not_available I paged you twice.
not_available I don't want to talk yet.
not_available That's too bad because I deserve an explanation.
not_available If you want me to feel bad, I do.
not_available I'm really disappointed in myself.
not_available You should be.
not_available That's not an explanation.
not_available I don't know how it started.
not_available You thought I could do it.
not_available I wanted to impress you.
not_available It spun out of control.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available What did you think you were going to accomplish? I don't know.
not_available I thought I could learn on my own.
not_available You can learn on your own.
not_available You don't need to be here, then.
not_available You endangered patients.
not_available You don't need to make me feel bad! I feel horrible! That would work if this was about you.
not_available But down there it's never about you.
not_available Go home.
not_available Don't come back unless you're serious about learning.
not_available If you ever lie to me again, you can look for another rotation.
not_available What are you doing back here? Waiting for the grill to heat up.
not_available I thought it was fendfor
not_available yourself night.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sick of fendfor
not_available yourself.
not_available I got us some steaks.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available You got another one of those for me? What's in the bag? It's a pregnancy test.
not_available Just to be sure.
not_available No need.
not_available I started my period.
not_available Well, I guess I wasted $17.50.
not_available Save it for next time.
not_available I'm kidding.
not_available That was a joke.
not_available We dodged a bullet there, didn't we? That's good, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Although all day, I kept thinking, "Wow, a kid." You know, that would really change my life.
not_available Our life.
not_available It would change ours.
not_available Okay.
not_available Our lives.
not_available That would be bad, right? I changed my mind.
not_available I don't want to joke about it.
not_available Maybe I'm not joking.
