not_available It was so smoky, I could barely see.
not_available The flames were eating the walls like maggots on dead meat.
not_available So, where was the little boy? Well, I looked everywhere for him, and when they radioed me to get out, something told me to check again.
not_available Was he there? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He was behind the dresser.

not_available Newbie, you finish up the run sheet.
not_available No problem.
not_available Not bad, man.

not_available So, this your first day? Two MIs, an MVC on a Dan Ryan 
not_available and the shift's not even half over.
not_available How's Dumar treating you? 
not_available He's cool, man.
not_available Real cool.
not_available He's not giving you a hard time? He made me stock the rig and get the coffee.
not_available But it's not like I had to shine the rims or anything.
not_available Just make sure it doesn't get in the way of your school work.
not_available It won't.
not_available Hey, Pratt, you see this? Kovac is having a mandatory department dinner next week.
not_available Now, why would I want to hang out with you losers on my free time? Hey, it's better than the time, uh, Weaver took us to the Olive Plantation.

not_available All right, all right, speaking of which
not_available Marquez, staple gun lady in three, Sam, liter of NS and get an EKG for the new one in two.
not_available What's this, uh, dinner all about? Well, after County's lousy Joint Commission survey, Kovac probably just wants to boost morale.
not_available What about emergency power for all the rooms? We're getting to that.
not_available And the bathrooms still aren't ADA compliant.
not_available First I need to upgrade the nurse call systems and get automatic fire doors.
not_available Well, you'll have plenty of time to do that when we close.
not_available JustJust give me another week, okay? 
not_available I gave you a month.
not_available We're too busy.
not_available We're busy every day.
not_available Soccer player has a positive culture.
not_available Start vancomycin.
not_available Look, I haven't even prepared the staff.
not_available Well, you have the rest of your shift to do so.
not_available What about the patients? We've increased capacity at the urgent care clinic.
not_available You promised shuttles to other facilities.
not_available We don't have enough money for that.
not_available You have no idea what it's like to be down here.
not_available I covered trauma in this E.R.
not_available for 20 years.
not_available We're trying to improve the way it works.
not_available How long are you going to shut us down? 
not_available For as long as it takes.
not_available So we can comply with trivial rules? Without accreditation, we can't run this hospital.
not_available Come on, Donald 
not_available In 12 hours, we close the E.R.
not_available End of story.
not_available You heard what he just said.
not_available We're closing down.
not_available It's only temporary.
not_available How do you know? Old boys running around here checking for cracks in the ceiling, 
not_available and now we're having some dinner.
not_available Oh, we have the dinner every few years.
not_available Just drinks and dancing.
not_available Usually you can't bring a date.
not_available Maybe I'll bring Wilson.
not_available The cop? They say white men can't jump, but he sure can Who you bringing? 
not_available I I don't know.
not_available You know, Sam, it's obvious you got some stuff going on.
not_available You don't need to keep it all in.
not_available Nurses stick together.
not_available No, I Honestly, I don't know who I'd bring.
not_available It's the first time in my life I've really been alone.
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available No, and now that Alex is out of the house, I got to find something to do with myself.
not_available Girl, it's called the rabbit.
not_available It costs a grip, but it's worth every dime.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available You'll be saying more than that, trust me.
not_available Excuse me.

not_available Kovac.
not_available It's not history, Sam.
not_available It's right now.
not_available Metastatic.
not_available End stage.
not_available Doctors need to know that.
not_available You two know each other? 
not_available She's been here before.
not_available Not as a patient.
not_available Diana's a photographer.
not_available She's, uh, doing a project on hospice patients.
not_available Oh, that's right, yeah.
not_available I re I remember you.
not_available Wow, you've got pretty bad ascites here.
not_available Your abdominal cavity is accumulating fluid.
not_available I know what ascites is.
not_available I took a picture of it.
not_available It looks like I'm pregnant.
not_available BP's 92/58.
not_available She's depleted intravascularly.
not_available Okay, run in a liter of NS.
not_available No, no IVs.
not_available I told the paramedics, I'm D DNR.
not_available It's just an IV for rehydration.
not_available No.
not_available I know how I know, okay? I know I know how this starts, andand then you You get sucked into the
not_available the hospital vortex, and it and it never ends up well.
not_available The fluids will make you feel better.
not_available No.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available No.
not_available No IVs, no blood tests, no nono monitors, no
not_available no medicines.
not_available I'm going to Costa Rica.
not_available What's in Costa Rica? The beach.
not_available Sam, give her a liter of oral rehydration solution.
not_available Just stay long enough to show us you can hold that down, okay? Okay.
not_available Hey, shouldn't we at least drain some of the fluid? We can't do a paracentesis.
not_available Why? It'll help her breathe easier, it'll make her more comfortable.
not_available You heard her
not_available no blood tests.
not_available It's a needle in the belly.
not_available It'll take you five minutes.
not_available Come on, Luka.
not_available Ray's right.
not_available We can't tap the fluid without checking labs.
not_available She could be dangerously anemic, coagulopathic
not_available not a good idea.
not_available She doesn't want any treatment, Sam, so let's respect that, all right? Luka, your favorite skin popper won't let me I &amp; D her abscess.
not_available Sign her out AMA and get her out of here.
not_available Yeah, but she knows you.
not_available Maybe if you could talk to her 
not_available No.
not_available We can't keep convincing people to stay if they don't want to be here.
not_available We can't even take care of the ones we already have.
not_available Okay, listen up.
not_available We got reassignments for all of you during the E.R.
not_available closing.
not_available How are they just going to tell us this today? I thought I could prevent this, but Anspaugh's not budging.
not_available How long are we shutting down for? 
not_available I'm not sure.
not_available Great.
not_available I'm sure I'll wind up giving enemas in Geriatrics.
not_available No, you're going to ICU.
not_available Malik, Geriatrics.
not_available Pratt, Family Medicine.
not_available Abby, you're going to the NICU.
not_available I'm not going to the NICU.
not_available Right.
not_available I'll, uh, fix that.
not_available Uh, Gates goes to Anesthesia.
not_available What about me? 
not_available You're going to the cafeteria.
not_available Cafawhat? Oh, why don't they just give me a jockey suit and sit me out on the lawn? Well, do we get to keep the same shifts? 
not_available Will we still get our choice of schedule? Uh, you'll have to talk to your supervisors about shift scheduling.
not_available Well, give it to us straight.
not_available Are they going to shut down the residency? These are just alternate rotations until the E.R.
not_available opens again.
not_available Yeah, that's what they told the residents at MLK in Los Angeles.
not_available And now they're scrambling for spots in other programs.
not_available No.
not_available Our didactic programs for the residents will continue, and for our attendings, there'll be some administrative duties to help correct the JC deficiencies, and we'll also be assigned clinical shifts in the urgent care center, okay? 
not_available Great.
not_available Med refills, URIs and back pain.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I bet we're closing for good.
not_available I'm with you.
not_available Something stinks, and it's not the diarrhea in four.
not_available Uh, who has Johnson? Oh, I did.
not_available No pneumonia, but are you aware he has multiple rib fractures? 
not_available Yeah, the kid plays rugby.
not_available So, uh, guess who's, uh Guess who's going to Family Medicine? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Who? Yours truly.
not_available No nights, no weekends.
not_available Now maybe you can come over for some dinner.
not_available We can crack open a bottle.
not_available You know? 
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available Hey, Betina, I saw your abstract on neuroimaging and autism.
not_available Pretty cool stuff.
not_available Paper's coming out in Neuroscience next month.
not_available Wow.
not_available Very impressive.
not_available But not surprising, considering you managed to enroll such a big cohort of autistic children.
not_available And the way you correlated the MRI findings with the tissue specimens I mean, no one's ever done that on this scale before.
not_available You actually read it? 
not_available I sure did, and if you ever have time to talk about it more, I'd love to chat.
not_available I'm looking for some areas to focus clinical research in the E.R.
not_available I'd be interested in collaborating with your department.
not_available Are you free for lunch tomorrow? 
not_available Sounds great.
not_available Okay, great.
not_available What just happened? Blunt trauma to the head and arms.
not_available Assaulted with a baseball bat.
not_available Alert times three.
not_available Got it.
not_available Okay, put him in trauma one.
not_available What happened? I was at a scifi convention, and some Romulan started beating me! Get a C
not_available collar.
not_available He accused us Intergalactic Rebel Warriors of being inferior.
not_available He was just being uppity, 'cause Romulans are biological cousins to Vulcans.
not_available Of course.
not_available Where is your pain? Mostly in my shoulder.
not_available My arm hurts, too.
not_available Okay, let's get a line in, get him some morphine.
not_available And a C
not_available spine film to his right shoulder and left forearm.
not_available It hurts.
not_available Well, you dislocated your shoulder anteriorly.
not_available Am I going to die? 
not_available Not today.
not_available Have you seen that patient? 
not_available She stumbled off, so did my doctor.
not_available Can you find him? 
not_available Yeah, I'll send someone over.
not_available Today? Next year? During Cinco de Mayo? When? Have you seen Diana? 
not_available Who the hell is that? The photographer lady, she was in curtain two.
not_available Sam, where are the glucometers? 
not_available They're all packed up.
not_available They were supposed to leave one in the trauma room.
not_available And the test strips? 
not_available Uh, you're on your own.
not_available I get that Klingons used to be enemies of the Federation, 
not_available but we have nothing to do with that.
not_available Okay, move your toes.
not_available Good.
not_available Can you feel me touching your foot? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I never heard of Intergalactic Rebel Warriors.
not_available What show were you on? We're still in the conceptual stage, 
not_available but we're about to land a deal.
not_available Looks like you're right.
not_available Anterior shoulder dislocation.
not_available C
not_available spine is clear.
not_available And he's got a nightstick fracture of the left ulna.
not_available Okay, let's get a sugar tong splint.
not_available Let's give him, uh, 100 of Propofol 
not_available for his shoulder reduction.
not_available Propofol? Yeah, I just got credentialed to use it.
not_available Why don't we try, uh, scapular manipulation, you know? Put it in without having to knock him out.
not_available No, n
not_available no, reductions are much easier, if you have good sedation.
not_available Sedation has risks.
not_available Morris, I need you to dispose some patients out here.
not_available We got a full waiting area, and the clock is ticking.
not_available Come on.
not_available Okay, uh let's get set up for the Propofol, and we'll do the reduction when I get back.
not_available All right, let's get him prone, and we'll try the scapular manipulation.
not_available WHe
not_available Morris said he wants to use sedation.
not_available He's a kid with a new toy.
not_available Well, the kid's the attending, so even if you're right, you have to talk to him about it.
not_available If it goes in easy, great.
not_available If not, then we'll try the Propofol.
not_available Let me roll you over.
not_available Hey I've been looking all over for you.
not_available I got to get an airline ticket before the price goes up.
not_available Come here.
not_available Come on, sit down, please.
not_available I had malaria once.
not_available I didn't feel as bad as this.
not_available Look, the fluid in your belly is compressing your lungs.
not_available If you let us take some of it off, it'll make it easier for you to breathe.
not_available I just want to get o
not_available on the plane.
not_available I understand that okay? But you are breathless and you're pale, and flight crews are trained to spot people just like you.
not_available I'll wear blush.
not_available The paracentesis will only take a few minutes.
not_available Sam I have friends i
not_available in Costa Rica And they're waiting for me.
not_available And it's all planned out.
not_available This is your only chance to get there.
not_available Come on, trust me on this.
not_available ICU has beds for our intubated patients.
not_available Well, there are only three stepdown beds, but these others can go to telemetry.
not_available Yeah, we have 11 patients going to medicine.
not_available They can use the GYN floor for overflow.
not_available Uh, what about the waiting room? 
not_available Send them to urgent care.
not_available The E.R.
not_available is closing at 8:00.
not_available How do you say "This is going to hurt" in Intergalactic Rebel Warrior? What the hell are you doing? 
not_available He did it.
not_available What?! 
not_available Gates thought he'd try it this way.
not_available Yeah, and it worked.
not_available No need for Propofol.
not_available Well, who made that call? 
not_available I did.
not_available His shoulder's back in.
not_available That's not the point; I gave you an order.
not_available So do what a boss does.
not_available Take credit for my resourcefulness.
not_available I'm writing you up.
not_available Why, because my approach was better than the attending? Go home; you're done.
not_available You can't send me home.
not_available You should have thought about that before, cowboy.
not_available I helped the guy without sedation.
not_available You went against my orders.
not_available Oh, come on, Morris.
not_available You're supposed to be a soldier.
not_available I am a soldier.
not_available A real one.
not_available Could have fooled me.
not_available Y
not_available You're acting like I killed the guy.
not_available I am sick and tired of you not taking orders.
not_available In the time that you got here, you have placed a subclavian line without supervision, you tapped a VP shunt without even calling neurosurgery, you overrode an attending to give Digibind to a guy that was already brain dead What, you keeping score? You transpose numbers, 
not_available you falsify charts.
not_available You sound like you're slow as hell with documentation 
not_available like my high school girlfriend.
not_available And still you act like you're God's gift to medicine, like, like you're too good to seek advice or need help.
not_available You're arrogant and dangerous, and I've had enough.
not_available We all have.
not_available Go home.
not_available Where's Kovac? 
not_available This is my call, not his.
not_available Okay.
not_available What was that about? 
not_available I sent him home.
not_available I tried that once.
not_available Yeah, well, this time he's getting a letter in his file.
not_available So how did you cut your leg? I was trying to get the chip out.
not_available What kind of chip? A neurogenic biomatrix nanosilicate chip.
not_available The aliens put it there.
not_available And, uh, did the aliens do anything else to you? Not that I didn't consent to.
not_available Look They want me to go back and report my findings.
not_available Really? I'm willing to give them a report, but I don't want them tracking me! Hey, Sam, can you page Psych for a consult, please? 
not_available Katey's already down here.
not_available Katey? We're gonna move you to exam three to do the procedure, and you're all set.
not_available One ticket to Costa Rica.
not_available Tomorrow evening, 7:55.
not_available Seat 13B.
not_available You ever been to Costa Rica? 
not_available Only on the Discovery Channel.
not_available That's where my dad bought me my first camera.
not_available My family lived there when I was 15 for six months.
not_available It was very magical.
not_available Very beautiful.
not_available The sunsets, the beaches.
not_available Sounds romantic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's where I met Paul.
not_available He was a journalist for the BBC.
not_available The only guy who ever got me.
not_available Is he going to meet you there? No.
not_available He died in Baghdad.
not_available He was embedded with a Marine unit, and they drove over an IED.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Sorry yeah I never had his kid.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Please hide me.
not_available We should, uh, put her on a 72
not_available hour hold.
not_available She cut her leg open.
not_available She's a danger to herself.
not_available She's a crazy bird.
not_available Aren't we all? My best friend thinks I'm nuts sitting around waiting for you to call.
not_available Okay, look, I'm sorry.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available The moment I jump in the pool, you get out.
not_available Katey, that's not
not_available Hey, this is Katey Alvaro, fourth year on Psych.
not_available Do we have any beds? You know, I pulled out my best for you.
not_available Hey, don't get me wrong.
not_available The sex was great.
not_available I'm not talking about the sex.
not_available No, that's great.
not_available I
not_available I'll bring her right up.
not_available I should have called you.
not_available You should have call? 
not_available You dropped off the face of the Earth.
not_available Okay, it was wrong.
not_available No, it was, it was more than wrong.
not_available It was wussy, immature, tenth
not_available gradish.
not_available You're right.
not_available What happened? You start dating Neela or something? Okay, can we talk about this? What's there to talk about? You're stupid, and I'm done.
not_available Did Morris tell you not to do the procedure? Well, yes, but b
not_available but scapular manipulation doesn't pose any real risk.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available I saved the guy from being sedated.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available You were out of line, and now you're going over his head to me.
not_available My way was better, and it doesn't merit being written up.
not_available Actually, it does.
not_available When an attending tells you to do something, you do it or discuss it.
not_available Now you're gonna go home and think about that, okay? Am I, am I in trouble? 
not_available Morris that's one of the best moves you ever made.
not_available See? I knew it! He can't go against me.
not_available He shouldn't even be able to go against residents.
not_available There was a resident in the room? 
not_available Uh, let's leave me out of it.
not_available You should have stopped him.
not_available Oh, please, like he's going to listen to me.
not_available He doesn't even listen to you.
not_available Well, maybe I should send you home, too.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well well, not today.
not_available But I'll do it, Abby.
not_available Don't test me.
not_available It wasn't life threatening.
not_available Doesn't matter.
not_available Morris is the attending.
not_available It's his decision.
not_available Got my Coltrane, my Margaret Bourke
not_available White books, new timer for my camera.
not_available You seem at peace.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why stress this? My friend's gonna cook, drink wine on the beach.
not_available That necessary? Uh, it's a precaution for the invasive procedure.
not_available I
not_available I said no blood.
not_available It's just platelets; your count's a little low.
not_available I'm still gonna get out of here.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Platelets running, belly's prepped.
not_available Lido's drawn up and ready.
not_available Got to get my film to my publisher.
not_available And my camera to Yolonda.
not_available Who's Yolonda? She's a girl I mentor in a photography program.
not_available Okay, a little sting, so you won't feel the big needle.
not_available Vitals? 
not_available A little tachy, but BP's good.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're gonna feel some pressure here.
not_available That's it.
not_available If the bottle fills up, clamp the tubing before you switch to an empty one.
not_available Yeah, got it.
not_available I need to see if I have enough miles to upgrade.
not_available Why skimp on your last plane ride? 
not_available She refused the morphine.
not_available Okay, the painful part is over, anyway.
not_available Eh, fluid's bloody.
not_available Just a little; shouldn't be a problem.
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I feel weird.
not_available Diana? Diana, come on.
not_available Systolic's only 84.
not_available Get the crash cart.
not_available Come on, Diana.
not_available Sam, she's DNR.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We talked her into this, we at least got to get her back to where she was when she walked in here.
not_available Please? No crash cart, no CPR.
not_available Give her a liter of NS and lower the head of the bed.
not_available BP's 88 over 45.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Urticaria.
not_available Another liter of NS and DC the platelets, now.
not_available Crackles at the bases.
not_available on the non
not_available rebreather.
not_available Diana.
not_available What happened? You had a bad reaction to some of the blood products.
not_available Okay, I'll start another line.
not_available Oh, no, I don't want that.
not_available I don't want any of this.
not_available You dropped your pressure; you have no choice.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available Stop.
not_available We need a way to get her fluids, fast.
not_available No, no.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available This is very serious.
not_available Platelet allergy can be life threatening.
not_available Especially in your condition.
not_available Great.
not_available What is it about hospitals? It's a toxic environment.
not_available Everybody gets worse here.
not_available It's gonna be okay, Diana.
not_available Really? I don't think I'm gonna be okay.
not_available Want me to start a subclavian? 
not_available She's coagulopathic.
not_available Let's give the meds a chance to kick in and then reassess.
not_available Hang in there, Diana.
not_available We'll come and check on you soon.
not_available Sam shouldn't have pushed that.
not_available That was Diana's only chance to get on that plane.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, people are asking about this dinner thing.
not_available Morris, just tell Marquez to officially close us to trauma.
not_available No problem.
not_available So how are we affording such a fancy place? It's not Ladokern, is it? 
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available You didn't get in bed with a pharmaceutical company? Guys, come on, we have a lot of work to do.
not_available Say it isn't so.
not_available They're Satan.
not_available Trust me, I know.
not_available Hey, I got a 14year
not_available old with altered mental status and respiratory distress.
not_available We were walking home from rehearsal; he said his back hurt.
not_available Then he just sat down and stopped making sense.
not_available Please All right, Ray, can I get a hand over here? Come on, let's go.
not_available What's your friend's name? 
not_available Demitri.
not_available Does your friend have any medical problems? I don't know.
not_available Demitri.
not_available Hey, man.
not_available Wake up, Demitri.
not_available Wake up.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available Sat's only 76.
not_available You sure it's picking up? 
not_available Yeah, we got a good wave form.
not_available All right.
not_available We got shallow resps, decreased at the bases.
not_available Throw me the bag.
not_available Does he take any medicine? 
not_available We're in orchestra together.
not_available We're not really friends.
not_available Anybody call his parents? 
not_available Yeah, Timmy's on it.
not_available Pulse is thready, tacky at 125.
not_available You guys take any drugs? 
not_available We don't mess with that.
not_available Okay, did he fall? Did you guys get in a fight? He just passed out.
not_available Okay, all right, we're gonna need to tube himseven
not_available oh and a Mac two.
not_available I got access; what do you want? CBC, trauma panel, tox screen, type and cross.
not_available Call for a portable chest and let surgery know that they need to come down and do a trauma eval.
not_available It's not my fault, I swear.
not_available Let's get an ABG.
not_available Didn't call me back this morning.
not_available What? 
not_available You didn't call me back this morning.
not_available Morris is such a little bitch.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He's sending me home.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available I reduced a shoulder, that's what I did.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available I was trying to do what was safest for the patient, right? And then he shows up a
not_available and he pulls this big power trip.
not_available So you went against him? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available Well, it kind of is.
not_available Well, no, it kind of isn't.
not_available It the point You know what? I don't even want to talk about it, forget it.
not_available Why don't you just tell Morris you're sorry? 
not_available I'm not sorry.
not_available So what? 
not_available So what? I'm not a kiss ass.
not_available So you want to get written up? He doesn't have the balls to write me up.
not_available Neela.
not_available What? Since you've been ignoring Dr.
not_available Crenshaw's pages, he asked me to read this to you.
not_available "Get your ass into the trauma room, now." 
not_available I got to go.
not_available Where you going? WWhat'd you have to say to me? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'll call you later.
not_available Just go apologize to Morris.
not_available Suction! All right, I'm in! 
not_available Bag him up.
not_available Sat's are in the 70s, Pratt.
not_available Blood gas is ugly.
not_available PH only 7.02.
not_available What's happening? He may have taken something that's making him acidotic.
not_available There's no gap, but Hey, you know what? Listen, Todd.
not_available It's very important you tell us the truth.
not_available Did you guys take any pills? I told you, we were at orchestra practice all day.
not_available I can't bag him above 80.
not_available That's because of this.
not_available Yikes.
not_available What is that, pneumonia? Seems unlikely without a fever, but we got to cover it.
not_available It hurts me when you ignore my pages, truly.
not_available It wounds me to the core.
not_available You rang? Yeah, we got a 14yearold 
not_available with severe hypoxia and this film.
not_available Pneumonia? H and H is back.
not_available Hemoglobin's 6.2.
not_available Pulmonary hemorrhage.
not_available That's what I'm thinking.
not_available Any history of trauma? We still don't know, 
not_available and his buddy's not being too helpful.
not_available I told you, I don't know anything.
not_available Look, Todd, if you know something, you got to tell us right now.
not_available Hey, hey, Todd! Get back here! 
not_available All right, sonosite, please.
not_available And a chest tube tray, sterile sixes and a ten blade.
not_available What did you do to him? What did you do to him? 
not_available Nothing, I swear.
not_available Yeah? Then why are you running? You know, your friend could die? He could? 
not_available Yes! Did you do something to him? I wanted the solo.
not_available What did you do? I kept praying he'd get sick, but when that didn't work We did this experiment in chemistry where we used sulfur, and I saw what happens when you heated it up, so I figured eating it couldn't be good.
not_available You You put it in his food? Listen, our school orchestra goes to Milwaukee tomorrow, and I wanted to play the solo.
not_available I didn't mean for all of this to happen.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry this didn't go the way we wanted.
not_available Why don't you, uh just sign me out.
not_available I have a plane to catch.
not_available Diana, you can leave, but nothing's changed.
not_available They're not gonna let you on that plane.
not_available Well, why? We can send you home.
not_available Hospice can bring you pain medications.
not_available No, but I'm not in pain.
not_available Not right now, but sometimes when people die this way, they get they get really uncomfortable.
not_available Well, what can you do? Another para paracentesis? We can't we can't risk you bleeding.
not_available Why can't Why can't I just fall asleep and not wake up? You've seen this.
not_available It doesn't always work that way.
not_available The fluid in your body is gonna continue to build up, and as it does, it'll compress your lungs and make it harder for you to breathe.
not_available I'll feel like I'm drowning.
not_available We're not gonna be able to get to everyone before the E.R.
not_available closes.
not_available But what about my headache? 
not_available It could be a brain tumor.
not_available I can't wait till next week.
not_available I've got the mother of all yeast infections.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that, but you'll have to go find a doctor somewhere else.
not_available We've got a list of local clinics here.
not_available How long will the E.R.
not_available be closed? 
not_available We don't know.
not_available We need a room! 
not_available We're closed.
not_available You guys know that.
not_available You got to take this.
not_available No, we can't.
not_available Turn around and go to Good Shepherd.
not_available No, listen, it's Dr.
not_available Pratt's brother.
not_available Chaz? 
not_available He kind of overdid it.
not_available Somebody, I'm not feeling too good.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Happy hour overload.
not_available Hey, we need a gurney over here! 
not_available Trauma Two's open.
not_available Sam, we got this.
not_available Go give the nursing report on Diana.
not_available We got a bed for her upstairs.
not_available My appendix is bursting! 
not_available She's going home.
not_available No, she wants to be admitted.
not_available What? To the hospital? 
not_available No.
not_available She is not dying here.
not_available Sam, just make the call, okay? Hey, Sam, I got these kids doing fence plowing.
not_available What the hell is that? A bunch of knuckleheads run full
not_available speed into a fence and try to break it.
not_available Do we have time to treat them? Hurry up; they have to be out of here in an hour.
not_available Hey, Pratt 
not_available Yep? You got to get to Trauma Two.
not_available Your brother's here.
not_available Yeah, I know, he's working.
not_available No, he's drunk.
not_available What? Demitri's parents just called.
not_available He's got sickle cell.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available At least makes sense.
not_available Yeah, means the white out is acute chest syndrome.
not_available What's that? Um, Dr.
not_available Barnett will explain everything.
not_available Ray, take them upstairs, okay? Where you going? 
not_available It's my brother.
not_available All right, let's go.
not_available I just spoke to Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available It's okay.
not_available No, it isn't.
not_available It's fine, Sam.
not_available No, this isn't what you want.
not_available It's the hospital vortex.
not_available You said it yourself.
not_available Come on, let me take you home.
not_available We'll tell your friends to meet you there instead.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Don't say that.
not_available Come on.
not_available Sam, look, actually, there is no one, okay? II
not_available I just I did my thing my whole life.
not_available And I I didn't develop any real relationships, and I don't have any kids.
not_available So Okay.
not_available But you are still not doing this here.
not_available Not like this.
not_available Sam, I can't.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I can't do this alone.
not_available Pulse ox is dropping.
not_available Breath sounds equal.
not_available Chaz, wake up.
not_available Breathe for us, buddy.
not_available Come on.
not_available I have one beer.
not_available Hell, I have four beers.
not_available But 15 shots of tequila?! 
not_available It's a paramedic tradition.
not_available Yeah, tradition my ass! What the hell were you guys thinking?! 
not_available Sat's only 89.
not_available He needs a tube.
not_available No! 15 liters oh
not_available two by mask.
not_available That's not gonna work if he's hypoventilating.
not_available What are you, frat boys? You guys see people die from alcohol poisoning all the time.
not_available Yep, he's still got a gag.
not_available Barely.
not_available Chaz, come on, man.
not_available Chaz, hey! Pratt, his GCS is trending down and so are his sat's.
not_available We need to tube him.
not_available Not yet; he's arousable.
not_available See, look at that, he's talking.
not_available Mac two and an eight
not_available oh.
not_available I said no.
not_available You're not putting a tube in my brother.
not_available Once he aspirates, it's gonna be a mess.
not_available It's easy to extubate him later.
not_available I'm not putting him on a vent! Marquez, place an NG.
not_available We'll evacuate his stomach so he can't aspirate.
not_available That's gonna make him vomit.
not_available Chaz, come on, wake up, man.
not_available He better wake up or I'll kill you guys, I swear, I'll kill you.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available Hey, hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Sat's up to 92.
not_available Good.
not_available That's good.
not_available Let's put him on a non
not_available rebreather.
not_available I'll call for a med
not_available surge bed.
not_available This is nice.
not_available It's very chic.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Here.
not_available Did you do all these? Uh yeah, mostly.
not_available Some are friends.
not_available I thought you had no friends.
not_available Well, uh, kind of friends that you bunk with in Kabul, or let you sleep on their floor in Marrakech.
not_available I haven't told them.
not_available Diana? They'll read about it in the obit.
not_available I bet you underestimate them.
not_available That's Paul.
not_available A week before the bomb went off.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Oh, here, let me help you.
not_available Yeah, got you.
not_available Sit down.
not_available You know Sam? You don't have to You don't have to stay.
not_available I'm sure you have a family to go home to.
not_available Actually, uh, my son is away at school, so He's been, you know, having problems.
not_available A picture? What's that? 
not_available Picture? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Here.
not_available There's Alex.
not_available It's an old one, but he looks pretty much the same.
not_available Well, he's beautiful.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I used to think you had to chose between family and career.
not_available By the time I figured out you could have both, it was too late, 'cause I was I was already sick.
not_available Yeah, well, I got pregnant at 14, so by the time I realized you could have a career, my kid was in preschool.
not_available So, nursing isn't what you wanted? Uh, I actually never thought about what I wanted.
not_available Feeding Alex was the reality.
not_available It's never too late to choose.
not_available You have time.
not_available The room is ready for Mrs.
not_available Sherman on Four South, and the surgical step down says they will make room for our pertussis kid.
not_available Do you think it's a good idea to put a coughing toddler in a room with a bunch of surgical postop patients? 
not_available No, but it's the only option.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac 
not_available You can't send me out, Doc.
not_available can you sign this discharge? Look, we'll give you a taxi voucher to get to a shelter, okay? 
not_available Oh, you know what them shelters like.
not_available I'm afraid that's all we can offer.
not_available You don't need to stay in the hospital.
not_available Dr.
not_available Barnett, I finished packing up Trauma One, and I found this.
not_available Oh, it's a violin.
not_available My patient must have left it.
not_available I'll take care of it, thanks.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, how's he doing? 
not_available We're going to monitor him overnight.
not_available Hey, you know if you get admitted, you can't be a paramedic? Is he for real? 
not_available I'm afraid so.
not_available Oh, hell, no.
not_available It's a joke.
not_available Sit your ass down.
not_available Oh! What
not_available What happened? His first day as an EMT.
not_available Got initiated.
not_available Damn traditions.
not_available Um, I'll be up in a sec.
not_available Hey, Betina, Betina? About earlier I'm sorry about how I came off.
not_available "How you doing, girl?" "Maybe we could have dinner." "Crack open a bottle of wine"? 
not_available Yes, yes, yes, but I do want to hear about your research.
not_available Then you're going to have to read up like your buddy, Morris.
not_available I'll do that, but I still want to take you out.
not_available There's this E.R.
not_available department dinner next week, Thursday night.
not_available An E.R.
not_available dinner? 
not_available You're kidding me.
not_available And I thought maybe afterwards, we could get a drink in a bar in a public spot.
not_available Sounds better.
not_available Come on, what do you say? Call me.
not_available Hey, you forgot this.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Demitri's still not awake? Well, he's got a tough road ahead of him, but the disease did this to him, not you.
not_available You sure? Yeah, I'm positive.
not_available Sulfur doesn't make you sick, not like this.
not_available You know you got lucky.
not_available I know.
not_available Look, when the time is right, you'll get the solo, okay? Have you ever felt, like, jealous? Wanted something someone else had? Sure.
not_available Hey, but in the end, I believe people get what they deserve.
not_available And if you're patient, and you're committed, then you can get what you wantwhatever you want
not_available whether that means a violin solo, or a better grade, or even a girl.
not_available Sarah?! Sarah! 
not_available I didn't like Happy Feet.
not_available What? What kind of a kid are you? 
not_available Everybody likes Happy Feet.
not_available Well, I'm not everybody.
not_available Hey, you're home? 
not_available Yeah, I got off early.
not_available Where you guys been? 
not_available The video store.
not_available We ran out of movies.
not_available You know, if you want, you can join us.
not_available We got a bunch of Jackie Chan movies.
not_available Charlie Chan.
not_available Okay, Charlie Chan.
not_available Sarah, can you, uh, give Mike and I a second to talk? Sure.
not_available What's up? What's in the thermos, Mike? 
not_available I haven't been drinking.
not_available So, what's in the thermos? I felt like having a little bit of orange juice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Prove it.
not_available What
not_available what's your problem? I don't have to prove a damn thing.
not_available You need to relax.
not_available I need to relax? You've been drinking while driving with Sarah? 
not_available I was not.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Let go of that.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Let go.
not_available That's it! I'm done with you! Tony! Come on, Tony.
not_available It was only a little.
not_available You're out, you're moving out.
not_available We just went around the corner! 
not_available I should have never let you in.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I fall for this crap every time.
not_available Please, Tony, listen to me.
not_available I'm done listening, too.
not_available You're drunk.
not_available You'll always be a drunk.
not_available Come on, Tony.
not_available Get out of my way.
not_available Look, I'll change, okay? That's what you want.
not_available Yeah, how many times have I heard that? Tony, what are you doing? 
not_available Stay here.
not_available Tony? I got a job.
not_available Yeah, and the day the rent's due, you're going to go blow it at a bar.
not_available That's not true.
not_available It's true.
not_available It's always true.
not_available And you know what else? You weren't a fire chief.
not_available You were a second
not_available rate captain who got demoted because none of the other guys wanted to go into the fire with you.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Face facts, old man
not_available you killed that rookie, didn't you? You left him.
not_available You left him burning in that building, 'cause you were too out of it to go save him.
not_available Why don't you just face it? 
not_available You can't talk to me like that! You killed him.
not_available You killed your career.
not_available And the only way Mom could escape you was to die herself.
not_available You did it, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I don't like this.
not_available Hey, it's not all Mercedes and racquetball.
not_available I know that, but I'm beginning to feel like the politics aren't worth the paycheck.
not_available First you make me fire Weaver.
not_available Then I spend half my time in BS meetings.
not_available I'm flooded with paperwork, and now this.
not_available Well, welcome to management, Luka.
not_available This isn't me.
not_available I'm resigning as Chief.
not_available Luka, part of being the boss is being the bad guy.
not_available I'll leave that to someone else.
not_available I just want to be a doctor.
not_available Have a good night.
