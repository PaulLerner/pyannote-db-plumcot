not_available You had your chance.
not_available I was young.

not_available Just hurry it up, okay? Yes, sir.
not_available Oh, excuse me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I wanted to belt her in the mouth.

not_available Then I go and shoot myself in the leg.
not_available These things happen.
not_available I bet you see a lot working in a place like this.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available All the time.
not_available You don't mind my asking, have you done this before? I'd hate to tell you how often I've done this.
not_available You'll feel a needle.
not_available Come on, it wasn't that bad.

not_available We have to try this one more time.
not_available My wife's not that bad.

not_available In this case it's lucky I didn't kill her.
not_available Oh, man! I'm afraid we missed again.
not_available We'll try one more time.
not_available You have very tough veins.
not_available My wife is a very beautiful woman.
not_available I'm not proud of beating up any woman.
not_available Even when she's asking for it.
not_available I mean in this case, it's lucky I didn't break her neck! I got it.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Don't move! It's in the vein.

not_available If you don't have any symptoms now, I'd leave it alone.
not_available Come back if you have more trouble.
not_available Who's next? 
not_available You're just saying that because I'm black.
not_available Trying to save you money, I know you don't have insurance.
not_available You wouldn't say this if I wasn't black.

not_available There's a guy with a bullet in his leg who'd like to have it out.
not_available Sure you're not feeling any pain? No pain here in your back? You know what? All you've got is a fracture to your ankle.
not_available Everything else is fine.
not_available Now, what's the story, doc? Do I get worker's comp? The story? The story is, you're still alive.
not_available Great, but I got a few bills and
not_available There it is, nice and red.

not_available He'll be fine.
not_available If he's not better tomorrow, call me.

not_available Bye, tiger.
not_available He's very handsome.
not_available He knows it.
not_available We got a UA and a sed rate for patient Rebecca Morton.
not_available MOR
not_available What do you mean? We sent this an hour ago! It's 1:40 and it was a stat determination.
not_available What're you doing, picking your noses? Chest pains two hours, question AMl.
not_available I will talk to you any damn way I want to.
not_available If I sent for a stat chem I want it in an hour, not sometime next month.
not_available Well, we're a little busy here too.
not_available When they start going to lunch things will really slow down.
not_available What do you want me to do? 
not_available Go to lunch.
not_available I'm okay, if there's something to do.
not_available Excuse me a minute.
not_available Don't be a hero.
not_available If I tell you to go to lunch, go.
not_available It's a long time before dinner, and you may be too busy to eat.
not_available You never know how long till your next meal, so eat when you can.
not_available Get the hell out of here.
not_available And don't take more than half an hour.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available What's the trouble, Mrs.
not_available O'Rourke? I'm not Mrs.
not_available O'Rourke.
not_available Mrs.
not_available O'Rourke! Is there a Mrs.
not_available O'Rourke here? Tyrone! 
not_available What is it? Crack dealer.
not_available Took 5 shots.
not_available We need muscle in here! 
not_available He's just a kid.
not_available Thirteen.
not_available Call security! 
not_available Why? The other gang members may come and finish him off.
not_available Let's keep it calm.
not_available Here we go.
not_available This is Tracy Young in ER.
not_available I need someone in Trauma Room 1.
not_available Surgical 2.
not_available Turn right and down.
not_available We have a motorcycle accident coming.
not_available Wasn't wearing a helmet.
not_available Those are stat labs.
not_available I'll be across the street.
not_available Told my wife I'd keep this appointment.
not_available Can Susan cover for me? No, not there! Surgical 2! I'm Dr.
not_available Greene to see Dr.
not_available Harris.
not_available Everyone has a family, Mark.
not_available My wife wants to shop.
not_available Kids grow up.
not_available You want private school, college.
not_available You gotta think about that.
not_available Now, the office for our next associate is here.
not_available As a junior man, you'll do all calls and weekends for a year or so.
not_available Compensation you'll start out at 120,000 per year, plus bonuses.
not_available The group has a condo in Jamaica and one in Aspen.
not_available Do you ski? Haven't had the opportunity.
not_available You should.
not_available It's a great sport.
not_available Morgenstern tells me that you're the sharpest guy ER ever had.
not_available But I'll tell you, the ER is a young man's game.
not_available You think you're doing good, but there's a lot to life especially this one.
not_available We find the practice intellectually challenging so we send our physicians to major conferences.
not_available Last 
year Maui, Paris, Rome.
not_available We're proud to practice the best possible medicine we can here.
not_available Seems great.
not_available You like this? We had Prescott redesign it.
not_available We redesign every couple of years.
not_available Keeps us looking fresh.
not_available Terrific.
not_available Do we have time for lunch? We'll go to the Crown Club.
not_available They have a great porcini pasta.
not_available I gotta get back.
not_available No oil! Melissa would you bring Dr.
not_available Greene's coat? Maybe next week? 
not_available We'd love to have you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available McCormick, how are you? I thought the Field Museum Ball was wonderful! Margo loved the flower arrangements.
not_available Cheer up, doctor, it's only 3:00.
not_available Three o'clock.
not_available I must be crazy, huh? That's a very good insight.
not_available When did it start raining? It's raining! It has been for an hour.
not_available How's your new student? 
not_available Very capable.
not_available Tough.
not_available So I hear you went up to Harris' today.
not_available Did he offer you a job? Yeah.
not_available I think I have to go to a lot of charity balls.
not_available There are worse things.
not_available I guess.
not_available Must be.
not_available What's this I hear about you and that tech up on Surgical 4? 
not_available I'm a married man.
not_available So? 
not_available So whatever you heard is not true.
not_available All right.
not_available I heard that she was seriously cute.
not_available But you are faithful to your wife.
not_available Is that what you're telling me? Why would you do something like that? Because I'm too tired to do anything else.
not_available We'll know more when we have the x
not_available rays.
not_available How much do you smoke? Two, three packs a day sometimes.
not_available And how long have you been doing this? Since I was about 14, I guess.
not_available You really should stop that.
not_available I know.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You can put your clothes back on.
not_available Listen, I can't talk at work unless it'sIt is? Well, what
not_available ? No, I'm on all night.
not_available I get off tomorrow night at six.
not_available Paul, I thought we broke up.
not_available Oh, Paul, come on.
not_available Damn! What? No, not you.
not_available It's just, I have to tell a patient something.
not_available Listen, is everything all right? I'm sorry, but I just
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available We have your x
not_available rays, Mr.
not_available Parker.
not_available You can see there's a density in the right middle lobe.
not_available What does that mean? Something abnormal within the structure of your lung.
not_available In my lung? 
not_available That's right.
not_available What is it? 
not_available It could be an infiltrate, a dense area of tissue from an old infection.
not_available Perhaps an inhaled foreign body.
not_available It could be a granuloma.
not_available It could be a lot of things.
not_available What do you think it is? 
not_available There's no way to know.
not_available You'll need a bronchoscopy and possibly exploratory surgery.
not_available I understand, but what do you think in the meantime? You should consider it potentially serious.
not_available So I got cancer.
not_available I'm not saying that.
not_available We don't know anything for sure.
not_available Let me explain something to you.
not_available I'm 40.
not_available I have a wife and 3 children a house not paid for and a mother whose house isn't paid for.
not_available I have responsibilities.
not_available So I need to know.
not_available I need to know what you think.
not_available You should regard your condition as very serious but await a final determination.
not_available I don't understand the problem.
not_available Are you afraid to tell me the truth? Your history of coughing blood, weight loss and this x
not_available ray is suggestive of cancer.
not_available But the diagnosis is not confirmed, and it may be something else.
not_available And we shouldn't jump to any conclusions until we know.
not_available That's what I think.
not_available How long do I have? Six months to a year.
not_available Do I have six months for sure? No, not for sure.
not_available I was wondering because I always wanted to take my wife to Nassau.
not_available We talked about it, but we never did it.
not_available I just figured, spring's coming, it's getting too late to go to Nassau.
not_available She always wanted a suntan in the winter to show off to the neighbors.
not_available I understand.
not_available So I guess I'd better go.
not_available Summer will be here before you know it, so I better go soon, huh? Doctor, I want to thank you.
not_available I want to thank you for your help and for being straight with me.
not_available I guess I don't have to quit smoking.
not_available Mr.
not_available Parker, if there's one thing you learn in my job it's that nothing is certain.
not_available Nothing that seems very bad and nothing that seems very good.
not_available Nothing is certain.
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Good evening.
not_available How's it going tonight, Mrs.
not_available Raskin? Timmy, I have a problem that requires medical attention.
not_available See Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available He's on duty tonight.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene! How nice! 
not_available Good evening.
not_available How you doing? He says he doesn't drink.
not_available Then
not_available I require medical attention, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Give me a minute, Chris.
not_available Yes, Mrs.
not_available Raskin? I have this troublesome hangnail.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Raskin.
not_available I'm afraid it may be infected.
not_available If we treat you, it's gonna cost you $ 180.
not_available You do know that? I wish you'd do it for me.
not_available You're such a nice young doctor and I do appreciate your taking the time.
not_available We'll handle this in the lab.
not_available The lab? Oh, gracious! I had no idea how complicated it was! I'll be excising Mrs.
not_available Raskin's hangnail.
not_available I'll stand back.
not_available Well, at my age, you can't be too careful.
not_available Please have a seat, Mrs.
not_available Raskin.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, you look tired.
not_available How have you been? Fine, thanks.

not_available In half an hour.
not_available She's very cute.
not_available She work here at the hospital? She's a resident.
not_available Did I tell you my sister got remarried? How long has it been since I've seen you? Just a week or so.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Oh, don't make such a fuss! Thank you, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Now, you be a good boy and go home to your wife.
not_available Another day, another dollar.
not_available Good night, Timmy.

not_available It's not the cut! It's the car.
not_available I smashed the car.
not_available I wasn't supposed to drive it, and I took the keys and I smashed it up.
not_available And it was brand
not_available new! My father loves that car.
not_available Well, it might not be as bad as you think.
not_available It was a brand
not_available new Cadillac with power steering and air conditioning.
not_available Oh, God! He'll kill me.
not_available It was the first new car he ever had! Suzanne.
not_available Oh, my God!

not_available The important thing is that you're okay.
not_available What car? The Caddy? Daddy, I'm so sorry.

not_available Because.
not_available You see? He's impossible! Here's the KUB.
not_available There it is, all right.
not_available You mean it's in his stomach? 
not_available You said he swallowed it.
not_available What do I do? Check his stools.
not_available He'll probably pass it.
not_available I mean, how do I get into my house? I'm locked out.
not_available You don't have another key? 
not_available It's not funny.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's possible to become pregnant without actual penetration.
not_available Just by fooling around.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available It's important you tell me why you think you may be.
not_available No reason.
not_available If you are, you might have an ectopic pregnancy and you'd need surgery right away.
not_available It's serious.
not_available It could be a matter of life and death.
not_available I'm not pregnant.
not_available Excuse me for one second.
not_available How old? 
not_available She's 13.

not_available Just relax.
not_available It stopped raining.
not_available I thought I was going to be sick.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't ever say you're sorry.
not_available There's two kinds of doctors.
not_available Those who get rid of their feelings and those who keep them.
not_available If you're gonna keep your feelings, you'll get sick sometimes.
not_available That's just how it works.
not_available Keep your head down.
not_available People come in here and they're sick, dying and bleeding and they need our help.
not_available Helping them is more important than how we feel.
not_available But it's still a pain in the ass sometimes.
not_available Sometimes I just want to quit and do something else.
not_available Why don't you take a few more minutes.
not_available By the way I was in medical school with Benton.
not_available He used to get sick all the time.

not_available Has the family been notified? 
not_available I think so.
not_available Is she covered on the hospital policy?

not_available I'll get on it.
not_available Anybody know why she did it? No one knows.
not_available Her fiancé didn't know anything.
not_available They're supposed to get married in June.
not_available Who's next? I am, doctor.
not_available Now lean forward.
not_available You feeling any pain? It's better when I lean forward.
not_available Lydia, could I borrow your pen? Mr.
not_available Larkowsky, I'm going to admit you to the hospital and start you on a medical regimen.
not_available There's some question in my mind whether that's necessary but it's better to be safe than sorry.
not_available What is it? What's the matter? 
not_available You don't have to hide the truth from me.
not_available The truth? I know you're being nice, but you can tell me.
not_available It's okay.

not_available You can tell me.
not_available You don't have cancer, Mr.
not_available Larkowsky.
not_available I knew it, I knew it! It's cancer.
not_available You were hiding it.
not_available Every person that comes into this hospital whether they have a heart attack or a skin rash everybody worries about cancer.
not_available You don't have cancer.
not_available I swear to you.
not_available You do not have cancer.
not_available It's not cancer? You have an ulcer which flared up today because you went to a party and drank and smoked.
not_available Both of which you're gonna have to quit.
not_available Quit smoking and drinking? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Quit smoking and drinking? What, are you kidding me? We'll have to get x
not_available rays on him.
not_available Right away, doctor.
not_available How did this happen? He fell out of his crib.
not_available He fell out of his crib? He was crying all night, so I came here.
not_available I bet he was.
not_available When did he fall? I don't know.
not_available I don't want to get into trouble.
not_available Your son has multiple contusions.

not_available Please! I'll get into trouble.
not_available Stay here.
not_available Yes, doctor.
not_available I don't believe this.

not_available Your fingers are very long.
not_available Long and strong.
not_available I wanted to change first and put on some new underpants.
not_available I knew you'd be seeing my underpants.
not_available And touching them.
not_available You'll want to keep these bandages very dry for a day or so.
not_available Don't take any showers or baths.
not_available Just a sponge bath.
not_available Why is that nurse here? Hospital policy.
not_available She's not assisting.
not_available She doesn't have to be here.
not_available Are you afraid of me? You're gonna be just fine in a few days.
not_available Thanks, Lydia.
not_available After dinner? Yeah, right after dinner I felt this little aching, this burning, you know? Low.

not_available Tell him to get over here.
not_available I'm starting a ruptured aneurysm.
not_available You can't.

not_available I know that, but
not_available Look! I'm just trying to keep him alive until Morgenstern shows up.

not_available Call it out in minutes.
not_available Let's suck this field clean so we can see what we're doing.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, the chief resident is in the hospital and on his way.
not_available Well, suck that field clean, we got the chief coming! We don't want him to think we don't know what we're doing.
not_available Pressure? 
not_available 100 over 70 and falling.
not_available I won't sweat that.
not_available Let's just keep that blood going in.
not_available Jimmy, your hands are trembling.
not_available I can't imagine why.
not_available Yeah, well, me neither.
not_available But everything's cool here.
not_available All we have to do is sit and wait.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ashley will be with you as soon as he can.
not_available All of a sudden, I got all the help I want, huh? Start a nitroglycerine drip.

not_available seen here 8 weeks ago where he was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass with aortic calcification on X
not_available ray.
not_available Surgery was scheduled for next month.
not_available But this evening, he had intermittent pain in the mid
not_available back.
not_available When he got here, he had a distended abdomen, peritoneal irritation and reduced hematocrit.
not_available So you decided to open him up.
not_available This is the worst incision I've seen in a while.
not_available A good veterinarian would do a better skin cut than that.
not_available All right, hold on.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's his pressure? and he's gotten 12 units.
not_available We'll take over from here, try to make something out of it.
not_available Hey, humor me.
not_available Have some dopamine standing by.
not_available Hoover that, will you? Sounds like a plan.
not_available Good.
not_available Give me a little more room in there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Look at that.
not_available You did a good job.
not_available You were lucky, but you were right to open him up.
not_available Good work.
not_available Yeah, clear it out.
not_available Let me see if I can Pull it out for a second.
not_available That's what we want, right there.
not_available That's right.
not_available Why is he still crying? Why haven't you given him something? Look! He's still crying.
not_available Why aren't you giving him something? I can't until I know the extent of his injuries.
not_available He's been to X
not_available ray.
not_available We saw a skull fracture.
not_available A skull fracture? The babysitter! I never trusted her.
not_available Your child has contusions that are 12 hours old.
not_available He has a skull fracture.
not_available He also has several old healed fractures.
not_available This is a battered child.
not_available I'm not even gonna respond to that.
not_available You think I'd harm my child? It happens all the time.

not_available Look.
not_available I can assure you, whoever you are
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, let me tell you your concerns are unfounded, okay? How'd he burn his legs? These marks right here.
not_available On his legs.
not_available Those are healed burn scars.
not_available How did that happen? I don't know anything about burns.
not_available I think you're making this up.
not_available You might call an attorney.
not_available I am an attorney! Then you know what Child Services will do.
not_available How dare you? How dare you treat your child like this? He's a little kid! I try to be understanding in my job.
not_available But, lady, this just stinks.
not_available You find that chart? 
not_available I can't find it.
not_available Well, find it! I don't
not_available Do you think I am deaf? I heard you.
not_available Now find me the chart! 
not_available I told you, I don't know where it is! Is it okay? You can go now.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available I mean, is the baby okay? He will be.

not_available They contact her family? Yeah, they found them.
not_available So how'd your aortic aneurysm go? Morgenstern showed.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton to Trauma 1.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton to Trauma 1.
not_available No rest for the wicked.
not_available Jerry, Perez.
not_available Let's go.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available We picked him up in Old Town.
not_available He was standing, blocking traffic.
not_available But he's got that smell, so I thought I'd check.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available We got a diabetic ketoacidosis.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You probably saved his life.
not_available What do you want, a medal? Give him 10 units regular insulin, lV push.
not_available Start a drip, 10 units per hour.
not_available I want him hydrated as soon as possible with normal saline.
not_available And you want KCl? Not on your life.
not_available Get a CBC and lytes.
not_available Call me with the potassium, and get a blood gas.
not_available Did you get the message your wife called? No.
not_available I'll call her in the morning.
not_available Hello, Mrs.
not_available Harvey.
not_available Okay, let's have a look here.
not_available He seems to be doing fine.
not_available Oh, I'm so grateful.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern came so quickly.
not_available He saved his life.
not_available Yes, well, Dr.
not_available Morgenstern's a wonderful surgeon.
not_available He said you did a lot too.
not_available Actually, I just helped out a little bit.
not_available That's all.
not_available I'll check on you later, okay? I'm sorry I yelled at you.
not_available You want some coffee? Sure.
not_available I wouldn't kid you about that.
not_available I had a few.
not_available Maybe more than a few.
not_available Hell of a party, though! Okay, Mr.
not_available Murphy, you are done.
not_available Already? I didn't feel a thing.
not_available No, I didn't.
not_available I still don't.
not_available And he was in, I guess, ten days.
not_available And you know what it cost? $ 24,000.
not_available More than $ 24,000! That's what it cost.
not_available And I want to know where doctors get off charging money like that? Medical costs certainly are on the rise.
not_available That's why we need national health insurance.
not_available It's a scandal! Those doctors should be ashamed of themselves.
not_available Many of them are, I'm sure.
not_available Let's hear what folks out there think.
not_available Call Carl Barker on Nightline.
not_available We'll be back in just a minute.
not_available That's it? Anybody else? Well, I got a little problem.
not_available My throat's acting up.
not_available You need to see a doctor.
not_available Which room? 
not_available Five and six are open.
not_available Five.
not_available Is that it? Well, my throat.
not_available I've got some soreness.
not_available I'll be in Room 8.
not_available You got a pen? Wake me at 6:30.
not_available That gives you an hour and a half.
not_available You're lucky.
