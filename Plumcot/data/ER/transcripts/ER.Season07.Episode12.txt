not_available How is this per diem situation working out for you? 
not_available Could be better.

center Dr.

not_available Dr.
not_available Benton's bio can be found in your handout materials.
not_available He's all yours.
not_available Is your appointment the direct result of the Trip's investigative report about the declining numbers of African

not_available How can you ensure minority representation at the medical school in this post
not_available affirmative action era? E.

not_available I'm sitting right here.
not_available This is his sparring partner, Walter.
not_available Lip lac and a possible broken jaw.
not_available Aren't you too old to be fighting? Never too old to defend a lady's honor.
not_available This was over a woman? Grace is in all her steps Beauty in her eyes In every gesture, dignity and love

not_available I'll let you know in four hours.
not_available We getting a little backed up?

not_available Who's on the service? Peter.
not_available But she's stuck in a press conference.
not_available Who? 
not_available Peter.
not_available She's been in for an hour.
not_available Who's "she"? What? Who's giving a press conference? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But I heard Peter's in it.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you call Radiology? They sent this guy back without his films.
not_available Is there any bone exposed? 
not_available I have to rongeur it.
not_available I need the x

not_available How'd it happen? 
not_available They just lost it.
not_available No.
not_available The finger.
not_available I don't know.
not_available He won't say.
not_available Chuny already tried.
not_available Looks like some kind of saw.
not_available What did he say? I told you.
not_available Someone bring him in? 
not_available He took a cab.
not_available What cab company? Nobody saw him arrive? 
not_available Malik was out there.
not_available Why? 
not_available We should put a call in to OSHA.
not_available OSHA? They monitor workplace safety requirements.
not_available He's probably illegal and not saying anything because he doesn't wanna lose his job.
not_available That's his choice, isn't it? 
not_available Until someone gets seriously hurt.
not_available I'll find out.
not_available I just need you to call Radiology.
not_available What are you crying about? 
not_available You should have talked to me first.
not_available I did.
not_available I said a little extra money for added responsibility.
not_available I don't like being used.
not_available Everyone is used.
not_available It's what makes the world go round.
not_available You gave me that job because I'm black.
not_available You're discounting your finely honed public relations skills.
not_available I don't want it.
not_available Sure you do.
not_available You should have thought of that before your press conference.
not_available I need a minority to be the director.
not_available But it won't require any real work.
not_available It'll get you that much closer to a full
not_available time faculty position.
not_available You can find somebody else to be your poster boy.
not_available Well, the truth is I don't have anyone else.
not_available Which is why the diversity issue needs your immediate attention.
not_available You don't even believe that.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available But it doesn't really matter, does it? It's on your shoulders now.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Time's up, Peter.
not_available Did I misread the schedule? 
not_available What schedule? You canceled six cases in the past week.
not_available No, they were rescheduled.
not_available Which means canceled.
not_available One had a fever, one had an emergency.
not_available All of them happen to be the more complex procedures.
not_available It's simple coincidence.
not_available Look, I've been completely slammed by this review.
not_available Nothing seems to be up to standard.
not_available I have every confidence in you.
not_available But I need an associate chief who actually performs surgery.
not_available I do.
not_available I will.
not_available Once I get out from under all of this.
not_available No, today.

not_available What? There's no blood.
not_available He didn't crack your skull.
not_available He couldn't crack a smile.
not_available I'm a big proponent of marriage.
not_available Of course, you gotta be married to the right person.
not_available Is that a proposal? 
not_available We have to get to know each other first.
not_available We have to wait for the x
not_available ray.
not_available I don't see any other injuries.
not_available Anything else hurt? Nothing I want to talk about in mixed company.
not_available Well, I'm a nurse.
not_available If I'm gonna talk to you about my private parts I'd prefer to do it in a social setting.
not_available Does it hurt when you pee? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How did you know? Do you have an enlarged prostate? 
not_available It's large enough.
not_available Well, it could be prostatitis.
not_available I'm gonna need a urine sample.
not_available You'll have to hold it a little lower.
not_available I am going to show you to the bathroom.
not_available Actually, it feels more like something you pick up.
not_available Pick up? 
not_available A burning.
not_available I got it once before when I was stationed in Korea.

not_available Dropped his systolic to 70.
not_available Bradying down to 50.
not_available Open the fluids.
not_available Pump in O
not_available neg.
not_available What are you doing? Massive blood loss.
not_available Could be the cause of his low BP.
not_available Or he could have blown out his brain stem.
not_available Crit's 39.
not_available Doesn't sound like blood loss.
not_available You want Oneg? 
not_available But if you wanna try transfusing Hang two units on the infuser.
not_available I'll put in a central line.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Is this the other guy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Superficial abrasion.

not_available I got this.
not_available What, 20? 
not_available Nineteen.
not_available He's 15.
not_available He's drunk.
not_available I could smell the alcohol.
not_available He came over that way.
not_available You didn't give her anything? Who? 
not_available Your friend.
not_available He brought beer and his dad's gun.
not_available You made him hold the gun to his head.
not_available No.
not_available Hell, I went first.
not_available It was his idea, but you went first? 
not_available Better odds.
not_available Better odds? 
not_available That's the point.
not_available It's not a game! She blew his brains out! Who's "she"? What? 
not_available You said she.
not_available He! He's dead.
not_available He loaded the bullet.
not_available He knew what could happen.
not_available Why aren't the police arresting this idiot? 
not_available I didn't kill him.
not_available The hell you didn't.
not_available Did you call it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available After 45 minutes of CPR.
not_available I should never have started.
not_available You wanted to make sure.
not_available You would have called it from the beginning.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I'm lazy.
not_available Mark, please.
not_available You wanted to give it a chance.
not_available No big failure.
not_available I'm going back upstairs.

not_available So, Elizabeth? Yeah? Is Mark doing okay? 
not_available Very well.
not_available There's no change in personality or? 
not_available He's a little tired.
not_available Why? Have you noticed that he's mixing his pronouns? Mixing? How? Like saying she when he means he.
not_available No.
not_available Has he said anything to you about it? 
not_available I don't think he realizes.
not_available Maybe you've misheard.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Starting my shift.
not_available Okay.
not_available You wanted to see me before I started my shift.
not_available I've been thinking about it.
not_available The fact that you claimed responsibility I think is a positive sign.
not_available Therefore, I feel that I can't summarily dismiss you.
not_available But? 
not_available What chip are you up to? Your AA chip.
not_available How many days of sobriety? 
not_available Two hundred and forty.

not_available That's me.
not_available Nurse Firecracker.
not_available Married? 
not_available None of your business.

not_available Married her when she was 32.
not_available Waiting for the right guy, I guess.
not_available Damn right.
not_available We were married for another 32 years before she passed.
not_available But don't worry, because feisty gals like you always take a little longer.
not_available I wasn't the one who was brought in for fighting.
not_available Well, Earl started that.
not_available He was flirting with my Victoria.
not_available Who's Victoria? 
not_available My lady friend.
not_available Are the two of you intimate? I still get up a full head of steam, if that's what you're driving at.
not_available I see.

not_available A little coke.

not_available You can tell.
not_available Check her out.
not_available These files, Dr.
not_available Benton's.
not_available He doesn't have a box anymore so they came back.

not_available I'll make sure she understands the risks.
not_available Be careful.
not_available I don't want a lawsuit.

not_available Call them back.
not_available That's great.
not_available We have to report unsafe working conditions.
not_available He wouldn't even say how he cut it.
not_available He was scared.
not_available Scared of getting deported.
not_available Nobody's getting deported.

not_available Shut up, Frank.
not_available Hey, I heard you got stuck with grumpy old men.
not_available Horny old men.
not_available They have chlamydia.
not_available How old are they? Late 70s.

not_available Better not.
not_available Why not? Because I'm back to not pushing narcotics.
not_available You told Weaver? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was okay? 
not_available Not okay.
