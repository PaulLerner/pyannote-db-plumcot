
not_available Hello, I'm Eriq La Salle.
not_available This week we lost the creator of our show, Michael Crichton.
not_available A gentleman, gracious and witty.
not_available Brilliant writer, intelligent, unfailingly kind.
not_available But most of all, Michael was a good friend and we will miss him.
RUSSELL Baby.
not_available Where are you?.
not_available What are you doing in here?.
not_available I hate this wallpaper.
not_available We'll redo it.
not_available I don't know what you were thinking last night, talking about that.
not_available It was a dinner party, I didn't pick the topic.
not_available Well, you certainly didn't hesitate to dive right in.
not_available Maybe that's because you won't talk about it when we're alone.
not_available You think I blame you for what happened?.
not_available You think I'd still be here if I did?.
not_available I try not to worry about who you blame.
not_available No offense, living with a teenage boy is like living with an animal.
not_available Only, cows make better conversation.
not_available Butt abscess.
not_available Needs dressing.
not_available At least a cow's not a predator.
not_available Sarah's friends are like a pack of she
not_available wolves with cell phones.
not_available Look, a new one just for you.
not_available Anal warts.
not_available This is so ass.
not_available Looks like the Gates
not_available Taggart merger's in full swing.
not_available You mean the Brady Bunch from hell?.
not_available It's going great, she'll never admit it.
not_available Really?.
not_available Okay.
not_available Never been happier, loves to complain.
not_available This much we know.
not_available What's that supposed to mean?.
not_available Sorry?.

not_available God, with the age again.
not_available neck mass and dysphagia.
not_available Dis
not_available what?.
not_available Uh, pain on swallowing.
not_available Saying it fancy doesn't make you seem smarter, Andrew.
not_available It makes you seem insecure.
not_available It's a shorthand doctors use, to save us time.
not_available Yes, in theory.
not_available Uh, her son noticed the mass about three months ago when she visited him in Michigan.
not_available Ann Arbor.
not_available He's a professor at the university there.

not_available Let's stick to the thyroid.
not_available That's what we're here for.
not_available I'm with you, Bollywood.
not_available Uh, no palpitations, diaphoresis, heat intolerance.

not_available Everything was good, she was happy.
ALVARADO And then the baby was just gone.
TECH Go deep.
not_available Go.
RUSSELL Go, go, go!

not_available An emergency, call the radiologist.
not_available It's not an emergency but it needs to happen today.
not_available I have a homeless vet.
not_available Cognitive deficits, behavioral changes.
not_available Let Neuro work it up.
not_available They said they want him as an outpatient, which is never gonna happen.
not_available He's not an ER patient anymore, it's out of our hands.
not_available He was in lraq.
GATES A war hero.
not_available Served in the same unit I did back in Desert Storm.
not_available I hear the harmonica playing, Dr.
not_available Gates, but work is work, the rest is irrelevant.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield, I get this whole tough
not_available boss thing and it works for you it really does, but cut me some slack.
not_available I need your help.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield, the old ball and chain on line two.

not_available SSRls.
not_available Antidepressants.
not_available Didn't help much.
not_available They discharged you on a 5
not_available 1 3.
not_available Do you remember what that is?.
not_available Yeah, it meant that I could go home.
GATES No, it meant the Army could stop giving you medical care
not_available lt meant I could get out of there.
not_available Because they said you had a personality disorder.
not_available Something wrong with you before you enlisted.
not_available Maybe there was.
not_available That's what my old man always said.
not_available What if there wasn't?.
not_available What if it was a lie?.
not_available Your symptoms are consistent with a traumatic brain lnjury, TBl.
not_available You could have suffered when that rocket hit.
not_available So you're saying what?.
not_available They dumped me?.
not_available I'm saying I think they missed it mistreated it and sent you packing for the cheapest possible price.
not_available I wanted out, doc.

not_available Maybe we should be safe.
not_available It's just like last time.
not_available Look, it's stopping already.
not_available Are you sure?.
not_available I've been doing this too long to make promises.
not_available But I'll tell you losing control is not going to help her.
not_available If that's what you gotta do, do it outside.
not_available In here, you be the mom, you be calm you put energy into helping your girl fight back because that's what she needs.
not_available Can l

not_available We're trying to clear overflow as quickly as possible.
SAM Miss Mendenhall is crashing.
not_available Well, that's one way.
SAM BP down to 6O, palp.
not_available We've got a massive Gl bleed.
not_available Saline wide open on pressure bags prep for central line, two units on rapid infuser.
not_available Let's go.

not_available Hey.
not_available She complain of abdominal pain?.
not_available No.

not_available Uh, no.
not_available Not so far as I know.
NEELA Suction's on high.
DUBENKO Okay.
not_available Call Gl.
not_available Endoscopy if we get her pressure up.
SAM Lost the pulse.
not_available Ah, damn it.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield, our frozen girl's having runs of v
not_available tach.
ALVARADO I've got the amiodarone.
not_available Give 75 milligrams and set up an infusion.
MARTlN Got it.
not_available BP's 67/32.
not_available Valecia's temperature's dropped a little.
not_available We're working on that.
not_available It's supposed to go up.
not_available I said stay calm.
not_available I'm stepping up rewarming with some pleural lavage.
not_available You see that?.
not_available Huh?.
not_available How are coags?.
not_available Platelet count?.
ALVARADO Not back yet.
not_available Specimen clotted, we had to send it again.
not_available We should not have to wait an hour.
not_available We'll give platelets and FFP empirically.
BANFlELD Why do we have to fight the same battles every damn day?.
not_available Go on, do it.
DUBENKO How long have we been going?.
not_available Thirty
not_available nine minutes.
not_available It's time for another epi.
not_available lt won't do any good.
not_available What about the Gl consult?.
not_available They won't scope a patient without a pulse.
not_available Dopamine?.
not_available Eight units of packed cells, two FFP.
not_available We've replaced her entire blood volume twice.
not_available If the heart could come back, it would have by now.
not_available We're done.
ANDREW Uh
not_available uh.
not_available We're done.
not_available Two, three, four.
not_available Elevenfifty
not_available eight a.m.
not_available Any relatives?.

not_available Please.
not_available Pull the curtain behind you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available T omorrow's not good enough, she needs it now.
not_available What's the hold
not_available up?.
not_available There's no ECMO unit in the hospital.
not_available What?.
not_available That can't be.
not_available County only has two machines.
not_available One's in use, the other's out for repairs.
not_available Systolic's down to 44.
not_available Valecia needs a machine that will warm her blood and do the work of her heart and lungs.
not_available We don't have that here, so we have to transfer her to another hospital.
not_available It's gonna take hours for a hospital to accept her, a transport team to pick up.
not_available Time is critical.
not_available So let's not waste it.
not_available Call transport.
not_available Go.
not_available This girl's not stable enough.
not_available Increase rewarming, get the heart in better shape before we ship her out.
not_available She still has a pulse and a BP.
not_available Now is our window.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield.
not_available She's here now.
not_available We gotta work with what we have.
BANFlELD We don't need to go to the hospital.
RUSSELL You don't know that.
not_available He's groggy, he's post
not_available ictal.
not_available Just like what happened the other time.
not_available That wasn't the same.
not_available He was fine in 1 0 minutes.
not_available He had a full workup, he stayed overnight.
not_available Spinal tap, CT.
not_available You're not being objective.
not_available They terrified him and found nothing.
not_available It was nothing.
not_available Febrile seizures recur.
not_available The pediatrician warned us about it.
not_available What if this is different?.
not_available If he is not better in 20 minutes, we'll take him in.
not_available She's in v
not_available tach again.
MORRlS We got a pulse?.
ALVARADO Thready femoral.
not_available Okay, Morris.
not_available Lead the way.
not_available Let's move her to a trauma room.
not_available Prep for peritoneal lavage.
not_available T en more liters of warm saline and grab a thoraseal.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're leaving?.
not_available Get it started.
not_available I'll be in soon.
not_available It was probably diverticulosis.
not_available So she blew an artery in her colon wall and bled to death.
not_available It wasn't foreseeable.
not_available She had none of the predictors.
not_available Like bloody stool?.
not_available Yep, that would be one.
not_available She had it.
not_available Well, it's not here.
not_available You never said.
ANDREW She had it.
not_available Did you do a rectal exam?.
not_available Check for occult blood?.
not_available Did you ask her about any specific signs of Gl bleeding?.
not_available She, uh
not_available She said something about the food making her stool red.
not_available Why didn't you bring this up at rounds?.
not_available Because she had so many complaints.
not_available Her headache could have been a brain bleed, her backache a ruptured triple
not_available A.
not_available It's your job to decide what needs to be considered and when to speak up.
not_available If you're submissive when someone's life's on the line, you're not ready
not_available I try to speak up and nobody listens! Let's discuss this later.
not_available There's no way to be ready for something like this.
not_available But in the end, it'll make you better.
not_available You can't be a great doctor until you've killed a patient.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I've heard that before.
not_available I think it's called a rationalization.
not_available It's only been 1 5 minutes.
not_available It's too long, I'm
not_available I'm calling 91 1.
not_available Russ, he's waking up.
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available How you feeling?.
not_available Hey little man, you had us scared.
not_available Can't have our number one wide
not_available out on the injured reserve list.
not_available Here, have some water.
BANFlELD Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! 
not_available Oh, don't bother, that's my private line.
not_available ER.
GATES Vindication.
not_available Look.
not_available ""Diffuse axonal injury in the parasagittal white matter, consistent with TBl.
not_available "" 
not_available Yeah, and this is vindication because?.
not_available This is gonna save Max's life.
not_available Put him on a path of getting healthy, medical coverage.
not_available You convince Neuro to readmit him.
GATES I can, with your help.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates.
not_available lndulge that inner softy one more time.
not_available This is the last time.
not_available I wanna hug you.
not_available You'll be the one with traumatic injury.
not_available You're the best.
not_available Dr.
not_available Banfield.
not_available Yeah?.
not_available Valecia lost her pulse.
GATES Hey, Suri.
not_available What happened to my patient?.
not_available That bed's been empty.
not_available Anybody see him leave?.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Frank.
not_available I had a guy in there from radiology, Max Gonzalez, a vet.
not_available He had a duffel bag?.
not_available You seen him?.
not_available That guy was real jumpy.
not_available He went outside for a smoke maybe 1 5 minutes ago.
not_available Max! Hey, Max! 
not_available Max! Wait up! What happened?.
not_available Went into v
not_available fib.
not_available Didn't respond to the shock, she's still too cold.
not_available This is why I wanted to transfer.
not_available This is what I was worried about.
not_available Think she'd be better off coding in a rig?.
not_available Please.
not_available I stayed calm.
not_available I did what you said.
not_available Please help her.
BANFlELD Please.
not_available You don't need to do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't want him to pull the lV.
not_available I'll hold his hand instead.
not_available It's getting harder to bag.
not_available Might be pulmonary edema.
not_available Get sterile.
not_available You can help with the thoracotomy.
not_available Thoracotomy?.
not_available Why?.
not_available Myocardial irrigation.
not_available I'm gonna open your daughter's chest, flush saline over her heart.
not_available No, please, don't.
not_available Something else! 
not_available I know it's scary.
not_available Try something else! If we don't get her heart beating, she'll die.
not_available I'm gonna need a 1 0 blade.
not_available Is there a fire, Mama?.
not_available No, baby, we're in an ambulance.
not_available We're gonna make sure you're okay.
not_available Where's daddy?.
not_available He in the car right behind us.
MORRlS Are you sure about this? We are not gonna let this baby slip away.
not_available Not here and not now.
PlCKMAN Okay, ma'am we're here.

not_available I had to be somewhere.
not_available It was an atypical presentation.
not_available Nobody could have picked it up.
not_available If I had just brought him in earlier.
not_available He had acute leukemia, that's why he died.
not_available It might have given me another day.
not_available A little more time.
not_available They said we can go now.

not_available Greene.
not_available Take care, both of you.

not_available Maybe we've been fooling ourselves.
not_available Maybe we've been done for a long time, but never figured it out.
not_available I never blamed you.
not_available Never.
not_available I used to think every day that if God told me I could die and go to heaven and be with Daryl, I would do it.
not_available I wondered if that made me an awful person that I'd give up my life with you give up everything we could still have in the future.
not_available But I never really got away from the feeling like I need to be with him.
not_available Dreaming of him.
not_available I never got away from the idea that somehow I'd be able to hold him again.
not_available I've been afraid for so long.
not_available I don't want to be afraid anymore.
