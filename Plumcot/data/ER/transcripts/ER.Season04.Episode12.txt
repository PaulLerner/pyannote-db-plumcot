not_available No problem.
not_available Never had you scheduled in the first place.

not_available I taught her everything she knows.
not_available Next! Ellis, is it true Lady of Pity's ER is closed? Oh, no.
not_available Not closed.
not_available But they're not accepting paramedic traffic.
not_available Well, critical cases don't tend to be walk
not_available ins.
not_available What's the matter? I just had a woman nearly bleed out because she was in an ambulance for 15 minutes too long.
not_available That's bad.
not_available It's cases like hers that forced SPG to reconfigure their ER.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available They had a substandard trauma panel and their surgical coverage was spotty at best.
not_available Soon as we get new docs and upgrade equipment, she'll be back up.
not_available How soon will that be? The sooner the better.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available She'll probably live.
not_available She had the best care in the world, that's why.
not_available She was lucky.
not_available That's why.
not_available Mr.

not_available It moves through your system and then lays its eggs below your skin.
not_available Wait.
not_available A worm has been crawling through me for almost a year? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Why didn't the other doctors catch this? It presents like an abscess.
not_available When you had it drained it got worse.
not_available What's to be done? 
not_available Controlled removal.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Harrison says they grow a meter long.
not_available I really didn't need to hear that.
not_available I got about two centimeters.
not_available Toothpick, please.
not_available And a length of tape.
not_available Keep that taped down, and come back daily to continue the extraction.
not_available I gotta catch a 6 a.
not_available m.

not_available Hey, John?

not_available I remembered a couple Thanksgivings ago when we had bad pheasants, you hooked us up with whatever that was.
not_available Compazine.
not_available Right.
not_available It worked like a charm.
not_available I thought you'd give me a scrip.
not_available Excuse me for a second.
not_available Come here.
not_available You didn't just drive all the way here from the Loop to get Compazine.
not_available This isn't what you bring to the company nurse.
not_available You don't want your parents to find out about the heroin.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm not! I mean, I stopped two nights ago.
not_available And I just I need something to get me over the hump.
not_available If you need it to get over the hump, you're in withdrawal.
not_available Why don't you go to the cafeteria? And I'll go and I'll get you into a detox center.
not_available You're overreacting.
not_available You could've gone to any doctor, but you came to me! You're asking for my help! You've read too many I can't help if you slam the door in my face.
not_available You can help me, you just choose not to! Thank you! 
not_available The best thing to do is let him go.
not_available Pardon me? I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
not_available A friend of mine had a drug problem.
not_available I've had this conversation more times than you could imagine.
not_available I appreciate it.
not_available I can handle this.
not_available I know you don't want to talk but don't let him drag you in.
not_available I'm not gonna get dragged into anything.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What's in there? Eye of newt? Cajun Tofu Gumbo.
not_available And don't make that face.
not_available Whatever happened to beef stew and five
not_available alarm chili? Olbes is macrobiotic, me and Zadro are doing that Zone diet.
not_available Do you have kings? 
not_available Go fish.
not_available I should've taken the P.D.
not_available exam.
not_available Hoagies and doughnuts.
not_available Those guys know how to eat.
not_available Have any tens? Carol, please.
not_available Tell me that you're a real American.
not_available Red meat, the occasional brewski.
not_available I admit I'm not a big fan of nuts and berries.
not_available You hear that? That's the voice of common sense.
not_available Well, Mickey D's is right up the street.
not_available I have to say Zadro brought by incredible flourless carob brownies.
not_available They were good.
not_available Carob? Why bother, bro? Powell, you really are a caveman.
not_available Eights? That's us! More tofu for you there, big daddy! I had a lumpectomy and a lap choly on my schedule but when Anspaugh says jump, I say Sieg heil.
not_available I'm going to transect the ileum with the GIA stapler.
not_available Reinforce the staple lines with Reinforcing is very thorough.
not_available Our British colleague isn't always so detail
not_available oriented.
not_available I haven't noticed that to be true.
not_available Her baby blues would look better over this bowel than your mug but you know female surgeons.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Why don't you tell me? Always something to prove.
not_available Often at the expense of the case.
not_available One of the things I like about you, you're not a militant minority.
not_available We have the results of the frozen section.
not_available Bcell lymphoma? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Damn! 
not_available I knew it.
not_available Someone's gonna have to tell Anspaugh, and I am voting for you, Peter.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver, glad you could join us.
not_available I was explaining our plan to pursue industrial contracts.
not_available Can I speak to you for a minute? Sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The ER doesn't stop for lunch.
not_available Go take a seat, and we'll join you as soon as we can.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's up? I've been doing a little research.
not_available SPG closed 60 percent of their trauma centers in the Midwest.
not_available Why is that? Where did you hear that? 
not_available The Internet.
not_available I wish you had come to me first.
not_available You know, I did.
not_available You gave me the party line.
not_available Since I don't know where you got your figures, I can't address them.
not_available I can say a 60 percent downgrade by itself doesn't reflect our reconfiguration.
not_available Ellis, it's me.
not_available You can speak English.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me give you an 
example Kellogg Memorial in Detroit was a shambles as an acute
not_available care facility.
not_available Now it's a national hernia center.
not_available That does you no good with a stab wound.
not_available Neither does a hospital bankrupted by unreimbursed care.
not_available Emergency care is only for people who can pay? You're twisting my words.
not_available You're avoiding my questions.
not_available I'm not avoiding your questions! Look, if you're worried about County, don't.
not_available You're essential.
not_available You're not going anywhere.
not_available If everyone else closes, someone needs to handle the trauma.
not_available Are you going to lunch? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm not hungry.
not_available What to pick? What to pick? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, you got messages.
not_available From who? They were all from your cousin Chase.
not_available He says you can phone the prescription to De Gooyer's Pharmacy.
not_available Unbelievable.
not_available I need your John Hancock on this.
not_available Hey, Malik.
not_available Jeanie, what's up? Still got a friend at Startime Tickets? 
not_available Sure.
not_available What you need? I need a couple of rinkside Blackhawks Islanders tickets on the 20th.
not_available And I want world peace and a date with Tyra Banks.
not_available Can you get them? You know that's gonna run you.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Just ask.
not_available If you're living that fat, I might need to date you.
not_available Hey, Chase.
not_available It's John.
not_available You there? Pick up.
not_available Call me back when you get this.
not_available I'm at work.
not_available You know the number.
not_available So, Allison see, the two cords on the screen need to touch and vibrate in order for you to regain your voice.
not_available But as it is now, the left one is paralyzed.
not_available If you understand me, blink once for yes, twice for no.
not_available Good.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday, you here to observe? I'm actually here for Allison if she doesn't mind.
not_available Oh, fine.
not_available I was just explaining the procedure.
not_available All right.
not_available Now I'm going to make a slight incision.
not_available You should only feel a little bit of pressure.
not_available Okay? Kerry! Why aren't you at that big SPG luncheon? I had some work to do.
not_available Everything seems to be trucking right along, though.
not_available For the most part, sure.
not_available But this is a big step we're taking.
not_available I agree.
not_available Thanks to you, we're lighting a fire to institute some real change.
not_available I think we should be that turning the ER over to an outside management group is what we want.
not_available Well, isn't it? On paper, sure.
not_available Is something the matter? No.
not_available No, not at all.
not_available I just thought we could delay the board vote a week or two
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, how can I help you? Well, we got the results of Scott's frozen section.
not_available All right.
not_available We can discuss this later.
not_available Now is fine.
not_available Let's see.
not_available There's a recurrence of his lymphoma.
not_available We won't know if we got it all until we take a look at the tumor margins.
not_available Do you see any serosal seeding? No.
not_available What about infiltration to the liver or spleen? No metastasis.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, continue then.
not_available Let me know when Scott is awake.
not_available So, Kerry, where were we? Ha! You owe me a dollar.
not_available I only smoked half a cigarette.
not_available Half a cigarette is still a cigarette.
not_available At this rate, we're gonna be in Club Med by February.
not_available Not true, that was my last one.
not_available I'm going back on the gum tonight.
not_available You know what we could do tonight? 
not_available S'mores.

not_available It's about your cousin.
not_available I know what I'm doing.
not_available You don't look like you do.

not_available Don't leave me! Allison, it's imperative that you hold perfectly still.
not_available All right? This is the home stretch.
not_available You're doing well.
not_available All right.
not_available Now I'm gonna ask you to swallow for me if you can.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available Now can you say "E"? That's okay.
not_available You just need to clear the secretions.
not_available All right, good.
not_available Let's try again.
not_available You can do it, Allison.
not_available Doctor, you're a genius.
not_available I'm just doing my job, that's all.

not_available I'm going to help.
not_available Help me! I'm gonna help you.
not_available I'm gonna help you, but you gotta stick with me! Come on.
not_available All right? 
not_available Peter.
not_available Hey.
not_available How was the Beaumont surgery? Kotlowitz is optimistic she'll have full use of her voice in a few weeks.
not_available Oh, congratulations.
not_available How about the Anspaugh boy surgery? You know, well.
not_available As well as we hoped.
not_available It's been a long day.
not_available I could use a drink.
not_available How about you? No.
not_available I don't drink.
not_available Your body's made up of 60 percent water.
not_available You must drink something.
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available Well, have a lemonade or a Yoo
not_available Hoo for all I care.
not_available I think it'd be criminal to let this day end so early.
not_available Unless you were gonna spend time with your son.
not_available I wouldn't want to
not_available He's with his mother.
not_available So? Yeah, well Yeah.
not_available You know, I like lemonade.
not_available Splendid.
not_available Can I help you? We're the EMS team with County.
not_available She had a cat.
not_available Have you seen it? Nope.
not_available Anyone seen a cat around here? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available Is it okay if we look? Sure.
not_available We're almost done.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sometimes they come running if they hear a can opener.
not_available Here's some stairs.
not_available Maybe it got to the roof.
not_available Come get your dinner.
not_available I think it hissed at me.
not_available He'll come out eventually.
not_available Pretty up here, huh? I'm just glad to be out of there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Hey, you're right.
not_available What happened back there, it It got to me.
not_available Reminded me of my mom.
not_available Your mom? When I was 9, she hung herself.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, I was the one that found her.
not_available Seeing that lady, with the ligature marks and her head turned like that cops all around.
not_available I was pissed, all over again.
not_available I'm sure she didn't mean for you to find her.
not_available But I did.
not_available Then I started feeling guilty because I was thinking about myself instead of that old lady.
not_available Like my mom was only thinking of herself.
not_available What a sick boy I am, huh? I thought about everybody but me when I tried to kill myself.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available Why would you? It was a long time ago.
not_available I got wrapped up in everyone else's expectations.
not_available I forgot who I was.
not_available And now? Now I'm okay.
not_available Even tried to go to med school, but it wasn't me.
not_available Couldn't get the hang of that 9
not_available iron? I don't know.
not_available I opened up a clinic in the ER.
not_available It's only open a couple days a week, but But nothing.
not_available I mean, that's 
not_available That's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're "Supernurse"! But what about you? 
not_available Me? What are you thinking about? That it's freezing out here, and I wish that damn cat would come out.
not_available I know it's getting late.
not_available If you got somewhere to be No, I'm fine.
not_available What are you thinking about? I'm thinking I'm not feeling the cold.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I'm thinking that cat will come out when she's good and ready.
not_available Probably.
not_available I'm thinking if I look at you one more second, I'm gonna have to kiss you.
not_available Has anyone seen Carol? Not since that ride
not_available along.
not_available I haven't seen her either.
not_available No one's seen her.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll do that.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available If anyone sees her, tell her to call Doug.
not_available He's getting worried.
not_available Good night, everybody.
not_available Good night.
not_available There you are.
not_available You leaving? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I put together those figures I promised you.
not_available I thought we could go out to dinner, talk it over in a more relaxed setting? Yeah.
not_available I think I should think about this alone.
not_available Let me give you a hand.
not_available No.
not_available I don't
not_available I'm fine, thanks.
not_available Kerry, what can I do to make you feel better about this? Delay the board vote.
not_available I'm willing to give you whatever information you think you need.
not_available But delaying the vote isn't an option.
not_available I can't support something I don't believe in.
not_available And it seems SPG puts profits ahead of patient care.
not_available Synergix provides the most care for the most people.
not_available If that means giving them an Oldsmobile instead of a Rolls, so be it.
not_available Decent care shouldn't be a luxury.
not_available It shouldn't.
not_available And that's what we give people, decent care.
not_available And nothing more? 
not_available More bankrupts hospitals.
not_available I can't be part of an organization that low
not_available balls people's lives.
not_available That's a cheap shot.
not_available Oh, man! I just need time alone to think about this.
not_available About Synergix or me? Let me give you a ride home.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Kerry, don't do this.
not_available I don't care if the computer says it was processed.
not_available Because I phoned the scrip in hours ago.
not_available If it was processed, then I would have the meds in my hand right now.
not_available Yeah, I'll hold.
not_available Want some of this? Finally! 
not_available Hey.
not_available Anna.
not_available What are you doing here? You called in a prescription for Compazine.
not_available You're gonna need more than that.
not_available Trust me.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Chase.
not_available Hey, Anna.
not_available Sorry I didn't tidy up.
not_available You should see my brother Hank's place.
not_available It's a Superfund site.
not_available I got clonidine and propranolol.
not_available Propranolol? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I borrowed it from the ER.
not_available I also got your saline and rectal Compazine.
not_available Rectal? Do I get my choice of doctors? I think that's the sort of procedure you should keep in the family, okay? I'm gonna get this started.
not_available This'll lower your heart rate and take the edge off the jitters.
not_available You'll be okay.
not_available Visualize the bull'seye lean into the throw and release! 
not_available It's easier said than done.
not_available Try it.
not_available No, you're too stiff! Wait a minute.
not_available There you go.
not_available Nice aerodynamic form.
not_available Now, a small movement with the wrist.
not_available That's not bad.
not_available Can I get you some refills? I'll have another Newky Brown.
not_available A Perrier.
not_available You got it.
not_available Are you an alcoholic? 
not_available Excuse me? Is that why you don't drink? No, no.
not_available Are you a Muslim? I notice you don't eat pork either.
not_available Nothing against liquor, I don't like the taste.
not_available So it's not a control thing? 
not_available No.
not_available Of course not.
not_available You know, you should try a Pimm's.
not_available Tastes just like ginger ale and fruit.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available You're so resistant to new things, Peter.
not_available We'll shoot for it.
not_available Whoever gets closest picks the next round.
not_available I'll even drink that frog water of yours.
not_available You've been doing this all your life.
not_available I've never done this.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll throw backwards with my eyes closed, and you can shoot straight.
not_available Oh, yeah? You will? You got yourself a deal.
not_available Come on, watch this.
not_available Do this aerodynamic thing that you were talking about.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Hey, Jeanie.
not_available Hey.
not_available What are you doing awake? You need your sleep.
not_available I kept my end of the deal with surgery.
not_available What about you? What do you mean? Blackhawks/Islanders? Right.
not_available Center ice.
not_available That is so cool.
not_available So we got a date? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks, Jeanie.
not_available Sure.
not_available You have a good sleep, okay? Are you leaving? Well, not if you don't want me to.
not_available It gets kind of creepy in here at night.
not_available That's all.
not_available Why don't I just sit here until you fall asleep? Thanks, Jeanie.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available These are great photos.
not_available Those are Chase Carter originals.
not_available Really? Pretty stuff.
not_available Not what I would have expected.
not_available He's got a lot of talents.
not_available I guess that's why this is hard to understand.
not_available Well, this happens to all kinds of people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available When I said that I had a friend on heroin, I wasn't being completely honest.
not_available How so? It was my boyfriend.
not_available I've done the detox dance more times than I can count.
not_available How come you didn't cut him loose? It's not that easy when you love someone.
not_available No.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available You think this is the worst of it? I wish.
not_available Well, you were right.
not_available I don't know what I'm doing.
not_available No.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available What are friends for? I guess they're kicking us out.
not_available Yeah.
not_available That's life.
not_available Yep, that's life! Neither one of us is in any shape to drive.
not_available Listen, I didn't mean to get you drunk.
not_available It's just I've never seen that happen from two Pimm's before.
not_available Thank you! I should call us a cab.
not_available I'd invite you back to my place but I fear I'd be taking advantage.
not_available My head is spinning.
not_available I should just get some sleep.
not_available It's probably best.
not_available Taxi! When you get home, drink plenty of water.
not_available If you have any aspirin or B
not_available complex, all the better.
not_available So where can I drop you? 
not_available It's okay, I'll get my own cab.
not_available You sure? Hey, Elizabeth.
not_available I had a really good time.
not_available Yes it was delightful.
not_available Good night.
not_available Night.
not_available I've been waiting for you all night.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I got wrapped up.
not_available I called here but you weren't home.
not_available I was on the corner of Dearborn and Clark.
not_available Right.
not_available I called the hospital and the firehouse.
not_available And they both said that Unit 57 came back on time.
not_available I was talking to Greg Powell.
not_available He was the paramedic on my ride
not_available along.
not_available It was a really tough day for both of us It's like when you start talking to someone you hardly know and you tell them things.
not_available Talking to him all night? We got coffee and we talked.
not_available And since then I've been walking.
not_available In this cold? 
not_available I needed to think.
not_available About what? About you and me.
not_available And the engagement and the vows and the rings.
not_available I think we're rushing into this.
not_available I don't think we're ready.
not_available I'm ready.
not_available But you aren't? When I was talking to Greg Powell, it got intense.
not_available And I kissed him.
not_available It didn't go any further.
not_available But it was one of those moments, you know? I didn't want it to Okay, that's good.
not_available I just wanted to make sure you were safe and sound.
not_available Doug! I am so sorry! Yeah, me too.
