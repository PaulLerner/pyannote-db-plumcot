not_available I've been clean for a year.
not_available Heroin.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, maybe we could try a mild sedative like Valium.
not_available No, man.

not_available Hopefully, I'll be drunk then.
not_available No doubt.
not_available Good behavior! I'm serious.

not_available section? Yeah.
not_available So? Any chance you're pregnant now? No.
not_available I got fixed after Diana.
not_available I got pictures.
not_available But these cuffs! Save it, Morris.
not_available I'm missing my visit with her right now.
not_available I don't know when I'll see her next.
not_available Why? My sister's moving to L.A.
not_available And there's no one else to take care of her.
not_available She's 7.
not_available I got four years mandatory before I see her again.
not_available Should've thought before you broke parole.
not_available I just wanted to see her today.
not_available That's all.
not_available She's probably better off.
not_available Shut up! You shut
not_available Sara.

not_available That's it.
not_available Hold it right there, Rena.
not_available She needs more sedation.
not_available She's a former addict.
not_available She doesn't want any narcotics.
not_available I gave her a local.
not_available She needs more than that.
not_available I offered.
not_available She refused.
not_available Stop.
not_available I almost got it.
not_available Stop! Abby? She asked me not to administer narcotics.
not_available Give her 10 of morphine.
not_available No! No! Keep going.
not_available We need to relax you to pop your shoulder back.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available I want to respect her wishes.
not_available If we don't, you could end up with permanent nerve damage.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Push the morphine, Abby.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know what? I'm off the clock.
not_available She's all yours.
not_available I'm out of here.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I had a dream last night that I'd be in a car wreck, but I'd survive.
not_available My grandmother could predict when her cat would get sick.
not_available In the dream, I strangled a female doctor with my bare hands.
not_available Hey, Cleo.
not_available Is Malucci here yet? No.
not_available We're done.
not_available Someone'll be back to fit you for crutches.
not_available Just sit tight.
not_available You should get dressed now.
not_available So when he gets here, we can go.
not_available This might not happen, between this storm and how swamped we are.
not_available You should go ahead without me.
not_available Are you serious? Yeah, Malucci only said he'd try.
not_available He couldn't promise.
not_available What? 
not_available Cleo, come on.
not_available That would've been nice to know.
not_available It would've been nice if you'd asked me to go.
not_available What? I did.
not_available No.
not_available You RSVP'd and told me to save the date.
not_available Cindy Purcelli? Right here.
not_available All right.
not_available So, what are you saying? You don't want to go? I don't have a need to attend your ex

not_available It's no big deal.
not_available She's getting married.
not_available Peter.
not_available Listen, if you don't want to go, just say you don't want to go.
not_available All right.
not_available All right what? 
not_available I don't want to go.
not_available Fine.
not_available Amira, I need a car.
not_available What are you doing back? 
not_available A car.
not_available I need a car
not_available Peter! Peter, can I borrow your car? I need to get to the church.
not_available I'm on my way now.

not_available I'll just change in your car.
not_available Where's Cleo? Are people arriving? A few.
not_available Any sign of Mark? He'll be here.
not_available Where's Isabelle? She went off looking for someone to complain to about the temperature.
not_available So I'm going to be a grandfather.
not_available This won't affect my dating, will it? One can only hope.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, maybe I'll be better at it a generation removed.
not_available Parenting.
not_available Listen, I didn't turn out that badly, did I? That was luck! You gonna continue to practice after the baby's born? Eventually.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available That's good! I know what you're thinking.
not_available For years I criticized you and Mummy for all the time you spent working.
not_available Now I'm about to do the same.
not_available I'm sure you'll strike a better balance.
not_available You don't believe that.
not_available Actually, I do.
not_available No answer? Just the church service schedule.
not_available Elizabeth is gonna be on the verge of a meltdown.
not_available Yeah, I bet.

not_available Oh, he's okay.
not_available You know him? 
not_available Yeah, I met him.

not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Is he a nice guy? Who? Elizabeth's dad.
not_available Well, he seemed nice.
not_available That's good.
not_available Because her mother can really be a piece of work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What is it with women and their mothers? I mean, I got along with my mom.
not_available You? She was the best.
not_available Must be a chick thing.
not_available And weddings really bring it out.
not_available So have you met Cleo's mom? 
not_available No.
not_available Really? Thought you guys were pretty serious.
not_available What the hell is the problem? This isn't gonna leave a scar, is it? Not that you'd notice.
not_available A nurse will be by to put on a dressing.
not_available JingMei, we've got a hypothermic 10year
not_available old coming in.
not_available ETA? 
not_available Ten to 15.

not_available There's nothing you can do.
not_available I'm missing it! 
not_available No, you're not.
not_available It started, Peter.
not_available Obviously, it hasn't.
not_available I am screwed.
not_available She'll wait, Mark.
not_available Mark, what are you doing? Mark! Mark, get off my car! I'm trying to see what the hang
not_available up is.
not_available Mark, get down! I think I see lights.
not_available Maybe a cop.
not_available Maybe a rig.
not_available Mark, get down! Now! Come on, man! Get down! Sevenyear
not_available old male, environmental exposure with secondary hypothermia.
not_available This is ice.
not_available Rain's freezing everything.
not_available Any idea how long he's been down? Groundskeeper found him down on the soccer field.
not_available No ID.
not_available Guess the game got rained out.
not_available Where's the rest of his team? 
not_available Or his parents? BP is 70 palp.
not_available Core temp is 86.
not_available Pupils are slow but reactive.
not_available Set up for re
not_available warming.
not_available Start a second line of warm saline.
not_available And put in a Foley.
not_available He's about 80 pounds, soaking wet.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Let's get him out of these wet clothes.
not_available She just wants to see you.
not_available Is that so hard? I know it's been a long time.
not_available How many years has she served for you? Hello? Jerk.
not_available Who's a jerk? 
not_available Nobody.
not_available You feeling any better? 
not_available No.
not_available Why don't you go lie down? I'll take you home when I'm done.
not_available Okay, I just have to finish this first.
not_available Are you mad at me? Me? No.
not_available You were a little hard on Carter.
not_available He wasn't listening to me.
not_available He's a good doctor.
not_available And he's been here for a long time.
not_available And I'm his Attending.
not_available I know.
not_available It's just he's my friend.
not_available So? He's a nice enough guy.
not_available But he's got to let me do my job.
not_available Isn't he your supervisor? 
not_available Technically.
not_available So this has nothing to do with him dating your ex? No.
not_available Actually, Abby and I never really went out.
not_available You said you did.
not_available I made that up.
not_available Why would you make that up? 
not_available I'll explain later.
not_available So you'd like to go out with her? Hey, Dave! Nice weather, huh? Do you know Rena? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Fine, thanks.
not_available I didn't think you'd come.
not_available Cleo didn't need me and a few girls from Sal's party like weddings.
not_available Did you RSVP for them? There's bound to be a couple of no
not_available shows.
not_available Few extra butts in the pews couldn't hurt.
not_available Where can I dump this? They'll probably have a gift table at the reception.
not_available I'm supposed to lug this around? It's heavy.
not_available Didn't buy them a crock pot, did you? 
not_available We got something off the registry.
not_available I'm not into that.
not_available "Here's a list of things to buy me.
not_available " It's dicky.
not_available Evening, gentlemen.
not_available What? You didn't think I'd be invited? So where's the bride? She's in waiting.
not_available Dr.

not_available Really? Well, if he's smart he's halfway to Mexico by now.
not_available runs me off the road! It's my wife! Ex
not_available wife, you cheating son of a bitch! Kept ramming me over and over, completely out of control.
not_available Can you control your zipper, Kevin? Look at this! Shove your mid
not_available life crisis up your ass! You could have killed me, Brenna.
not_available Everybody, settle down.
not_available How long before you clear the street? 
not_available Sir, would you step off to the side? I'm getting married.
not_available Get back to your car.
not_available Nothing's moving.
not_available We're waiting for a tow truck.

not_available Can you tell me your name? Bryan Cooley.
not_available Bryan, do you remember what happened? I was waiting.
not_available I think I fell asleep on the field.
not_available What were you waiting for? They were supposed to pick me up.
not_available Who? Your teammates? My parents.
not_available They forgot.
not_available Well, there's a pretty bad storm outside.
not_available Maybe they were just running late.
not_available No.
not_available They work a lot.
not_available Sometimes they forget.
not_available Are you denying it? I had to work late! Doris! 
not_available What are you doing here? I'm stuck.
not_available Can you give me a ride to Northbrook? 
not_available That's outside my area.

not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available Okay.
not_available If you help me clear the scene.
not_available Sure.
not_available Let's hurry.
not_available Screwing around was an accident? 
not_available You're crazy.
not_available I'm home having your baby.
not_available We have to check you over.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Let her check your signs.
not_available Let him bleed.
not_available If you're okay, you can take yourself.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available I'm a doctor.
not_available Hit your head? What do you think? Mark, what are you doing? 
not_available I'm gonna catch a ride with Doris.
not_available I got it.
not_available Wait in the car.
not_available No.
not_available Check her out.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? Is there any pain? Is she getting more fat put in her lips? She didn't slam her car into anybody, you psychotic bitch! 
not_available We need to check your head.
not_available He doesn't think with that head.
not_available Are you all right? Okay, come on.

not_available What's wrong?

not_available We'll let you know.
not_available Make yourself useful, Charles.
not_available Get us a glass of water.
not_available I hope Mark didn't get cold feet.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Surely he would've called if there was a problem.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, he's not answering his cell phone.
not_available He probably left it at work with his wallet.
not_available Men get just as nervous as women on their wedding day.
not_available Right, Charles? Well, to be honest, I was never more More anxious.
not_available Practically forgot it was our wedding day.
not_available That could've been wishful thinking.
not_available It would've saved me several years of grief.
not_available Stop it, please, just for one day! 
not_available We were teasing.
not_available Well, don't! It's not funny.
not_available Oh, he'll be here, Elizabeth.
not_available Don't fret.
not_available But I do fret! Every time he's late, I fret.
not_available Every time he slurs a word, gets tired or bumps his head, I fret! I'm about to get married.
not_available And I'm afraid.
not_available Not of being with him.
not_available But of being without him.
not_available I'm afraid he won't be around to raise this child.
not_available But you told me the last MRI showed no recurrence.
not_available The new therapies offer a long survival.
not_available We don't know that for sure.
not_available Oh, darling, don't start crying now or we'll never get through the ceremony.
