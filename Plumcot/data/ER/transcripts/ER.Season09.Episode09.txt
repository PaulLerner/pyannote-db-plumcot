not_available How'd it go today? 
not_available Not so well.
not_available He left.
not_available What do you mean, "He left"? He withdrew from the program.
not_available And went where? 
not_available You should probably ask your mother.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available She came and got him an hour ago.
not_available I got no problem with you.
not_available Fire Leon and you do.
not_available Use a broom on him, and you've got a bigger problem.
not_available He wouldn't leave.
not_available Shows up every day, works his ass off and does every damn thing you tell him.
not_available He gets kicked to the curb, he doesn't understand.
not_available Somebody gets in my store after hours with a key how the hell do you think they got one? Think I left it in the door? 
not_available For all I know, Leon ripped me off.
not_available No.
not_available He's not like that.
not_available Everybody's like that.
not_available Even if it was his friends, they tricked him.
not_available He wouldn't have a clue.
not_available That dumbass brother of yours ain't so dumb
not_available Hey! The man took a bullet to the head.
not_available He's not dumb.
not_available Get away from me.
not_available Look, he wouldn't do this.
not_available Get away, or I'm calling the cops on you and him.
not_available Leave Leon out of this.
not_available You understand me? Leave him out of it.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Garding? What happened? 
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I don't know how much you were told.
not_available Next to nothing.
not_available Your ex
not_available husband and your son were involved in a car accident.
not_available Morgan has a broken ankle.
not_available It's relatively minor.
not_available Thank you, Jesus.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brenner's injuries, however, were far more extensive.
not_available And 
not_available Did he die? Oh, my God.
not_available I understand that it's been some time since you've seen Morgan.
not_available Three years.
not_available And are you? Are you aware that he's been living as a girl? His father and I disagreed on how to handle that.
not_available Morgan wanted to live with his dad, so I didn't fight it.
not_available Morgan hasn't been told about his father's death.
not_available I can't be the one.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I can take care of that.
not_available I do think it would be better if you were there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Morgan's gonna need crutches for about six weeks.
not_available There's a chance that he may require a little physical therapy.
not_available Otherwise, he should recover fully.
not_available Good.
not_available Morgan? What's wrong? Honey? What are you doing here? Where's my dad? Morgan, your dad was hurt very badly in the accident.
not_available No.
not_available We did what we could for him here.
not_available Then he went up to an operating room.
not_available No! They worked on him for a long time in hopes that his heart would start pumping again.
not_available No.
not_available But it didn't.
not_available And he died.
not_available No! No, no! It's gonna be okay.
not_available Sweetie? I'll take care of you, okay? I'll take care of everything.
not_available How soon before I can play basketball again? Soon.
not_available After the reduction, put Mr.
not_available Trotter in a sugar tong splint until the swelling goes down.
not_available And the short arm cast for six weeks after that? Your ears get red when you lie.
not_available How are you holding up, Matilda? You don't even have to try, do you? Sorry? 
not_available With women.
not_available I checked with Surgery.
not_available They should be ready to take you up in an hour or so.
not_available Is that pronounced Kovac? Kovac.
not_available Spell your first name for me, please.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Tipping you.
not_available You seem like a nice young man.
not_available I can't accept your money.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because you need it for yourself.
not_available I never had a soul to spend it on.
not_available Not even a cat.
not_available I'm frugal.
not_available I'm 82.
not_available Trust me.
not_available I have enough to last.
not_available I can't.
not_available Says who? Take it! I'm an old arthritic woman.
not_available I can't hold my arm out forever.
not_available Now, take it.
not_available Can someone really do that? 
not_available Never had it happen before.
not_available How much is it? 
not_available I didn't look.
not_available A patient writes you a check, and you don't look? Oh, my God.
not_available You accepted money from a patient? I'll look at it.
not_available That's completely unethical.
not_available It made her feel good to give me a token of appreciation.
not_available So, yes, I took it.
not_available Hello.
not_available Have her send you a basket of muffins.
not_available It'll probably bounce anyway.
not_available It's for $10,000.
not_available Melody Cranston's medical recs.
not_available Thick enough to support Munchausen's.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available Six months ago, she had a fractured orbit from falling off a ladder.
not_available Which is pretty damned impossible.
not_available Yeah? A month after that she was back.
not_available Multiple abrasions a contusion and a forearm fracture.
not_available Broken jaw in 2000.
not_available Broken ribs in 2001.
not_available Looks like Melody's got a lousy boyfriend.
not_available I tried to call.
not_available What's the matter with you? 
not_available He doesn't want to do it this way.
not_available He doesn't? Or you don't? Where is he? Abby, the only way someone with this disease gets better is if they want to.
not_available What, so until then we just wait it out? Is that it? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't say that.
not_available Well, then what are you saying, Mom? What's the plan here? Does he even have one? Do you have one? We' re going back to Minnesota in the morning.
not_available What? No, you' re not.
not_available Do you have any idea how many strings I had to pull to get him into that center? I'll get him to see my psychiatrist at least once a week.
not_available This is a proven program! 
not_available I'll keep him on his meds if I can.
not_available If you can?! 
not_available I realize this is hard to understand.
not_available No, it's impossible, actually.
not_available I love him too.
not_available So what? You think you' re the only one that's there for us.
not_available Maybe that's true.
not_available No! That is true! 
not_available All right.
not_available But, Abby, I'm here now! Where is he? Afebrile, normal vitals after What about his glucose? 
not_available Last two were fine.
not_available Slow start on the Enfamil, but he's good now.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Time to go, baby.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We've both have been in here for hours, and I haven't seen his face.
not_available Could I? Hey, your first roommate wants to meet you.
not_available Beautiful, isn't he? 
not_available I love this age.
not_available It's when they really need you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Say bye
not_available bye.
not_available Okay.
not_available Bye
not_available bye.
not_available Did you ever figure out a name for him? No.
not_available Did your boyfriend leave? 
not_available He had to get to work.
not_available Right.
not_available So how are you feeling? 
not_available About the same.
not_available I mean, in general.
not_available Have you been upset? Or depressed? 
not_available No.
not_available Not really.
not_available Then why'd you take an aspirin overdose? What was it? Like, 20 pills? That must've been some headache.
not_available Are you trying to get his sympathy, or are you trying to get away from him? We both know you've been beaten.
not_available A lot.
not_available Melody, someone is hurting you.
not_available You have to turn him in to the police.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available I couldn't.
not_available Violence isn't going to stop on its own.
not_available I just need a few days.
not_available Look, we both know
not_available He's joining the Navy.
not_available Your boyfriend? My son.
not_available All right, Jerry, talk to me.
not_available What'd I miss? Security stopped a guy with a crossbow coming in.
not_available Yosh forgot to put Conni's ice
not_available cream cake in the freezer.
not_available Carter's wondering where you've been.
not_available Hey, I had business to attend to.
not_available I signed my patients off to Chen.
not_available He asked and you asked.
not_available Did you dispo the diabetic ulcer in 1? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available And Mr.
not_available Barnsdale got moved to the ICU.
not_available Mr.
not_available Brenner back from surgery yet? 
not_available He exsanguinated in the OR.
not_available What? 
not_available Died about an hour ago.
not_available Where's Morgan? 
not_available With his mom, I think.
not_available I thought I told you not to do anything.
not_available Well, you weren't here.
not_available Learn to follow simple instructions! I did, per Dr.
not_available Carter! What are you doing? 
not_available I can't bring him home this way.
not_available Please, put down the scissors.
not_available Come on.
not_available His stepfather will never accept him.
not_available You do not need to do this.
not_available It's my right.
not_available He's my little boy.
not_available I'm doing this for him.
not_available It's the best thing.
not_available So how often do you get earaches? 
not_available Only when it's cold and windy.
not_available And you live in Chicago, huh? 
not_available Well, blame my parents.
not_available Much rather have grown up in Jamaica.
not_available Where'd you grow up? Dr.
not_available Chen? She described you.
not_available She said she'd been here earlier.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hi.
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available I want my baby back.
not_available Is this the mother? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Do you want to tell me what happened? 
not_available No.
not_available I just want him back.
not_available Oh, yeah? For how long? Can you give me the potassium level on Mr.
not_available Pinkus? Look, I was just really scared before, but I'm not anymore.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Romy.
not_available Do you think you can really take care of a baby, Romy? 
not_available My mama will help me.
not_available You told her? No.
not_available But I'm going to.
not_available He's mine.
not_available Can I see him? Chuny? Yeah? Please take Romy to see her baby? 
not_available Sure.
not_available This way.
not_available You gonna call Social Services? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mother of the year, huh? 
not_available At least she's trying.
not_available She left her baby with a bunch of strangers.
not_available How's that trying? Make sure she gets an examination before she leaves.
not_available V
not_available tach.
not_available Not surprising after lying on the floor for two days.
not_available She probably got a blood clot that broke off and went to her lungs.
not_available Happens all the time.
not_available Why didn't someone come get me? 
not_available She had an advance directive.
not_available No heroic measures.
not_available How come I didn't know about it? 
not_available Gave it to me a little while ago wanted to make sure it was out of her purse and in a medical record.

not_available Jeremy? She ready to go? 
not_available Not quite.

not_available She's always complaining about headaches.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Anyway, we'll need to keep her here for observation.
not_available For how long? We need to treat her abdominal pain, keep her hydrated on IV fluids.
not_available A couple of days, at least.
not_available I'm shipping out in a couple days.
not_available Good thing they invented telephones.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Maybe I misheard.
not_available What was your diagnosis? 
not_available Unintentional aspirin overdose.
not_available Unintentional? 
not_available What she's telling the social worker.
not_available And we' re admitting her? Her son knocks her around.
not_available Her son? 
not_available And he leaves for good in two days.
not_available She doesn't want it to be for jail.
not_available So you made up a diagnosis.
not_available No, I stretched one.
not_available Sounds unethical.
not_available So's eavesdropping.
not_available What number? 
not_available 309.
not_available You have a key? 
not_available Yes.

not_available Okay.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Eric, don't do this.
not_available Move your hand.
not_available You need help.
not_available I don't wanna hurt you.
not_available You can't do this by yourself.
not_available You need stability.
not_available Let go.
not_available Someone you can rely on and trust.
not_available That's not you anymore, okay? You don't understand.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available You think you do.
not_available But you don't.
not_available You' re not like us.
not_available You never will be.
not_available I'll call you when we get settled.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available Abby.
not_available Abby! Taking off? I have to make up time.
not_available Seems like I took too long of a break.
not_available You can't just leave.
not_available I signed out to Chen.
not_available Breaks are for 10 minutes in the hospital.
not_available You were gone for over an hour.
not_available Look, you weren't here.
not_available So I overrode your order to Harkins.
not_available But it's not like I had much of a choice.
not_available You could've waited paged me.
not_available You could've respected the kid's wishes.
not_available He's a minor.
not_available You could've called Social Services in.
not_available To do what? Remove him from the home? Hey, I feel bad about what happened too.
not_available But like it or not, she's his only family.
not_available Define "family.
not_available " That's her.
not_available She never told me that I just thought that she gained some weight.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Oh, I so need a margarita.
not_available Are you ready? 
not_available I think I'm gonna pass.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available I hate drinking alone.

not_available Next in line.
not_available Help you? 
not_available Yeah, I need to cash a check, please.
not_available ID and most recent pay stub.

not_available Yeah.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Hundreds okay? Sure.

not_available You know, my boys.
not_available They gave it to me.
not_available They won it or something.
not_available Leon, did it come in a box? Every once in a while I'll have a really perfect cigarette.
not_available You know? Everything about it is perfect.
not_available The taste, the moment.
not_available Of course, 99 percent of the time, it tastes like crap.
not_available Causes cancer.
not_available That too.
not_available I left you a message.
not_available How'd it go? With what? With your brother.
not_available You gonna let me in or do I have to guess or? Nothing happened.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Come on.
not_available Despite the best
not_available laid plans, nothing happened.
not_available Mostly because they left.
not_available What? They went off into the sunset.
not_available Very romantic.
not_available Wait, your mom and Eric, they' re gone? 
not_available You know I don't wanna talk about this now, because it's ruining my perfect smoke.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I'm done.
not_available I'm done with the both of them.
not_available I'm done with all of it.
not_available Cancel Christmas.
