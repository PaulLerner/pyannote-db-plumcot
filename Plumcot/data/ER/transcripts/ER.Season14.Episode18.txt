not_available I got nothing.
not_available No, I'm sleeping fine, work's good, I'm good.
not_available Surprised, you know, that I'm okay.
not_available Didn't think I would be.
not_available I mean, who would? But I am.
not_available Hostage situations are very traumatizing.
not_available Especially when there's a fatality involved.
not_available Yeah.
not_available No doubt, no doubt.
not_available Are we done? 
not_available Lf you wanna be.
not_available Okay, then, yeah, yeah.

not_available You all right? Yeah, yeah.
not_available Fourth time's the charm, right? Yep.
not_available I think I heard that somewhere too.
not_available So you've been at County since you were a nurse, right? 
not_available Well, you must like it here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Amazing people.
not_available It's hard to imagine being anyplace else.
not_available Well, it feels like home? 
not_available Yeah, sad but true.
not_available Yeah, I did some time in a county hospital.
not_available In the trenches, the adrenaline.
not_available It's great and frustrating.
not_available Constantly fighting the system or trapped in some bureaucratic quagmire.
not_available Am I right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You're pretty right.
not_available Here, no bureaucracy, no broken system.
not_available Just the best care we can provide every patient we treat.

not_available put database.
not_available Always ask your nurse for preemptive orders.
not_available You won't have to wait for an attending.
not_available Thank you, Chuny.
not_available You're welcome.

not_available I didn't ask you, Laverne.

not_available Is it a head bleed? 
not_available No, no sign of trauma.

not_available Thought it was the flu.
not_available Okay, everybody goes right to hep A and B.

not_available You what? 
not_available We found your wallet.
not_available Our clerk was able to get in touch with your mom, and she's on her way.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Don't worry, we'll figure this out.
not_available You had no right to go through my things.
not_available I don't want anyone here.
not_available Well, you're pretty sick, and I'm fine on my own.
not_available I don't need any help.
not_available Everybody needs some help sometimes.
not_available Nothing to be ashamed of.
not_available Saline at the splenic flexure.

not_available Fourth liter's up.
not_available Crap.
not_available I think the bowel's perfed.
not_available Page Dubenko.
not_available You nick it removing the graft? Injury's old and ratty.
not_available Maybe we missed it.
not_available Page Lucien yet? Yeah.
not_available What do you wanna do? GIA stapler? Lesion's less than 30 percent.
not_available Better off with dÃ©bridement and primary closure.
not_available Okay, 15 blade pickups and 3
not_available 0 vicryl.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm keeping my hand in the midline.
not_available Now elicit a fluid wipe.
not_available Laverne, would you mind calling the lab for our results, please? After that, I'll show you how to check for urine bilinogen.
not_available So, Lois, you said you first got sick a few weeks ago? You live with somebody? Alone.
not_available I left home a long time ago.
not_available Abby? I've got the mother here.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Lois passed out on the crosswalk.
not_available We think she's having problems with her liver.
not_available Lois? Who is Lois? Where is my son? I'm sorry? 
not_available I'm Edith Landry.
not_available They said you had my son, Loni.
not_available I'm right here, Mom.
not_available Let's get Pete's village.
not_available No, no, let's get some beef.
not_available You guys like sweet peppers or hot? 
not_available Both.
not_available Me too.
not_available And dip twice.
not_available Shut up.
not_available You're making me hungry.
not_available I haven't had normal food in days.
not_available You got a little fever.
not_available I've had a fever for weeks.
not_available I'm not worried.
not_available Good.
not_available We'll check back in a bit, okay? Thank you.
not_available Why's she still spiking? It's to be expected when you've manipulated infected tissue.
not_available Fever, shifting vital signs.
not_available All part of the healing process.
not_available Should have done a resection and anastomosis.
not_available Primary repair was the right thing.
not_available Maybe my sutures were too loose.
not_available Stop it.
not_available I've watched you do primary repair of a bowel perf a hundred times.
not_available But I just can't be positive 
not_available Neela, you stepped up.
not_available You made the right calls.
not_available I told you I didn't want anyone here.
not_available She's upset.
not_available You know, sometimes the people closest are the ones that have the hardest time with the truth.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Look, we'll talk about it when I get home, okay? Okay.
not_available Bye.
not_available That was my husband.
not_available I lied to him.
not_available He doesn't know that Loni is here.
not_available We're not sure yet, but I think her liver is failing.
not_available Her? 
not_available I know.
not_available It's a lot, I know.
not_available When you people called me, you said my son was here.
not_available There was a driver's license in the personal belongings bag.
not_available Our clerk used it to contact you.
not_available We had no idea.
not_available Loni always had a flair for the dramatic.
not_available We woke up one morning six years ago and he was just gone.
not_available My strange, sweet little boy just gone.
not_available He never had many friends, you know.
not_available Kept to himself.
not_available His father, they never saw eye to eye.
not_available Um I have to go check on some of Loni's tests.
not_available But you can go in there if you like.
not_available I'm "sure " your child could use the company.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I don't see anything.
not_available Surveillance footage.
not_available Right there.
not_available Charlie's crew caught some couple knocking boots all over the hospital.
not_available I've seen more steam in a shower.
not_available You don't see the gyrating? Look.
not_available Is that a leg? 
not_available We gotta get the picture enhanced bring up the sound levels.
not_available You've got cameras wired for sound? 
not_available Some.
not_available God.
not_available What a tease.
not_available Hey, Morris, you need to sign off on my CHFer.
not_available What are you guys looking at? 
not_available Surveillance footage.
not_available Of what? 
not_available People getting busy all over the hospital.
not_available What? No idea who they are, huh? Uh
not_available uh.
not_available Well, hang onto the DVD, look again, see if you recognize anyone.
not_available Will do.
not_available That look like sex to you? Yeah.
not_available I mean, no.
not_available Well, not good sex, anyway.
not_available Hey, Morris, I gotta go to Psych to do my debriefing.
not_available Did you do yours yet? 
not_available Yeah, it was lame.
not_available Hey, Gates, come here a sec.
not_available What? It's surveillance footage of people having sex in different rooms in the hospital.
not_available I know it's been a long, but that does not look like sex to me.
not_available Frank, I've been waiting forever on LFTs.
not_available Can you check on that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, do you have a minute? Yeah.
not_available Come on, walk with me.
not_available What's going on with the attending job? You still haven't heard anything yet? 
not_available I got another job offer.
not_available What? Where? Payton Medical Center.
not_available They want an answer today.
not_available Can't you get them to wait? 
not_available They've been waiting for two weeks.
not_available Get them to wait one more day.
not_available You told me to get out there, so I did.
not_available I need a plan or end up in Lubbock.
not_available Abby, got Lois' labs back.
not_available They put them in the system under the wrong name.
not_available Bilirubin's, 8.
not_available AST, 10,000.
not_available Look, I'll get an answer as soon as I can.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Landry, I got the test results.
not_available That's him.
not_available Abby, just got the coags.
not_available ProTime's 96.
not_available Okay, hang an FFP.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available We give plasma because her liver is not making proteins to clot blood.
not_available I need to talk to her about this.
not_available I think you should come.
not_available Last HemoCue was 11.
not_available Okay, stay ahead.
not_available Four pack cells.
not_available Hi, Mom.
not_available It's just me.
not_available Don't worry, your father's not coming.
not_available It's been so long.
not_available You didn't call or even write.
not_available I didn't know what to say.
not_available We didn't know where you were.
not_available If you were even alive.
not_available Six years.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please, don't hate me.
not_available Honey, honey, I could never hate you.
not_available Lois.
not_available Lois? Your test results show that you're in liver failure.
not_available Do you take hormones? Estrogen injections, twice a week.
not_available Where do you get them? From a friend of a friend.
not_available A doctor? It's this guy who brings them back from Mexico.
not_available "They're " They're way cheaper.
not_available I'm just trying to save money.
not_available That's okay.
not_available Is there a way we can get a sample? Do you have any at home? I have a vial in my purse.
not_available I had it with me.
not_available It's right here.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know they're in here.
not_available There.
not_available Can you get that to Toxicology? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You think it's the estrogen.
not_available We'll find out.
not_available Have you had the reassignment surgery yet? No.
not_available That's what I'm saving up for.
not_available Hey, Abby, can you wait till next Wednesday? They only do gas chromatography once a week.
not_available Since when? Since budget cuts.
not_available I love County.
not_available What do you mean you didn't get it? Do I have to get it myself? 
not_available No, I'll get it.
not_available It's right there on the desk.
not_available I see it.
not_available Aren't you the cutest thing.
not_available Oh! You going soft on me, Frank? Well, look at the face.
not_available Not doing it for me.
not_available Let me see, let me see.
not_available Please.
not_available Oh, that's so 
not_available What's the matter with you? I'll get it.
not_available No, I'll get it.
not_available I'll get it.
not_available No, I've got it.
not_available Scram.
not_available You've done enough.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates, broken
not_available arm kid is ready to go.
not_available All right.
not_available Oh, my God, look how cute.
not_available Her name is Purdy.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Gaines, what are you doing here? 
not_available Stretching my legs.
not_available Well, you left me back there for forever.
not_available I wrote the discharge at 10 a.
not_available m.
not_available What does it take to send someone home? What? You forget where you work? Would you mind? 
not_available Right this way, ma'am.
not_available Thank you, miss.
not_available Messenger from Payton picked up your toxicology sample.
not_available Abby, Lois is vomiting blood.
not_available Suction's on high.
not_available Push the pack cells.
not_available What's happening? She's bleeding from either her esophagus or her stomach.
not_available She had FFP? 
not_available Two units.
not_available Call GI.
not_available We're gonna heat coagulate with an endoscope.
not_available All right, hold on.
not_available Let's use recombinant factor vlll
not_available A.
not_available It's a brand new drug.
not_available It can normalize the PT in 20 minutes if the FFP fails.
not_available Okay, grand rounds, your show.
not_available Four mgs per kg, IV push.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sensitivities on Sheryl Hawkins.
not_available Cultures came back positive for Acinetobacter.
not_available Resistant to vanco, imipenem Nasalide, everything.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Calling ID.
not_available There must be another drug.
not_available No, Neela, there's not.
not_available She is septic.
not_available If we can't treat this, we lose her.
not_available I understand that.
not_available Why are you not upset? Who says I'm not? 
not_available I don't need to indulge it.
not_available What do you suggest I do? Take a deep breath, gather yourself, and go back in there and find out how aggressive she wants us to be.
not_available Hey there.
not_available How are you feeling? The same.
not_available Eyes and nose look good.
not_available How's PCA working out? You in any pain? No.
not_available Should that have changed? Not necessarily.
not_available You already did your rounds.
not_available Why are you back? I've been here a month.
not_available You never just check in.
not_available Well, there's a first time for everything.
not_available Neela " I'm" a mother of four.
not_available Do you really think I don't know when someone's not telling the truth? Where's your family? Getting lunch.
not_available We should get them back.
not_available Angi output has slowed down.
not_available Looks like your factor Vlll
not_available A worked.
not_available Repeat CBC and coags.
not_available Abby, this is Mr.
not_available Landry.
not_available And a Dr.
not_available Jensen called.
not_available Said he'd try your cell.
not_available Mike.
not_available Edith.
not_available I told you not to come.
not_available You said, "Hospital.
not_available " I thought you got hurt.
not_available Look, I'm fine.
not_available Keep her NPO, D5.
not_available What's going? If you're okay, what are you doing? Mr.
not_available Landry, I'm Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available And maybe you two might wanna talk about this outside, okay? 
not_available Chuny, show them the family room? Sure thing.
not_available Wanna follow me this way, please? 
not_available Check your KUB film and do plasma.
not_available This case got more interesting, didn't it? 
not_available You got this? Absolutely.
not_available Hi.
not_available Dr.
not_available Jensen, hi.
not_available Listen, I really appreciate you running that for me.
not_available Our lab "is " It's a mess, you know.
not_available Yeah, about that.
not_available I need to ask you for a favor.
not_available Yeah, I I was hoping that you would give me one more day to make a decision.
not_available Yeah, I know, I know.
not_available L Right now? No, you're right, you're right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I accept.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll take the job.
not_available Sats only 77 on 100 percent.
not_available Lungs are wet.
not_available Send a blood gas and get her on a non
not_available rebreather.
not_available Translation, please.
not_available The infection is causing fluid to collect in your lungs.
not_available So, what now? Without a breathing tube, your oxygen will continue to drop " and" you'll eventually fall into a comatose state.
not_available Get the tube.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Give me the tube.
not_available But you don't think it's a good idea? You won't be able to talk.
not_available You got a point there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sheryl if we put this tube in, we may never get it out.
not_available So I shouldn't even try to get better? It's not a matter of trying.
not_available The antibiotics aren't working.
not_available Maybe my immune system can fight the infection on its own.
not_available It would take a miracle.
not_available I believe in those.
not_available I need to be sure you understand exactly what I'm saying.
not_available If I don't try, what does that say? That's what I teach my kids.
not_available Put the bed I want the bed up.
not_available I want you to be in my blog.
not_available Can't say no.
not_available Can't say no.
not_available Course I Okay.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi, everyone.
not_available This is the beautiful and talented Dr.
not_available Neela Rasgotra.
not_available She's the one always avoiding the camera.
not_available She saved my life.
not_available Don't you say that.
not_available What the hell am I supposed to say? Excuse me.
not_available We got the toxicology results back.
not_available It's not great news.
not_available Okay.
not_available The estrogen you've been injecting contains tetrachloroethane.
not_available It's an organic solvent extremely toxic to the liver.
not_available How can we fix it? Well, the medicine I gave is only a temporary fix.
not_available It's okay to look at me, Dad.
not_available Lois.
not_available Lois.
not_available I don't think your liver can recover from the damage.
not_available We've already seen bleeding complications, encephalopathy.
not_available If it's very serious, it can cause seizures, a coma or death.
not_available So, what do we do? Your best hope is for a liver transplant.
not_available Transplant? How do we do that? 
not_available There's some kind of list, right? Yes.
not_available But that could take a long time.
not_available There's something called LDLT.
not_available If a family member or a friend is a tissue match, they can donate a portion of their liver.
not_available Siblings have the highest odds of being a match.
not_available We don't have any other children.
not_available The odds are also good for a parent.
not_available We're not doing that.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mike.
not_available Damn it, Edith, no.
not_available We're leaving.
not_available Mr.
not_available Landry, please.
not_available Please, what? You're her only parents.
not_available You already lost her once.
not_available How many times I gotta say no? You're gonna let her die? 
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Edith.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Test me.
not_available Frank? 
not_available Hm? If you're not too busy, could you help me with something? I need somebody big and strong to help me put a box on a shelf in Sutures.
not_available Okay, Sam.
not_available Chivalry's not dead.
not_available Oh, I have to forward the phones.
not_available For the back pain, I have an MVA waiting on LS films.

not_available And I know you know I know.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available Did you talk to Anspaugh? 
not_available No.
not_available I haven't had a chance.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because I took the other job.
not_available What? Why? They wouldn't give me another day.
not_available And it's a really good job.
not_available All right, look, I gotta go, but when I get back, we're gonna fix this.
not_available Okay, everyone, let's get started.
not_available The five
not_available year war in Iraq hasn't yielded weapons of mass destruction but it has given us some advances in trauma resuscitation.
not_available Hemostatic resuscitation is about replacing coagulation factors and platelets early.
not_available So soldiers who received plasma on a oneto
not_available one ratio with PRBC transfusion, have lower mortality.
not_available Lights, please.
not_available You're such a tiger.
not_available Is it coming? 
not_available "Louder.
not_available " 
not_available You're a tiger.
not_available "What?" 
not_available Yes.
not_available That's my kind of presentation.
not_available "That's how tigers play.
not_available " 
not_available That's right.
not_available Oh, mama.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Got everything.
not_available Drainable pouches, no
not_available stink prep wipes, Stomahesive powder.
not_available You romantic fool.
not_available So you need anything? I gotta get back.
not_available More water? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Oh, with ice, please.
not_available Sure, no problem.
not_available Is there anything else I can get you? 
not_available Kiss, please.
not_available So I was thinking, I should stay here for a few days.
not_available Why? Look, we both know that you shouldn't be alone right now.
not_available I can sleep here on the couch and tend to your every need.
not_available And not because I'm supposed to, but because I want to.
not_available Get it? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Good.
not_available Come here.
not_available I missed you, Mommy.
not_available I missed you too.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Landry, we got your lab results back.
not_available And they show you are a tissue match.
not_available Oh, thank God.
not_available How soon can we start? We can't.
not_available The tests also show that you have cirrhosis.
not_available I used to be a drinker but I thought I was okay.
not_available I haven't been sick.
not_available You are okay now, but it's too risky for you to donate.
not_available Mr.
not_available Landry? 
not_available Don't say it.
not_available Mike.
not_available V
not_available tach, no pulse.
not_available She's still ours.
not_available Charging 300.
not_available That is not my kid.
not_available Clear.
not_available I don't know who that is.
not_available No change.
not_available Mike.
not_available Don't you walk out of here.
not_available She's still ours, Mike.
not_available Pulse is V
not_available tach.
not_available All right.
not_available Continue compressions.
not_available Intubation kit, 80 ET tube and suction.
not_available Chuny, what was her last creatinine? Twopoint
not_available nine.
not_available All right, push an amp of calcium.
not_available On the outer 
not_available Just push it.
not_available Can I have a crash cart? 
not_available Were you thinking hypokalemia? Hypo what? Too much potassium.
not_available You said it was her heart.
not_available She's had six units of blood.
not_available A huge potassium load.
not_available If she's in hepatorenal syndrome? Kidneys can't clear.
not_available Her heart will stop.
not_available Oh, God.

not_available He's okay, right? 
not_available Lois is in critical condition.
not_available She's gonna keep arresting or die until she gets a new liver.
not_available Hey, what's up, man? What are you doing out here? Oh, it's slow.
not_available Just taking a breather.
not_available So how'd that trauma conference go? Oh, probably the best one ever.
not_available Really? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available How's Bettina? She's a little sore, but she'll be all right.
not_available You did the right thing going back to her.
not_available Well, actually, it's weird.
not_available You know, I've never felt like this before.
not_available I used to think that falling in love was like getting sick or something.
not_available So we try to avoid it, right? I know what you mean.
not_available You know, I was thinking about the thing that happened to you.
not_available You know, the hostage thing.
not_available Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, you know how things like that go.
not_available You keep thinking about them, even when you don't want to.
not_available So if you wanna talk, man, it's cool with me.
not_available What is there to talk about? I don't know.
not_available It's just sometimes it helps.
not_available I know I've had to do it.
not_available So if you want, you could talk to me or somebody more qualified.
not_available There's no shame in that.
not_available You know, I already did their mandatory little psych debrief.
not_available I don't need it.
not_available I'm good.
not_available All right.
not_available Cool.
not_available I'll see you inside.
not_available Oh, that's right, tiger.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available No way.
not_available We kid you not.
not_available It was great.
not_available I didn't know you had it in you.
not_available Yeah, now you do, you all do.
not_available Sorry, still doesn't look like sex to me.
not_available Oh, my favorite part was the linen cart.
not_available All right.
not_available You know what? There.
not_available You got us.
not_available Gates is my boyfriend.
not_available Are you happy now? Show's over! Now go back to work.
not_available Yeah, what she said.
not_available Cover for me, will you? I gotta go see Uncle Donny.
not_available Sure.
not_available I've been covering all day.
not_available Why stop now? Dr.
not_available Brenner, we're ready to present.
not_available The dutiful young fourth years.
not_available I'm all ears.
not_available Present away.
not_available Fiftysix
not_available year old woman with a history Let's start with the chief complaint that brought her in.
not_available Chief complaint is "headache, backache, nausea, dizziness " That's four complaints.
not_available Go back and find out what the biggest problem is.
not_available Kaya, take a look at the nosebleed in 2.
not_available We're gonna pack it together.
not_available Okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Brenner.
not_available Yes? Why are you treating me like this? Look at me.
not_available Well, what the hell was last night, huh? Boring.
not_available To be honest, dull, mundane, mechanical.
not_available Thank God I had two bottles of Bordeaux in me.
not_available I thought you'd be a better student in bed than you are here but I guess the Bordeaux helped with that as well.
not_available You don't wanna see me? Fine.
not_available But you still have to teach me.
not_available For that to be possible, you'd actually have to have the ability to learn.
not_available I could get you fired for this.
not_available Really? And risk sullying that spotless reputation to become the student that sleeps with attendings and then rats them out? That would be something, wouldn't it? You can fill out all the admit papers up in the ICU.
not_available Nurse Marquez will show you there.
not_available I think she's saying thank you.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Landry, can I talk to you for a second? The people you love, they can't always help who they are.
not_available And they do stuff we don't understand.
not_available But you have to try and get past that.
not_available Especially when they need you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available There is a clinical trial.
not_available It's called a bioartificial liver Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll donate if I can.
not_available How do I get tested? We could do it here.
not_available Come here my love.
not_available Come here.
not_available You got no moves, Dad.
not_available He's got moves.
not_available Shake it, baby.
not_available "Yeah.
not_available " 
not_available Those are moves.
not_available Those are moves.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Look at Mom move.
not_available Family seems to be taking it well.
not_available Should have been in attending this morning.
not_available Would have been the same.
not_available You don't know.
not_available Been operating with you three years.
not_available I do know.
not_available The patient in the ICU would have died.
not_available What? So instead it's Sheryl? You're emotional because you got close.
not_available That's okay.
not_available But it's clouding your judgment.
not_available If wanting her to get the best treatment is clouded then, yes, you're right.
not_available You could have approached the perf differently.
not_available I can't be sure I got all the abscesses.
not_available Stop, okay? I know what it's like to be close.
not_available But you're not a little intern anymore.
not_available I expect you to handle bad outcomes like a professional.
not_available What does that mean? I should stop giving a damn? No, it means, no matter how much we care sometimes the people we try to save die.
not_available Are you trying to rationalize this? Because we both know you should never have left that room.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Please, there are more patients than there are doctors in this place " and" I can't be everywhere.
not_available None of this should be news to you.
not_available This is the job.
not_available Oh, Abby.
not_available Exam 2 lady finished her Dilantin load.
not_available Okay, she can be dispo'd.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Take care.
not_available You too.
not_available Laverne, you know how to bury the knot? Okay, just start at the base of the wound, sub
not_available Q.
not_available Good.
not_available And now go sub
not_available Q to the other side.
not_available There you go.
not_available It gives you better approximation cosmesis.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hey, Abby, wait up.
not_available So I talked with Anspaugh.
not_available I told you, I already took the other job.
not_available Yeah, I know, I know.
not_available Just hear me out, okay? 
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm not interrupting, am I? 
not_available No, not at all.
not_available I was hoping maybe you had a little time next week to talk.
not_available Where have you two been? 
not_available Nowhere.
not_available Exam 3.
not_available Dr.
not_available Gates, G YN has a bed " but" they can't take your PID for two hours.
not_available All right, everybody, listen up.
not_available I have a wonderful announcement to make.
not_available It is with great pleasure to introduce Dr.
not_available Abby Lockhart our newest attending physician.
not_available Cider?

not_available Oh, that's great.

not_available I thought I'd catch you.
not_available I know I'm gonna see you when you pick up Joe but I just wanted to tell you that I got the job at County.
not_available Thought you'd wanna know.
not_available Glasses up, people.
not_available Here's to Dr.
not_available Abby Lockhart.
