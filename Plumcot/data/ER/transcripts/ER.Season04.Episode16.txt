not_available Did Cynthia leave a forwarding address? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Why? 
not_available I've just got some of her stuff.

not_available Cro
not_available Magnon man is considered a modern Homo sapien, just like you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available I didn't say he was as good
not_available looking.
not_available Let's bet on it.
not_available Loser buys lunch.
not_available If you wanna take me to lunch
not_available If it isn't Lucy and Ricky.
not_available You read today's Sun
not_available Times? There's a feature on our Lizzie.
not_available I've got a lapcholy.
not_available "Risking her own life, the resourceful surgeon refused to abandon Leipzinger in the rubble.
not_available The doctor's and patient's fate were now one.
not_available " Not exactly.
not_available You don't have a prosthetic.
not_available I read the article.
not_available I bet.
not_available Not a very good picture of you, though.
not_available We can't all have your devastating good looks.
not_available "Despite her heroic efforts, County surgeons were unable to save the arm.
not_available " 
not_available At least they didn't mention my name.
not_available It was an oversight, I'm sure.
not_available Be sure you tell Larry King you only fly first
not_available class.
not_available I almost forgot.
not_available Your six
not_available month review.
not_available I wish it could be as glowing as the article.
not_available How is he?

not_available What do you keep in it? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Soda.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available BP's 70/40.
not_available Resps, 32 and shallow.
not_available What is all this? 
not_available Photography supplies.
not_available Thinners.
not_available I don't know how he got into it.
not_available We need to know what he swallowed.
not_available Can't you tell? 
not_available He has conflicting symptoms.
not_available Treat him for everything.
not_available It could kill him.
not_available Did you approve a transfer from Bellarmin? Motorcycle accident? A head injury.
not_available John Doe, no ID.
not_available Can't the poison kill him? Can't the poison kill him?

not_available Get a CT.
not_available Pulse ox is falling.
not_available I can't believe they did this.
not_available Should we control an airway? I knew it was a dump, but this is gross negligence.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Two of Versed, 150 sux and 10 of Pavulon.
not_available A 7.5 ET tube.
not_available Got it.
not_available Once we get you cleaned up, they'll let you back on.
not_available It's not right.
not_available I sold all my stuff to buy that ticket.
not_available Yeah? Where were you going? Am going.
not_available I am going.
not_available San Francisco.
not_available That sounds urgent.
not_available I'm gonna get a chest x
not_available ray, check out that cough.
not_available My daughter's there.
not_available I was hoping I could live with her for a while.
not_available Maybe she could wire you money.
not_available I don't have her phone number.
not_available You know where she lives? 
not_available In San Francisco.
not_available I mean, do you have an address? Why do you care? I don't want you stranded in San Francisco.
not_available That's my problem.
not_available I'll meet you in CT.
not_available Call me when Neurosurgery gets there.
not_available Come on, Adrian.
not_available Can you hear me? What happened? 
not_available He's waking up.
not_available Did you find the poison? 
not_available No.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available You're in a hospital.
not_available You gotta tell us what you took.
not_available You need to tell them what you drank.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Listen, buddy.
not_available Adrian.
not_available Stay with us.
not_available Come on.
not_available What was in the can? 
not_available Eric gave it to me.
not_available Eric? Who's Eric? Eric! He's having a seizure.
not_available How many is that? 
not_available His fourth.
not_available They'll fry his brain.
not_available Phenobarb? Keith, stop! Doug? 
not_available Tube him.
not_available Don't! 
not_available What did you give him? Get Security.
not_available Tell me what you said to him, you little bastard! Tell me what you gave him or I'll make you sorry you were born.
not_available He poisoned my son! 
not_available This doesn't help.
not_available He's right, Keith.
not_available Come on.
not_available Get back here, Eric! 
not_available I got him.
not_available Eric? Eric? Hey, Eric? Buddy.
not_available Hey, Eric.
not_available Go away.
not_available Listen, I'm Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available So? You and I have to talk and we don't have a lot of time.
not_available I'm not afraid of you.
not_available It's just you and me here.
not_available Your dad isn't here.
not_available He's not my dad.
not_available Okay.
not_available Your brother is very sick.
not_available Half
not_available brother.
not_available Your half
not_available brother.
not_available He'll die if you don't tell us what you gave him.
not_available Is that what you want? 
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I think you do.
not_available I think you care.
not_available Eric, come on.
not_available Buddy.
not_available Come on out.
not_available Buddy, come on out.
not_available I gotta talk to you.
not_available Come on out.
not_available Hey, there.
not_available Come here, come here.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available What is it? Your stepfather did that to you? 
not_available He's gonna kill me.
not_available No, he's not.
not_available This black bottle, print developer? 
not_available He mixed developer with insecticide.
not_available Cyanide.
not_available I got the kit.
not_available Where's Eric? He's all right.
not_available Start with inhalation.
not_available Amyl nitrate perle.
not_available Then sodium nitrate at 3% solution.
not_available Is he gonna be all right? Wait 15 minutes and then 30 cc's, What is wrong? Why won't you tell us? We're gonna take care of both of your kids.
not_available No way.
not_available I already washed him when he first came in.
not_available What, with soap? I gave him the bar.
not_available The rest was his business.
not_available Can you also try adjoining cities? It's supposed to be on Bellflower Avenue.
not_available If I don't get him clean, he's not getting on the plane.
not_available You know where the showers are.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Carol.
not_available Malik.
not_available See if you can get him clean clothes.
not_available Don't push it.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Greene? It's not trauma.
not_available He's got a subarachnoid bleed, shouldn't have been transferred.
not_available What did Neurosurgery say? 
not_available I'm waiting.
not_available Grab them and get them down here.
not_available Find out what happened.
not_available I'm already on it.
not_available How are you feeling? Better? Steroids always seem to help.
not_available Can you lean forward? Take a breath.
not_available Again.
not_available I think I need a little more theophylline.
not_available I'll check the level.
not_available We'll need a repeat chest film.
not_available What for? To see the same ugly spots? I think the effusion, secondary to your cancer, is back.
not_available If that's the case, we'll need to tap you.
not_available You mean stick a needle in my chest again? It'll make you feel better.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available I think we'll have to admit you this time.
not_available If you were dying, would you wanna spend the rest of your life here? You could go into respiratory failure.
not_available Take me home, Rose.
not_available I don't know, honey.
not_available Maybe we should listen to him.
not_available Rose, take me home, please? Your blood oxygen level is very low.
not_available I'd like to put you on a monitor for a while.
not_available Trust me, doc.
not_available This is as good as I get.
not_available There you are.
not_available All ready for this carotid endarterectomy? Apparently, you don't think so.
not_available You've had a chance to review your evaluation.
not_available I thought I was generous.
not_available I'd hate to catch you on one of your parsimonious days.
not_available Let me make something clear.
not_available I'm your biggest fan.
not_available If I didn't think you showed potential, I wouldn't sponsor you.
not_available Then what's the problem? 
not_available Frankly, you're distracted.
not_available Distracted? You came to study trauma surgery.
not_available Lately, you're more interested in vocal cords and paramedics.
not_available I see.
not_available I suppose I should refocus my energies.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I'm starting a new study on the use of HemoAid in vascular procedures.
not_available It's the artificial blood.
not_available Thought you'd like in.
not_available We could do a paper together.
not_available The ER at Bellarmin as much as admitted he was a dump.
not_available Couldn't get the neurosurgeon to come in.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Zaccarria.
not_available You know him? He has privileges here.
not_available It's a blown aneurysm all right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jerk probably heard "uninsured John Doe" and went to his country club
not_available He doesn't want to open himself up to malpractice without getting paid.
not_available It's against the law and the Hippocratic oath.
not_available It won't help much now.
not_available He's got bifrontal intraparenchymal edema.
not_available I'll put in an ICP monitor and manage him expectantly.
not_available That's it? Continue the mannitol, keep his head elevated.
not_available Maintain hyperventilation and wait.
not_available For him to die.
not_available Basically.
not_available Were his chances better before the transfer? It's hard to say.
not_available You don't know when the aneurysm blew.
not_available There's no surgical option? The only thing you could try is a partial frontal lobectomy.
not_available The chances that that would affect outcome are remote.
not_available So do it.
not_available I can't make that call.
not_available Who can? 
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Mack.
not_available She's in surgery.
not_available Hey, time to reset the clock.
not_available Yeah.
not_available At least take off the patch.
not_available I did.
not_available What are you doing? Well, the copy place swears that they sent the order over here.
not_available The presentation? 
not_available Jerry says he never saw it.
not_available He was throwing a bunch of stuff out.
not_available I knew it! You kept the original? 
not_available No.
not_available Can you help me or are you out of breath? How's that poison kid? He's gonna make it.
not_available Medically he's fine.
not_available Sometimes working with kids is great, but sometimes it really sucks.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Under that crate.
not_available Under that crate.
not_available What's that? Look at that.
not_available What is that? Do they throw bio
not_available hazard out here? It's probably just somebody's pudding.
not_available Why were you so late this morning? I stopped by to check on Cynthia, see if she's all right.
not_available Yeah? Is she? I don't know.
not_available She moved.
not_available Victoria's Secret catalog, huh? Look at the label.
not_available Lily.
not_available Lily! I feel bad, you know? I don't think it was fair.
not_available I was pretty selfish.
not_available I know all about being selfish.
not_available What was really wrong with her? She was, you know, funny, supportiveGood
not_available looking.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She was great in bed.
not_available She was nice to me, which was different from most women in my life.
not_available Give her a call.
not_available She's unlisted.
not_available There it is.
not_available I'm gonna kill him.
not_available Hold on to that.
not_available Jerry! Think he'll make chief of staff? 
not_available It's just to get closer to Carrie.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then she'll console him, and then they'll get it on.
not_available I don't know about that.
not_available She's in love with Austin.
not_available This month.
not_available Wait.
not_available Here, it's back on.
not_available This is what I hate.
not_available Here's Marlena in the hospital.
not_available She's all made up, high heels.
not_available Nobody's that gorgeous all the time.
not_available You're prettier than she is.
not_available That's the nicest thing anybody's said all year.
not_available Don't get a big head.
not_available Yeah, yeah, yeah.
not_available You're all done.
not_available Last round of chemo.
not_available Congrats.
not_available Next week we can go to a movie instead of filling me with nuke juice.
not_available That sounds fun.
not_available What do you wanna see? What movie? I don't know what my schedule is.
not_available I'm working in the ER.
not_available I'm done
not_available Working for my dad.
not_available You're done.
not_available You don't need me anymore.
not_available Don't need you now.
not_available You do your thing.
not_available I'll go get your meds.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Mary Jo Reynolds.
not_available Thank you for saving my son.
not_available Talk to the people upstairs.
not_available They won't let Keith
not_available We are concerned for the children's safety.
not_available That's why he wants
not_available Both your boys are to be placed in protective custody until the Dept.
not_available of Children and Family Services investigates.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Eric didn't mean to hurt Adrian.
not_available This is Eric's way of hitting back.
not_available Hitting back? Nobody hits Eric.
not_available That's for the DCFS to determine.
not_available No one needs to determine it.
not_available It's the truth.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available Eric's out of control.
not_available He has terrible tantrums.
not_available He throws and kicks things.
not_available He lies.
not_available He kicks his teachers.
not_available Keith has to be strict to keep him in line.
not_available Strict? Burning cigarettes into his arm? That's strict? Eric did that to himself.
not_available You can't keep our boys from us! Keith's not gonna like this at all! 
not_available He'll get over it.
not_available I'd avoid the men's bathroom if I were you.
not_available Who's got the kidney stone in 1? 
not_available I do.
not_available He doesn't have money.
not_available I'm worried about his mental health.
not_available All right.
not_available Syncope in 3.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Stick your head in the OR and find out how long she'll be.
not_available The resident checked him.
not_available Six ODs coming in.
not_available Five minutes out.
not_available Paramedics said the site looked like Jonestown.
not_available Call Kerry.
not_available We'll meet them outside.
not_available I know it's unlisted, but listen she's his only daughter.
not_available He needs a place to go.
not_available Your guy passed his stone.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Don't go far.
not_available We got multi
not_available ODs coming in.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Mark Greene from the ER at County General.
not_available I have an older gentleman here who has no place to go.
not_available His daughter is in the area but he doesn't have a number on her.
not_available He says it's unlisted.
not_available Could you help me? What's the name? Hooper.
not_available Cynthia Hooper.
not_available Okay, I've got your Scottie? Do you know where Scott went? He went home about 10 minutes ago.
not_available I thought you were with him.
not_available Thanks.

not_available Not today.
not_available Another two of Narcan.
not_available Prep a dopamine drip.
not_available On my count.
not_available John! John! Yeah? Come here! 
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I got it.
not_available What? 
not_available It's Chase.
not_available You know him? 
not_available It's his cousin.
not_available How long's he been down? I found him in respiratory arrest Asystole! 
not_available I got it.
not_available Where are we? Epi times 2, 2 mgs atropine, Unresponsive to all.
not_available Accucheck the glucose.
not_available Get blood gas, CBC, lytes, tox screen, chest film.
not_available I'll get the gas.
not_available Don't do this, Chase.
not_available Damn you, don't do this.
not_available It looks like he aspirated.
not_available Amp of bicarb.

not_available All right, come on.
not_available He's been down a long time.
not_available Let's roll him.
not_available It's not capturing.
not_available Turn up the gain.

not_available Tell the MICU we're on our way.
not_available We need an EEG and a brain scan.
not_available So where are you taking me? Somewhere cheap.
not_available You won on a technicality.
not_available That statue looked like a caveman.
not_available Really? It reminded me of Romano.
not_available That super
not_available orbital torus, that prognathic jaw.
not_available So much for evolution.
not_available A retrogression.
not_available Don't let him get to you.
not_available Easy for you to say.
not_available You're not a kept woman.
not_available I need his sponsorship to stay in the U.S.
not_available He's trying to rattle you.
not_available If he gives you valid criticism, then compensate.
not_available Overcompensate.
not_available And the study? Well, do you have a choice? 
not_available Peter! His name will come first.
not_available Hey, Jackie.
not_available What are you doing here? Arranging a natural history exhibit for Humboldt Park.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm settling a bet.

not_available Yes.
not_available We support each other quite often.
not_available You've reached the Hooper residence.
not_available I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey.
not_available You wanted to see me? Yeah.
not_available A 4year
not_available old came in wheezing.
not_available Did you get the EEG? Slow diffuse activity.
not_available You think I pushed too far? 
not_available No.
not_available I'd have done the same thing.
not_available I should've gotten him into detox.
not_available If he didn't want to, it wouldn't work.
not_available You helped him the only way he'd let himself be helped.
not_available A lot of good it did.
not_available Did you call your family? His folks are in Singapore.
not_available My grandparents are on their way.
not_available That's probably my neurosurgeon.
not_available You'll be okay? Yeah.
not_available Sure.
not_available Impending respiratory failure.
not_available BP's 90 palp.
not_available Resps, 40.
not_available O2's at 10 liters.
not_available He fought us all the way.
not_available Trauma 1.
not_available He didn't wanna come, but I've never seen him this bad.
not_available You did the right thing.
not_available Pulse ox down to 88.
not_available We started an IV.
not_available He wouldn't let us intubate.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mr.
not_available Kyle, we're gonna take care of you.
not_available We're gonna get a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available We'll probably have to do that tap.
not_available Will he be here long? I promised he wouldn't have to stay.
not_available I'm afraid we'll have to admit him this time.
not_available All right.
not_available On my count.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available Are you his doctor? Do you know him? I'm his son.
not_available What happened? How did he get here? We're not exactly sure.
not_available We don't even know his name.
not_available Tom.
not_available Tom Dibble.
not_available How did you find? 
not_available Cops.
not_available They had his motorcycle.
not_available They sent me to the wrong hospital.
not_available The other hospital sent him here.
not_available Why? What's wrong with him? He had a brain hemorrhage.
not_available He wasn't wearing his helmet? 
not_available Not from the trauma.
not_available He had an aneurysm.
not_available A vessel ruptured.
not_available It probably caused the crash.
not_available What do you do to fix it? We're trying to relieve the intracranial pressure with medication.
not_available But it's not working? I'm waiting for Neurosurgery to take a look.
not_available They can operate? There's a slim chance that a partial frontal lobectomy might work.
not_available And if it doesn't? He'll die? He might.
not_available That's a mess.
not_available End
not_available stage lung cancer.
not_available He's still alive? 
not_available If you call it living.
not_available He's a smoker, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Shouldn't you be at a podium? You present today? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available She's going? You use my computer, you don't tell me, but she gets to go? Someone has to hold cue cards.
not_available Can somebody see this colicky baby? 
not_available I'll take that.
not_available No, no, I will.
not_available I wouldn't want you to be late.
not_available Call me if you need a second opinion.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Is Scott upstairs? In the bathroom.
not_available Jeanie! Jeanie, come look! I made a fort in my room! I want to check on your brother.
not_available He wants us to leave him alone.
not_available I know.
not_available Get your sticker book and I'll meet you there.
not_available Scott? Scottie.
not_available Forgot your Zofran.
not_available Where's your IV? 
not_available It's empty.
not_available I took it out.
not_available By yourself? I saw you do it a hundred times.
not_available You took off on me.
not_available Ask my dad.
not_available He'll pay your cab fare.
not_available Your dad paid me to help you through your chemo but we don't have to stop being friends.
not_available I have friends.
not_available I don't need any more.
not_available That sucks.
not_available Why? I need all the friends I can get.
not_available So how about Saturday? How about it? I can't go Friday, but I can Saturday.
not_available Unless you're too cool.
not_available You are pretty sorry.
not_available Speak for yourself, Captain Baldy.
not_available Next month my hair will grow back and you'll still be sorry.
not_available Just for that, I get to pick the movie.
not_available No way.
not_available No chick flicks.
not_available Oh, right, Mr.
not_available Days of Our Lives.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available She's quiet.
not_available I'll give you a fact sheet on colic.
not_available Let me stay until her next feeding so you can see how bad she gets.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll check her in a little while.
not_available Chuny, tell Mark I'm going over to the med school for a half an hour.
not_available Hey, who called the Grim Reaper? What are you doing down here? I heard his family came in.
not_available We're not ready to talk about organ donation.
not_available I just came down to do an apnea test, see how close he was.
not_available He's not brain
not_available dead.
not_available Neurosurgery said it's a matter of time.
not_available I don't care what they said.
not_available Dr.
not_available Del Amico? Yeah.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I haven't given up on him yet.
not_available What was that thing you said they could try? 
not_available A partial frontal lobectomy.
not_available No.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available There's nothing more we can do.
not_available Your resident said it was possible.
not_available He shouldn't have.
not_available It's worth a shot.
not_available He's a Teamster.
not_available He's got great insurance.
not_available That isn't it.
not_available It's just that surgery isn't warranted in this case.
not_available He might die if you don't.
not_available I'm afraid he will die, no matter what.
not_available I want a second opinion.
not_available You say one thing, she says another.
not_available I'm the chief neurosurgeon.
not_available You'll have to get it from another hospital.
not_available I want all of his records.
not_available Sure.
not_available I'm really very sorry.
not_available I wish I could help.
not_available Excuse me for a second.
not_available Pardon me, Dr.
not_available Mack.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available He's right.
not_available If the patient's gonna die, why not at least try? There's no indication for one.
not_available Isn't it worth the effort? We don't perform brain surgery for the heck of it.
not_available I understand that.
not_available But someone needs to take a risk and try to help him.
not_available Bellarmin dumped him.
not_available We wanna harvest his organs.
not_available He deserves a chance, no matter how remote.
not_available There is no chance.
not_available I appreciate that you wanna do something but know what you're talking about before you play on someone's hope.
not_available That kid's already lost his father.
not_available The heroin depressed his respiratory center, which led to cardiac arrest.
not_available We got his heart going again but everything indicates his brain was deprived of oxygen for a significant time.
not_available But you don't know for sure.
not_available No.
not_available His pupils are reactive.
not_available He withdraws from painful stimuli but his brainwave activity is slow and diffuse.
not_available Speak English, son.
not_available He has probable brain damage.
not_available What's "probable"? 
not_available Can't be quantified.
not_available It could run from memory impairment to a chronic vegetative state.
not_available Did you know about this? The drug use? 
not_available Yes, drug use! Oh, John.
not_available Did you think to do anything? 
not_available I helped him detox.
not_available Where? Here? No, his apartment.
not_available His apartment? What kind of medicine do you practice? There are centers that take care of this sort of thing.
not_available He didn't want it that way.
not_available It was not your decision, John.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available It was his.
not_available It should've been ours! He's on heroin, for God's sake! He had no ability to apply good judgment, but you should have.
not_available Called your family! We could have handled it! I'm sorry.
not_available I'll call Dr.
not_available Levy.
not_available We'll get him out of here.
not_available Only one child reached the lockout dose
not_available But for example, your sickle cell patient with the infarcted spleen you advocate letting them blunt their pain and mask symptoms? If you had a surgical belly, then there would still be other signs.
not_available But still, pain is an important diagnostic indicator.
not_available We're talking about kids.
not_available You'd say "suck it up"? 
not_available I guess I'm from the old school.
not_available I think that's probably true.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available It was all quite thought
not_available provoking.
not_available Excellent work.
not_available That's it, everybody
not_available Actually, Don, I had a question for Dr.
not_available Ross regarding the randomization of his control group.
not_available Sure, Kerry.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, a minute? You've been here for six months.
not_available Call me Mark.
not_available Mark, I know this sounds rather morbid but I haven't had as much trauma experience as I had hoped.
not_available I was wondering if you might be able to advise me on the times that a surgeon might sign up for ER coverage.
not_available I hope you don't mind nights and weekends.
not_available No.
not_available That's what I'd presumed, actually.
not_available The gunshot wounds and knife wounds taper off in the winter but spring's just around the corner.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, we need you in Trauma 1.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Lung cancer patient's coding.
not_available What happened? 
not_available I found him like this.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Let's get him on the gurney.
not_available Why was he out of bed? Where's this blood from? 
not_available He probably hit his head.
not_available Bag him.
not_available Asystole.
not_available A mg of atropine, an amp of epi.
not_available This looks like an exit wound.
not_available What? Here's the entrance.
not_available This is a gunshot wound.
not_available Somebody shot him? Where's the wife? 
not_available Call Security.
not_available Wait, wait.
not_available Dude capped himself.
not_available Why? End
not_available stage lung cancer.
not_available It's awful.
not_available Does suicide count as a DNR? Time of death, 17:05.
not_available I'll try and find his wife.
not_available Where's Gramps? You called him away from a union negotiation.
not_available He'll have a strike starting at midnight if he doesn't settle it.
not_available I'm heading uptown to this Kenner Neurology Institute.
not_available Chase needs to be stable before he can be moved.
not_available His blood pressure's supported by intravenous medications and he's having arrhythmia.
not_available I've spoken to the internist.
not_available I don't need you to explain.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available If I could go back and change this, I would.
not_available I assumed if he really needed help, he'd ask.
not_available He did.
not_available He asked me.
not_available Did he tell you what made him start? I don't know.
not_available Maybe he just felt overwhelmed.
not_available I've never understood that about your generation or your parents' for that matter.
not_available In our day, we embraced our responsibilities.
not_available They defined us.
not_available I don't blame you for this, John.
not_available But I know you blame us.
not_available No, I don't.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available All your lives you've been indulged and considered it oppression.
not_available You look after him tonight.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll be back in the morning.
not_available There are areas where my knowledge and my experience exceed yours.
not_available You should have consulted with me.
not_available You should have consulted me! What's going on? She was about to release a 2week
not_available old baby with sepsis.
not_available Her temp was slightly below normal.
not_available You made a mistake.
not_available Yeah, but that's not what this is about! It's not about you.
not_available It's about me.
not_available I'm the screw
not_available up.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available He has to redo his study after I found a flaw in his research.
not_available First, there was no flaw.
not_available Second, you ambushed me.
not_available I tried to talk to you and you blew me off.
not_available You left a sick kid here to undercut me in front of the Pediatrics staff.
not_available I cannot allow you to push the use of PCA when the research doesn't support it.
not_available You are the selfappointed authority? 
not_available If I have to be! You didn't help.
not_available You almost killed a kid.
not_available Screw you, Doug.
not_available Okay.
not_available Both of you calm down! Is the baby all right? 
not_available Fine.
not_available I gave her antibiotics.
not_available That's what's important.
not_available From now on, a pediatrician is consulted in all Pedes cases.
not_available I am capable of treating children.
not_available Apparently not.
not_available I know you're angry, but she's right.
not_available Emergency physicians are fully qualified to handleHey, hey, hey! Guys! What are you doing? Can you wait over there? What are you doing? 
not_available We have to transfer him to Evanston.
not_available Why? He's too much to handle.
not_available He can't control his rage.
not_available Didn't you see the burns on his arm? They may have been self
not_available inflicted.
not_available So you're committing him? He tried to kill his brother, and he has no signs of remorse.
not_available Did he show any to you? No, I Look, you might need to testify.
not_available I'll let you know.
not_available You okay? How'd it go today? Fun, fun, fun.
not_available Are we gonna do rounds? 
not_available Beats me.
not_available The organ donation coordinator is coming down to talk to you.
not_available Forget it.
not_available He's getting the operation.
not_available Listen, Alex when your father first came in I was frustrated, you know? I wanted to help.
not_available I pushed really hard to find anything that might save his life.
not_available Unfortunately, I was overly optimistic about his chances for survival.
not_available There is no operation.
not_available That was one doctor's opinion.
not_available I got a surgeon at Bellarmin to do the lobectomy.
not_available Bellarmin? All set.
not_available I've booked an OR.
not_available Who are you? David Zaccarria.
not_available Is this the ER intern? I'm the doctor who treated this patient after you dumped him.
not_available I didn't dump Mr.
not_available Dibble.
not_available No.
not_available You dumped a John Doe.
not_available Bellarmin paged you.
not_available Aneurysm, no insurance, no interest from you.
not_available We don't have time for this.
not_available I have to get him to the OR.
not_available Hey, he's still my patient.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available Does Dr.
not_available Mack know about this? 
not_available He has privileges.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Hello? Hello? Mark.
not_available Hi.
not_available Is this a bad time? What are you doing here? 
not_available I got your luggage.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Sure.
not_available Hold on.
not_available How did you find me? Can I come in? 
not_available Oh, sure.
not_available Of course.
not_available You can put them right there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I was wondering how I was gonna get those back.
not_available So how are you? I'm, you know, good.
not_available Same old stuff.
not_available What about your mom? Better some days.
not_available How about you? I'm okay.
not_available It's a nice place.
not_available I got a new job.
not_available Administrative assistant for a law firm.
not_available That's great.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was surprised when I came back and you weren't working at the ER.
not_available Well, I thought I needed to I needed a fresh start.
not_available I couldn't really do that with you there.
not_available Guess not.
not_available Mom? Oh, Jason, honey.
not_available What are you doing up? I'm thirsty.
not_available I'll get you some water, then you've got to go back to bed.
not_available This is my friend, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi, Jason.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Jump in there, sweetie.
not_available Sleep well.
not_available You got him back.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good for you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I didn't just come here to give you your luggage back.
not_available I made a big mistake.
not_available You don't need to apologize.
not_available No.
not_available No.
not_available I went after you.
not_available I was a big girl, and I knew what I was doing.
not_available No.
not_available I think I made a big mistake.
not_available I mean, we were great together.
not_available Mark, you don't love me.
not_available I deserve better.
not_available You do.
not_available I could
not_available No.
not_available You can't.
not_available I'll miss you.
not_available Me too.
not_available Goodbye, Mark.
not_available Hey, I'll do that.
