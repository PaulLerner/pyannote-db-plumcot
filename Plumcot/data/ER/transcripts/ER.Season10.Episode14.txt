not_available Then come back here and have the baby.
not_available I don't want you to get the wrong idea about Luka.
not_available He's a good guy.
not_available I'm not looking for anything right now.

not_available Seventyfouryearold
not_available Hold on.
not_available Past medical history? On the 14year
not_available old? Unremarkable.
not_available Was she drunk or high? Does the story match the injury? She sexually active? When was her last menstrual period? 
not_available She came in for a sprained ankle.
not_available Monoarticular joint pain in a young woman could be the result of gonococcal arthritis, staph 
not_available or a systemic polyarticular disease.
not_available Or she fell off a curb.
not_available You're a med student.
not_available I don't want to hear "history unremarkable." This ER visit may be the only time a 14year
not_available old sees a doctor.
not_available Get a sexual history, do some STD counseling.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Arnie Nadler, Human Resources.

not_available He's a mandated part of the Romano lawsuit settlement.
not_available Which one? 
not_available Hengstet.
not_available Who? 
not_available Nurse with the weird dog and that hat.
not_available Sexual harassment?

not_available We identify and assess highrisk employee behaviors and implement early
not_available intervention strategies before they escalate into psychological abuse or violence.
not_available Have you ever been in an ER before? You know, Dr.
not_available Romano's gone, and we all get along great.
not_available In my experience, all work environments could use help.
not_available Especially when navigating the twin dangers of anger and conflict.
not_available Morris.
not_available Morris, I'm gonna kill you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Here, have one.
not_available Don't put those there.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Idiot.
not_available John? What are you doing? I was gonna make you breakfast in bed.
not_available Did you lock Emily in the guesthouse? No.
not_available I gave her the day off.
not_available She's convinced we're gonna burn the house down.
not_available Oh, let's.
not_available Then we can run off to the jungle, live off sticks and berries.
not_available Is my cooking that bad? Oh, let me do it.
not_available They hassle you about going into work today? No.
not_available I think Luka has forced everybody to lower their expectations.
not_available If we show up without resigning, Weaver thinks it's a good day.
not_available We've got a whole day alone together.
not_available What are we gonna do? 
not_available I have a list.
not_available This is everything I wanted to show you in Chicago, but we haven't done yet.

not_available Yeah, that's one.
not_available And the Art Institute.
not_available Among others.
not_available So where should we start? I have an idea.
not_available Would you do a sexual history on a 14yearold girl with a twisted ankle? 
not_available Depends on the girl.
not_available Why? 
not_available Weaver.
not_available I'm used to the squawk, but she's condescending.
not_available Belly pain in 3 has been waiting for an hour.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, you're getting big.
not_available You mind? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want to try a dislocated shoulder? Yeah.
not_available Can I do the Hennepin maneuver? Are you marrying, or will that kid grow up a bastard? Shut up, Frank.
not_available But what is going on with you and Chuck? He's pushing to get married, buy a minivan fire up the barbecue.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available How often do you find yourself the subject of unwanted physical contact at work? What? Can you do a flyby on a swollen knee? This guy's demanding pain meds 
not_available wants to see a doctor right away.
not_available Sure.
not_available Is tactile contact between employees something that is encouraged or frowned upon? How many bimbos you got in this hospital? Just the right number.
not_available Miguel, this is Dr.
not_available Lockhart.
not_available Student doctor, actually.
not_available What does that mean? Means she's studying the latest medicine.
not_available That looks painful.
not_available How'd you do it? I fell off a ladder.
not_available I gotta get back to work.
not_available What kind of work you do? 
not_available Hang dry wall.
not_available It'll go away.
not_available Just give me some Vicodin, and I can get off your plate.
not_available We'll take good care of your knee and get you home.
not_available When did you fall? What do you have? 
not_available I'm not ready to present.
not_available Knee effusion from a fall? Drain it, pain meds and send him on his way.
not_available Told you.
not_available I'm not finished doing a history.
not_available We've got 30 on the board and 50 waiting.
not_available We're backed up 18 hours, and this is an easy case.
not_available Come on, next patient.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'll get a setup for you.
not_available Med students always spend an hour with patients.
not_available She was doing a great job.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, if you have a minute I'd like to talk to you later about that incident with Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available It wasn't an incident.
not_available It was a French fry.
not_available How does that feel? Is that too tight? 
not_available No, it's perfect.
not_available Oh, I love it.
not_available Seeing your whole face.
not_available Are you colder now? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, that is what scarves are for.

not_available Okay, I'm deciding between Cy Young Award winner and the guy who cures cancer.
not_available I think he'll be astoundingly cute.

not_available Oh, my God! This is incredible.
not_available Layla, do your parents know
not_available ? Dean's gonna go through the roof.
not_available You can't use that in here.
not_available You need to seriously consider whether or not you want to keep this pregnancy.
not_available Oh, Dean loves kids.
not_available What you want now may not be what you're gonna want in five years or next year, or even in six months.
not_available We need a SonoSite in here.

not_available Yeah.
not_available Wait here for her.
not_available I got it.
not_available I'm just the messenger.
not_available I don't trust him.
not_available He didn't understand.
not_available He stopped taking the pills when he stopped feeling sick.
not_available I want Miguel in isolation.
not_available If he can't take his meds I want him handcuffed and force
not_available fed.
not_available He just started coughing.
not_available You're gonna call the police? 
not_available The guy's a time bomb.
not_available Are we gonna throw all of our TB patients in jail? Just this one.
not_available If this is how we treat people with TB they will stop coming to this hospital.
not_available They don't all go out together.
not_available They hang out at the TB clinic.
not_available Miguel will need six months' therapy.
not_available You think you can do that? I want to try to make him cooperate with the health

not_available Maybe later.
not_available Waiting for Weaver?
