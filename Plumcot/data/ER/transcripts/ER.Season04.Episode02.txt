not_available Right.
not_available You're in early.
not_available Wanted to be in before my med student.
not_available Your very own scut puppy.
not_available Somebody to pick up my labs, do a patient history the occasional obligatory rectal exam.
not_available Someone to abuse.

not_available Kerry Weaver Katie Couric.
not_available Katie Couric, Kerry Weaver.
not_available So, David, how are you feeling? Morphine.
not_available Damn fine stuff.
not_available I talked to Dr.
not_available Weintraub.
not_available They're tapering your lidocaine.
not_available The echo showed very little damage to your myocardium.
not_available I put the nitropatch here.
not_available Just as effective.
not_available Most docs put it on the patient's chest.
not_available I say, why tear out those little hairs if you don't have to? I have some forms that Billing sent down for you to sign.
not_available The CPT codes for the attendings from last month.
not_available They're always sending me this junk.
not_available Forms, paperwork, duplicates little perforated lines.
not_available "Tear here.
not_available " They must not know about your heart attack.
not_available If you want to look them over
not_available I never look them over.
not_available Sign them for me and send them back.
not_available You want me to sign them? 
not_available Sign everything.
not_available Send everything back.
not_available You don't mind if I take over a little bit? 
not_available Praise Allah, no! I don't mind telling you sometimes I have felt like a sheriff with no posse.

not_available Like a lone shepherd high up on a hill no sheep dog.
not_available I completely understand how you feel.
not_available I'd like to take
not_available Everywhere you look there's sheep, sheep, sheep.
not_available Maybe it would be best if I stepped in and took over some administrative duties while you're recuperating.
not_available God bless you, Kerry Weaver.
not_available God bless you.
not_available Doug? Ketchup or Tabasco? With your scrambled eggs.
not_available You want what some call a vegetable or something more daring? 
not_available You thought I left.
not_available No.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available No, really.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Okay, yeah, I did.
not_available But you kind of did leave, technically.
not_available That doesn't count.
not_available If you'd gotten up a bit earlier, you would've seen me here, sound asleep.
not_available Well, some habits die hard.
not_available Yeah, like you sleeping in.
not_available Like you not being there in the morning.
not_available That's an old habit.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available I gotta talk to you about something.
not_available Not another serious conversation.
not_available You said we didn't communicate.
not_available Now you're communicating too much.
not_available It's important.
not_available Can I have a drawer? 
not_available What? A drawer.
not_available Something you keep your clothes in.
not_available Something that I would keep my clothes in.
not_available You never wanted a drawer before.
not_available Well that's because I always got up and left.
not_available But now that I'm staying here If I could maybe just have some place to keep a new shirt 
not_available Yeah.
not_available or a nice pair of socks.
not_available I'd settle for underwear.
not_available You know, you could always just wash your boxers out in the sink.
not_available They'd dry by the morning.
not_available Oh, my! So Morgenstern asked you to stop by? 
not_available I had forms for him to sign.
not_available Next thing you know he makes me Acting Chief of Emergency Services while he recuperates.
not_available He's been under a lot more stress than any of us realized.
not_available Can I give Mrs.
not_available Crane another 50 of Demerol? She's agitated.
not_available Yes, I know.
not_available And yes, you can.
not_available Convention? Tour bus.
not_available They're waiting for their driver.
not_available He ate bad eggs at Pulaski's and now he's puking up his guts in Exam Room 4.
not_available Maybe we should talk to Morgenstern's doctor.
not_available Who is it? Emma Weintraub.
not_available I already talked to her.
not_available No PVCs, but chest pain.
not_available They've scheduled angioplasty.
not_available So you'll be filling in? He asked me to fill in with some administrative duties.
not_available As long as you don't have a problem.

not_available Excellent.
not_available Morning.

not_available Thank you, Doug.
not_available Tour bus? 
not_available Bingo! I need to attend the executive committee meeting for JCAHO's next visit.
not_available And I wanted to know if you and Carol could interview the candidates for the new desk
not_available clerk position.
not_available Around noon.
not_available It'd be a pleasure.
not_available Great.
not_available Just clear your selection through me before you make a final one.
not_available Jerry, you going somewhere? 
not_available Not that I know of.
not_available Dr.
not_available Mark Greene? Yeah? 
not_available This is for you.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Who are you? There's a name of an attorney inside if you want to call for information.
not_available What is this? A subpoena? Oh, man.
not_available You're coming in to the clinic at 4, right? Al! Yeah, don't worry.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available As long as I can come up with another excuse to leave work early.
not_available I wish you could tell Rozwell the truth.
not_available That I have AIDS? 
not_available It'd take him five seconds to fire me.
not_available Okay.
not_available How about you have to pick your mother up from the airport? I've used that one.
not_available One of our kids is sick? All four have already had every childhood disease known to man.
not_available Your grandmother is sick, and you have to see how she's doing? Poor Grandma had a stroke.
not_available Went to her funeral last month.
not_available That's horrible.
not_available I know, but it worked.
not_available Got me the afternoon off.
not_available I'd better get going.
not_available Just make sure you get this afternoon off.
not_available Miss an appointment, you could lose your meds.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available "Yeah, yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available " Okay? Don't worry.
not_available He's ready to come off the vent.
not_available You want to extubate him today? 
not_available It's been three weeks.
not_available I think he's ready.
not_available What about a trial of CPAP? He's almost at room air.
not_available Setting at 99.
not_available He says that's good.
not_available I know it's good, Carla, but he could end up back on a ventilator.
not_available That's very unlikely.
not_available I'll extubate him this afternoon.
not_available What's wrong with you, Peter? Why are you so against good news? 
not_available Carla, I just want to be sure.
not_available You don't want to give him a name, fix the birth certificate It's gonna be Baby Boy Reece forever? 
not_available We weren't even sure he'd make it.
not_available But now we are.
not_available The next ultrasound could show bleeding.
not_available And the sky could be falling too, Peter.
not_available We need to get on with his life.
not_available First thing I'm doing is taking down those bunks.
not_available Don't you even think about arguing with me.
not_available He's too smart for that, aren't you, Skylar? It was my husband's idea.
not_available He had bunks when he was a boy.
not_available Seven brothers.
not_available We had bunks all over.
not_available You never fell out? 
not_available No.
not_available I was pushed a number of times.
not_available Anna, you got a minute? The nurse will be in with your Ortho referral, Mrs.
not_available McClay.
not_available And, Skylar, take the bottom bunk for a while, okay? Thank you.
not_available Today's charts
not_available With patients, I'd appreciate if you called me Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available I didn't? 
not_available Nope, you called me Anna.
not_available I didn't mean anything.
not_available I've probably called Mark Greene "Mark"
not_available That would be wrong too.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What about the charts? You've worked mostly Pedes since you started? Hang on.
not_available Did you disagree with my handling of any of those cases? You want to talk someplace else? No.
not_available It's easier to go with what we know.
not_available Right.
not_available You've done a Pedes residency but are here on an Emergency residency.
not_available I think you'd benefit by working with adults.
not_available I appreciate your concern but I think I can balance my own caseload.
not_available Well, I don't know
not_available Anna, the scut puppies have landed.
not_available You're not supervising my residency.
not_available Pediatrics, I am.
not_available Okay.
not_available Adults you run by Dr.
not_available Doyle first, then myself or Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Okay? You too, Carter.
not_available What? Run my cases by Maggie? 
not_available That's right.
not_available I've done quite a few more ER procedures than she has.
not_available And you are what year? Technically, an intern, first year.
not_available And she's second year.
not_available But I spent half my internship teaching her.
not_available No, you didn't.
not_available I taught you one
not_available handed knots.
not_available Big deal! 
not_available Look, that's enough.
not_available Is everybody clear about who runs what by whom? Yeah? Where are the students? 
not_available Cafeteria.
not_available Doug? Anna was gonna take these barfing twins in 5.
not_available Peter, you've met Elizabeth Corday? 
not_available Yes.

not_available Would you assist her today? Show her the ropes.
not_available I don't know my surgical schedule.
not_available Just in Trauma.
not_available Penetrating trauma, gunshot wounds.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available No problem.
not_available I was to tag along with Mr.
not_available Campbell, but he's got a kidney stone.
not_available And seeing as Dr.
not_available Carter isn't taking up your time
not_available No, no problem.
not_available This is the ER right now, so Oh, lovely.
not_available Good.
not_available Which one do you want? I don't want either.
not_available I had plenty of students back at CHOP.

not_available You'll be with me.
not_available Looking forward to finally doing my ER rotation.
not_available My dad's a trauma surgeon.
not_available I know there's a lot of scut work, but I'm glad to finally be seeing patients.
not_available John, I should mention that I'm not all that interested in working with patients.
not_available Excuse me? I'm getting my MD/Ph.
not_available D.
not_available I finished med school.
not_available I've been doing bench research for the past four years.
not_available Patients just aren't all that helpful to my research.
not_available You haven't had any medical training in four years? You remember anything? About the pathophysiology of disease? How to do a physical exam? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available I've been doing brain research.
not_available Studying genetic markers for Angelman's Syndrome.
not_available You may know it as "happy puppet's disease.
not_available " It causes the afflicted to laugh inappropriately and to flap their hands like a puppet on a string.
not_available Get Xray in here! Please, it hurts! Caught a good one, didn't you, Ernesto? 
not_available Oh, man! This is Elizabeth Corday, new surgical resident.

not_available No sign of tension pneumo or cardiac tamponade.
not_available Next, auscultation of the heart and lungs while palpating the carotid pulse.
not_available Do you know what sort of bullet hit you? 
not_available Who is this? Palpable carotid indicates a systolic BP of 60.
not_available No muffled heart sounds.
not_available Diminished breath sounds.
not_available He needs a chest tube.
not_available 9 mm.
not_available I beg your pardon? 
not_available Possibly shot with a 9 mm.
not_available One of the semiautomatics? Right.
not_available Entry wound is typical, but the exit is bigger.
not_available The bullet yaws through 90 degrees.
not_available Cavity's larger than a.
not_available 38 special.
not_available Is that temporary cavitation? Oh, God, no! You need an AK
not_available 47 for that.
not_available Only 1200 feet per second.
not_available Listen, when we get in there, just stand back.
not_available Observe.
not_available Don't do anything.

not_available This is my student, George Henry.
not_available What have we got? I can see we just put in a chest tube.
not_available Probably a hemopneumothorax.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available Just wanted to help out.
not_available Less than 500 cc's of blood.
not_available Means they won't have to do an exploratory 
not_available Move.
not_available thoracotomy.
not_available Don't need you.
not_available Didn't page you.
not_available If there's something you do need
not_available No, there isn't.
not_available Look around.
not_available There are four doctors here.
not_available Yeah, I realize that
not_available I think we got it.
not_available Check with Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Henry, I think Dr.

not_available Right.
not_available And Carter, she's febrile.
not_available So a gram of Tylenol rectally.
not_available Rec
not_available Rectally? You heard him.
not_available Glove up and dig in.
not_available Why is it so hot in here? 
not_available Because it's so hot outside.
not_available Isn't the air conditioning working? Think you're hot? Those new candidates are sweating like piggies.
not_available Only two left? 
not_available Not counting the one they're with now.
not_available How were the others? 
not_available Not a big hit.
not_available Yeah, well, I didn't put my money on you when you were interviewing.
not_available You bet on us? 
not_available Sure.
not_available But you didn't bet on me? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Styman, you've worked at several other Chicago
not_available area hospitals.
not_available Nine other hospitals.
not_available If that's what it says.
not_available Why'd you move around so much? Just curious.
not_available Did you ask them why? 
not_available No, we just received your résumé now.
not_available Precision.
not_available That's why.
not_available Their extraordinary lack of precision.
not_available Precision? For example, this interview was scheduled for 
12 15.
not_available I arrived promptly at 
12 10.
not_available However, the interview didn't actually start until 12:26.
not_available Eleven minutes late.
not_available Very imprecise.
not_available Well, we've been a little backed up.
not_available I thought so.
not_available Next question.
not_available Estelle Webb, 79.

not_available I didn't fall down.
not_available Please, help me.

not_available And he's getting on in years.

not_available Really? You might wanna pay more attention here than you did in the trauma room.
not_available I'll certainly bear that in mind, Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Sam Breedlove.
not_available Elizabeth Corday.
not_available How do you do? Come again? 
not_available I said, Elizabeth Corday! I knew he was old, but not that he was short.

not_available but I didn't know you were so short.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available Always have been.

not_available What? I drew blood of the guy in 4.

not_available Everyone's always said that about me.
not_available When I was the cashier at the Ford dealership, service and parts I used to talk to all the customers while I was processing their bills.

not_available Okay.
not_available I have other skills.
not_available Telemarketing? 
not_available I sold vitamins over the phone.
not_available That's kind of in the health field, isn't it? No, I guess it's not really, is it? They didn't even like me there.
not_available Well, I got fired because I wouldn't sell the combo Vitapack to the old people that we were supposed to call.

not_available We can't save them all.
not_available Okay? Give her some Jell

not_available Where's your student? 
not_available He keeps disappearing.
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available He said he was incapable, but
not_available I'd take him at his word.
not_available Has the social worker called back on Mrs.
not_available Webb? 
not_available The woman pushed down the stairs.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Henry! My throat's a little scratchy.
not_available This is Mrs.
not_available Webb's history? 
not_available I wrote everything.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available There's 20 complaints.
not_available "Back pain, earache, bumpiness in her head.
not_available " 
not_available I don't know what that means.
not_available Neither did I.
not_available You can hear multiple complaints but not chart them.
not_available Now that you wrote them, we have to check them.
not_available One moment, Mrs.
not_available Webb.
not_available Good 
rule If there's more than 
not_available But I wrote them all down.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available She'll be stuck here the whole night having tests she doesn't need.
not_available I don't have to stay all night, do I? 
not_available I like him.
not_available Very thorough.
not_available Yes, he is very thorough.
not_available The social worker will be here soon.
not_available I can't go back to my sister! No, they'll try hard to find a new place for you to stay.
not_available You want to smother me with that pillow, don't you? She tried that once before too.
not_available Oh, Mrs.
not_available Webb.
not_available How are you doing? I'm okay.
not_available Your labs came back.
not_available You're dehydrated.
not_available Have you had the flu or been vomiting? Is there something else going on that you haven't mentioned to us? I'm just gonna take one more quick look.
not_available Can you open up for me? Laura, has your dentist mentioned the enamel on your teeth? I hate the dentist.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available He's not bipolar or schizophrenic, but I can't figure him out.
not_available Sure never seen this in a kid.
not_available I thought you could take a look.
not_available Sure.
not_available He thinks I'm Sidney Poitier in Lilies of the Field.
not_available See? See? If you're wearing a white coat, then you must be the butcher.
not_available That's not right, not if you' re the pharmacist.
not_available Am I here to pick something up? 
not_available They found him wandering the streets.
not_available BA and tox screen? 
not_available Negative.
not_available He's confabulating.
not_available Complete short
not_available term memory loss.
not_available He has no idea who I am every time I walk in the room.
not_available The cook! I hope they have lima beans.
not_available Oliver, I'm Dr.
not_available Del Amico.
not_available Remember? And this is Dr.
not_available Carter and Mr.
not_available Henry.
not_available You're here in the hospital.
not_available I'm in a hospital? Okay, if you say so.
not_available Like Jimmy Stewart was in Harvey.
not_available You feeling okay? 
not_available Sure, I feel fine.
not_available We'll be back in a little bit, okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Lima bean.
not_available I think you're right about the psych consult.
not_available But I'd call one down anyway.
not_available I thought I'd wait on the CT.
not_available See if it reveals anything.
not_available It will.
not_available Probably a small lesion in the mammillary bodies and dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, the mammillothalamic tract.
not_available Associated with Korsakoff's Syndrome which causes retroand anterograde amnesia, thus, short
not_available term memory loss.
not_available And the confabulation.
not_available Could have gone a lifetime without a translator.
not_available Can I put in for extra pay? 
not_available Yeah, just run it by Kerry Weaver.
not_available Mr.
not_available and Mrs.
not_available Trujillo Jesus' x
not_available rays didn't show anything specific.
not_available Probably has bronchitis.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? 
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available We're giving him some antibiotics, and we'll check up on him for a while.
not_available This is Thomas Anders.
not_available Department of Social Services.
not_available Where is he taking me? 
not_available We'll talk on your way to Radiology.
not_available Back to Xray? 
not_available Ultrasound, this time.
not_available Wait, my glasses.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Thank you.
not_available And we've been trying to track down your sister.
not_available Oh, no! Please! 
not_available It'll be okay, Mrs.
not_available Webb.
not_available Jeanie, those slippers you gave me.
not_available I don't see them.
not_available Maybe they're under the bed.
not_available Don't let them send me back there.
not_available Okay.
not_available Please don't let them.
not_available I know.
not_available They can't do it.
not_available I can't go.
not_available Let's get these slippers on.
not_available There we go.
not_available One more.
not_available Jeanie, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Carol Hathaway filled me in on the interviews.
not_available Crackpots.
not_available But we'll break one in.
not_available She felt you should see more.
not_available I don't.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Long as you're confident.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Where are you taking her? 
not_available MRl.
not_available She's a drunk.
not_available Just to be sure.
not_available I did an LP.
not_available And I think I need an MRl.
not_available I ran everything by Dr.
not_available Doyle.
not_available She agreed.
not_available Let your student handle the transport.
not_available Henry's collecting stool samples on three abdominal pains.
not_available Can you page Henry again? 
not_available I already did, twice.
not_available Again.
not_available Here you go.
not_available Mark.
not_available I just checked in on Laura Quentin.
not_available Yeah, I saw her labs.
not_available Urine specific gravity's low.
not_available Mildly hypokalemic.
not_available Probably got the flu.
not_available Actually, she's bulimic.
not_available I checked her teeth.
not_available The enamel's eroded, consistent with the vomiting.
not_available No period in six months.
not_available Took a lot, but she finally admitted to it.
not_available Let's rehydrate her.
not_available Two liters of normal saline.
not_available Turf her to Psych.
not_available She doesn't want to go.
not_available Doesn't want her parents to know.
not_available I called the eating
not_available disorders clinic.
not_available There's no availability for seven weeks.
not_available Nothing we can do.
not_available Thought you could talk to her.
not_available Won't do much good.
not_available Can't hurt to try.
not_available Look, I got a lot of patients, Carol.
not_available Come on, Mark.
not_available She might listen to you.
not_available We're an ER.
not_available We don't manage chronic problems.
not_available Her condition is chronic.
not_available And if you have concerns about other desk
not_available clerk candidates run them by me first before you go to Kerry Weaver.
not_available Henry was right.
not_available There it is.
not_available That's the lesion? 
not_available It's large.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're about to get your first taste of giving the bad news.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Well, you see, I don't need a haircut.
not_available You're not the barber, are you? Oliver, I'm Dr.
not_available Del Amico, and you're in a hospital.
not_available Well, whatever you say is fine.
not_available But I feel just great, see? 
not_available Just like Jimmy Stewart was in Harvey.
not_available Oliver.
not_available I need you to listen to me for a minute.
not_available We took a picture of your brain.
not_available You have a tumor on the right side.
not_available You look like Carole Lombard.
not_available She had a brain tumor.
not_available Oliver, it's very serious.
not_available Serious? Are you saying I'm gonna die? The people upstairs in Surgery will do all they can.
not_available But we can't be sure.
not_available I'm gonna die? I'm gonna die.
not_available Oh, God! Oh, God.
not_available What are you doing up here? You're supposed to be on your ER rotation.
not_available If I don't load the sequencing gel now, it could ruin the whole experiment.
not_available Doesn't your ER rotation mean anything? Beyond its being a requirement? What's all this stuff? This is a plasma control with 10 micrograms of salmon
not_available sperm carrier.
not_available Would you like to see my linkage map? Wait! Don't touch this! This is ethidium bromide.
not_available It can slip between your DNA, cause a mutation.
not_available No! Don't touch the Eppendorf.
not_available Did you feed him yet? I got stuck in the O.R.
not_available Tabash says I can't try until this evening.
not_available Good.
not_available I thought I was gonna miss the first time.
not_available Listen, I'm on tonight.
not_available But page me, and I'll come straight up.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available He's doing great.
not_available But they're asking for a name.
not_available We gotta do this birth certificate.
not_available I guess we have put it off.
not_available We? No.
not_available I had no idea you could be so superstitious.
not_available Well, neither did I.
not_available So, what'll we do? Are we gonna flip a coin? Reece or Benton? Carla we talked about it and said it'd be Benton.
not_available It's easier for the insurance.
not_available We talked about it, but we definitely did not agree on it.
not_available That insurance reason is an excuse.
not_available You just want your boy to have your last name.
not_available What's wrong with that? 
not_available What's wrong with having my name? I'm the one getting up at night to feed him change him, rock him back to sleep.
not_available Carla, I can do that too.
not_available So you're just gonna move into my apartment now? We haven't talked about it
not_available No, because you acted like this day was never gonna come.
not_available He needs a family.
not_available Is that what you think we are? 
not_available We don't have to formalize things.
not_available If there wasn't a baby in the picture would you see the two of us as a family? It's okay, Peter.
not_available I don't either.
not_available GSW to the left upper chest two IVs of saline in the field, BP 100/60, pulse 110.
not_available O2, 15 liters by mask.
not_available Hey! Look out! Who is that guy? 
not_available Checking for radioactivity.
not_available God, I love this job.
not_available Okay, let's go! One, two, three.
not_available Get her clothes off.
not_available What've we got? 
not_available Gunshot wound.
not_available Two in one day? 
not_available Honey, you haven't been here long.
not_available I can run it.
not_available Why don't I have a go at it.
not_available Right.
not_available The usual investigations.
not_available FBC, type and crossmatch four units, and portable radiograph of the chest.
not_available FBC? 
not_available Full blood count.
not_available Run a liter of saline and a gram of cephalexin.
not_available Trachea's midline, no jugular distention.
not_available Strong radial pulse, subclavian's intact.
not_available Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
not_available BP's 95 palp.
not_available Diminished breath.
not_available She'll need a tube thoracostomy.
not_available A what? 
not_available Chest tube.
not_available Could you intubate, please? Number 8 ET tube and suction.
not_available I wonder if everyone might slow down just a bit.
not_available I think things will run more smoothly with a little more peace and quiet.
not_available Anyone bleeped Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available He'll like that.
not_available "Bleeping" Benton.
not_available Perhaps somebody could ring him up? 
not_available Page, right? That's page Benton? I got it.
not_available One percent lidocaine.
not_available All right, I'll get it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Let's bag her.
not_available We're out.
not_available I'll get some from Supply.
not_available Connie, get the lidocaine.
not_available Anna, we need your help.
not_available What is it? What happened? He stopped breathing.
not_available Pedes laryngoscope and a number 6 ET tube.
not_available Get ready to bag him.
not_available What happened? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday just stabilized your patient.
not_available GSW to the left upper chest.
not_available Came in with a pressure of 100/60.
not_available Received two liters of crystalloid.
not_available Spun hematocrit is 34.
not_available Gave a gram of cephalexin.
not_available Placed a left thoracostomy tube with 300 cc's of blood.
not_available Missed the great vessels.
not_available Lucky girl.
not_available I guess you were paying attention.
not_available Always.
not_available Her sister died in 1984.
not_available That's right.
not_available So obviously her sister did not push her.
not_available Not recently.
not_available I'll kill her.
not_available Can't.
not_available She's borderline.
not_available You can never get rid of borderlines.
not_available Randi, call Psych for me.
not_available I need a consult.
not_available They won't admit until Medicine's completed her evaluation.
not_available I'm still waiting on eight tests.
not_available You know what I've done for her today? 
not_available She says you tried to suffocate her.
not_available She what? Gratitude.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Carter? He keeps paging me.
not_available Come with me.
not_available You're about to do some babysitting.
not_available Come on.
not_available Hi, Mrs.
not_available Webb.
not_available You remember Henry.
not_available I asked if he'd had his shots.
not_available They didn't know you meant vaccines.
not_available They thought you meant any shots.
not_available I didn't think of whooping cough.
not_available It presents like bronchitis.
not_available Thanks for stepping in.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Malik, he was supposed to be up in Neurology an hour ago.
not_available We're on our way up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver needed some labs stat.
not_available Get him up there now, please.
not_available Hi, there! You're the ice
not_available cream person, aren't you? You don't want to spill on that coat.
not_available No, you're the pharmacist.
not_available I have my toothpaste.
not_available Do you remember you're in the hospital? 
not_available Hospital? Is something wrong with me? Dr.
not_available Greene, I need you to sign a chart for me.
not_available It's for that woman with slurred speech.
not_available Did she finally dry out? Not exactly.
not_available LP showed pleocytosis and elevated gamma globulins.
not_available MRl confirms she has multiple sclerosis.
not_available You order a Neurology consult? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available I am now officially having a bad day.
not_available What? The one non
not_available puking kid I had almost died of whooping cough.
not_available I'm ready for a drink.
not_available You want to join me? I can't.
not_available What's your bad day? Remember Chris Law? His brother died.
not_available The basketball player, right? Well, that's what the process server was about this morning.
not_available He and his family are slapping me with a malpractice suit.
not_available It's a great world, huh? First he beats me up, and then he sues me.
not_available Law didn't beat you up, did he? Police said he had an airtight alibi.
not_available That's what the police said.
not_available But you don't believe them? I don't know.
not_available So, what happened with your amnesia patient? Kept forgetting he was dying.
not_available I had to tell him five different times.
not_available And after all that, they give us this humiliation.
not_available Wow, a paycheck! Alleged paycheck.
not_available The rich kids at CHOP would blow it on poker the first night.
not_available Didn't think I'd care.
not_available About getting a paycheck? No, I meant I didn't think money would make that much of a difference.
not_available Well, it won't after I pay my landlord the med
not_available school bills, my phone bill, the gas bill.
not_available Should leave me about 4 bucks.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available See you.
not_available See you.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available John.
not_available I know I said I didn't need to be paid, but it sure feels good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd hoped to catch you before you got it.
not_available I need you to endorse your check back over to County.
not_available What? 
not_available To cover disability and malpractice.
not_available They issue one weekly, and you sign it back to us.
not_available Endorse it back over to County.
not_available Right.
not_available Every week? 
not_available That's what we agreed.
not_available You didn't need to be paid? Right.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Pen.
not_available Been up to any of the labs recently? Why? 
not_available Give me your shoes.
not_available What? I said, give me your shoes.
not_available They're radioactive.
not_available You know how much they cost? Radioactive? 
not_available Give him your shoes.
not_available I won't.
not_available Yes, you will.
not_available Hey.
not_available He's really doing it, huh? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available This boy is really doing it.
not_available Only lasts a couple of minutes, though.
not_available Then he gets really tired.
not_available Listen I thought about what we talked about and I don't have any more claim on his name than you do.
not_available I'd be happy with "Reece.
not_available " I would.
not_available Well, I thought about it too, Peter.
not_available And I'd be okay with Benton.
not_available So why don't we name him Reece Benton? Reece Benton.
not_available Sounds a little formal but we'll get used to it.
not_available Reece Benton.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, we will.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Sorry to bother you.
not_available Do you remember me? IYou're 
not_available Cynthia Hooper.
not_available You've been hanging out here all day? No.
not_available Well, I sat over at the diner.
not_available Look, I know I'm out of contention for the job.
not_available I just wanted to apologize for my interview.
not_available I just get so nervous, and I never say the right thing.
not_available Happens to all of us.
not_available At least I didn't throw up, which I actually have done in an interview.
not_available That probably hurt the interview.
not_available Is this your first time in Chicago? Yeah.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I've only been here for six days.
not_available But I'm starting to figure it out.
not_available The lake is 
not_available that way.
not_available That way.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm glad you stopped by because I didn't make any phone calls yet.
not_available And so I can just tell you that you got the job.
not_available What? You're kidding, right? 
not_available No, it's yours if you want it.
not_available Of course I want it.
not_available Are you sure you're not kidding? 
not_available Start next week.
not_available Oh, my God! I don't know what to say.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Are they closed? 
not_available Closed.
not_available Keep them closed.
not_available I said, they're closed.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Open them.
not_available All right.
not_available That was very delicate, Doug.
not_available What the? Oh, that's a drawer.
not_available You know what? 
not_available I love this drawer.
not_available Good.
not_available Come here, you.
not_available Come here.
not_available You know what, I love sitting out here on the porch with you.
not_available It's
not_available Something new.
not_available Something new.
not_available Nice drawer.
not_available It's a good touch, don't you think?
