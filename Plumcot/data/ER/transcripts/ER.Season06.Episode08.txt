not_available Yeah.
not_available How far along are you? Oh, 38 weeks.
not_available Was the amniotic fluid clear?

not_available Induces vomiting and low blood glucose.
not_available Known as JVS.
not_available JVS.
not_available Jamaican Vomiting Sickness.
not_available But the Akee also grows in southern Florida.
not_available You're kidding.
not_available Start an infusion.
not_available There's a high fatality rate.
not_available If you don't believe me, check the differential.
not_available Might be a doctor after all.

not_available That stops the train.
not_available She needs help.
not_available We only have to go one stop.
not_available Let's be safe.
not_available Don't pull it! 
not_available It says "Pull in case of emergency.
not_available " 
not_available This isn't that kind! "Police, fire, medical emergency.
not_available " Don't pull the damn cord! Oh, God! Can she cook? 
not_available What a question.
not_available She can't.
not_available I don't know.
not_available We eat out.
not_available My experience with English 
food it's bland.
not_available Would you rather I cook?

not_available We need time to gorge ourselves so we can pass out.
not_available It says 180.
not_available You didn't have to do all this.
not_available Those two can be a bit much.
not_available All families are eccentric.
not_available I guess.

not_available But we're okay over 80.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, good.

not_available It's okay.
not_available Looks like about six pounds.
not_available She's so little.
not_available So little.
not_available But that's a good size for a twin.
not_available I have to take her.
not_available Take a good look.
not_available She's healthy? 
not_available She's beautiful.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available There we go.
not_available Have you picked a name yet? Tess.
not_available I think I'm gonna name her Tess.
not_available Welcome to the world, Tess.
not_available There we go.
not_available You did great.
not_available Carol Hathaway? I'm Abby.

not_available What if she gets hungry? 
not_available We can supplement.
not_available Sure?

not_available Thanks.
not_available Threefiveonesix
not_available four.
not_available Threefiveonesix
not_available four.
not_available All set.
not_available Say bye
not_available bye, Mommy.
not_available Bye, honey, bye.
not_available Thanks, Kerry.
not_available Are the contractions still strong? They're spaced out.
not_available But yeah.
not_available We'll do an ultrasound.
not_available But it could take a while.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available McLucas on her way? Yes.
not_available Do you want an epidural? I can still have one? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available If I wasn't sure before, I am now.
not_available Wimp.
not_available Mark.
not_available Heard I missed the party.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'll call the anesthesiologist.
not_available A girl? 
not_available A girl.
not_available Troublemaker already? You're hanging in there? 
not_available It's brutal.
not_available One down, one to go.
not_available I quit.
not_available You don't have a choice.
not_available Well, you could shoot me.
not_available Yeah, if it comes to that.
not_available Sorry to pull you away from your Thanksgiving.
not_available I'd rather be here.
not_available D
not_available Day.
not_available Five beaches.
not_available The Americans take Utah Here.
not_available The potatoes.
not_available And Omaha, the squash.
not_available Now, the Brits land here and share Juno 
not_available the stuffing, with the Canucks.
not_available Canucks? 
not_available The Canadians.
not_available Right.
not_available Are you with me? 
not_available Yes, I'm with you.
not_available The German resistance is concentrated on the American lines.
not_available Massive casualties are suffered by the Americans that day, 6000.
not_available The Brits had their share.
not_available The gravy goes with the potatoes.
not_available Fine.
not_available Instead of cutting off the Germans at Caen, Montgomery the British general
not_available I know.
not_available He sat on his ass and had tea.
not_available I'm going to the bathroom.
not_available The British fought the Germans before the Americans.
not_available Perhaps they were more cautious.
not_available Cautious is one word for it.
not_available I guess "tea
not_available loving" is another.
not_available That's two words.
not_available It's a hyphenate, actually.
not_available Anyway, the 82nd Airborne DivisionDo you have to use a cath? 
not_available You won't control your urine.
not_available Great.
not_available Sorry, no catheter, no epidural.
not_available Seems like a small price to pay.
not_available It's not your bladder.
not_available Are we doing this? Carol? 
not_available Yes.
not_available All right.
not_available All set.
not_available Carol, you have to sit up.
not_available Can't we do it on my side? 
not_available It's better upright.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available Why? 
not_available To get a clear shot.
not_available You don't want him fishing around.
not_available Up you go.
not_available Get it right the first time.
not_available I generally do if the patient cooperates.
not_available Mark? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Grab her other shoulder.
not_available Okay, lean into us.
not_available A little bit more.
not_available Keep your back round.
not_available And you'll feel a little prick.
not_available Carol Hathaway? Carol, it's you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn.
not_available I had no idea.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available No, he's my Lamaze coach.
not_available How're we doing? 
not_available Six centimeters.
not_available Six? 
not_available You shrink between deliveries.
not_available I know.
not_available But six? Need more local? 
not_available No, contraction.
not_available Just hold on.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Dr.
not_available McLucas is in Wichita.
not_available She asked me to cover.
not_available Is that all right? I gotta lie down.
not_available He's in the middle of it.
not_available Hold still.
not_available No, I can't! 
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Hold my hand, okay? You're gonna feel much better.
not_available It hurts, Mark.
not_available I know.
not_available No, I mean, it really hurts.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available Hang in there.
not_available One night Stu and I were on deck.
not_available He asked me for a light.
not_available And when I looked up, he was gone.
not_available What do you mean, gone? 
not_available Gone.
not_available He'd fallen overboard.
not_available My God! Did he drown? If the fall didn't kill him.
not_available That's terrible.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Worse than the working conditions was the food.
not_available Probably took more men than anything.
not_available You mean worse than the English? I was kidding.
not_available I haven't had a meal like this since Well, for a while.
