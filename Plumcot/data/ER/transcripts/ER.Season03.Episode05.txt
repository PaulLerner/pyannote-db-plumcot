not_available Not you too! 
not_available It's true.
not_available He's up there.
not_available Still pining for the woman he loved.
not_available I thought he broke her heart.
not_available He broke his own heart.
not_available How do you know this? Because that's the story.
not_available It was Halloween night, the 1930s, up on the fifth floor.
not_available There was rain and thunder and lightning.
not_available He was a doctor, she was an intern.
not_available She loved him, didn't she? But a wealthy, handsome patient had asked her to marry him.
not_available What did she say? 
not_available She didn't know what to say.
not_available So she told the doctor.
not_available What did he say? 
not_available He said nothing.
not_available I thought he loved her.
not_available He did love her, but he couldn't get the words out.
not_available She walked across the room, turned back and looked at him.
not_available She put her hand to her lips and blew what would be their only kiss.
not_available They say it blew through him like a rush of cold wind.
not_available That is so sad.
not_available What happened? Unfortunately, the doc fell out of the fifth

not_available Call me when she wakes up.
not_available I need to tell her about her father.
not_available Dr.
not_available Keaton, I think I need to tell her about her father.
not_available It's none of your business.
not_available I'm just curious, if you're thinking about medical school.
not_available You're done.
not_available It's just a physics class, which I doubt I'll make it through much less go to medical school.
not_available Doc, we've got a guy staggering out here.

not_available Time of 
death 8:53.
not_available Would you like to stay with her? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available What I did I don't know if it was right or wrong.
not_available She was in a lot of pain.
not_available But her whole marriage it was never about giving up on life.
not_available This is not who we were.
not_available You stayed with her.
not_available You helped her when she needed you.
not_available I think that's who you were.
not_available Got an ET tube.
not_available Can't find a laryngoscope.

not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available If you can, pull the drains on the pyloroplasty.
not_available Why are you riding me? 
not_available You're an intern.
not_available I bust my ass, and you give me a mediocre evaluation.
not_available Most interns do mediocre work.
not_available I don't.
not_available You could do better.
not_available So can Carter, so can everyone.
not_available You have to do better.
not_available I have to do better? Is that because I'm black? Is that your message? Let me ask you something.
not_available When you applied to med school, did you check the box "African American"? I worked just as hard as everyone else.
not_available People think that you checked the box to get preferential treatment.
not_available They assume you're here to fill a quota.
not_available To prove them wrong, you have to work twice as hard to be twice as good.
not_available Think I need you to tell me that? We understand each other, so we don't have a problem, do we? Did you check the box? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe you should tell people, so you don't have to prove it all the time.
not_available Hi there.
not_available You stayed.
not_available You did really well.
not_available You're going to be fine.
not_available I wanted to talk to you.
not_available I have something I need to tell you.
not_available About my dad? Yes.
not_available He died, didn't he? Is that it? Yes.
not_available What've we got? 
not_available Knife wound in the abdomen.
not_available Needs lap.
not_available Let's get him to the O.R.
not_available How is it? I'm going next week.
not_available No big deal.
not_available Real smooth.
not_available Bring cookies.
not_available That's it.
not_available Have a good night, Gus! I'm not gonna say anything about that physics book.
not_available It was probably a stupid idea.
not_available Lf it's what you want to do 
not_available lf I can make it, anybody can.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Going to the Halloween party? 
not_available No, can't make it.
not_available I hear Haleh's really good.
not_available She is.
not_available I heard her last Christmas.
not_available That case with Mr.
not_available Jennings today When I saw him watching her and holding her hand I kind of saw what their whole life had been.
not_available It made me wish that we could save her so that we could save him.
not_available What do you mean? He's alone.
not_available Left with all the pain.
not_available She fell asleep in her husband's arms.
not_available I'll see you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, I'm going to remind you one more time.
not_available I'm on my way.
not_available I'll take Susan with me for protection.
not_available Protection from what? 
not_available The ghost on the fifth floor.
not_available Why do we have to go up there? A guy corked off.
not_available I have to pronounce him.
not_available Are you scared? Of course not.
not_available Mark? Susan? 
not_available Good, you're still there.
not_available Where would I go? Hey, slow down! All right, that's it! Come on, we're going back.
not_available It's past your bedtimes.
not_available Please, can we go to one more floor? Yeah, one more floor! 
not_available Be a sport, Peter.
not_available Yeah, be a sport.
not_available Nurse "B
not_available jerk" would let us.
not_available Bjerke.
not_available Yes, I would.
not_available All right.
not_available Look, we'll go the ER, but that's it.
not_available Mister! What? 
not_available I have to pee, bad.
not_available Oh, man! The rest of you just hold hands until I get back.
not_available Don't move.
not_available What do you think we are? Babies? 
not_available Just don't move.
not_available Come on.
not_available Do we have to do this now? 
not_available We could wait until daylight.
not_available He'll only have been dead about 10 hours.
not_available Oh, my 
not_available Next bed, doctor.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You're not scared, huh? Did you feel that? What? 
not_available You're going to think I'm crazy.
not_available Feel what? I swear it was just like a rush of wind went through me.
not_available You are crazy.
not_available Oh, boy! 
not_available Did you feel it? No, I didn't feel anything.
not_available Oh, boy! You felt it, didn't you? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? Did you tell her? 
not_available She knew.
not_available She said that her father had kissed her goodbye during surgery.
not_available Kids know.
not_available It's as if their parent's spirit joins them, and they just seem to know.
not_available I knew.
not_available My brother died of leukemia.
not_available I was riding home from school one day.
not_available I just knew he had died.
not_available I felt like he was with me.
not_available Maybe that's why you're good with kids.
not_available See you in the morning.
not_available Hey! Where are those kids? What? 
not_available I don't know where they went.
not_available Hey, come here! Come on.
not_available How could you let them go? I looked up and they were gone.
not_available Check the ER.
not_available I'll call upstairs.
not_available I took my troubles Down to Madame Rue Ya know that gypsy With the gold
not_available capped tooth She's got a storefront At 34th and Vine She se//s /ittle bottles Of /ove potion number nine Boo! Come on, Lily.
not_available Riyadh is like a bake oven.
not_available Sounds bad.
not_available But Norm would fix these desert cocktails.
not_available Equal parts potassium, sodium, with a lemon chaser.
not_available There she is.
not_available Sucking up to him a bit more.
not_available Mark 
not_available Disparaging and belittling me.
not_available She's tightening her grip on that tenure slot.
not_available What's the problem? 
not_available She's making everything competitive.
not_available You're a doctor, you love competition.
not_available You're just obsessed.
not_available I am not.
not_available A little myopic, then.
not_available What? Your wife divorced you, you don't see Rachel.
not_available You just care about the job.
not_available I just spent a week where no one was stabbing people in the back.
not_available I could drop everything, take a walk with Susie.
not_available The big decision was what to have for lunch.
not_available There's other stuff out there.
not_available I know you don't have it now.
not_available I just hate to see you get caught up in that.
not_available He broke my /ittle bottle What are you doing here? You weren't supposed to move.
not_available You found us, didn't you? 
not_available We could've lost you, if we wanted to.
not_available Let's go back up to the ward.
not_available Didn't you go trickortreating? Yes, I've gone trickor
not_available treating.
not_available What did you go as? 
not_available Once I went as a scientist.
not_available Bet no one gave you any candy.
not_available We had to do tricks to get treats.
not_available Bet you can't do one now.
not_available Yeah! Do a trick! Do a trick! 
not_available Hey, hey, hey! Shut up, all right? Just one.
not_available How was that? 
not_available That was it? Hey.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available They say those trains run every 10 minutes, but I don't believe it.
not_available You never change, do you? What? 
not_available Just unbelievable excuses.
not_available I said I'm sorry.
not_available I never changed either.
not_available "Hang in there.
not_available Carry the marriage alone." "Don't think about who he is with." 
not_available What's wrong? A man came in today and sat there and watched his wife die.
not_available He helped her to die because she was in pain.
not_available And he loved her.
not_available But we didn't have that kind of marriage.
not_available We didn't love or cherish.
not_available We didn't respect! And now you have killed me! This drink is strong.
not_available I should've eaten something.
not_available We should've eaten before this.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want to Go ahead.
not_available You want to Go ahead.
not_available You're probably too tired after your trip to dance.
not_available Kind of, but 
not_available Maybe later.
not_available I guess I'm up for it.
not_available I'// sing to him Each spring to him And /ong for the day When I cling to him Bewitched, bothered and bewildered Am I Oh, bewitched Bothered and bewildered
