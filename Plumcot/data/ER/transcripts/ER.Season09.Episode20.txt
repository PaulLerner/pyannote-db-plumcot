
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available You two know each other? 
not_available Gordana is here to observe a correction of a heart repair.
not_available Young boy from Croatia.
not_available Eric.
not_available Where are you? I have to go get him.
not_available Why? I mean, Eric's been gone for weeks.
not_available What's one more day? He's off his meds.
not_available And if I don't go now, he might disappear again.
not_available You really need to take this call.
not_available He's in V
not_available tach.
not_available It's your grandmother.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Okay, cough for me.
not_available How much longer? Can you call Psych? 
not_available I did.
not_available A moth flew in my ear.
not_available I'm luring it out.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Kovac here? 
not_available What would you do? Try Trauma 1.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Charge again.
not_available Charged.
not_available Three sixty again.
not_available Charged.
not_available Clear.
not_available Time of death, 9:37.
not_available Sorry to trouble you with this.
not_available That's all right.
not_available I understand.
not_available These are complicated issues.
not_available They certainly are.
not_available I want to give you time to think about things and go over the papers before the will is officially read.
not_available I'll make sure to.
not_available Kel.
not_available Oh, I didn't realize you were here, Jack.
not_available I flew in three days ago.
not_available I telephoned you in New York.
not_available Did you get my message? That's Eleanor's apartment now.
not_available I just wanted to express my condolences.
not_available Well, I'll see you both at the service.
not_available Appreciate the visit.
not_available Bye.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Is red not somber enough? 
not_available You look fine.
not_available She liked men to wear red ties.
not_available That's very Republican of her.
not_available I think that's blue now.
not_available I didn't realize estate lawyers made house calls.
not_available The foundation board has called an emergency meeting for next week.
not_available He just wanted me to be prepared.
not_available Prepared for what? Gamma stipulated it in her will that I be put in charge.
not_available She appointed me president.
not_available I see.
not_available Well, I think that would be a good thing.
not_available For me or the foundation? 
not_available Both.
not_available It should be you, Dad.
not_available I guess that's not what she wanted.
not_available Well, I think she figured I'm in Chicago.
not_available It'd be easier for me.
not_available She put you in charge of the family fortune and left me with a little bachelor's trust fund.
not_available I don't think it was a question of geography.
not_available I've also tried to stay as involved as I could.
not_available Who are you kidding? 
not_available Want me to tell you the truth? She was disappointed in you as a son, as a father.
not_available She didn't think you were up to it.
not_available You could sugarcoat it a little.
not_available It's an opportunity for you.
not_available Not one that I wanted.
not_available Now I'm stuck having to run the damn thing or walk away.
not_available Looks like she managed to screw us both.
not_available Almost time.
not_available Are we waiting on Abby? She's meeting us at the cemetery.
not_available That's good.
not_available You look like a hooker.
not_available Damn it! Anybody home? Eric? What are you doing? 
not_available I broke in.
not_available I'm home.
not_available I can see that now.
not_available What happened to you? I got in a fight with a guy in the lunchroom.
not_available He took the last Jell
not_available O cup.
not_available God.
not_available What? He cut the line! 
not_available You're a mess.
not_available I jumped through a window and scooted through some bushes.
not_available It's a voluntary program.
not_available You can leave whenever you want.
not_available Where's the fun in that? You're not taking your meds.
not_available I have, I swear.
not_available I just lowered the dosages a bit.
not_available How? 
not_available By cheeking them.
not_available They had me on too much.
not_available It was a real downer.
not_available So a few hours after our talk, you pick a fight with another patient.
not_available They call us clients.
not_available Then skip out on the whole thing.
not_available Yeah, I think we could find a better situation, you know? Like, in Maui.
not_available You should've called me.
not_available Give me that.
not_available Why didn't you call me? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I really don't.
not_available Maybe I should just go.
not_available No.
not_available Sit down, sit down.
not_available I could use a drink anyway.
not_available Is your apartment spinning? You feel that? Le duele? I'm working for la Migra.
not_available She says you're a bad man and she doesn't want you touching her son.
not_available Get an abdominal scan to rule out appendicitis.
not_available And tell Evita here I can prescribe a good ESL class.
not_available Twentythreeyear
not_available old minor leaguer.
not_available Syncopal episode after wind sprints.
not_available She says you're a jerk.
not_available Got it.
not_available Parietal hematoma on the left.
not_available BP, 104/58.
not_available Pulse, 120.
not_available He got dizzy.
not_available So I walk him to the dugout.
not_available He must've hit his head when he passed out.
not_available CBC, chem panel, UA, EKG, lateral C
not_available spine and head CT.
not_available No Battle's.
not_available Has he had incidents before? No, this guy's a stallion.
not_available He went from instruction league to Triple
not_available A in a season.
not_available That's impressive.
not_available Chest is clear.
not_available Belly's benign.
not_available He was on his way to be called up to the Show.
not_available What show? 
not_available Ignore him.
not_available He's foreign.
not_available Shoot the neck film and get him to CT.
not_available You good here? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I'll use my foot to put on the BP cuff.
not_available That boy has gotten worse.
not_available What boy? Ante.
not_available The Croatian kid.
not_available I thought it was all set up.
not_available It needs to happen sooner.
not_available No, no.
not_available We have enough trouble taking care of our own uninsured.
not_available He's dying, Kerry.
not_available His mother smuggled him onto a plane.
not_available I need you to try again, please.
not_available Look, even if they donate medical supplies and facilities
not_available The rest would be for me to take care of.
not_available Cardiothoracic team, nurses, transport
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Don't count on anything.
not_available Jacy said she'd do it on one condition.
not_available She needs two weeks off in June that the surgical NM denied her.
not_available I can't control vacation schedules.
not_available Everything's a negotiation.
not_available Nurses are supposed to be angels of mercy.
not_available Even mercy has a price.
not_available Jerry, can you track this flight for me? "Air Flugelros"? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It has a sick kid on it.
not_available They don't have hospitals in Germany? 
not_available Get Dr.
not_available Deford on the phone.
not_available Checking out of the losers' lounge.
not_available Try not to kill anyone.
not_available We'll do our best.
not_available CT's back on the ball player.
not_available Negative.
not_available Looks like a concussion.
not_available Except his 12
not_available lead EKG shows a corrected QT interval of 0.49.
not_available Long QT syndrome? He's just an athlete who's training too hard.
not_available "Baseball been good to him." Let's check a family history to be sure.
not_available Okay.
not_available You know what.
not_available I'll do it myself.
not_available I thought you were going home.
not_available Well, you know me.
not_available I live for this place.
not_available She used to tell me how much it meant to have you in her life.
not_available She was lucky to have you looking after her.
not_available I was the lucky one.
not_available This is Gamma's good friend, Vivian.
not_available Hello.
not_available Are you a relation? I'm her son.
not_available I'm so pleased to meet you.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available This way, please.
not_available They're almost ready to start, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Let's wait five minutes.
not_available Abby not here yet? Yeah.
not_available I sent a car for her but I guess she's running late.
not_available So, what do you do for that? 
not_available Well, the surgeons can insert an ICD.
not_available An implantable cardioverter
not_available defibrillator.
not_available That can shock your heart into rhythm.
not_available He doesn't drink enough water.
not_available He was just dehydrated.
not_available If I get one of those things, an ICD, what then? You'll be on beta
not_available blockers for six months.
not_available After which, we can gradually increase your level of strenuous activity.
not_available We can't stop playing for that long.
not_available Lucia, please.
not_available A guy with a heart condition dropped out for a whole season? What team will take a chance on you then? With Long QT, there's a risk of cardiac arrest and death.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available I'm about to get my shot.
not_available Tuesday night at Wrigley Field.
not_available Our whole life has been waiting for this.
not_available All right.
not_available We can treat this less aggressively.
not_available But just for the moment.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis, you have a minute? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thank you, doctor.
not_available I'm expecting box seats.
not_available You want a cards consult for the ICD? No.
not_available Just give IV fluids and a stress test later.
not_available I thought you were recommending ICD.
not_available I had an ER overreaction.
not_available I worked through it.
not_available All right.
not_available I have paperwork for us to look over.
not_available What paperwork? You know.
not_available The end of the affair.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available Jerry get me that surgical nurse manager back on the phone.
not_available Ever think about getting a personal assistant? Susan, drunk in 3 is waiting on his banana bag.
not_available And, you.
not_available I need to talk to you.
not_available I'll be back in a minute.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you doing tonight? Take it easy, cowboy.
not_available I'm a married man.
not_available Thanks.
not_available O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered accept our prayers on behalf of your servant, Millicent.
not_available And grant her an entrance into the land of light and joy in the fellowship of your saints.
not_available Tears have been my meat, day and night.
not_available While they daily say to me, "Where now is your God? " Now, when I think about these things, I pour out my heart by myself.
not_available For I went with the multitude and brought them into the house of God.
not_available Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul and why are you so disquieted within me? Just as the deer longs for the water brooks so longs my soul after you, O Lord.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available There's a bar.
not_available Vodka goes through me.
not_available Get in the car.
not_available I'm trying to make this work.
not_available Give me room.
not_available I swear, if you do not get back in this car, I will get a gun and I will shoot you dead! Did you learn that in nursing school? Which is the help of my countenance and my God.
not_available I went with the multitude and brought them into the house of God.
not_available Eric.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available What's up? 
not_available Sit! Sit! God.
not_available Put your trust in God.
not_available You need to calm down.
not_available Sorry about your grandmother.
not_available Why don't you come sit with us.
not_available It's tough to lose somebody.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Why don't we talk? It's quite a sendoff.
not_available She must've been very loved.
not_available Or very rich.
not_available Eric.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I don't feel so good.
not_available You brought your brother.
not_available It's not exactly my bowl of rice, Kovac.
not_available Besides, I got a date.
not_available Hot little brunette in Radiology.
not_available Oh, you'll be disappointed.
not_available Hey, listen.
not_available All you'd have to do is be there as a support surgeon.
not_available Some dying kid's desperate mom snuck him aboard a plane, huh? That's almost enough to pluck at my heartstrings which are notoriously unpluckable.
not_available I'll really be disappointed? Trust me.
not_available Will Corday be scrubbing in? The Illinois Marital Dissolution Act 
says "A marriage can be invalidated for one of the following reasons.
not_available " 
not_available Okay.
not_available Keep going.
not_available " Fraud.
not_available " Did you ever fake anything? 
not_available No.
not_available You? 
not_available No.
not_available I'm just a screamer.
not_available " Unacknowledged prior marriage.
not_available " 
not_available Right.
not_available Like either of us is a bigamist.
not_available I have an uncle who's a Mormon.
not_available Next.
not_available "Under the age of legal consent.
not_available " 
not_available Don't I wish.
not_available Don't I wish.
not_available "Lacked capacity to acquiesce due to the use of drugs alcohol or some mind
not_available altering controlled substance.
not_available " I think we have a winner.
not_available Which one of us was trashed? 
not_available Split the difference.
not_available Okay, you know, let me be the gentleman this one last time.
not_available Oh, I don't recall any precedent for that.
not_available Okay.
not_available You're gonna have to sign these and I'll take them into family court.
not_available All right.
not_available Don't kick my ass.
not_available Just initial paragraph two and sign page three.
not_available Done and done.
not_available There we go, unknotting the bonds of love.
not_available Yeah, something like that.
not_available An impetuous lust? Maybe something in between.
not_available See you later? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Call me when we're divorced.
not_available Picked her up at home.
not_available She was at a neighbor's Botox party last night.
not_available Botox party? 
not_available Your day will come.
not_available She's having trouble swallowing.
not_available I'm sorry, Luka.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm getting Deford's team from Rush to do the tet repair.
not_available But I need a County support team.
not_available It's just too far afield for me.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll do anything.
not_available I'll mow your lawn.
not_available I'll baby
not_available sit Ella.
not_available Over my dead body.
not_available And this guy's too, if you don't tie off that bleeder.
not_available Suction from above.
not_available Three
not_available 0 Prolene on a needle driver.
not_available Look, Luka, I appreciate your commitment.
not_available I really do.
not_available But don't you think this is all just a little bit rash? It's the only chance this boy has.
not_available Is Dr.
not_available Dorset part of this team? Is that a problem? Yes.
not_available Okay.
not_available No, no.
not_available Fine.
not_available Fine, I'll do it.
not_available He's calmer now.
not_available I gave him some Depakote.
not_available How much? The whole bottle.
not_available I was stuck.
not_available I He couldn't be left alone and I wanted to be here.
not_available And I thought he would just wait in the car, and I'm really sorry, John.
not_available I'm gonna drop him off at the hospital and then I'll come by the house, okay? What for? Because he agreed to be evaluated, maybe go into a locked ward.
not_available No, I mean, why come by the house? I know what happened was terrible.
not_available Unforgivable, really.
not_available But my brother is sick and struggling.
not_available I'm just trying to help him survive.
not_available I know.
not_available So go do that.
not_available Didn't your doctor tell you that Botox is not FDA
not_available approved for neck wrinkles? They say botulism is beautiful.
not_available Until you need an NG feeding tube.
not_available A what? It's an internal catheter which goes from your nose to your stomach.
not_available Now, you'll have to use that to feed yourself four cans of solution a day.
not_available Will I lose weight? 
not_available GSW times three en route.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available How long till they get here? 
not_available Now.
not_available Fortyfiveyearold in a drive
not_available by shooting at home.
not_available Let's take her in Suture.
not_available Pratt, two kids coming in.
not_available GSW to the right hand, chest and arm.
not_available My babies! Where are my babies? 
not_available They're right behind us.
not_available Turner Mitchell, GSW to the abdomen.
not_available Where does it hurt? 
not_available Where the bullet went in.
not_available Nineyear
not_available old girl.
not_available Multiple abrasions to the head and neck.
not_available Denies LOC.
not_available I'm okay.
not_available Help my kids first.
not_available They're taken care of, Mrs.
not_available Mitchell.
not_available BP's 100/74 after two liters.
not_available 108/64.
not_available But he's tachy at 120.
not_available Hold him steady.
not_available I can't find any GSW.
not_available Me either.
not_available My back hurts.
not_available My neck.
not_available What's your name, pretty girl? 
not_available Noelle.
not_available Well, Merry Christmas, Noelle.
not_available We're gonna fix you right up.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available BP's 90 systolic.
not_available Single small
not_available caliber wound in the right lateral chest.
not_available We were watching Bugs Bunny.
not_available The window 
not_available Exit wound.
not_available Okay, hang another liter.
not_available Betadine the right chest.
not_available Nothing.
not_available Good, Gallant.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Must have come around for a second time Is there a husband? 
not_available No, he's gone.
not_available It's just me now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Ma'am, we're gonna numb you up.
not_available What about my kids? I'll go check.
not_available Prep and anesthetize.
not_available I'll be back for the chest tube.
not_available Down to 64/48.
not_available Sterile gloves and a 7 French triple
not_available lumen.
not_available Gallant needs the SonoSite.
not_available Take it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, there's a telephone call.
not_available It's important.
not_available Take a message.
not_available Let's prep a 6.0 ET tube and a 2
not_available Mac.
not_available Eighty of sux and 10 of etomidate.
not_available It's that airplane you asked me to track.
not_available Okay, ask them what the problem is.
not_available Hey, what's the problem? Okay, wire's in.
not_available Needle back.
not_available Is this the unifoc kid? 
not_available Sounds like a tet spell.
not_available He's saying "bad breathing" and "blau." 
not_available Okay, hold out the phone.
not_available Okay, catheter is in.
not_available Hook up the infuser.
not_available Pressure's holding up at 70.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll take it outside.
not_available DPL kit for Pratt? 
not_available Over there.
not_available What? 
not_available Says he's doing a DPL on the girl.
not_available My pager's going mad.
not_available Start up here.
not_available I gotta see what the hell he is up to.
not_available NG tube and a Foley.
not_available What's his first HemoCue? Twelvepoint
not_available eight.
not_available Talk to me, Pratt.
not_available She's persistently hypotensive and bradycardic with warm dry skin and good cap refill.
not_available Spinal shock.
not_available Or complete transection.
not_available Hi, sweetie.
not_available Can you squeeze my hand? Shrug your shoulders.
not_available I can't feel anything.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available We'll take care of you.
not_available She has no motor or sensory below C
not_available 5.
not_available Where's the GSW? 
not_available There isn't any.
not_available Her mom pulled a bookcase down to protect her.
not_available It must've caused a spinal
not_available cord injury.
not_available Like I said, she needs a DPL.
not_available Do a SonoSite and wait for Corday.
not_available Start the steroids? Yeah.
not_available Nine hundred milligrams of Solu
not_available Medrol, then 5.4 per hour.
not_available I'd assume you would save a human over an endangered species.
not_available Yes, I would.
not_available I mean, do you understand that
not_available I'm curious.
not_available Who do you love most in the world? Can I ask you? You know, and it's not a trick question.
not_available Who do you love the most? I mean, a mother, a father, a brother, a wife, a kid? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I doOh! God! Son of a
not_available It is an unfortunate situation.
not_available But if Mercy is committed to doing surgery 
not_available they should do it.
not_available That won't happen.
not_available And our facilities provide the best, perhaps, the only last
not_available minute option.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need an answer.
not_available It's hard enough to keep pace with our own problems, Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available If it were a wealthy businessman in need of an artificial heart we'll find a reason to do it.
not_available Artificial heart implantation is a cutting
not_available edge surgery that has benefits to medical science as well as the patient.
not_available I know all that.
not_available Unifoc and tet repair, while important, are more prosaic.
not_available We have the ability to save but not the will to do it! After all the talk, we won't save this boy for only one reason.
not_available Because we don't want to.
not_available It's more complicated than that, Luka.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available There's also the money.
not_available I didn't know Gamma had The Collected Oscar Wilde first edition.
not_available There was a story about him late in his life she loved to tell.
not_available I can't quite remember.
not_available He was on his deathbed, drinking champagne.
not_available And a friend of his asked him what he was doing.
not_available And he 
said " Isn't it obvious? I'm dying beyond my means.
not_available " She was a society lady with the heart of Stonewall Jackson.
not_available I didn't mean what I said before.
not_available Oh, it is what it is, John.
not_available We can't pretend it was anything else.
not_available Not much of a party, huh? Not much of a funeral.
not_available It was certainly memorable.
not_available More like embarrassing.
not_available Is that why Abby's not here? I was just having a hard time mingling.
not_available Sharing duck canapés and cosmos with a bunch of people I don't really know.
not_available You don't need to stay if you don't want.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I'm sorry, Dad.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available I feel like I blew it.
not_available Well, you didn't.
not_available Neither did Abby.
not_available Let it go, son.
not_available Just let it go.
not_available They're ready for her up in CT.
not_available So you're on Harper.
not_available I live on Williams, about six blocks east.
not_available I don't know any doctors in our neighborhood.
not_available So, what do you wanna be? 
not_available A fashion designer.
not_available That's good.
not_available But with a smile like that, think about becoming a model.
not_available Stuff like that never happens.
not_available Sure it does.
not_available I've seen it happen.
not_available I'll come find you later, okay? We'll bring you back as soon as the CT's done.
not_available I still can't move anything.
not_available Why can't I move? We're gonna figure that out.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, you forget something? 
not_available Yeah, I did.
not_available Denzel I need my Ancef.
not_available Exam 2.
not_available Pronto.
not_available I.M.
not_available or IV? What's it matter to you? 
not_available Nurses give antibiotics.
not_available I gotta push this girl through CT.
not_available Well, let her do that.
not_available You come with me now.
not_available Come on.
not_available I haven't got all day.
not_available Romano's got a new bitch, huh? Get me a portable defibrillator and a drug box.
not_available Is somebody going on a run? 
not_available Something like that.
not_available I'm not sure why you'd want an affirmative
not_available action imbecile fixing you.
not_available But if you're trying to humiliate me
not_available Zip it.
not_available You've demonstrated integrity.
not_available It won't last long, but for the time being it suits my purposes.
not_available I'd prefer to keep this between us.
not_available How did that happen? 
not_available It's not important.
not_available There's some tissue that's devitalized.
not_available It'll need débridement.
not_available I don't know much about burns, but you'll need more than débridement.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Just do it? Some of this is circumferential.
not_available The vessels look charred.
not_available I don't know if I can take care of an injury that severe.
not_available All right then.
not_available I'll get Corday.
not_available Get Lewis.
not_available She's the least annoying of the bunch down here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, you need a surgeon to examine that.
not_available I am a surgeon.
not_available Jerry, have you seen Abby? She's off today.
not_available I thought you were too.
not_available Jerry, tell Malik to let me know when the postictal postal worker in 4 wakes up.
not_available "Postical" 
not_available I don't think I can even say that.
not_available Carter, thought you went to the funeral.
not_available If you can call it that.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Curtis Mitchell.
not_available They say my family's here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll take you to them.
not_available You gonna be here a while? Did they tell you what happened? 
not_available They told me.
not_available Your mom was lucky.
not_available A bullet went through her chest but we were able to re
not_available inflate her lung.
not_available What about Turner? 
not_available Shot to the abdomen.
not_available But he's stable.
not_available And my little sister? No bullet wounds.
not_available That's good.
not_available But a bookcase fell on her so there's some paralysis, which we're hoping is temporary.
not_available But we won't know more until we get back her CT.
not_available Hey, Mama.
not_available How are the kids? Did you see them? No, not yet.
not_available Are you all right? I was trying to protect her.
not_available It's not your fault.
not_available I pulled the bookcase down on her.
not_available Did you see who did this? Mama, did you see who did this? Don't do anything, Curtis.
not_available You hear me? 
not_available Let's go.
not_available We need to get him upstairs.
not_available Don't you do anything.
not_available Don't you do anything! Have them send type
not_available specific to the O.R.
not_available That's my brother.
not_available Cefoxitin's on board.
not_available Turner.
not_available Second unit's in.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We're taking him to the O.R.
not_available He needs exploratory surgery.
not_available He's bleeding internally.
not_available Can you make it stop? 
not_available A bullet ripped into his spleen.
not_available We may need to remove it.
not_available Turner, you all right? 
not_available We gotta get him upstairs.
not_available You stay strong, little man, okay? Stay strong, man.
not_available The standard of care really does suck here.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Perez? He's got a swing like a young Ted Williams.
not_available That's what everybody says, anyway.
not_available Sounds like a natural.
not_available I just
not_available We can't give up on that.
not_available You don't have to explain it to me.
not_available Robert.
not_available Shall we step inside? Gallant told me what happened.
not_available So much for his integrity.
not_available He was concerned.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis was busy.
not_available May I? It may be a little worse than I thought initially.
not_available Normally, in order to determine full assessment for escharotomy
not_available We need to determine pain and paresthesias which we can't do because I'm the guy with driftwood hanging off his shoulder.
not_available There are other ways to determine if the procedure is called for.
not_available No.
not_available No escharotomy.
not_available These are full
not_available thickness burns.
not_available If blood supply to the hand is compromised
not_available I can feel a pulse.
not_available I am not gonna let the surgical B
not_available team hack away at me.
not_available It's possible your arm could become ischemic.
not_available In which case, it's already too late to save it.
not_available I know.
not_available I get it.
not_available I understand.
not_available Caisce.
not_available You should see Corday.
not_available I don't want to.
not_available At least get a Plastics assessment.
not_available Will you do that, Robert? Hi, it's Abby.
not_available Leave a message after the beep.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, I thought you were gonna be here with Eric.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I was trying to catch you.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I guess there was a change of plan.
not_available And I'm gonna hang up now because you're standing right in front of me.
not_available Hi.
not_available Where's Eric? Upstairs with Meyers.
not_available Are you okay? I'm really sorry.
not_available I feel like such a terrible person.
not_available Yeah, well, it's been a bad time all around.
not_available I'm gonna see them dead! I'm gonna wipe them out! Look, I swear I will kill them! I'm gonna do them all! And I'll take this whole damn world with me, man! I'll take them with me! 
not_available You wanna be cool? Or you wanna be in custody? I'm cool, all right? I'm cool, man.
not_available Okay, I'll get a suture kit.
not_available Sit.
not_available I'm gonna come back later.
not_available Good.
not_available Picked a fight with an IV stand? 
not_available You a doctor? Just a hobby, really.
not_available Nice tattoo.
not_available What is that, Black Pharaohs? No, man.
not_available Righteous Lords.
not_available How long you been into that? I'm not anymore.
not_available I used to run with them a while before I stopped, man.
not_available Outgrew it? My mama begged me.
not_available I got a job bagging groceries.
not_available Okay.
not_available This'll sting a little.
not_available They were after me.
not_available Who was? The Discip
not_available The Disciples, man.
not_available They think they own my ' hood! Probably figured I was an easy target ever since I left my crew.
not_available Now Turner, Noelle and Mama, they paying for it? Punk
not_available ass hoods, man.
not_available Luka, the board's answer was no.
not_available Oh, this is for something else.
not_available However, I convinced them to agree that if a boy with no other options shows up at County General's doors in need of an emergency unifoc and tet repair well, he wouldn't be turned away.
not_available Hypothetically? And completely off the record.
not_available Kerry, thank you.
not_available Welcome to Chicago.
not_available Please remain seated.
not_available We have medical personnel arriving to escort a passenger.
not_available Thank you for your cooperation, ladies and gentlemen.
not_available You are Dr.
not_available Kovac? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Baseline cyanosis.
not_available Non
not_available rebreather at six liters.
not_available All right.
not_available Can I get a pulse ox? Wait until we're in the helicopter.
not_available That the x
not_available ray the lady doc was talking about? Come on.
not_available Talk to me, man.
not_available She has no return of her reflexes.
not_available She's having difficulty breathing.
not_available That could indicate paralysis.
not_available Will she walk? If the swelling goes down, we can put her on physical therapy.
not_available Will she walk? I don't know.
not_available Hey there, baby girl.
not_available Curtis.
not_available Mom's okay.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available We didn't do anything.
not_available Why'd they shoot at us? I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna get things fixed up.
not_available You stay here and get better, okay? Neuro ICU's ready to take her.
not_available When can I visit? 
not_available It's open 24 hours.
not_available Am I going to have to stay here? 
not_available For a while, yeah.
not_available I can't go home with you tonight? No, not tonight, baby girl.
not_available Not tonight.
not_available These folks are gonna take care of you.
not_available You try to get some sleep, all right? 
not_available Car's outside.
not_available You back? Too bad it's like this though, man.
not_available Where you going, Curtis? 
not_available Like I said, fix things.
not_available Yo, they shot up Jamal's crib too, son.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Not the way to do it.
not_available What do you know? 
not_available You did a good thing.
not_available Don't undo it.
not_available Disciples undid it.
not_available They shot my family.
not_available Your family needs you.
not_available Yo, doc.
not_available Hey, Curtis.
not_available Hey, Curtis.
not_available You just didn't do that, right? What am I supposed to tell that girl upstairs when you don't show up? You tell her I'm a warrior.
not_available You tell her that.
not_available Sats are falling! Can't get a good angle! 
not_available PVCs.
not_available We've gotta bag him! No, maybe we'll have to wait! He's gonna go into arrest! Let me give it a shot! I don't think it's possible! 
not_available We do it all the time! Here.
not_available Bag for me! Get low like you're having sex in a Volkswagen.
not_available You know what I mean? He's going into V
not_available tach! Don't miss! You're a motivator.
not_available Anyone ever tell you that? Bypass tech and machine ready? 
not_available On their way.
not_available Where can I plug in? You are? 
not_available The echocardiologist.
not_available Kovac promised me Cubs tickets.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available What a pleasant surprise.
not_available I didn't realize Kovac had recruited you.
not_available He's a persuasive man.
not_available They're three minutes out.
not_available Are they ready? 
not_available Standing by in the O.R.
not_available Okay! Let's roll! Easy! Don't pull the tube! He's bradying down! Looks like 65! Half mg of atropine! Let's get moving! 
not_available No.
not_available He might arrest.
not_available Eagle Scout, doc! Sats are offthe
not_available chart low.
not_available No pulse.
not_available Okay.
not_available Starting CPR.
not_available You want epi? Point
not_available five escalating doses.
not_available Pushing down! High
not_available dose epi doesn't work.
not_available Nothing works.
not_available I just want his heart to beat.
not_available I got a pulse! Let's go! 
not_available Okay! Go, go, go! Pressure's only 60 on maximum dopamine.
not_available He needs suctioning.
not_available Where's the CT team? 
not_available On their way in.
not_available You intubated? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's in pulmonary edema.
not_available Let's get started.
not_available He stable enough for general anesthesia? 
not_available I'll scrub in.
not_available Let's prep the chest.
not_available It's all right.
not_available We have it.
not_available Porcine pulmonary valve with Dacron conduits.
not_available Let's look at his coronary anatomy.
not_available All set.
not_available It's been a good gig being married to you, all in all.
not_available No complaints.
not_available If you ever need a letter of recommendation
not_available My résumé speaks for itself.
not_available Is that split move you do is that a special skill? So I guess we'll be running into each other.
not_available You know, just because we're splitting up doesn't mean we have to end it.
not_available That makes sense to me.
not_available I hear divorcées have the best sex.
not_available We're technically annulled, not divorced.
not_available Work with me.
not_available I will.
not_available I got a roommate.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I know a bench in Lincoln Park.
not_available There'll be some outrage at the top, but we'll handle that.
not_available So he's doing well? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Stable on bypass.
not_available Harvesting pericardium.
not_available I thought if I could save him, it would make me feel I don't know, like maybe I was a doctor again.
not_available Hey, does this look like a pubic ramus fracture to you? No.
not_available Avulsion of the ischial tuberosity.
not_available Abby's on her way down.
not_available Dr.
not_available Romano, how's it going? How's what going? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Back to work.
not_available Gallant.
not_available I'm putting Mrs.
not_available Mitchell in 1.
not_available I'll be back from Ortho in a minute.
not_available What's the chesttube output? 
not_available Less than 50 cc's an hour.
not_available Normal sats.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Mitchell, how are you feeling? Curtis.
not_available Is Curtis here? He had to go out for a little while.
not_available He said he'd come back later for a visit.
not_available You a doctor? You dress so nice.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had a funeral.
not_available Somebody close to you? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Must be hard.
not_available Turner's better.
not_available He's out of surgery.
not_available And Noelle is up in the Neuro ICU.
not_available You can see her tomorrow.
not_available Will you wake me up when Curtis comes back? I'll make sure that the doctor knows.
not_available He's a good boy, my Curtis.
not_available How did Kovac get you on board? Well, he asked.
not_available That was easy.
not_available So, what do you wanna do now? Because normally tonight, I would just be sitting at home watching Trading Places.
not_available But fortunately for you, it's ladies' night.
not_available Yeah, you're right.
not_available My daughter's waiting.
not_available I see.
not_available Well, have I mentioned how much I love kids? My car's up the street.
not_available You want a ride? Which way are you going? Whichever way you point me towards.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available I just can't tonight.
not_available Can I take a rain check? Nice evening for a stroll.
not_available Lizzie.
not_available How'd it go with Plastics? What'd Gallant do, post it on the bulletin board? No.
not_available Plastics consulted me.
not_available They knew that I'd examined your other infection.
not_available He wants to admit me for wound care, daily débridements, pulse monitoring in about a week, do skin grafts on the dorsum and the volar aspect.
not_available Well, that seems reasonable.
not_available Does it? I was making tea.
not_available I put the pot on.
not_available I got distracted.
not_available My sling got caught on the burner and my arm was on fire.
not_available And I didn't realize it until I saw the flame.
not_available It's ridiculous.
not_available Unfortunately, things like that can happen during sensory recovery.
not_available Yeah, but I'm not recovering.
not_available I'll never get the feeling back.
not_available Listen.
not_available Just because you're discouraged, don't do anything that may cause delay.
not_available It's gonna keep going.
not_available You can't afford another infection.
not_available It's over.
not_available Compartment syndrome, vascular insufficiency.
not_available Lizzie, you're not hearing me.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's time for me to cut my losses.
not_available Robert.
not_available We both know I'm better off without it.
not_available You as much as said so.
not_available No.
not_available I said that amputation was always a possibility, but I don't think
not_available I'm very, very glad we had this chat.
not_available Will you check the O.R.
not_available schedule and set it up? As soon as possible.
not_available I just wanna be rid of the damn thing.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available Have you seen Carter? 
not_available He was here before.
not_available Everything okay? Hey, I heard about the boy.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, see you tomorrow.
not_available Actually, you won't see me for a while.
not_available I'm going to the Congo.
not_available What? The Alliance de Médecine Internationale.
not_available I'm off tomorrow and then I'm going for West Africa.
not_available I didn't realize that was so soon.
not_available Take care of yourself.
not_available I mean it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hold down the fort.
not_available She's in the lounge.
not_available Who? You're not gonna play that? 
not_available GSW to the chest.
not_available No LOC, but he's altered.
not_available Who's Attending? Chen's in 3 with a hot Ml.
not_available Who's gonna take this? Pratt needs an Attending.
not_available You're an Attending.
not_available BP, 90/66 after a liter.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, where's Curtis? 
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Was anybody with him? 
not_available A couple pronounced on the scene.
not_available Tachy at 130.
not_available I can't breathe! 
not_available Lost the pulse.
not_available All right, start compressions.
not_available Let's go.
not_available No pressure, no pulse.
not_available All right, stop CPR.
not_available I'm in.
not_available You bag.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Carter, I'm here.
not_available Betadine and 10 blade next.
not_available Jing
not_available Mei's got it.
not_available Pratt, don't just stand there.
not_available Do a central line.
not_available He's my patient.
not_available I got it.
not_available Still no pulse.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You don't have to do this.
not_available Give me the 10 blade.
not_available John, let them take it.
not_available Fifth intercostal space all the way to the midaxillary line.
not_available Okay, why don't we get out of here? 
not_available You know I came in to find you, right? I shouldn't have come in here.
not_available I shouldn't have come.
not_available Things are gonna get better.
not_available Can you do me a favor? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Can you leave me alone? What? 
not_available I need some time.
not_available Can you just go? Okay.
