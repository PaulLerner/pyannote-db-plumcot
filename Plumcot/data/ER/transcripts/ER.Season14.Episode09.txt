not_available Hey, why is Mrs.

not_available The CT isn't gonna change the management.
not_available Come on.
not_available Frank, where's Anspaugh? Don't shoot the messenger.
not_available He said he'd be down.
not_available Hey, Dawn, did you get the, uh, EKG for the CHF'er? I tried, but someone moved your patient.
not_available There's a baby in Curtain 4.
not_available Thought that's where they put the septic hip.
not_available How can you accept a Neurosurgery transfer if we don't have a bed? 
not_available We have to if it's for higher level.
not_available Not if we don't have a bed.
not_available Neurosurgery can see them even if there isn't an inpatient bed.
not_available Were we talking to you? Do you have chest CT results? No.
not_available Okay, hold your water.

not_available It's with deep regret that I announce Dr.
not_available Moretti will not be returning to the ER.
not_available Kevin fully intended his absence to be temporary but due to personal circumstances " he's" not certain when or if he will be able to return.
not_available Here we go again.
not_available A search committee will be convened, find a replacement to consider 
not_available Dr.
not_available Anspaugh.
not_available Yes? With all due respect, the ER needs a chief now.
not_available Today.
not_available There's a lack of communication among the staff and departments.
not_available Waiting room times are up and patient care is compromised.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We can't wait, and neither can our patients.
not_available Yes, it sounds like it can't wait.
not_available So until the search committee meets and until further notice the acting chief of the ER will be Dr.
not_available Wexler.
not_available What? She's a sly one, that Skye.
not_available You see the surprised look on her face when Anspaugh made her acting chief? 
not_available She didn't look surprised.
not_available Exactly.
not_available I'll admit, I believed her funky, laidback surfer
not_available girl act.
not_available But she's been playing us.
not_available She's only been here for a month? How could she know what ER needs?

not_available I don't want it.
not_available Hey, I hear congratulations are in order.
not_available You make me acting chief just like that? Okay, well, I got a lap chole to scrub in on.
not_available Don't I have a say? 
not_available You did.
not_available You made it quite clear the ER needs a leader.
not_available I am not the administrator type.
not_available But you are the most experienced ER Attending we have.
not_available I only signed on at County as a moonlighter.
not_available Well, your new duties will require more than that.
not_available Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
not_available Budget meetings, politicking and ass
not_available kissing? This is not me.
not_available I'm gonna be surfing in Uluwatu at Christmas.

not_available I'll be right back.

not_available Talk to him.
not_available Tell him you want it.
not_available I already did, months ago.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Look, I know I'm too young and less experienced than Skye or Moretti or Kovac or Weav Even that nutcase Clemente.
not_available But, man, I'd be good at it.
not_available You'll get your shot.
not_available Really? When? Hmm? How long do I have to wait? What do I do to be taken seriously? Dr.

not_available Murphy's arm started gushing.
not_available Okay.
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available What else can you do? I mean, it's not like you're gonna quit in protest.
not_available We're on our third unit.
not_available Keep the blood bank ahead two units.
not_available Order FFP.
not_available I thought you had this under control.
not_available I got the artery.

not_available It's not DIC.

not_available He needs the O.R.
not_available What have you decided? Uh I don't know.
not_available We're waiting on a second opinion.
not_available We're gonna wait for that.
not_available Did you talk to Anspaugh?

not_available Dr.
not_available Wexler, can I have a minute? 
not_available Yes, Dr.

not_available I was thinking I should be angry.
not_available But then I figured since you're new here, I'd help you out.
not_available Help me.
not_available Back
not_available seat doctoring doesn't go well.
not_available Is that what you think? 
not_available Instead of criticizing, you could help.
not_available It's called collaboration.
not_available When a decision needs to be made about my patients, I will make it.
not_available I see.
not_available Anything else? Yeah.
not_available Yeah, what's with all the buddy
not_available buddy business with Surgery? Conferring with Dr.

not_available Sorry about that.
not_available About what? 
not_available Oh, he's the sensitive type.

not_available Cystic duct is clear.
not_available We're kicking ass.
not_available Don't jinx it.

not_available We'll make sure she does.
not_available Get the paperwork for workers' comp.

not_available Oh, but she got hurt on the job, so she's eligible.
not_available Actually, she's not.
not_available She's paid off the books.
not_available So you're undocumented? No, she's illegal.
not_available Come on, just tell it like it is.
not_available You should go back to Mexico.
not_available She's from El Salvador.
not_available But to you, we're all the same.
not_available I'm tired of pressing one for English.
not_available That's enough.
not_available No.
not_available No, my father is probably gonna be a cripple, and it's all her fault.
not_available You're wrong.
not_available She got hurt helping him.
not_available What? What? What? You people, you want everything we got.
not_available Why don't you work for it? My mother's been working here longer than you.

not_available Murphy.
not_available You okay, Sam? 
not_available Yeah, I think I just caught an elbow.
not_available You saw, he attacked me.
not_available It wasn't my fault.
not_available Someone put a gun to your head, made you say stuff.
not_available Okay, you know, I was upset, okay? My dad, he's all messed up.
not_available So, chief, what do you wanna do? Well, I think I'd like to hear what you think.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, he didn't take the first swing and his dad is in bad shape.
not_available So I say we escort him back, post security in the hall.
not_available Well, I say, sick dad or no sick dad, we keep his racist ass in Waiting.
not_available Yeah, I'm with Pratt.
not_available Okay, thank you for your input.
not_available We'll go with your suggestion, Dr.
not_available Morris.
not_available Take him back to Trauma 1.

not_available Let's go.
not_available You too.
not_available Hey, Sam, I left something for you in your locker.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Oh, I can't say.
not_available But it's guaranteed to pump you up.
not_available Ha.
not_available Morris wants to give you a pump? 
not_available Not if I can help it.
not_available So are you playing tour guide for your brother? Well, we've been to Navy Pier and Sears Tower.
not_available But what he really wants to see is a taping of "Oprah.
not_available " Kovac, I gotta say, you always have perfect timing.
not_available I thought you staged all that to welcome me back.
not_available You know, the break room was open if you wanna go through that.
not_available And I think the coffee's only about two hours old.
not_available I'll buy you a cup.
not_available Come on.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll be in the break room if you need me.
not_available Take your time.
not_available Hey, Frank, would you mind buying a couple dozen doughnuts? Doughnuts? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My treat, for everyone.
not_available Frank, you all right? 
not_available You know what I think? I think Skye is an angel sent to walk among us.
not_available Right.
not_available Who the hell knows how long we're gonna be here? Reschedule the home inspection for Monday.
not_available Mr.
not_available Udecker, Tate just told me he doesn't wanna be numbed "up " before I suture.
not_available Tate said that? 
not_available Wants to prove he's tough.
not_available Really? Okay.
not_available Okay? He's gonna be in a lot of pain.
not_available That's fine with you? 
not_available No.
not_available If he wants to man up, it's better to learn now.
not_available It's cold out there in the real world.
not_available He's 13.
not_available This is wrong and cruel.
not_available You have children? No, I don't.
not_available Then who the hell are you telling me how to raise my kid? Just do your job and sew up my boy.
not_available Okay, boss.
not_available Whatever you say.
not_available So when you getting back on the schedule? Here.
not_available Uh, next week.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Good.
not_available Is there any chance you'll consider being chief again? No.
not_available You know, Moretti's gone.
not_available And today, Anspaugh made Skye the acting chief.
not_available Really? How about you? 
not_available Me? No.
not_available No, I'm years away from that.
not_available In fact, I was thinking maybe it's time for me to start looking around.
not_available Build up my rÃ©sumÃ©.
not_available Leave County? I might need a letter of recommendation.
not_available So I was wondering, maybe you could write me one.
not_available Yeah, of course, Greg.
not_available But, uh, if you wanna run an ER one day there's no better place to learn.
not_available Yeah, maybe.
not_available But I'm feeling real invisible around here.
