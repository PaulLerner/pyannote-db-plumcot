
not_available Previously on ER This baby's gonna be fine.
not_available Plenty to eat, clothes.
not_available Worry about yourself.
not_available Peter can't use your talents.
not_available My team can.
not_available Why did you take it? 
not_available The MCATs? For me.
not_available I just wanted to see if I was good enough.
not_available Daddy! 
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available You're a young doctor, learning, making mistakes, saving lives.
not_available It takes a lifetime.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I'm getting too old! Shaq on Jordan at the buzzer! Still got your sneakers on, doc? You had better be passing! All right! Time
not_available out! Keep bonding, Mark.
not_available I got it.
not_available Malik, time to save a life.
not_available Hey, doc, do you want some of this? Dad, what are you doing? Busy night? 
not_available Thought the sun would never rise.
not_available One more for the road.
not_available Tearful and upset? That's her chief complaint? Mr.
not_available Thomas here OD'd on his son's jimsonweed tea.
not_available We'll need to send this to the lab.
not_available Jimsonweed? 
not_available Gotta keep up with the times.
not_available Anything else in it? 
not_available No.
not_available When my dad comes down, he'll kill me.
not_available Nurse, it hurts when I do this.
not_available Then don't do it, Mr.
not_available Thomas.
not_available I always use my diaphragm.
not_available I'm a total fanatic about it.
not_available But Did you have unprotected sex in the last 72 hours? The girls at the dorm say you can take a quadruple dose of birth control the morning after, and it will keep you from getting pregnant.
not_available Yes, it can work.
not_available But it's not the best method of birth control.
not_available It's just so weird.
not_available My boyfriend will kill me.
not_available Did he force you or threaten you? Maybe I'm having a nervous breakdown or something.
not_available I can help you if you tell me what happened.
not_available I had a few beers at this party last night.
not_available I saw this guy, Mike, and I was going to give him a ride home.
not_available And then I woke up in my car in a dorm parking lot.
not_available My tights weren't up all the way.
not_available And I don't know what happened.
not_available You don't remember? 
not_available No.
not_available How well do you know Mike? 
not_available You're a hunky chunky one.
not_available What's wrong with this guy? Psychosis and hypersexuality are toxic effects of jimsonweed.
not_available Can't you give him something? What does your dad do? 
not_available He's a malpractice attorney.
not_available Medical malpractice? Really? Have you ever seen anything so pretty? 
not_available It's not that pretty.
not_available Pretty as yours, doc? Hey! Come on! 
not_available Hey, Peter! Here you go.
not_available Light on Hick's service today? I'm covering the ER.
not_available I don't know what these guys whine about.
not_available ER's a cakewalk compared to Surgery.
not_available Cakewalk.
not_available Okay, how about a little O.R.
not_available Versus ER? Loser takes the next gomer who comes in the door.
not_available No.
not_available Squash is my game.
not_available He's kidding.
not_available Yes, he's kidding.
not_available Turkey, same stakes.
not_available Are there patients I can't handle? No, but one could tie you up the whole day.
not_available All right.
not_available Sky hook, left
not_available handed, top of the key.
not_available Your shot, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Leave her hair in the doll's mouth.
not_available The doctors'll figure it out.
not_available Sounds like one for you.
not_available Or maybe for our young surgeon recently humiliated in hoops.
not_available I think I have a better one.
not_available Bring on your worst.
not_available Who made the tea? 
not_available Is there a butcher in the house? Mrs.
not_available Chenovert, you need to stay in your room.
not_available The room makes me jumpy.
not_available I gotta get the chili fry out of my throat.
not_available I still need to finish her history.
not_available That's what they said at St.
not_available David's.
not_available I took two buses to get here.
not_available The pulse is 130.
not_available Are you high on something? Crack? 
not_available Crack? Never! Why don't you let her finish and tell her what you're high on and then I have the perfect surgeon for you.
not_available What kind of surgeon? 
not_available A young one.
not_available Private hospital turfed, that woman.
not_available Can you imagine? Crackhead with abdominal pain.
not_available What do you think? Oh, yes, Carter.
not_available Want some tea? 
not_available No, I'm cutting back on caffeine.
not_available I think its herbal.
not_available Don't drink that! 
not_available You don't want to go there.
not_available Hey, Sasquatch! See what I'm talking about? Your drug screen came back positive for roofies.
not_available Rohypnol.
not_available It knocks you out and causes amnesia.
not_available You mean he put it in my drink? 
not_available Unless you took tranquilizers.
not_available Never! Oh, my God.
not_available How could I have been so stupid? You weren't stupid.
not_available You just trusted someone you shouldn't have.
not_available So what's going to happen? We need to do a medical evaluation.
not_available And we have to call the police.
not_available But what if I'm wrong? I don't really know what happened.
not_available I mean, when I woke up, I didn't know for sure that I had had sex.
not_available He may have used a condom.
not_available Then it's my word against his.
not_available Let's finish your medical evaluation.
not_available We might find some evidence.
not_available Need some help here! Two GSWs.
not_available Hope you're in the mood.
not_available Bad drug deal.
not_available Guy fired in a Fly Burger.
not_available Injuries? 
not_available Single GSW to left flank.
not_available Vitals stable, good breath sounds, IV, saline TKO.
not_available Some guy shot me!

not_available Something for the pain? Stand by with morphine.
not_available Guess you need hazard pay for slinging burgers.
not_available Belly's tender.
not_available Set up a lavage.
not_available Pulse ox is 92 on 15 liters.
not_available He might have a peritoneal violation.
not_available Give him oxygen.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available A cake for you to walk.
not_available Exam 2.
not_available I need a surgical consult on a lovely crackhead sent over courtesy of the St.
not_available David's ER.
not_available That sounds like a dump.
not_available You lost fair and square.
not_available What about this guy? 
not_available Forget it, Carter.
not_available It's gomer tag, and you're it.
not_available Where's Malik? 
not_available Calling Radiology.
not_available I was just standing there.
not_available Hold still.
not_available You're okay alone? 
not_available Yes.
not_available He wasn't armed.
not_available I don't own a gun! 
not_available Call me if you need me.
not_available Can I help you? 
not_available I'm looking for my brother.
not_available Visitors can't go in during a trauma.
not_available Go to the desk.
not_available Kenny! Kenny, are you all right? 
not_available You have to wait outside.
not_available He's my brother! 
not_available You still have to go outside.
not_available Cops won't let me past the tape, medics won't let me in the ambulance.
not_available Who capped you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Would you get him something? 
not_available They think I'm a gangbanger.
not_available I haven't finished assessing him.
not_available Please wait outside! Why're you swarming around this boy? My brother is dying! Nobody is dying anywhere.
not_available Family members need to wait outside.
not_available You in charge? 
not_available Haleh, could you? Don't make no sister shoo me away.
not_available Get your ass in there and fix him up! We treat the most critical patients first.
not_available Kenny's been shot.
not_available You're delaying his treatment.
not_available So why don't you wait outside? You think he's a gangster! 
not_available We treat everybody the same.
not_available Same for the white boy? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, need you in here.
not_available Lydia, come with me.
not_available He bradied down, BP bottomed out.
not_available Give him anything? 
not_available No.
not_available Give me a 14 gauge.
not_available Pulse ox is 85.
not_available Lungs sounded okay.
not_available He's got a tension pneumo.
not_available Get that portable in here! 
not_available What happened? You must constantly reassess a penetrating trauma.
not_available What's wrong with him? 
not_available BP is only 70 palp.
not_available I'm gonna put in the chest tube.
not_available You set me up with a 32 French.
not_available I told you he needed help! 
not_available He will be fine.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Kenny Law.
not_available The Southside basketball kid? You've got to represent for him! He was All
not_available City point guard.
not_available Yo, black man! Are you a doctor? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You gotta take care of Kenny! 
not_available Guy's stable.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available Hey, you! Get off! Don't you touch him! 
not_available I need a new tray.
not_available Call Security! 
not_available What's going on? I got a tension pneumo.
not_available Trying to get the chest tube in.
not_available Let us do our jobs, okay? Mg of atropine and a unit of O
not_available neg.
not_available Hook up the Thora
not_available Seal.
not_available Looks arterial.
not_available Somebody call the O.R.
not_available Tell them we're on our way.
not_available So after you choked on the chili fry? Who said anything about choking? You! 
not_available No, the burning started right after.
not_available All right.
not_available And the burning has lasted on and off for three weeks.
not_available Babs? Where is your pain? Yeah? That's more like your chest.
not_available You're so much nicer than that Dr.
not_available Smith.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I need to examine you.
not_available I'll call St.
not_available David's see if I can find the doctor who took care of you there.
not_available You can leave your clothes on for now.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available And out.
not_available Hey, Kerry.
not_available Hey.
not_available I called you last night.
not_available I was out with Greg.
not_available How's that going? Would you mind writing me a script for a new diaphragm? 
not_available It's going pretty well then.
not_available We haven't done anything.
not_available I've got condoms.
not_available I'll get a new diaphragm.
not_available I'm carefully planning for a possible spontaneous moment.
not_available That's great, Jeanie.
not_available My viral load is down.
not_available I'm not sure if I should expose Greg to HIV unless he's the one.
not_available Not just because I'm Ionely and haven't had sex in a year and a half.
not_available I got one for you.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Woman, 61/2 months pregnant, rear

not_available This is Mr.
not_available And Mrs.
not_available Brodie.
not_available Their son works at the Fly Burger.
not_available We heard he was shot.
not_available He's stable but needs surgery.
not_available Will he be okay? 
not_available I think so.
not_available You can go in and see him before we take him to the O.R.
not_available They get the red carpet escort while you call Security on me.
not_available The patient is waiting for surgery.
not_available He's not critical.
not_available He was when you were letting Kenny bleed to death.
not_available They were treated based on what we saw on initial exam.
not_available What you saw.
not_available Just another shot nigger's what you saw.
not_available He's had a gram of cefoxatin, D.T.
not_available And 5 of morphine.
not_available BP's up, 110/70.
not_available Good.
not_available In English that means he's doing well.
not_available There's been some internal bleeding.
not_available We need your consent to do surgery.
not_available Of course.
not_available Was anyone else hurt? There was another young man.
not_available We took him up to surgery.
not_available I know this is hard.
not_available He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
not_available Billy is always in the wrong place at the wrong time.
not_available It doesn't matter how much we threaten or worry.
not_available Our son is a crack dealer.
not_available It's just a matter of time.
not_available What? The black kid isn't a banger, and he isn't a dealer, and we assumed he was.
not_available I didn't assume anything.
not_available One was stable, the other wasn't.
not_available There it is.
not_available How can you tell? Semen glows in ultraviolet light.
not_available We're gonna have to take a swab.
not_available Oh, my God! He raped me.
not_available I'm afraid he did.
not_available I'm also gonna have to comb for a few hairs.
not_available I could have VD or AIDS.
not_available We'll give you antibiotics for sexually transmitted diseases.
not_available And you should be tested for AIDS.
not_available Oh, my God! I called Rita James.
not_available She's a counselor who specializes in women in your situation.
not_available If you don't tell the police about this, he'll do it to someone else.
not_available The mixture of alcohol and roofies might kill his next victim.
not_available Will you stay with me? 
not_available Of course I will.
not_available Yes.
not_available No, you saw her today.
not_available Chili
not_available fry indigestion.
not_available I need her records faxed over.
not_available Shouldn't cost you more than the bus token you gave her.
not_available I need them now! You can't just dump people that don't have insurance.
not_available Go, Johnny, go.
not_available Mark? 
not_available Hello.
not_available This is Dan Ferkich.
not_available He's Kenny's basketball coach.
not_available Mark took care of Kenny.
not_available Someone from Woodlawn Park must've got him.
not_available Settle down.
not_available Kenny's at the O.R.
not_available His brother went with him.
not_available Chris is on it? Good.
not_available Will he be all right by Saturday? 
not_available He was shot, coach.
not_available Damn, man! 
not_available We gotta call the guys.
not_available How can I check on how he's doing? 
not_available Go to the Surgical Waiting Room.
not_available Someone there can inform you.
not_available These guys have to wait here.
not_available Okay, you stay here.
not_available Is that my baby's heartbeat? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good and strong.
not_available What a sweet sound.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available Everything appears to be fine.
not_available Thank God! How far along are you? 
not_available 61/2 months.
not_available We'll have to monitor you for contractions.
not_available We'll shield your baby, take an x
not_available ray of that ankle and put some stitches in this arm.
not_available Couldn't you just tape it together or something? I could Steri
not_available Strip it, but you get a much better result with stitches.
not_available The thing is, I hate needles.
not_available You're planning on going through childbirth without an epidural? Honey, women were having babies long before doctors and needles.
not_available Why can't they come up? 
not_available We want to see him too.
not_available Only immediate family are allowed on the surgical floor.
not_available They let coach come up.
not_available They shouldn't have.
not_available I see what this is.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I hang with y'all here.
not_available How is Kenny doing? 
not_available Nobody knows.
not_available That's because they don't tell you nothing around here.
not_available What's this? 
not_available The natives are restless.
not_available I heard that.
not_available It's an expression.
not_available They live here, they're natives.
not_available That's not what you meant.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Jerry, let's just knock off those kind of remarks.
not_available The kids heard a rumor that Kenny was shot by a guy betting for the game.
not_available Was he shot over a basketball game? 
not_available Kids get shot over basketball shoes.
not_available Maybe you should set them straight.
not_available White kid was a drug dealer, right? It's not our job to spread rumors or to stop them.
not_available It's confidential.
not_available The kids look pretty riled up.
not_available The police should handle it.
not_available Daddy! Hey! Oh, girl! You're too big.
not_available Something wrong? 
not_available Mom had a stroke this morning.
not_available How is she? 
not_available She's in the ICU in Sarasota.
not_available She's paralyzed on one side and can't talk.
not_available Let's go in the lounge.
not_available Is there anything I can do? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available We're flying down this afternoon.
not_available Rachel wanted to see you first.
not_available Will she be home by the weekend? 
not_available I don't think so, Mark.
not_available She's gonna miss both school and soccer? Maybe that's not I can't miss soccer! I'm the goalie! 
not_available I'll talk to the coach.
not_available Why can't she stay with me? How can you do that and work? 
not_available You do it.
not_available I can take her to school.
not_available Ruth can pick her up and keep her till I come home.
not_available I want to stay here with Daddy.
not_available I can handle it.
not_available Gonna have to transect at the sternum.
not_available Lebsche.
not_available I hear our patient is quite the basketball player.
not_available NBA material.
not_available Been busy in outpatient surgery? I've been busy all right.
not_available Especially since I don't have an intern.
not_available Well, Dr.
not_available Carter asked to be transferred to my team.
not_available You don't think I would poach him from you? No, of course not.
not_available Not unless it was for his own good.
not_available Richardson.
not_available Suction.
not_available I finally got someone at St.
not_available David's to fax me your records.
not_available What time you got? Wasn't the doctor's name Smith? 
not_available No, that was my doctor from before.
not_available Was he a cardiologist? Heart doctor? I got a party to get to.
not_available Maybe I should come back tomorrow.
not_available Wow.
not_available I'd love to let you go, Babs but this EKG tells me that you should be here for a while.
not_available She should be on a monitor.
not_available O2 and a Hep
not_available Lock.
not_available See if they got enough blood to do cardiac enzymes.
not_available Didn't they run those at St.
not_available David's? 
not_available No.
not_available They didn't notice the flipped T waves and the nonspecific ST changes.
not_available Is that bad? 
not_available It could be.
not_available Or it could be the way your EKG always looks.
not_available Dr.
not_available Smith ever tell you that you had heart trouble? You're nice.
not_available You're sure you're a surgeon? 
not_available Sometimes I wonder.
not_available Here's your referral, antibiotic prescription and birth control pills.
not_available I want you to take two now, and two in 12 hours.
not_available If you don't get your period in three weeks, come in for a pregnancy test.
not_available Do you need any help getting home? 
not_available My boyfriend's here.
not_available Would you like me to speak to him? 
not_available No, I'm fine.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hey, weren't you off hours ago? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You've been working a lot since you got back.
not_available Are you okay? Yes, Doug, I'm fine.
not_available I'm gonna go home and sleep all day.
not_available See you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Only a couple of mild contractions.
not_available Is that okay? Less than six an hour is okay.
not_available Is this your first pregnancy? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Do you know your blood type? It's A
not_available negative.
not_available And who's your OB? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Coburn.
not_available That stings! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available When are you due? 
not_available June 15th.
not_available I'm gonna be a caboose by then.
not_available You got any kids? 
not_available No, I don't.
not_available You and your husband must be excited.
not_available It's just me and the baby.
not_available I'm fine with it.
not_available The father would howl and try to chew his leg off like a trapped coyote.
not_available I know the type.
not_available Plenty of them around.
not_available They think they're God's gift.
not_available I definitely know the type.
not_available There they are.
not_available Two wedding rings.
not_available He doesn't want Mom to get married.
not_available It's normal at his age.
not_available They should pass in a day or two.
not_available You mean we gotta wait till he poops them out? Dr.
not_available Weaver, we need you out here.
not_available We got a handicapped guy jaywalking on Michigan.
not_available "Jaywheeling." Handicapped? 
not_available Is that wrong, ma'am? Back there's his wheelchair.
not_available A car hit it, threw him 15 feet.
not_available Head, right chest and shoulder trauma.
not_available BP's 100/60.
not_available Pulse is only 15.
not_available GCS is 12.
not_available How do you say "handicapped"? 
not_available Person with a disability.
not_available Okay, everybody, let's go.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available I'm breaking loose.
not_available Pupils are sluggish.
not_available Where are you injured? 
not_available Everywhere.
not_available Get off me! 
not_available How much did you drink? A couple of beers.
not_available BP is 90/50, pulse is 60 and thready.
not_available He's high on something.
not_available Crosstable Cspine, Chem
not_available 7, blood alcohol and tox screen.
not_available Do you want to pump him now? 
not_available No.
not_available We roll him over if he vomits.
not_available Don't put that snake on me! Swallow when you feel this at the back of your throat.
not_available What's that for? 
not_available I spoke with Dr.
not_available Coburn.
not_available We gotta do a Kleinhauer
not_available Betke test.
not_available You mean stick me with that needle? You have Anegative blood, so you're Rh
not_available negative.
not_available If the father is Rh
not_available positive, the baby can be too.
not_available That can cause a condition called erythroblastosis fetallis.
not_available If this test is positive, we'll give you RhoGAM.
not_available Wait.
not_available Time out.
not_available What if the father has negative whatever? Then you don't need the test.
not_available I just don't think I can bother him.
not_available It's worth a phone call.
not_available You ask for his blood type, not his love and support.
not_available Yes, well.
not_available He actually, he works here at this hospital.
not_available Which department? 
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available We have a lot of doctors.
not_available His name is Peter Benton.
not_available So Dr.
not_available Smith has never seen a patient named Chenovert? Okay, thank you.
not_available Still busy with the chili
not_available fry woman? You should work on your jump shot.
not_available I'm trying to track down a cardiologist named Smith who saw her years ago.
not_available Do you know how many Smiths there are? Hi, this is Dr.
not_available John Carter from County General ER.
not_available The group is getting big.
not_available Can you ask them to go to the Waiting Room? Is there a problem? 
not_available No, not a problem at all.
not_available Dad, where have you been? When's Ruth coming? 
not_available I need you to wait in the lounge.
not_available Dad! 
not_available Come on.
not_available Is everything okay? I thought you were gonna draw me a picture.
not_available Are you not taking care of Grandma because you and Mom are divorced? Of course not.
not_available The doctor where Grandma lives is taking care of her just like I would take care of the doctor's family if they were here.
not_available Mark, paramedics are pulling up with a GSW.
not_available What is a GSW? 
not_available I'll let you know when Ruth is here.
not_available He's from Woodlawn Park.
not_available He was shot coming out of practice.
not_available Can be payback for Kenny Law.

not_available Should she call back? 
not_available No, give me the phone.
not_available Hi, can you pick up Rachel at the hospital? Left chest, right thigh.
not_available How about tomorrow after school? How many units do you want? 
not_available Six.
not_available I'm in.
not_available BP's coming up.
not_available We have a handle on him now.
not_available Doyle, put in a chest tube.
not_available Sure.
not_available Is this payback for the other kid? 
not_available I have no idea.
not_available Your tox screen came back positive for opiates, cocaine, benzos plus your alcohol level is three times the legal limit.
not_available You gonna bust me on a WUI? "Wheeling under the influence"? 
not_available I'm just saying it's a lot of drugs.
not_available I'm a cripple, I'm in a lot of pain.
not_available You got a T4 deficit from a gunshot wound two years ago? You the geek expert? You stick with your rehab? Are you getting physical therapy? I know it's a hard transition.
not_available But nothing comes easy.
not_available Not that crap.
not_available You gotta rise above.
not_available And for what? So I can try out for gimp Olympics? 
not_available I wasn't thinking that far ahead.
not_available What about detox? 
not_available I'm not interested.
not_available Then you can get back in rehab.
not_available Just give me something for the pain! 
not_available There it is.
not_available Bovie that one.
not_available How many units has he had? 
not_available Twelve.
not_available Two are fresh frozen plasma.
not_available He'll never play basketball again.
not_available He'll be lucky if he lives.
not_available We're gonna have to resect this lung.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, I need to talk to you.
not_available I'm in the middle of surgery.
not_available I need to talk to you in private.
not_available Can't it wait? I wouldn't have changed into scrubs if it could wait.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available We'll be okay for a few minutes.
not_available What is it? Do you know your blood type? 
not_available No.
not_available Why? 
not_available Carla Reece is in the ER.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available She had a minor TC, ankle sprain.
not_available She's Rh
not_available negative and Coburn's worried about Rh incompatibility.
not_available What about a KB? 
not_available She refuses.
not_available Yeah, she's afraid of needles.
not_available I need some of your blood for typing.
not_available I can get somebody else to do it.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Okay.
not_available What about the locker room? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Got this one under control.
not_available He's drained about 300 cc's, but the bleeding's stopped.
not_available Any word from the O.R.
not_available On the other basketball casualty? 
not_available Kenny Law's still in surgery.
not_available Will they cancel the game? 
not_available Both teams lost a starter.
not_available Hope they do before more happens.
not_available I'm waiting for the next kid to be wheeled in.
not_available This guy's stable.
not_available Haleh, call the O.R.
not_available And get him transported.
not_available Hey.
not_available Family allowed to use this machine? 
not_available One in the Waiting Room is broken.
not_available How's your brother doing in Surgery? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Do you want me to try to find out? You could do that.
not_available I heard some information about the shooting that I didn't give you.
not_available It was drug
not_available related and involved the other victim.
not_available Your brother was a bystander.
not_available Okay.
not_available The Woodlawn Park student was just shot in a drive
not_available by.
not_available So? 
not_available There was no need for retaliation.
not_available Are you accusing me for having that white boy shot? I told you in case you know someone who would think of revenge.
not_available Who do you think you're talking to? You neither know my hood nor me.
not_available I know about the gunshot victims that come in here every day.
not_available You think you know my life? 
not_available I see them die! And you think I can stop that? Little do you know.
not_available That's not your brother who had his blood spilled and is lying on that table! You don't know a damn thing! Back off and stay out of my face.
not_available I found Dr.
not_available Smith.
not_available Yancy Smith.
not_available I got him to dig out one of your old EKGs, and it was normal.
not_available Ducky.
not_available Maybe not so ducky.
not_available A change in your EKG could signal a heart problem.
not_available All from chili fries? 
not_available A lifetime of chili fries, maybe? But I feel better.
not_available And this thing is getting on my nerves.
not_available You feel better because of the nitropatch.
not_available Let the tech do her job.
not_available I will come back and check on you after I've looked at your enzymes.
not_available Don't forget me.
not_available How could I? Does she want me to come by? 
not_available She didn't say that.
not_available Did she say she didn't want that? 
not_available She didn't say that either.
not_available Okay.
not_available I've gotta go scrub in again.
not_available Peter.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sure.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? Collision at second base.
not_available You must have been hit hard.
not_available It's the All
not_available Star League.
not_available You get punched in the eye? 
not_available He landed on me with his elbow.
not_available Let's get orbital films on that eye.
not_available And set me up for suturing.
not_available Still here.
not_available You on hold? I just called a Cardiology consult.
not_available They're getting Babs' old records out.
not_available Babs? 
not_available Are you on with the O.R.? Tell them we're still waiting to transport that kid from Woodlawn Park.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available We're still waiting for the transport of a GSW.
not_available Mark, I have a question for you.
not_available Just a second.
not_available Malik, can you tell the Law family that there's still no word? Kenny's still in surgery.
not_available They're in the Waiting Room.
not_available I know where they are.
not_available I want them to have an update.
not_available There's this guy I want to get into Detox, but he's a hard sell.
not_available He's defensive and doesn't want to ask for help.
not_available Plus he's uninsured.
not_available So he won't be admitted, and if he is, can't pay for it? That would be the "glass is half empty" viewpoint.
not_available Just make sure we're not wasting a bed on somebody who isn't motivated.
not_available That is a hard sell.
not_available Kid in trauma is bradying down.
not_available Carter, time to play surgeon.
not_available Jerry, if that cardiologist comes, tell him I'm looking for him.
not_available He was stable, waiting for O.R.
not_available Blood started pouring out of his chest tube.
not_available Carter, help me crack him.
not_available Rib spreader.
not_available Suction's ready.
not_available Blood's here.
not_available Put two units on the rapid infuser.
not_available I'll incise the pericardium.
not_available Metz.
not_available Look at that.
not_available Bullet hole, right atrium.
not_available We won't be able to clamp it.
not_available No.
not_available Too much tissue is blown away.
not_available I'll tie in a Foley.
not_available That way we'll get a tamponade and a blood port.
not_available Give it a try.
not_available 4.0 Prolene and a unit of O
not_available neg.
not_available Carter's on fire.
not_available He's better with his scalpel.
not_available Yes, I know beds are tight.
not_available But the patient's brush with death has given us a window of opportunity to No.
not_available I assure you that Mr.
not_available Brown is highly motivated to change.
not_available Okay.
not_available Great.
not_available I'll send him right up.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now if you could just sell it to the patient.
not_available I'm seeing an idioventricular rhythm.
not_available Give me another mg of epi.
not_available Faint pulse.
not_available Let's get him ready to move up.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available Candidate for a pericardial patch thanks to your intern.
not_available How's the basketball player doing? 
not_available First guy we sent up.
not_available Died on the table 20 minutes ago.
not_available Okay, let's move him.
not_available Sorry to keep you here all day.
not_available I've had a good day.
not_available Want to scrub in? 
not_available No, I have a surgical consult.
not_available Okay.
not_available Slick piece of work.
not_available Thought you had forgotten us.
not_available I had an emergency.
not_available How did you guys get hurt? Tommy broke up a double play.
not_available The kid fell on top of him.
not_available X
not_available rays look okay.
not_available That was a mugging, Plosay.
not_available That was a clean, hard slide.
not_available Three feet outside the base path? 
not_available Your kid elbowed mine on purpose.
not_available Can we talk outside? If he can't take a hit, he shouldn't be in the league! Excuse us, fellas.
not_available You got great kids who want to play ball.
not_available Let them keep it on the field.
not_available All right, guys.
not_available Let me see this eye.
not_available Drop that thing down.
not_available Malik, can you join me? 
not_available What for? Kenny Law died.
not_available I have to tell his family.
not_available If you're scared, you should call Security.
not_available I'm a nurse.
not_available Mr.
not_available Law, word just came down from the O.R.
not_available It's not good news.
not_available What is it? The surgeons weren't able to repair the damage in time.
not_available Is he dead? They were unable to save your brother's life.
not_available When did the contractions start? 
not_available Right before Dr.
not_available Coburn came.
not_available This is far too early! 
not_available The father's blood type? No Rh incompatibility.
not_available I'll give you an ultrasound after we stop your labor.
not_available IV drip of mag sulfate.
not_available No.
not_available No IV! It's okay, Carla.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Give me a pain shot! It's hard to get a person without insurance into the Detox Program.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Your chair's messed up.
not_available Give it 48 hours.
not_available No, I'm out of here.
not_available Should I write up an AMA form? 
not_available No.
not_available I'll make you a deal.
not_available Demerol 100, Phenergan 50.
not_available It's yours if you check into Detox.
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Just give it a couple of days.
not_available Give yourself a chance to get your life together.
not_available Are you trying to bribe me? 
not_available Do you want it? Okay.
not_available Let's do it your way, doc.
not_available Just give it a couple days.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Brown.
not_available It's a deal.
not_available I'll tell you everything I'm doing.
not_available Just close your eyes and try to relax.
not_available Relax.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's already a little numb.
not_available I'll use some local anesthesia with bicarb.
not_available Take some nice slow breaths and think of a place you would like to be.
not_available Good.
not_available Just let yourself float.
not_available Do you want to tell me where you are? 
not_available I can't.
not_available It's X
not_available rated.
not_available Never mind, just keep it to yourself.
not_available Okay, it's in.
not_available It is? Really? Oh, girl, you've got the touch.
not_available Are you sure you don't mind? If she doesn't eat before 6, she gets cranky.
not_available I'll be over as soon as I can.
not_available It's macaroni night at Magoo's.
not_available Is that all right by you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Remember, no dessert unless you eat one green vegetable.
not_available I know.
not_available My baby.
not_available He was my baby.
not_available Why is that lady sad? 
not_available Her son died.
not_available Why did he die? 
not_available He was shot.
not_available Did you take care of him like Grandma's doctor takes care of her? Sure he did.
not_available Grandma is gonna be just fine.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Go eat.
not_available The last one to touch Magoo's door has to eat two green veggies.
not_available I need your John Hancock.
not_available When Kenny Law came in, do you think I made racist assumptions? Black folk see the world one way, white folk see it another.
not_available All white people? When something happens, you say it's got nothing to do with race.
not_available But for us, it's always got to do with race.
not_available Can I have my pen back? Carter needs you, his patient's crashing.
not_available The chili
not_available fry lady.
not_available Let's get her in Trendelenburg.
not_available She's having multifocal PVCs.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Echo showed cardiomyopathy with wall motion abnormality.
not_available Enzymes confirmed acute MI.
not_available She was having a heart attack? 
not_available She was on her way to the Cath lab.
not_available I don't hear a BP.
not_available Lidocaine at a 100, IV push.
not_available I lost the pulse.
not_available Charge at 200.
not_available Hands off! 
not_available Normal sinus rhythm.
not_available Check her BP.
not_available Get a gas.
not_available That was close.
not_available BP's back.
not_available 100 systolic.
not_available Fundal placenta, no abruption.
not_available We're in good shape.
not_available Is it a boy or a girl? 
not_available I haven't seen a penis yet.
not_available Are you still nauseated from the mag sulfate? Your contractions have stopped.
not_available Biophysical profile? Four 
parameters Breathing, tone, movement And amount of amniotic fluid.
not_available Oh, hello, there it is.
not_available Turtle sign.
not_available It's a boy.
not_available That little thing? 
not_available They grow.
not_available Not as much as they'd like to think.
not_available I'm having a little boy! Acute MI.
not_available And I thought she was a drugged
not_available out gome.
not_available It worked out okay in the end.
not_available How do you feel, Babs? What? 
not_available Not too great.
not_available You'll be fine, thanks to Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I never should have smoked that crack.
not_available We've got the bleeding under control.
not_available Pressure's holding at 90.
not_available I've dissected out the femorals.
not_available Not bad for some general surgeons.
not_available We'll take it from here.
not_available Arterial and venous cannula.
not_available At least we saved one basketball player.
not_available It was a pleasure working with you.
not_available I know you have your heart set on a high
not_available end specialty, Peter.
not_available But I have an opening on my team for a good general surgeon.
not_available Not flashy.
not_available But we still have a lot of fun.
not_available It's not ambition, Peter.
not_available It's about healing people.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me know if you change your mind.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks I'd be honored.
not_available Good.
not_available What? 
not_available You'll be working with Carter again.
not_available He'll love it.
not_available Thought you'd gone home.
not_available Carter wants a rematch.
not_available Not now.
not_available The honor of ER is at stake.
not_available Rachel's over at Doc's with Doyle.
not_available I'll go and check on them.
not_available Help me.
not_available I can't take him by myself.
not_available All right.
not_available Ten minutes.
not_available No more.
not_available I called up the O.R.
not_available About Kenny Law.
not_available Whether my delaying diagnosis would've made a difference.
not_available There was no way of knowing.
not_available But you're right.
not_available I do make assumptions about patients.
not_available But I try to act the way I'd like the world to be, not the way it is.
not_available Mark, you're the least cynical ER doc I know.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available Home.
not_available You can't leave.
not_available I signed out.
not_available They're expecting you up at Detox.
not_available We made a deal! Well, never trust a junkie.
not_available He'll be back.
not_available Then the nurses will deal with him.
not_available He misses again.
not_available Scores.
not_available It's a lay
not_available up.
not_available Malik.
not_available Hey, come on.
not_available You were right to call me on that.
not_available A little twoontwo? 
not_available Come on! Let's finish them off.
not_available Come on, Malik.
not_available Okay, let's play ball, man.
not_available Get down low.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I broke his arm.
not_available Good hands, Mark.
not_available Let's go.
