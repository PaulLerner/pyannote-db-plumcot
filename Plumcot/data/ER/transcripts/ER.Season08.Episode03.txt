not_available Yeah.
not_available She was in pain.
not_available With sugar? Yeah.
not_available You sprinkle a little on, water escapes from the mucosa the edema subsides, and you pop that puppy back in.

not_available Trust me.
not_available That was no hemorrhoid.
not_available No, wait.
not_available Who asked you to see her? Hey, Dave.
not_available Don't treat my patients unless I ask you to.
not_available I rectified the situation.
not_available Anyone could have shoved it in.
not_available "Rectify." You get it? Funny.
not_available I was waiting for a surgical consult.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available You were gabbing with your boyfriend.
not_available Is there a problem? Yes.
not_available I never knew anyone so possessive over somebody else's butthole.

not_available What about an umbilical line? 
not_available I can't.
not_available I did one during my internship.
not_available We won't get it if she's more than a few hours old.
not_available Fewer complications than a cutdown.
not_available We just need two minutes.
not_available Go get an umbilical
not_available line kit.
not_available No.
not_available Chuny, page Pedes Surgery.
not_available Just go get the kit, Deb.

not_available They knocked him over.
not_available On purpose.
not_available The little buggers were cheering when I went down.

not_available They should be here.
not_available Come on, Deb.
not_available Stay with me.
not_available Can't get a BP.
not_available Okay, turn off the alarm.
not_available Somebody get Weaver.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'm cutting the cord.
not_available What if we can't pass the catheter? 
not_available It's okay.
not_available Umbilical vein looks good.
not_available Prep and drape the ankle, just in case.

not_available Along with everybody else within a six
not_available block radius.
not_available It wasn't that loud.
not_available Don't come to me when you need a hearing aid.
not_available What about those old Led Zeppelin records you're always playing? Okay, they're albums, not records.
not_available And they're vintage, not old.
not_available Whatever.
not_available You still play them way louder than this.
not_available Chicken or beef? 
not_available Dad, I'm a vegetarian.
not_available I knew that.
not_available Mom thinks it's just a phase.
not_available Hello, it's called a healthy lifestyle.
not_available Maybe you should try it.
not_available Exactly what happened between the two of you? I told you, she kicked me out.
not_available She did.
not_available I came home from my friend Stacy's and she had thrown my clothes on the lawn.
not_available I left.
not_available Why'd she throw your clothes out? She's crazy.
not_available Seriously, I think she needs therapy.

not_available hour late.
not_available I mean, come on, Dad.
not_available A half
not_available hour.
not_available It's summer vacation.
not_available I'll call her.
not_available Don't bother.
not_available She's beyond reason.
not_available Does she know you're here? Rachel, you've got to let her know you're here.
not_available Why? 
not_available Why? Because she'll be worried to death.
not_available So what? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Rachel.
not_available She dropped in for a visit.

not_available That's mine.
not_available End
not_available stage dementia.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Call your mother.
not_available Bye.
not_available You didn't tell me she was in town.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available She ran away.
not_available Why? 
not_available To join the circus? I don't know.
not_available She and Jen are having mother
not_available daughter issues.
not_available I'm sure you know what that's like.
not_available I didn't run away.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available Your mother would have set the hounds out on you.
not_available This guy's definitely not breathing.
not_available He needs an airway.
not_available Hand me this when I say "tube.
not_available " Okay? 
not_available There's no air in here.
not_available I can't see squat.
not_available All right, you.
not_available Push on his neck.
not_available What? Give me your hand.
not_available Like this.
not_available There you go.
not_available Okay.
not_available Forget it.
not_available I'm never gonna see the cords.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available Damn it.
not_available Blew the line.
not_available Bag him.
not_available I don't know how
not_available Just squeeze the bag every three seconds.
not_available One, two, three, squeeze.
not_available All right? One, two
not_available Hey, hey, hey! Help her! Help her! Hey! I said, no fainting! No fainting! Okay! Run the fluids in over two hours.
not_available And give him 50 of Librium for the shakes.
not_available Abby? What? Did you hear me? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available You want a blood
not_available alcohol level? Just a liver panel.
not_available Did you find your sweater? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available I thought you maybe had some trouble.
not_available Why would you think that? 
not_available I haven't seen you.
not_available Well, we've been busy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Abby, I'm sorry if I hurt you.
not_available I didn't want to.
not_available You didn't hurt me.
not_available I just want you to be happy, Abby.
not_available You never seemed to be happy with me.
not_available That's all I wanted to say.
not_available Well, you said it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available So, what now? You tell me.
not_available Should I send a ProTime? Yeah.
not_available What's your biggest angiocath? 14
not_available gauge.
not_available Give it to me.
not_available What are you gonna do? 
not_available Retrograde intubation.
not_available Hold that.
not_available The wire should come out the mouth.
not_available Okay, hold on to that, sparky.
not_available I got the line.
not_available Squeeze in a liter.
not_available Hold on to that.
not_available Don't stick anyone.
not_available And tube.
not_available I said, tube! Doctors are human.
not_available We make mistakes.
not_available If this guy had been properly diagnosed and sent straight to the O.R., he'd be flipping burgers at McDonald's.
not_available Marfan's is difficult to detect.
not_available Residents had never heard
not_available Which is why we have Attendings.
not_available I can't be everywhere.
not_available Wrong answer! The Trib is writing a feature story on this screwup and the rise in preventable deaths.
not_available So come up with a better excuse than "doctors are human" or find yourself a good old
not_available fashioned scapegoat.
not_available Let me out.
not_available Hurry up.
not_available We got good breath sounds.
not_available Very cool.
not_available Who's your daddy? She's pinking up.
not_available She's breathing quietly without retractions.
not_available Heart rate's normal at 140.
not_available Temperature's up to 97.
not_available All right.
not_available Someone's got to call Social Services and DCFS.
not_available This little girl's gonna need foster placement.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter? This is Mirissa.
not_available She's the woman who found the baby.
not_available She wanted to know how she's doing.
not_available Very well.
not_available Good thing you found her.
not_available Would you like to see her? 
not_available This is my sister Carmine.
not_available Hi.
not_available Doctor, can you show my sister the mark on her chest? The birthmark? Oh, yeah.
not_available There you go.
not_available Doctor, thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did I just miss something? She thinks the birthmark is the sign of the Virgin Mary.
not_available It does look like a bleeding heart.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available Thanks for the help.
not_available Anytime.
not_available No, no, really.
not_available Anytime.
not_available Hey.
not_available Can I get you a cane? I've heard that women find helplessness charming.
not_available In puppies maybe.
not_available Are you still evading Luka? No.
not_available Well, yeah, sort of.
not_available It's complicated.
not_available Most breakups are.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available Well, not that way.
not_available This morning, I had to go over to his place to get one of my sweaters.
not_available And I smashed his fish tank.
not_available Why? 
not_available It was an accident.
not_available Did you replace it? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available I haven't told him.
not_available Is it too broken to fix? It was more like a crack.
not_available You want some lidocaine? 
not_available No.
not_available Just do it.
not_available That is one big piece of glass.
not_available You really should replace it.
not_available He's gonna think you're a little 
not_available vindictive.
not_available It wasn't like that.
not_available I know.
not_available I'm getting him another one.
not_available I think that's a great idea.
not_available I just need help getting it into his apartment.
not_available Don't even.
not_available Come on.
not_available I can't lift it up by myself.
not_available We get there and replace it before he gets home.
not_available You tell Luka what happened and the two of youMay I remind you I removed a thorn from your paw? John, did you discharge Ravitz? 
not_available Who? All right.
not_available I'll think about it.
not_available I owe you.
not_available Twentytwoyear
not_available old with chest pains, taking birth control.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, why? 
not_available Well, Weaver took her from me.
not_available She gave her to you? Maybe she thought you were swamped.
not_available Yeah, more like incompetent.
not_available She made you Chief Resident.
not_available You know, you're the chosen one.
not_available Yeah, by default.
not_available We met when we were kids.
not_available Her family had the cottage next to ours.
not_available We used to go water
not_available skiing together.
not_available But now she can't feed or dress herself.
not_available And she doesn't even recognize me.
not_available What will happen if we don't operate? Her appendix will burst, and she'll develop a life
not_available threatening infection.
not_available Is that a painful way to die? 
not_available She doesn't have to die, Mr.
not_available Tanzi.
not_available It's a fixable condition.
not_available I'm not so sure she wants to be fixed.
not_available It's a simple surgery, Mr.
not_available Tanzi.
not_available Look, I don't want her to suffer, but I want to let her go.
not_available Can you do that? 
not_available Sure we can.
not_available Let's give her 5 milligrams of morphine.
not_available Keep her hydrated.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Mark, are you not going to try and convince him? He has power of attorney.
not_available It's his decision.
not_available Dad.
not_available Yes, I know, butDad? What's wrong? 
not_available I called her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She started freaking out.
not_available I told you.
not_available All she ever cares about is her stupid job! 
not_available She's gonna send me to summer school.
not_available Call if you need me.
not_available And I swear I'm adopted! 
not_available Rachel, what did she say? She started yelling at me! She hates me.
not_available She's such a bitch.
not_available Rachel.
not_available You don't know what she's like.
not_available You don't live with her.
not_available I did.
not_available You couldn't stand it either.
not_available Mark, we got a GSW coming.
not_available I'll be there.
not_available Prep the Trauma Room.
not_available Where's Malucci? Said he was going to Radiology.
not_available What are they waiting for? 
not_available 104's bringing them.
not_available Chief! 
not_available You're fired.
not_available I'm on my break.
not_available I'm between calls.
not_available Go home, Malucci.
not_available And get this rig out of here.
not_available What are we talking? You want to suspend me a week? 
not_available You no longer work here.
not_available What do you want? A formal apology? 
not_available I want you to empty out your locker.
not_available What? Dr.
not_available Chen, you need to check the baby.
not_available Calm down.
not_available She's here.
not_available Want to talk to her? No! When do you get in? 
not_available I don't want her to come.
not_available She's calling from the plane.
not_available I'm not going with her.
not_available Don't yell at me.
not_available I didn't tell her to come here.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Yeah, I gotta run.
not_available We'll figure it out when you get here.
not_available Bye.
not_available She was freaking out, wasn't she? 
not_available She's worried.
not_available Mr.
not_available O'Groat, Mr.
not_available O'Groat.
not_available Where are you going? 
not_available To the game.
not_available I need to check your x
not_available ray.
not_available I'm good to go.
not_available You may have separated your shoulder.
not_available It's okay.
not_available I saw the baby.
not_available Cheers.
not_available What baby? Are you taking her side? 
not_available What? No.
not_available Can you talk to Weaver? She fired me.
not_available What did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I don't even want to see her! Why are you still here? See? What's going on? 
not_available He's out of here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Just a second.
not_available You gonna talk to her? 
not_available My wife's gone.
not_available What? 
not_available I went to call our son.
not_available When I got back, she was gone.
not_available Maybe the nurses took her.
not_available Her walker's gone.
not_available She couldn't have gone far.
not_available Last time she wandered off 
not_available she nearly got hit by a car.
not_available Randi, call Security.
not_available His wife might be missing.
not_available We'll find her.
not_available Dad, I want to stay with you.
not_available Not now! So you'll talk to her, then, right? 
not_available You talk to her.
not_available She didn't fire me.
not_available You ready? 
not_available One more patient.
not_available I'll be in the car.
not_available I don't want Luka to see us.
not_available We gonna wear ski masks? 
not_available Thank you for calling me.
not_available Yes.
not_available Did you win the lottery? Better.
not_available My labs came back.
not_available My HIV test is non
not_available reactive.
not_available Hey, congratulations.
not_available Great.
not_available I have to take it again in three months.
not_available If you haven't converted by now, chances are you probably won't.
not_available God, I feel like I just got my life back.
not_available I don't think this is working.
not_available Give it time, Yolanda.
not_available What's this? Oh, she just had an allergic reaction to some meat.
not_available She'd probably breathe easier if you took the corset off her.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Slow, deep breaths, Yolanda.
not_available You got this? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available What happened? She dropped her sats? 
not_available Sinus tach.
not_available Heart rate's 180.
not_available Is she dehydrated? 
not_available Well, definitely not dry.
not_available She's making good urine.
not_available Spike a fever? Repeat temp is 98.4.
not_available Chuny, I need that hemoglobin.
not_available It's coming.
not_available Last one was 12.2.
not_available She's not anemic.
not_available You're not anemic, are you? Did you check a tox screen? 
not_available Negative.
not_available Maybe she's worn out from performing those miracles.
not_available Second HemoCue is 8.2.
not_available I knew she was looking pale.
not_available Well, that's too low to be dilutional.
not_available It might be hemolysis.
not_available Or Gl blood loss.
not_available I'll check a stool guaiac.
not_available What are you doing out of bed, dear? The baby was crying.
not_available Well, let's get you back to your room, all right? All right.
not_available Send off a retic count, haptoglobin, Coombs, direct and indirect bilirubin.
not_available I want to transfuse 2 cc per kilo per hour over the next five hours.
not_available That's a good pickup.
not_available I would never have thought to repeat the blood count so soon.
not_available Tachycardia will resolve with transfusion.
not_available Baby's anemic, you give blood.
not_available It's not exactly one for the journals.
not_available What? 
not_available Thanks, Carter.
not_available That was great.
not_available Where was she? 
not_available Wandering the halls, apparently.
not_available I was detained by Malucci, who seems to think he's out of a job.
not_available He is.
not_available The baby was crying.
not_available What happened? Why is she so much better? Her appendix probably burst.
not_available Once the pressure's relieved, the pain temporarily goes away.
not_available For how long? 
not_available Within 24 hours peritonitis will take over.
not_available Causes high fevers and severe abdominal pain.
not_available Thank you for taking care of me, Lawrence.
not_available You know, Malucci is not the first doctor to get caught performing an unauthorized physical in the hospital.
not_available She knows I've been taking care of her.
not_available Excuse me? It's been two years since she's said my name.
not_available Is it too late to perform the surgery? 
not_available She's perforated.
not_available We'd have to do an open procedure, which will take much longer to heal.
not_available I want you to operate.
not_available Mr.
not_available Tanzi, your wife's moment of lucidity was probably a fluke.
not_available The surgeon says it's a simple operation.
not_available Why don't you stay here with your wife and we'll have the surgeon come down and speak with you, all right? 
not_available She deserves to have everything done.
not_available She will.
not_available What are you doing? His wife's end
not_available stage dementia.
not_available I'm trying to help them.
not_available Well, apparently, you're not.
not_available You want this one too? She's yours.
not_available Why don't you take all the patients, seeing that you're firing all the doctors.
not_available He had it coming.
not_available For what? Unacceptable behavior, insubordination.
not_available I mean, he has no respect for anything.
not_available So what? Reprimand him.
not_available I am tired of his attitude.
not_available You can't get rid of him just because you don't get along.
not_available If that were the case, you'd fire all of us.
not_available You know what? I'm not gonna justify my point of view! Where is she? 
not_available Good to see you too, Jen.
not_available Don't break it.
not_available You owe me so big for this.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What's wrong? I left the keys in the apartment.
not_available That's it.
not_available Mission aborted.
not_available Wait.
not_available Hold it.
not_available Wait.
not_available He sleeps with the window open.
not_available Wouldn't it make more sense to leave it out front? So someone can steal it? Who steals a fish tank? Come to think of it, who breaks one? 
not_available I told you, it was an accident.
not_available That's good.
not_available Okay, that's Luka's.
not_available Can you give me a boost up there? 
not_available No.
not_available Just bend over.
not_available You could at least buy me dinner first.
not_available I got a bad back.
not_available What are you? What are you implying? 
not_available What if somebody sees us? All right.
not_available Just relax, Opie.
not_available Are you ready? Okay.
not_available Yes.
not_available Wait.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's stuck.
not_available Sorry.
not_available It's stuck.
not_available Carter! She doesn't listen.
not_available She ignores curfew.
not_available She doesn't do a thing around the house.
not_available How would you know? You're never home.
not_available I just made partner.
not_available Excuse me for working so hard so I can put a roof over your head.
not_available You made partner? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Dad! 
not_available Rachel, sit down.
not_available Obviously, there is a lack of communication here.
not_available Sounds like to me, Rachel, you could be a little more responsible.
not_available Jen, maybe you could spend some more timeI am responsible! 
not_available I've given her 14 years.
not_available I am tired of being her maid.
not_available Tired of being a mother.
not_available Can you blame me? All right, time
not_available out.
not_available We'll finish this at home.
not_available We get on a plane at 5:30.
not_available Maybe I'm not going back.
not_available Rachel, I had to cancel my whole day to be here.
not_available And now I'm gonna be up all night doing a brief.
not_available Well, I'm sorry I'm such a pain in the ass.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene, we need you.
not_available Remember when she used to push crayons down the toilet? Seriously, Mark, you've gotta help me here.
not_available Now, doctor.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Auto versus pedestrian at moderate velocity.
not_available Altered, with GCS of 24
not_available 4.
not_available BP is 80 palp.
not_available Full trauma panel, type and cross for four.

not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? We got a severed umbilical cord.
not_available Where's the baby? 
not_available There is no baby.
not_available She's got a retained placenta.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll try to extract.
not_available Call OB.
not_available She's missing a shoelace.
not_available Resuscitate? 
not_available He's been down too long.
not_available Flush him? Think Luka will miss him? 
not_available He'll think one of the other fish ate him.
not_available They're not piranha.
not_available Fine.
not_available I was never any good with pets.
not_available I used to like those turtles at the Woolworth's.
not_available Don't they carry salmonella? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Didn't live long if you paint them with nail polish.
not_available Can we get out of here now? I have to wipe the place down for prints.
not_available Should I get it? 
not_available No.
not_available No pneumothorax.
not_available You ready with the ultrasound? All set.
not_available Systolic's up to 100.
not_available She's coming around.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Anna.
not_available What happened? 
not_available You were hit by a car.
not_available My stomach hurts.
not_available Where's your baby? I don't have a baby.
not_available Crit's only 28 after 2 units.
not_available Hang another 2.
not_available She needs a splenectomy.
not_available What? 
not_available You need an operation.
not_available Why? You have internal bleeding from the accident.
not_available And you haven't delivered your placenta.
not_available No, I'm not pregnant.
not_available You were.
not_available Did you leave your baby at the church? 
not_available I don't have a baby.
not_available I'm taking her up.
not_available Hold on.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Oh, crit's up.
not_available But she needs another 4 per kilo.
not_available I need to take her for a second.
not_available What? Take her where? 
not_available Just next door.
not_available She needs more packed cells.
not_available Send off another CBC from Pre
not_available Op, and I want plasma in the O.R.
not_available Wait.
not_available Her pressure's borderline.
not_available I gotta take her.
not_available I need to put her back on the monitors.
not_available Anna, this is your baby.
not_available I don't have any children.
not_available You tied off her umbilical cord with your own shoelace.
not_available No.
not_available We need to finish the transfusion.
not_available You left her at the church because you wanted her to be safe.
not_available I can't have a baby.
not_available But you did.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available She's very sick.
not_available But we're helping her now.
not_available I never meant to hurt her.
not_available I thought God would protect her.
not_available He did.
not_available Some people think she's a miracle.
not_available What? They feel better when they're near her.
not_available Can I touch her? Yeah.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available What are you doing, ordering pizza? 
not_available I'm calling my lawyer.
not_available They haven't charged us.
not_available We're sitting in the back of a police car.
not_available What are they gonna arrest us for? Aquatic mischief? Hope you're this funny in handcuffs.
not_available I am.
not_available Oh, here we go.
not_available He looks pissed.
not_available You think he's gonna press charges? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available We did kill his fish.
not_available We? 
not_available Oh, he's really pissed.
not_available I'm making my phone call now.
not_available All right, Bonnie and Clyde, your friend cut you loose.
not_available Stay out of trouble.
not_available Should we say something? 
not_available You should say something.
not_available Maybe tomorrow.
not_available Rachel, your mom's waiting out front for a taxi.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I know growing up can be tough.
not_available You can call me anytime.
not_available Yeah, until Mom takes away my phone privileges again.
not_available It'll be okay.
not_available No, it won't.
not_available Rachel, what do you want me to do? You could let me stay here.
not_available You can't.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Your mom would miss you.
not_available Right.
not_available You'd miss your friends.
not_available They're only a phone call away.
not_available I'll make new ones.
not_available What about school? 
not_available They have schools in Chicago.
not_available I just want to spend more time with you and Ella.
not_available I've got a baby sister who doesn't even know me.
not_available And Elizabeth is totally smart and cool.
not_available I mean, she's a great role model.
not_available Are you serious about this? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's a big move.
not_available I miss you, Dad.
not_available I'll talk to your mother.
not_available Straight clamp, then 2
not_available 0 Vicryl.
not_available Any chance we could speed this up? I got tickets to the Cubs game.
not_available If you're asking me to compromise surgery in order for you to attend a sporting event, the answer is no.
not_available I did a pre
not_available op assessment on her.
not_available I've had more intelligent conversations with my neighbor's cat.
not_available I need to irrigate with 2 liters.
not_available I've only got 500 cc's on the field.
not_available Then get us some more.
not_available Coming right up.
not_available Maybe this is God's way of saying her meter's out.
not_available If I get to this point, I sure as hell don't want a trip to the O.R.
not_available I'll keep that in mind, Dr.
not_available Babcock.
not_available Whatever happened to dignity in death? Elizabeth? Dr.
not_available Corday? Where's my saline, Shirley? 
not_available Ready to go.
not_available Right, then.
not_available Did you just fall asleep? 
not_available No.
not_available You did.
not_available You fell asleep.
not_available I was resting my eyes.
not_available Peter, you missed a good one.
not_available Seven gunshots.
not_available Looked like a scavenger hunt.
not_available What've you got? Twentyyear
not_available old with fractured spleen and retained placenta.
not_available Call Coburn? 
not_available She's on her way.
not_available She's gonna try manual extraction under general anesthesia.
not_available Hopefully it's not an accreta.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, there's a young man out here looking for you.
not_available Jackie? 
not_available I'm sorry, Peter.
not_available What's wrong? I can't do this.
not_available Not right now.
not_available I'm getting ready to go into surgery.
not_available I tried.
not_available I really did.
not_available Okay, listen.
not_available Why don't we just talk about this when I get home.
not_available Reece is the sweetest little boy I know.
not_available I love him like he was mine.
not_available But he's not mine.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available And every time I see him
not_available It's just not fair.
not_available Jackie? Jackie! 
not_available Is he scrubbing in with you, Peter? I just need to find somebody to keep an eye on him.
not_available Don't look at me.
not_available I'm gonna go to daycare.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Go home.
not_available Get your personal life sorted out.
not_available I'm going to perform a splenectomy.
not_available Not anymore.
not_available She stands a better chance if I do it.
not_available Go.
not_available Spend some quality time with your son at Chuck E.
not_available Cheese or something.
not_available Hey.
not_available Weaver change her mind? 
not_available No.
not_available Not yet.
not_available She will.
not_available She's just mad at you.
not_available She's always mad at me.
not_available This is different.
not_available Well, maybe it'll blow over.
not_available You know, I
not_available I should have seen it.
not_available I didn't focus on the mediastinum.
not_available II didn't even look at the x
not_available ray, Dave.
not_available Because I told you it was clear.
not_available I mean, I thought I was doing the right thing.
not_available I justI just wanted to save the guy and
not_available You know, they say you're not a real doctor until you've killed a few patients.
not_available What are you gonna do? This is the only thing that I've ever been any good at.
not_available I'm gonna be a doctor.
not_available You were never arrested or brought home by the police or anything when you were a kid? 
not_available No.
not_available Were you? Well, not for anything serious.
not_available What, no counterfeiting? No grand
not_available theft auto? Actually, I did get in trouble for taking this car.
not_available You stole a car? 
not_available Barely.
not_available It was a Gremlin.
not_available And I was only borrowing it anyway.
not_available What, no highspeed chases involved? 
not_available Well, a short one.
not_available It was an emergency.
not_available We had to get Wham! tickets.
not_available Now, that's a crime.
not_available Do you want to come in for a coffee or something? 
not_available No.
not_available I gotta get up early.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, thanks for helping me.
not_available You can find yourself another wheelman next time.
not_available That's too bad, because I had my eye on this liquor store on the corner.
not_available You heard the cop.
not_available "Stay out of trouble.
not_available " 
not_available All right.
not_available Got it.
not_available Sorry I almost got you arrested.
not_available You walk outside there, you gonna find all your stuff on the street! 
not_available My upstairs neighbors.
not_available Sound like nice people.
not_available They're at it again.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Somebody should go up there.
not_available I'm sure they'll settle down in a minute, Mrs.
not_available Gottschuck.
not_available Why don't you go back to bed.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow.
not_available All right, good night.
not_available You're gonna tell Luka this was your idea.
not_available Yes.
not_available I'm not gonna drop a dime on you, Carter.
not_available You look beat.
not_available I am.
not_available How was Mrs.
not_available Tanzi's appendectomy? Uneventful.
not_available Hey, Rachel's still here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I thought Jen was coming to get her.
not_available Things didn't go quite as planned.
not_available How's that? As in, how do you feel about Rachel staying with us a while? 
not_available For the rest of the summer? Maybe.
not_available Maybe longer.
not_available Could be handy having a live
not_available in babysitter.
not_available And I'm sure she'll help around the house.
not_available She's your daughter, Mark.
not_available Of course she's welcome to live with us.
not_available The fact that she's still here suggests you've already told her she could.
not_available You were in surgery.
not_available So do you guys have a satellite dish? No.
not_available No singed nasal hairs.
not_available If you lean back far enough, the flame burns away from your face.
not_available That's the key to fire
not_available eating.
not_available So, what happened today? Usually, I smear my mustache with Vaseline.
not_available Today, I forgot it, so I used hair gel instead.
not_available I guess it was flammable.
not_available Guess so.
not_available Let's shave off the rest of the mustache and débride the skin.
not_available You can't shave my mustache.
not_available It's my trademark.
not_available Dude, it's half gone.
not_available I'll get an extension or something.
not_available I'll give you Neosporin.
not_available Give this to Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available He left.
not_available Give it to someone else.
not_available Look, chief, I know you're pissed.
not_available But let's be real about this.
not_available If you really want to ax me, you go through the review committee and disciplinary committee.
not_available They'd want to counsel me.
not_available The best you'll get is suspension.
not_available You have five letters in your file 
not_available for unprofessional behavior.
not_available Me and every doctor.
not_available You've been counseled.
not_available You failed two rotations.
not_available There will be a meeting of the Residency Review Committee.
not_available They will offer you counseling, but I am telling you 
not_available you will never work in this ER.
not_available What's your problem? 
not_available You.
not_available You're my problem.
not_available Because I don't kiss your ass? I mean, yeah, I like to have fun sometimes.
not_available I'm a damn good doctor.
not_available I had a half a dozen great saves today.
not_available Being a doctor is more than great saves.
not_available Really? What? I need to adopt your cheery attitude and sparkling bedside manner? Hey, this isn't about my performance, is it? 
not_available Or my rotations.
not_available You just don't like me.
not_available You're right.
not_available I don't like you.
not_available You have no respect for me, your coworkers, this hospital, anything.
not_available You think you have this whole cowboy approach to medicine.
not_available But you don't have the goods to back it up.
not_available So you make mistakes.
not_available Mistakes that kill people.
not_available I need this job.
not_available You can't fire me.
not_available I have a kid to support.
not_available Since when? You never said anything about being a father.
not_available Did you ever ask? 
not_available You don't know a damn thing about me.
not_available Well, I know you're fired.
not_available You're a sad, coldhearted bitch! You know that? 
not_available Somebody call Security.
not_available Nobody here likes you.
not_available Get out! 
not_available Know why this stupid ER is so damn important to you? Do you know why? Because it's the only thing that you've got in your life.
not_available Nazi dyke.
