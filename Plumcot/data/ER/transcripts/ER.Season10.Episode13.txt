not_available 10x13 "GET CARTER" Oh, look.
not_available Here they are.
not_available Fantastic.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Good morning, Ella.
not_available Hi.
not_available Happy birthday, Sydney.
not_available You ready for your party? 
not_available She's been ready for a month.
not_available Were going to the aquarium, and then were having a puppy party.
not_available It seemed like a good idea at the time.
not_available I put her present in Ella's backpack.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Youre awful brave taking this on alone.
not_available Hey, youre welcome to come with us.
not_available Yeah, Mommy.
not_available Come with us, please? Oh, Ella.
not_available I have to work in the hospital.
not_available I'd come if I could, but I have to do a pancreaticojejunostomy at 9.
not_available No problem.
not_available I'll come another time.
not_available I promise.
not_available You have fun at the party.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks, Dave.
not_available I'll pick her up around 6.
not_available They'll be into their sugar rush by then.
not_available Marvelous.
not_available All right, girls.
not_available Love you.
not_available Bye.
not_available Bye.
not_available Do you think I could talk to the Infectious Disease department? It would be great to compare adherence statistics for HIV patients in Chicago.
not_available I could arrange that.
not_available And it would be helpful if I could spend time in your clinical lab.
not_available Though the chances of us getting one are remote I'd love to take a look at the current
not_available generation flow cytometer.
not_available Hand
not_available counting lymphocytes under a microscope is the best I can do now.
not_available I gotta check with Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Frank, have you seen Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Try the lounge.
not_available Be right back.
not_available Breakfast pirogi? His dedication to the staff and patients will be hard to 
not_available Kerry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Didn't mean to interrupt.
not_available You didn't.
not_available Have you seen Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available No.
not_available I just got on.
not_available Would you mind if Kem observed today? Yeah.
not_available She has her Master's degree in public health.
not_available That's no reason to punish her.
not_available Give the poor woman a credit card, Carter.
not_available Let her have some fun.
not_available I tried that.
not_available She would like to speak to the Public Health nurses see how we track communicable diseases.
not_available Sure.
not_available Maybe she can motivate some of these slackers.
not_available Frank, where's Lewis? 
not_available Got me.
not_available Okay, I want everybody in the lobby at 9 for the dedication.
not_available What dedication? Theyre renaming the hospital Romano Memorial.
not_available Not kidding.
not_available Where's Kem? Do the patients with sexually transmitted infections get routine HIV testing? Sometimes.
not_available Depends on the doctor.
not_available Do you refer them to your STI clinic? 
not_available I don't think we have one.
not_available You talked to Dr.
not_available Weaver? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available She said everything's fine.
not_available Kem's gonna be hanging out today.
not_available Why? Morning, folks.
not_available Ridealong? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Interns have to do paramedic ride
not_available alongs twice a year.
not_available Lets them see real medicine.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available You might want a couple steroids before lifting this one, doc.
not_available a flight of stairs complains of back and diffuse abdominal pain.
not_available Frank, did any labs come back on the Gorham kid? Frank? You all right? 
not_available I think I'm having a heart attack.
not_available Are you kidding? 
not_available Do I look like I'm kidding? Okay, here.
not_available Here, sit down.
not_available Sit down.
not_available I need some nitro over here.
not_available That feels a lot better.
not_available You know, I bet it was just those breakfast pirogis.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey, check you out, Mr.
not_available GQ.
not_available What, you have a deportation hearing? Have another pirogi, Frank.
not_available Luka, could use a set of hands here.
not_available I'm not on.
not_available Just for the transfer.
not_available Where's Dr.
not_available Lewis? Did you check the oncall room? 
not_available She was sleeping.
not_available Are you kidding? She didn't feel well.
not_available Do you need something? Yeah.
not_available I need someone to run the department.
not_available Can't help you there.
not_available Hey, Susan.
not_available The Medical Executive Committee has authorized a nationwide search to look for Romano's replacement.
not_available Until we can find a suitable candidate, we'd like you to step in.
not_available Kerry, thank you for the vote of confidence, but I I'll pass.
not_available I'm going home.
not_available It's an extra 3 grand a month.
not_available Do med students qualify? 
not_available I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested.
not_available Why not? I'm pregnant.
not_available Cleanup on aisle five.
not_available I'll phone upstairs as soon as I'm done here.
not_available Please let me sit up.
not_available I can't catch my breath.
not_available You got too much weight on your chest.
not_available We need to get an x
not_available ray of your neck.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We can use the NEXUS criteria.
not_available If he's alert and sober without any focal neural deficits distracting injury or neck pain, then he's low risk for a C
not_available spine fracture.
not_available Any pain in here, sir? 
not_available No.
not_available What are you doing here today? I'm giving a lecture to students on clinical decision
not_available making without the use of ancillary tests.
not_available Look towards me.
not_available Now look at Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Any pain there? 
not_available No.
not_available That's cool.
not_available Our health
not_available care system requires us to diagnose with a minimum of tests.
not_available Maybe Kem can sit in on your lecture.
not_available She's doing a little recon in the hospital today.
not_available I never taught in a classroom.
not_available Oh, you're a natural.
not_available Okay, his neck's clear.
not_available Let's sit him up.
not_available Ready? One, two, three, go.
not_available HemoCue's 12.8.
not_available Trauma labs drawn.
not_available This is exactly what I'm talking about.
not_available All he needs is a CBC and UA.
not_available Abdominal pain meets trauma guidelines.
not_available I'm sending a panel.
not_available There's no rebound or guarding.
not_available He doesn't need LFTs, amylase.
not_available Doesn't need to be typed and crossed.
not_available Nurses follow protocols.
not_available They're unnecessary.
not_available You know what? Save the lectures for your med students.
not_available The nurses don't want to hear it.
not_available Weaver says to get your butts in the lobby pronto.
not_available Dr.
not_available Robert Romano was a fixture in this hospital for years.
not_available His dedication to the staff and patients will be hard to forget.
not_available And his generosity continues even now.
not_available Hey, how you doing? 
not_available Very good, thank you.
not_available A significant portion of Dr.
not_available Romano's estate was left to this hospital to further our service of this community.
not_available And to that end, I am pleased to announce the creation of the Robert Romano Center for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Healthcare.
not_available This new facility will provide the latest in health services to those patients and their families.
not_available She didn't.
not_available Oh, yes, she did.
not_available All right, that's it.
not_available Back to work.
not_available Pratt, you missed your appointment 
not_available with Bob Harris in Risk Management.
not_available I was busy.
not_available I got you another appointment in 30 minutes.
not_available Don't be late.
not_available Is it just me, or do the eyes seem to follow you? Was Romano's prosthetic arm destroyed in the accident? Why? 
not_available Because if it wasn't it's gonna hunt Dr.
not_available Weaver down and strangle her.
not_available He wasn't a big supporter of gay rights? 
not_available No.
not_available Not really.
not_available That's too creepy.
not_available Did I miss the dedication? More like post
not_available mortem payback.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available All right, looks clear to me.
not_available What do you think? I think we should discuss it over dinner.
not_available Really? You like Moroccan? 
not_available I'll eat just about anything.
not_available Pratt! Approximately 20year
not_available old male, feet versus tree at 30 miles per hour.
not_available Was he thrown from a car? This thing is frozen.
not_available His buddies wrapped him up, tied him to a toboggan and sent him down a hill.
not_available He bounced off the tree and wound up in a creek.
not_available I can palpate a decent carotid, but we can't get his arm out for a BP.
not_available It looks like bilateral foot fracture.
not_available We may have a spinal injury.
not_available Maybe we should get Carter.
not_available What's wrong with you? Come find me later.
not_available Get 10 liters of warm irrigation solution so we can throw off this blanket.
not_available And let's cut off this tape so we can do a proper assessment.
not_available I hate this time of year.
not_available We must get 30 slipand
not_available fall calls a week.
not_available Right, Bardelli? 
not_available At least.
not_available Here's an idea.
not_available If it's icy, and you're old, don't go outside.
not_available Save yourself a broken hip.
not_available I told you what would happen if you didn't listen.
not_available You call 911 for paramedics? Feel like a threat? 
not_available Screw you! Hello? Someone hurt in there? Stop it! You're hurting me.
not_available Stop! I'll call the police.
not_available Hold on.
not_available What are we doing? We need to get in.
not_available Not till the police get here.
not_available What if he's hurting her? We wait for the cops.
not_available EMT got shot last year going in without backup.
not_available Open the door! Leave me alone! Just shut up! Just shut up for five minutes! You enter two pages of demographics for every patient that walks in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available What do you do with the information? That's really up to the Public Health geeks.
not_available Do you use it to track down patients who leave without being seen? You have to ask one of the docs.
not_available So how many people leave without seeing a doctor? Look, lady, I just work here.
not_available What kind of training do you need for this job? Dr.
not_available Weaver, do you know how many patients leave without medical attention? How about calling off this grand inquisition? 
not_available Somewhere around 5 percent.
not_available Some of us are trying to work here.
not_available Hi.
not_available I just got off the phone with Dr.
not_available Farina.
not_available Someone's gonna phone me back about letting you take a tour of the lab.
not_available That's great.
not_available You wanna catch Luka's lecture? I'll just have you paged.
not_available Luka didn't seem too keen on the idea.
not_available He's shy.
not_available He'll appreciate the interest.
not_available Kerry are we truly to believe that Robert left a substantial donation to establish a gay and lesbian centre? Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered.
not_available Whatever the hell that means.
not_available The actual designation was left to the discretion of the board.
not_available This is the one area where we felt that County was truly lacking.
not_available Revenge is a dish best served cold.
not_available Morales, the police are here, man.
not_available Come on.
not_available Just relax, man.
not_available Listen, there's a woman inside.
not_available It sounds like she's being killed.
not_available This is the police department.
not_available Open the door.
not_available Get out of here! This is my apartment! 
not_available Back up.
not_available Back up.
not_available Stop! Sit down, sir! Sit down! 
not_available She tripped.
not_available Ma'am, are you okay? 
not_available He pushed me.
not_available She's drunk.
not_available She tripped.
not_available Sit down now, sir! 
not_available You're the drunk, you liar.
not_available You better take a look at her.
not_available I'm gonna kill you.
not_available Bitch.
not_available Quiet down.
not_available I swear to God I'll kill you.
not_available Enough of that.
not_available It's all your fault.
not_available Patients with peripheral vertigo do not require CT scanning.
not_available What clinical test will diagnose BPPV? Anyone? Sheila? Could you repeat that last part? 
not_available Come on, guys.
not_available Positional test for vertigo.
not_available Rectal temp is 87.
not_available 6.
not_available I think he's coming around.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Doug.
not_available You want to tell me what happened? Talk to me.
not_available Hockey initiation.
not_available I'm cold.
not_available We're working on that.
not_available Pleural lavage with bilateral chest tubes? 
not_available No, let's do external rewarming.
not_available He's groggy and under 89 degrees.
not_available That's criteria for active rewarming.
not_available He's progressing.
not_available Get a warming blanket, heated IV fluids, and heated 02.
not_available What happen to him? 
not_available Doug's friends took him sledding and he wound up swimming.
not_available Temp, Rest of the vitals? 
not_available BP is good, 112/78.
not_available Pulse, 106.
not_available Sinus tach on the monitor.
not_available Films? 
not_available Bilateral calcaneal fractures.
not_available And a compression fracture of L5.
not_available Doug, can you wiggle your toes? Can you wiggle your toes, Doug? Let's get an MRI to rule out spinal
not_available cord injury.
not_available No.
not_available Lumbar compression fractures almost never have cord involvement.
not_available He can't move his toes.
not_available It's from the frostbite.
not_available Try some warm
not_available water immersion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available DTRs are 2 plus and equal.
not_available How's the rectal temp? 
not_available Pretty normal.
not_available Good.
not_available Sacral nerves are intact.
not_available S2, 3, 4 keeps the poop off the floor.
not_available Sensory loss in his toes.
not_available The distribution of a dermatome.
not_available Warm up the toes and reassess.
not_available No MRI.
not_available I can't feel my toes.
not_available We're warming them up, Doug.
not_available No, I can't feel anything.
not_available What's happening? You broke both your heels and a vertebrae.
not_available What, my back's broken? 
not_available It's a compression fracture.
not_available Your legs took most of the impact.
not_available So am I paralyzed? 
not_available We're still waiting.
not_available No, am I paralyzed? Just tell me.
not_available Get the MRI.
not_available Look, can you call my dad? Can somebody call my dad? 
not_available But Dr.
not_available Carter said
not_available Just do it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, you're a hard man to track down.
not_available Bob Harris.
not_available I'm with the Risk Management department.
not_available I can't talk now.
not_available I realize you're busy.
not_available I need you to write up your recollections of a case regarding an MVA patient, Martin Brodie.
not_available He suffered from
not_available Ankylosing spondylitis.
not_available The disease turned the guy's neck into a breadstick.
not_available Were the injuries from the car accident exacerbated by his condition? He came in having trouble breathing.
not_available I tried to help.
not_available And there were complications.
not_available Look, I snapped the guy's neck.
not_available Now he's a quadriplegic.
not_available The insurance settlement on this one is gonna be in the millions.
not_available Do you have any idea how much 24/7 nursing care in a state facility costs? Martin Brodie's a 19year
not_available old boy looking at what? Forty, 50 more years of total paralysis.
not_available Have your notes on my desk by 9 a.
not_available m.
not_available See you, bitch.
not_available Pupils equal and reactive.
not_available I hope he rots in jail.
not_available Pulse, 105.
not_available BP, 118/82 with decent sats around 94 percent.
not_available Smells like her blood alcohol's the same.
not_available From what I can tell, these lacerations are superficial and both her lungs are up.
not_available Is there any chest pain? Belly pain? 
not_available Hey, Amy, stay with us.
not_available Where did he go? 
not_available He's been arrested.
not_available Listen, she's gonna need a head CT.
not_available Keep her on the monitor, stand by with a tube in case she starts to go south.
not_available Wait.
not_available Do you hear something? Sounds like a kid crying.
not_available Wait! Wait, wait! It's just a kid.
not_available It's just a kid.
not_available Drop the gun, son.
not_available I thought you were my dad.
not_available With a normal neurologic exam and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 you do not need a head CT, and you save $2000 in health
not_available care costs.
not_available We do about10 unnecessary scans a day.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available The costs to procure and maintain the CT scanner are relatively fixed, am I right? Yeah.
not_available So if you eliminated half the scans wouldn't that then double the costs of the tests you did do? I mean, there'd be no real savings in health
not_available care dollars and the patient would be billed twice as much.
not_available Wouldn't the real solution be to have several hospitals share one scanner? Did you send Mrs.
not_available Wintermute to Radiology? 
not_available No.
not_available I sent her home.
not_available What about her abdominal pain? It was more discomfort than pain.
not_available Her husband's been off work with a workers' comp claim.
not_available Her son moved home with his daughter 
not_available while going through a divorce.
not_available What, you get her whole family history? Half the people that come in here just wanna talk to somebody.
not_available How's your son doing? Fine.
not_available He hasn't given himself a thoracotomy.
not_available That's good news.
not_available He'll probably end up a brain surgeon.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Or a grave robber.
not_available You're a glasshalffull kind of guy, huh? Hey, how's the teaching going? 
not_available Ask Kem.
not_available She seems to be doing most of the talking.
not_available Yeah.
not_available She can be a little inquisitive.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll talk to her.
not_available Don't these patients have primarycare doctors? There's a three
not_available month wait to be seen at the clinic.
not_available Hello, Mrs.
not_available Lemonier.
not_available I'm Neela.
not_available I don't speak good English.
not_available Can you tell me what's wrong? Why you're here? 
not_available My children are sick.
not_available You don't sound very well yourself.
not_available She's from Haiti.
not_available Do you recognize that? Pneumonitis? 
not_available It sounds like pertussis.
not_available Whooping cough, really? 
not_available Hey, there you are.
not_available John, I think this woman has pertussis.
not_available Is that possible? Yeah.
not_available We get the odd case.
not_available In Chicago? How's the lecture going? 
not_available Interesting.
not_available Luka's an excellent teacher.
not_available I should get back, but I think Neela needs a translator.
not_available I think we can probably manage that.
not_available Dr.
not_available Farina is ready to give you a tour of the Infectious Disease department.
not_available What about the lecture? 
not_available I think he'll understand.
not_available Hey, Neela, can you take Kem up to five west? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available If you see Luka, tell him I'm sorry 
not_available I missed the rest of his lecture.
not_available Find me when you're done.
not_available Check out that woman.
not_available Is that the domestic? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Superficial lacs, maybe a broken arm.
not_available We got a kid too.
not_available He almost shot Gallant's head off.
not_available So how are you liking Chicago? It's very nice.
not_available How long have you been here? 
not_available I've been in America for seven years.
not_available Chicago for the last three.
not_available Do you like it? I still feel like I'm getting settled in, but it's quite pleasant for a big city, really.
not_available Although it's not quite London.
not_available No.
not_available Or Paris.
not_available No.
not_available It's much more agreeable in the summer.
not_available A tad warmer too.
not_available That is good to know.
not_available And the people are friendly enough.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're larger than I expected, the people.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're quite fond of their giant portions here.
not_available Big Gulp, supersize, monster fries, all that.
not_available I saw a woman drinking a bucket of coffee this morning.
not_available Actually, that's quite common.
not_available Is this a MedSurg admit? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Let's run in a gram of Ancef too.
not_available No.
not_available I just wanna go home.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll see what we can do.
not_available How are we doing over here? That's okay, Rudy.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter's one of the good guys.
not_available He's gonna help out you and your mom.
not_available Physically, he's fine.
not_available How are you? My ears are still ringing, but I'm cool.
not_available Did you call DCFS? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Rudy, I'll be back in a little bit to check in on you and your mom, okay? Vitals Q 30 minutes and CBC in an hour and set up a suture set with 4
not_available 0 nylon.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Doug, how are you feeling? 
not_available Better.
not_available Warmer.
not_available Good.
not_available Where is he coming from? 
not_available MRI.
not_available I said he didn't need that.
not_available Pratt thought otherwise.
not_available Look, it's not my job to make sure your residents listen to you.
not_available I'm getting tired of doctors thinking that we work for them 
not_available or that they can tell us what to do.
not_available The patients think it works that way.
not_available I'm staying out of this conversation.
not_available What's with Kovac and his holierthan
not_available thou healing hand? I'm getting sick of that.
not_available Oh, I don't know.
not_available Those healing hands have their good points.
not_available Right, Abby? Did you go out with Kovac? 
not_available Briefly, yeah.
not_available And Carter? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Abby's the ER slut.
not_available I went out with two doctors in the five years that I've worked here.
not_available Hey, Abby.
not_available Are we still on for tonight? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Great.
not_available We're studying.
not_available And you shouldn't talk, Chuny.
not_available Kovac gets around.
not_available Our goal is to get all of our triplecombination
not_available therapy patients to an undetectable viral load.
not_available I'd be ecstatic just to be able to follow CD4 counts.
not_available Would it be possible for me to visit the AIDS ward? It would if we had one.
not_available Fifteen years ago we had an entire floor of AIDS patients.
not_available Now the few inpatients we care for are on the general medical service.
not_available We had a gentleman earlier in the week with Kaposi's but he was discharged yesterday.
not_available It is so different from what I deal with.
not_available I see thousands of deaths from opportunistic infections.
not_available Well, you're welcome to observe in the outpatient clinic.
not_available These are your AIDS patients? Breath sounds diminished on the left, I think.
not_available He has a scar over his fifth rib.
not_available From a chest tube.
not_available That's right.
not_available Some quack stuck one in me last year.
not_available You're not gonna do that, are you? 
not_available Not if we can help it.
not_available Did you send the human toboggan for an MRI? I was trying
not_available I told you it was unnecessary.
not_available The guy started freaking out.
not_available He was worried about paralysis.
not_available And you? 
not_available I was trying to be thorough.
not_available So was I.
not_available Next time you disagree with my orders, come and talk to me about it.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Okay.
not_available You ready to present this? Neela.
not_available Mr.
not_available Morgan is 64.
not_available He has Wegener's granulomatosis which is an inflammation of the respiratory tract.
not_available Vitals are in the normal range.
not_available He's only satting at 92? 
not_available He's not taking any deep breaths.
not_available Because it hurts like hell.
not_available I told you that already.
not_available Sounds like pleural effusion.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He needs to do a thoracentesis.
not_available I've already paged Pulmonology.
not_available That's good.
not_available As long as Mr.
not_available Morgan doesn't mind gasping for air until sometime tomorrow.
not_available Tomorrow? I could be dead by then.
not_available He's had a number of bronchoscopies.
not_available They put his lung down last year doing a thoracentesis and had to put in a chest tube.
not_available He'll be better off if they do it upstairs.
not_available He will? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Or you will? You send a guy for an MRI he doesn't need because you're worried about paralysis.
not_available Now you don't want a thoracentesis.
not_available So? So sounds to me like you're still a little gun
not_available shy 
from Breaking that kid's neck.
not_available The man has tons of scar tissue around his lung.
not_available Besides, a thoracentesis down here only opens him up for a risk of infection.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Neela, would you set me up for a thoracentesis, please? Betadine the chest.
not_available Load up a syringe with 1 percent of lido.
not_available I got this.
not_available I really don't mind doing it.
not_available I said, I got this.
not_available Mr.
not_available Morgan.
not_available We're gonna sit you up and drain some of the fluid 
not_available out of your lungs so you can breathe.
not_available It's about time.
not_available Does this guy know what he's doing? 
not_available You are in good hands.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And I'll be back in a little bit.
not_available I've been looking all over for you.
not_available Hey, you back already? 
not_available You should come and see this patient.
not_available Okay.
not_available How did it go with Dr.
not_available Farina? He was very nice and generous with his time and his data.
not_available But I'm still 10 years away from the results he's getting.
not_available Are you finished with Mr.
not_available Yarrow? Leg lac in 2? Yeah, he's good.
not_available Just wash out the wound give him a tetanus shot, Anything else? 
not_available That should do it.
not_available Have you ever heard of Echo Free? 
not_available Let me guess.
not_available Something that Kovac does instead of pain meds.
not_available No.
not_available It's a club on LaSalle.
not_available My friend deejays there.
not_available A bunch of us are going tonight if you don't mind hanging around with nurses.
not_available I don't think I'd be much good tonight.
not_available I'm having a bad day.
not_available All the more reason to go out with us.
not_available Nurses make people feel better all the time.
not_available Hey, Pratt.
not_available Pick up line six.
not_available Hey, take a message.
not_available It's Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available She's calling from Shoo Goo Kin Doo

not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Listen, it's not your fault, Jing
not_available Mei.
not_available You know that.
not_available A pulseless foot? You paged a surgeon? You just stay focused on getting your father better.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawson came and got him.
not_available No, no.
not_available I was talking to somebody else.
not_available Who? The radiologist took him down for an angiogram and wound up giving him angioplasty and putting in a stint.
not_available He's good.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available That's wonderful.
not_available Someone could have called to tell me I didn't need to come.
not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt, Mr.
not_available Morgan's dropped his pressure, 86/66.
not_available All right, look, I've gotta take this.
not_available Here, talk to Dr.
not_available Chen.
not_available Her mother just died.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get Bordetella PCR, pertussis serologies and a culture.
not_available Did you get all that? She has another kid? Eighteenmonth
not_available old.
not_available He's at home with her sick mother.
not_available Well, they both need to come in.
not_available They're both probably infected.
not_available The grandmother won't come.
not_available She doesn't trust American doctors.
not_available That's a problem.
not_available Can't treat them unless they come in.
not_available What if we go there? 
not_available This is America.
not_available We don't make house calls.
not_available Don't.
not_available What? You know what.
not_available I'm not leaving the hospital.
not_available Do you see how many patients I have? Okay, I mean it.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Gallant, I need you guys to make a run for me.
not_available I'd like to stick around with Rudy here.
not_available Just until DCFS shows up.
not_available After that, then.

not_available Sats, 78.
not_available It's a tension pneumo.
not_available Sixteen
not_available gauge Angiocath and Betadine.

not_available tube tray.
not_available Size 8.
not_available 5 gloves.
not_available Heart rate's dropping.
not_available Do you want a crash cart?

not_available ABCs.
not_available I know what the problem is.
not_available Treat it.
not_available No pulse.
not_available He's not breathing.
not_available Okay, bag him.
not_available I knew this was gonna happen.
not_available I wanted Pulmonology to do it.

not_available Chest tube is definitive.
not_available Pressure's 94/62.

not_available Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Hey, have you seen Pratt? 
not_available Nope.
not_available What about Kem? 
not_available I haven't seen her either.
not_available Maybe they're together.
not_available You need to keep better track of your woman, Carter.
not_available Hey, Chuny.
not_available Have you seen Pratt? 
not_available Sorry.
not_available We have rules too, you know.
not_available What are you talking about? What the hell's going on? 
not_available The paramedics needed a translator.
not_available You took her with you? 
not_available She's persuasive.
not_available She's febrile.
not_available She's also diabetic.
not_available Weak pulse and was already pretty out of it when we found her.

not_available I can't believe you would go out there.
not_available Temp, 40.
not_available 2.
not_available Accu

not_available How long's she had that? 
not_available Several months.
not_available Several months.
not_available She said people in the building are sick.
not_available You exposed yourself to them? Has she been coughing up anything? 
not_available Ectopy.
not_available Ma'am? Run in a liter wide open.
not_available Get a 12
not_available lead on her.
not_available BP's dropping, 92/56.
not_available Okay.
not_available She's septic and hypotensive.
not_available Let's mix up some dopamine, titrate to a systolic of 90 3.375 of Zosyn and 150 of gent.
not_available Pertussis is not a risk to my pregnancy.
not_available It could be TB.
not_available What am I exposed to back home? Why don't you go ask Mrs.
not_available Lemonier if her mother has any advance directives? You sure you two aren't married? Need a portable x
not_available ray.
not_available Get him in! Pratt! 
not_available I need another set of hands.
not_available I got a nasty head lac.
not_available Get a med student to do it.
not_available You need to sit down and roll up your sleeve, Louie.
not_available If you don't take your Epo shot, you're gonna get sick again.
not_available Do you want to end up in the hosp
not_available ? Hey, hey.
not_available Help! Security! Hey, Louie.
not_available Put her down, or I'm gonna call your mother.
not_available Now say you're sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Sorry.
not_available She didn't give me any gum.
not_available Well, that's no reason to pick her up.
not_available Here.
not_available Sit down and behave yourself.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Louie's a lifter.
not_available He likes to pick things up, including nurses.
not_available You have to give him gum before a shot.
not_available Now you tell me.
not_available Listen, about earlier, I don't want you to get the wrong idea about Luka.
not_available He's a good guy.
not_available I'm not looking for anything right now.
not_available Okay.
not_available I just thought you should know.
not_available Thank you.
not_available But independence works pretty good for me.
not_available Although I wouldn't mind some regular sex.
not_available No kidding.
not_available I'd settle for irregular sex.
not_available Can you help my husband? What's the problem? 
not_available It's my leg.
not_available Did you fall? 
not_available No, no.
not_available I think she shot me.
not_available Mom's sleeping off her bender.
not_available She got about 30 stitches.
not_available Her head CT was negative.
not_available Surgery wants to watch her overnight.
not_available BP's 110/78 after three liters.
not_available And her crit's 41.
not_available Good.
not_available If they discharge her in the morning why don't we keep the kid with her? DCFS won't let us do that.
not_available They'll wanna place him into foster care.
not_available It's only one night.
not_available Then we need to admit him.
not_available What? 
not_available He's looking a little dehydrated.
not_available Complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available Observe him overnight for a rule
not_available out appy.
not_available Look, if he was your kid? I'll start a chart.
not_available Hey, Rudy.
not_available I got good news.
not_available You and your mom can spend the night at my hospital tonight.
not_available You hungry? Anything I can get you? 
not_available They took my gun.
not_available Police took your father's gun because it's dangerous.
not_available You could hurt yourself or somebody else.
not_available How am I gonna protect my mom? Look, buddy, your dad he's going to jail for what he did.
not_available Okay? You don't have to be worried about him now.
not_available He'll get out.
not_available He always does.
not_available He turns off the lights so I can't see him hitting my mom or find the phone.
not_available But I can always hear him.
not_available Yo, Mike.
not_available Yeah, in a minute.
not_available We gotta roll, man.
not_available Look, I'll be back, okay? I promise.
not_available Everything'll be okay.
not_available No cardiac motion, no effusion or tamponade.
not_available Resume CPR.
not_available Zosyn is up.
not_available Another liter up.
not_available Another round of epi and atropine.
not_available Could be massive PE or Ml.
not_available Hypovolemia possible.
not_available Hypoxia possible.

not_available All right.
not_available Holding CPR.

not_available Clear.
not_available V
not_available fib.
not_available Clear.
not_available She's flatline.
not_available Wanna pace her? You ran it.
not_available You call it.
not_available Time of death, 5:48.
not_available I'm very sorry, ma'am.
not_available Maybe if she'd come in two weeks earlier, we could have 
not_available You ran a good code.
not_available Didn't help her any.
not_available Carter, Abby needs you in here.
not_available Two liters in.
not_available Pressure's up to 120 systolic.
not_available Gram of Ancef.
not_available Update his tetanus.
not_available What's up? You tell me.
not_available GSW with no exit wound, I can't find the bullet.
not_available Pelvic and chest films are clear.
not_available Maybe it migrated to the foot.
not_available I checked.
not_available But let's get a foot and a tib
not_available fib.
not_available I didn't even want a gun in the house.
not_available Now I know why.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available I didn't wanna use it.
not_available First HemoCue is 12.4.
not_available Frequent PVCs on the monitor.
not_available Repeat the HemoCue in 30 minutes.
not_available Sir, do you have any heart problems? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you use cocaine or crystal meth? 
not_available No, no.
not_available Bullet's in the right ventricle.
not_available Are you kidding me? 
not_available What is it? Did you find it? Bullet traveled up your femoral vein into the inferior vena cava into your heart.
not_available What is that? 
not_available Run of six, 100 of lidocaine.
not_available Can you get it out? 
not_available He'll need an operation.
not_available On his heart? 
not_available The bullet is irritating his heart.
not_available Right? Yeah.
not_available Let's page Corday and Cardiothoracic just to be safe.
not_available And rebolus 50 of lido in five.
not_available Help me roll him on his right side.
not_available Will that help it to come out? 
not_available No.
not_available That should keep the bullet from entering his lungs.
not_available Is that bad? 
not_available Don't want that to happen.
not_available You put a bullet in my heart? I shot you in the leg.
not_available It was an accident.
not_available You got this? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Paramedics ran over our ball.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it happens.
not_available So seven is my record.
not_available What? 
not_available We lost seven patients in one shift my second year of residency.
not_available That supposed to cheer me up? You know, when you first got here, you were 
not_available dangerous, reckless and arrogant.
not_available Is this your idea of a pep talk? Hey, we all get our confidence rattled.
not_available If you don't, you should worry.
not_available It means you've stopped caring.
not_available Believe me, you could do a lot more harm playing it safe.
not_available So we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.
not_available What do you want me to tell you? That everything's gonna be okay? That you're gonna get so good that nothing bad is ever gonna happen again? Forget it.
not_available This is what we do.
not_available If we're successful in our jobs, then patients live.
not_available And if we're not sometimes they die.
not_available Or wind up paralyzed.
not_available Did you do what you thought was best? Was there a chance that you might have been right? Afterwards, did you tell the kid what had happened? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Then quit feeling sorry for yourself.
not_available You're a good doctor.
not_available Start acting like it.
not_available Hey.
not_available How's the daughter? Better than I would be if I'd just seen my mother die.
not_available Are you angry with me? 
not_available No.
not_available But I didn't expect you to be doing paramedic ride
not_available alongs.
not_available Did you even eat lunch today? 
not_available I'll grab something.
not_available You need to eat properly.
not_available You treat the woman with pertussis? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? I think you'd better get out here.
not_available I don't know what they're saying.
not_available Who are "they"? They're Mrs.
not_available Lemonier's neighbors.
not_available I told everyone in the building they needed to be examined, possibly inoculated.
not_available You did? 
not_available Now you're angry.
not_available I'm not angry.
not_available Get everybody into Triage and round up as much pertussis vaccine as you can.
not_available Can I help? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I love you.
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available John, where's the man with the bullet in his heart? 
not_available He's gone.
not_available What, he's dead? 
not_available No, no.
not_available They took him upstairs.
not_available Who? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Lawson.
not_available Who the hell is this Dr.
not_available Lawson? He's the new invasive radiologist.
not_available I was supposed to pick my daughter up.
not_available I stayed late because I was paged.
not_available He wanted to do it so you didn't have to.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available You must be Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available That's right.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You got involved in this case how? I was downstairs.
not_available I saw his chest x
not_available ray.
not_available Well, I was the consulting surgeon.
not_available This is the second patient of mine you've poached today.
not_available Got it.
not_available Advancing the guide sheath and moving south.
not_available If there are options in treatment, we should present them to the patient so that he can hear the risks and benefits of both procedures.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought you'd appreciate having two fewer procedures to do today.
not_available The bullet's in the femoral vein.
not_available You can have your patient back now.
not_available What? 
not_available You can take him to the OR.
not_available For a cutdown.
not_available It's nice to finally meet you, Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I look forward to working together again soon.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Pratt.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
not_available You saved my life.
not_available Not really.
not_available I came in here a few hours ago with a broken back, and now I'm going home.
not_available You have a compression fracture of your vertebrae.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available But I'm not paralyzed.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're the best.
not_available Mom, can you hear me? Mom, wake up.
not_available Mom.
not_available Hey, little man.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available My mom won't wake up.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available The doctors just gave her something so she could sleep.
not_available I couldn't protect her.
not_available That's not your job.
not_available Yes, it is.
not_available She doesn't have anybody else to do it.
not_available Well, it says here you do a great job of taking care of your mom.
not_available Then why is she in the hospital? Well, you know, sometimes things happen that we have no control of.
not_available Bad things.
not_available Even when we do our best.
not_available But I think your mom's lucky to have somebody like you looking out for her.
not_available Your arm may hurt and may feel a little achy.
not_available But it'll pass.
not_available If it doesn't, you need to come back to the hospital.
not_available Hey, Luka, you busy? 
not_available No.
not_available You mind helping me examine patients? They all may have been exposed to pertussis.
not_available Why not.
not_available You don't mind? No.
not_available This at least I'm good at.
not_available Hey, Kem enjoyed your lecture.
not_available Yeah, she's the only one.
not_available I don't think I got through to any of the others.
not_available Maybe it's the accent.
not_available What the hell is this? These people may be infected with whooping cough.
not_available Then they should be seeing their primary
not_available care physician.
not_available From what I've seen, you are their primary
not_available care physician.
not_available Kem.
not_available If you don't give them medical care they won't seek treatment, and you'll have an epidemic on your hands.
not_available What Kem is trying to say is
not_available She doesn't need you interpreting.
not_available She's making herself perfectly clear.
not_available You got your work cut out for you.
not_available All right, do it, but do it quickly.
not_available From now on, no one is going to Africa.
not_available I'm tired of this Dr.
not_available Schweitzer routine.
not_available Did I say something wrong? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available Eighteenyear
not_available old Peter Spratt, took a hockey puck to the face.
not_available Looks like a mandible fracture.
not_available He swallowed teeth and blood.
not_available Okay, I got this.
not_available He's not moving enough air.
not_available His jaw is too busted to intubate.
not_available Let's get a 7
not_available 0 ET tube and Surgilube.
not_available I'm going nasal.
not_available Pratt? It's okay.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac showed me.
not_available Tachy at 112, sats are 92 and dropping.
not_available Apparently, somebody's been listening to you.
not_available I'm sorry I'm a little late.
not_available No worries.
not_available They're just watching a movie.
not_available Hi, Ella.
not_available Okay, time to go.
not_available Put your shoes on.
not_available It's almost over.
not_available How are the puppies? 
not_available Messy.
not_available But the kids had fun.
not_available You want a piece of cake? 
not_available No.
not_available I haven't had dinner.
not_available In that case, how about a slice of pizza? I'll even throw in a glass of wine.
not_available All right, then.
not_available So how was your pancakejuju thing? My what? 
not_available Your surgery.
not_available The operation you were doing this morning.
not_available Pancreaticojejunostomy? You made that up, didn't you? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Come on, admit it.
not_available You have the perfect job for getting out of things.
not_available Who's gonna argue with a surgeon? "I'm really sorry.
not_available I'd love to help you move, but I have to separate a pair of Guatemalan twins who are joined at the testes.
not_available " Actually, a pancreaticojejunostomy is a replumbing of the upper GI tract.
not_available That sounds painful.
not_available Can you get that from working out? 
not_available Because my shoulder's been killing me.
not_available I believe that's called old age.
not_available After I go to all the trouble of making you this nice dinner.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Cheers.
not_available Happy birthday.
not_available Hey, Rudy.
not_available How you doing, man? 
not_available Okay.
not_available You hungry? I went and picked us up some burgers and French fries because I am starving.
not_available I also got you this.
not_available All right, take it.
not_available So you don't ever have to worry about the lights going out.
not_available Busy.
not_available No kidding.
not_available How was your day? 
not_available It sucked.
not_available Yours? Same.
not_available About this morning
not_available Forget it.
not_available No.
not_available I know sometimes I can be overzealous.
not_available Is that? Is that the word? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Is that Croatian for "jerk"? I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't want to take my frustrations out on you.
not_available Sometimes I just feel very passionate.
not_available John! Want a bite? 
not_available No.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I thought we were going to dinner.
not_available We are.
not_available I'm just famished.
not_available I needed something to hold me over.
not_available All this? I couldn't decide.
not_available There was too much to choose from.
not_available I got Twinkies, Ho Hos, MoonPies.
not_available This is all junk food.
not_available I know.
not_available But it tastes so good.
not_available I must be getting cravings.
not_available All I can think about is chocolate.
not_available And sex.
not_available But I am so happy.
not_available Are you happy? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Thanks for letting me come to the hospital today.
not_available I love to watch you work.
not_available You were such a stud.
not_available Oh, stop it.
not_available It's all I could do to keep my hands off you.
not_available That's it.
not_available No more sugar for you.
not_available Can I come tomorrow? 
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Because Dr.
not_available Weaver said she'd fire me if you did.
not_available She didn't? 
not_available Actually, she did.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I should talk to her.
not_available No, please don't.
not_available No.
not_available What, did I do something wrong? Did I get in the way? Did I ask too many questions? I asked too many questions.
not_available Did I ask too many questions? 
not_available How many chocolate bars did you eat?
