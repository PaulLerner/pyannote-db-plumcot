not_available No, you cannot leave.
not_available Fainting can be a warning sign for heart attack, for stroke.
not_available I'll take my chances.
not_available Luka got me a job.
not_available Oh, he did? Is she, like, your girlfriend now? I got her a job, that's all.
not_available What was I thinking when I said I'd come back? You weren't.
not_available Reece has one father, and that's me.
not_available We both know that's not true, don't we? Four people are dead.
not_available I was their doctor, and I can't explain what happened.
not_available Well, the answer certainly isn't that you were euthanizing people.
not_available Am I being accused of something here? You wouldn't be the first angel of mercy to help end patients' suffering.

not_available Sign in.
not_available ActuallyWhere are our Tsheets? 
not_available I'm a new med student.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available You said that yesterday.
not_available Check in with the docs.
not_available Okay, thanks.
not_available Do you guys have a lostandfound box? 
not_available Somebody stole it.
not_available Excuse me, ma'am.
not_available Are you Dr.
not_available Carter? Lewis.
not_available I don't think he's in yet.
not_available And I'm not old enough to be a ma'am.
not_available I'm supposed to meet him around 8.
not_available You're a tad early.
not_available Yeah, it's my first day.
not_available I guess I was a little excited.
not_available You'll get over it.
not_available So Mr.
not_available Hopper, what seems to be the problem? I can't eat.
not_available I can't sleep.
not_available I just don't feel like myself.
not_available How long has this been going on? 
not_available A few weeks.
not_available Any stress? Family? Work? All my problems started when I met this girl at an after
not_available hours bar.
not_available She bit me.
not_available She bit you where? In the alley outside the clubNo, where on your body? 
not_available My neck.
not_available I'm pretty sure she was a vampire.
not_available That's a hickey.
not_available Is that a zygoma fracture? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available Are you Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Nope, Greene.
not_available I'm Michael Gallant.
not_available I'm supposed to be meeting Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You found the ER.
not_available That's half the battle.
not_available You called for surgical consult! 
not_available I changed my mind.
not_available After I got down here.
not_available He has rectal pain.
not_available Probably prostatitis.
not_available That's why I need to examine him.
not_available If it is an appy, he's probably going to need surgery.
not_available Somebody need a second opinion? 
not_available Nope.
not_available Yes! He has a 22yearold male with right
not_available sided tenderness.
not_available Who also says it burns when he pees.
not_available What's his urine and white count? 
not_available Still waiting.
not_available Usually you won't even come till labs are back.
not_available Fine.
not_available When it bursts, you can operate.
not_available Hey, Dr.
not_available Carter? 
not_available Kovac.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Elizabeth! What's going on? Isn't it obvious? 
not_available No.
not_available He calls for a surgical consult, then changes his mind the moment he sees it's me! 
not_available That's a bit egocentric, don't you think? They're afraid to have me treat their patients.
not_available You're being paranoid.
not_available Am I? Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Do you know where Dr.
not_available Carter is? 
not_available He should be here in a few minutes.
not_available Listen, I know you're really busy.
not_available If you say where he is, I could find him.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Sorry.
not_available How come there aren't any doughnuts? 
not_available No petty cash.
not_available There was 50 bucks in there yesterday.
not_available I need a psych consult.
not_available My patient thinks he's a vampire.
not_available Count Fred? Where is he? 
not_available Exam 2.
not_available Is there a nurse in with him? No, why? 
not_available He's a vampire.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available I mean, he drinks people's blood.
not_available You're kidding, right? That's nasty.
not_available But I volunteered to drive to the Royal Botanical Gardens fundraiser.
not_available I'm sorry, but there's just not much I can do about it.
not_available You can stop lying to me.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Did I miss something? 
not_available Yes, breakfast.
not_available Your grandmother's upset because the Jaguar's being serviced.
not_available For a week! What's wrong with it? 
not_available Yes, Alger.
not_available What's wrong with it? 
not_available They're waiting for a part.
not_available What part? 
not_available The ignition coil.
not_available Liar.
not_available He's holding me hostage.
not_available What's the matter with the Town Car? 
not_available I don't drive the Town Car.
not_available You shouldn't be driving anyway.
not_available That's why we have Alger.
not_available Having a driver was your grandfather's idea.
not_available Now that he's gone, it seems an unnecessary expense.
not_available He's just trying to look out for you.
not_available I'm a big girl.
not_available I don't need a chaperone.
not_available Oh, John, are you still planning to come with me to? Gamma! Nurses do most of the triaging, right? 
not_available Right.
not_available So maybe you could sneak me some minor cases.
not_available Maybe you could sit down read your orientation kit, and wait for Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Teaching Nicole to take blood pressure.
not_available Why? 
not_available It's part of her training.
not_available What training? 
not_available I'm learning to be a nurse's aide.
not_available Really? 
not_available Abby? No helmet.
not_available Alert at the scene.
not_available GCS
not_available 14.
not_available Any blood loss or seizure? 
not_available No.
not_available Okay, let's get him in Trauma 1.
not_available Nicole, come on.
not_available Me? 
not_available Yeah, it'll be good for you to watch.
not_available Must've taken a header off the skateboard.
not_available Bad scalp lac, hematoma, right peritemporal.
not_available Abby, show Nicole how to take a pulse ox.
not_available Put some gloves on.
not_available Can I watch? Why don't we sell tickets? You a med student? 
not_available Michael Gallant.
not_available Dr.
not_available Finch.
not_available Nice to meet you.
not_available Road rash all the way down the chest.
not_available Big abdominal bruise.
not_available BP's 90 over 60.
not_available Pulse, 115.
not_available Full trauma panel, lateral C
not_available spine, chest and pelvis.
not_available Jeremy, do you remember what happened? Right pupil is sluggish, slightly larger than the left.
not_available What's his pulse ox? 
not_available I can't get it.
not_available Abby? Make sure the fingernail has contact with that red light.
not_available No CSF or blood from the ears.
not_available and Neurosurg.
not_available Read the number off of this monitor.
not_available Decreased breath sounds on the right.
not_available 78.
not_available What? Pulse ox is 78 on 15 liters.
not_available Okay.
not_available Good job.
not_available What do you think? Hyper
not_available resonant on the right.
not_available Decreased breath sounds, low sats, hypotension.
not_available Tension pneumothorax, right? Yeah.
not_available I had a fainting spell, John.
not_available It happens.
not_available But it shouldn't happen.
not_available In my day, it was quite acceptable for a lady to swoon.
not_available There's a med student looking for you.
not_available I'm a little busy.
not_available Oh, hello, Mrs.
not_available Carter.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hi, Evan.
not_available Your mother's on her way.
not_available She found your inhaler in the laundry.
not_available Gam, will you sit up for me, put your legs over the end of the bed? Yes, John.
not_available You're not gonna make me do pushups, are
not_available ? Gam? Gamma? Gamma? Susan.
not_available Gamma, can you hear me? John? Okay.
not_available You're okay.
not_available I need to step out for a minute.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Checking orthostatics? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Is she anemic? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm sending her up for a tilt test.
not_available She might be dehydrated, it's probably nothing.
not_available Can I intubate? 
not_available Maybe next time.
not_available What am I looking at? Teenage skateboarder, tension pneumo on the left, with a head injury.
not_available Needs a central line.
not_available He's anterior.
not_available I can see the cords.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Okay, bag him, Nicole.
not_available Come on.
not_available One, two, three, squeeze.
not_available He did all this on a skateboard? 
not_available Trying a crazy stunt, no doubt.
not_available Good breath sounds.
not_available Probably has a depressed skull fracture.
not_available That's what they used to call a pingpong fracture? 
not_available Neurosurg is on the way.
not_available Pressure's dropping.
not_available Okay, he's bleeding somewhere.
not_available How much out in the chest tube? Less than a liter.
not_available First HemoCue is nine.
not_available Let's hang the O
not_available neg.
not_available Get him to O.R.
not_available Has he had Dilantin? Yeah.
not_available And 70 grams of mannitol.
not_available What about his head? Who are you? 
not_available Michael Gallant.
not_available You a trauma surgeon? You a med student? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Why don't you find something to do, all right? Let's get him ready to go.
not_available I'm in.
not_available I'll learn more here.
not_available You'll learn more with your eyes open and your mouth shut, okay? 
not_available He's got a point.
not_available What about his head? 
not_available Won't make a difference if he bleeds out in his chest first.
not_available Okay, let's move.
not_available You did good.
not_available Really? I was so scared.
not_available You get used to it.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You saved his life.
not_available Yeah, I hope so.
not_available Me too.
not_available I better go back to work.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Okay.
not_available What are you doing? What? What? This morning she was learning to take a BP, now she's in a trauma? 
not_available Yeah, she's learning.
not_available To be an aide, not a nurse.
not_available I know you don't like her, but
not_available That has nothing to do with this.
not_available It's inappropriate that she be in trauma and you know it.
not_available I just asked you to help her.
not_available That's not my job, Luka.
not_available Do you even realize what I do in there? You're not the only one trying to save that kid's life.
not_available I'm gonna go ahead and scrub in.
not_available I'll page Neurosurg again.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? Yeah? Yeah, are you Peter Benton? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Consider yourself served.
not_available Have a nice day.
not_available What was that about? Peter? 
not_available I'm being subpoenaed.
not_available For what case? Reece.
not_available Roger's suing for custody.
not_available So how extensive do you think his brain injury is? 
not_available It's too early to tell.
not_available How is he? The skateboarder.
not_available Is he gonna be okay? Are you his father? No.
not_available I'm David Hilliker.
not_available I called 911.
not_available Did you see what happened? Screwing around in the mall with buddies.
not_available Looked like he hit his head.
not_available Yeah.
not_available He wasn't wearing a helmet.
not_available Wouldn't be cool.
not_available Don't need helmets to drive a motorcycle in this state.
not_available Why a skateboard? 
not_available You got a little limp.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I twisted it chasing him and his buddy out of the mall.
not_available You should let us look at it.
not_available Come on.
not_available Ice pack and a couple beers, I'll be fine.
not_available Sit down.
not_available We just need to change the dressing.
not_available But Dr.
not_available Carter usually does that.
not_available I'm aware of that, but Dr.
not_available Carter's not here right now.
not_available We'll wait.
not_available I don't know when he'll be in.
not_available I'm very patient.
not_available Look, Sister.
not_available Helen.
not_available The sooner I change the bandage 
not_available I'm Monica.
not_available the sooner you guys can get out of here and get back to doing your stuff.
not_available And, quite frankly, I need the bed.
not_available Perhaps if you told Dr.
not_available Carter we were here? 
not_available Your fans are getting restless.
not_available What is it with you and nuns, Carter? It's almost kinky.
not_available Can you take care of them for me? 
not_available They're looking for you.
not_available My grandmother had a She passed out this morning.
not_available Having Cardiology work her up.
not_available Is she okay? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Are you? 
not_available Me? I'm fine.
not_available Just wanna see she gets settled.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come on, ladies.
not_available Tequila Willie is still in Exam 1, covered in puke and assorted body fluids.
not_available He's making this whole place reek.
not_available This place always reeks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And it's Abby's turn.
not_available Oh, come on.
not_available I did him last time.
not_available You're up.
not_available Fine.
not_available Nicole.
not_available You need something? Yeah, grab some gloves.
not_available I'm gonna show you how to bathe a patient.
not_available Robert! I was scrubbing in when I discovered Dale's doing my Whipple.
not_available Yeah, he's an arrogant ass, but he's becoming a decent surgeon.
not_available I thought I was back on service today.
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Why not? I've complied with every insulting, demeaning request.
not_available Even volunteered for a lie detector test.
not_available But we have to wait for the CDC to finish with their bug hunt.
not_available But the criminal investigation is essentially over.
not_available Couldn't find anything.
not_available What's that mean? "We think you're killing your patients, we just can't prove it?" 
not_available This has nothing to do with you.
not_available Then why am I not in surgery? I'm sorry.
not_available I know this is frustrating.
not_available But what choice does either one of us have? Take the opportunity to catch up with your dictation.
not_available Spend time with your baby.
not_available Enjoy the downtime.
not_available What are you doing? Excuse me? 
not_available That's my patient.
not_available Drawing blood.
not_available No, you were injecting something into her central line.
not_available I couldn't get a draw.
not_available It's clogged.
not_available What did you inject into my patient? 
not_available I didn't.
not_available Don't lie to me! I saw you! Is there a problem here? No, I was
not_available Yes.
not_available She was injecting my patient.
not_available Urokinase to bust the clot in her line.
not_available Let me see it.
not_available Where's the vial? Elizabeth.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Twenty
not_available six years with the Chicago P.D.
not_available Never fired my gun once.
not_available That's good.
not_available These are different times.
not_available Try and stay off your ankle and keep it elevated.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kovac, Jeremy's mother's here.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll have one of the nurses give you a lesson on using the crutches.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Norris? Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Kovac.
not_available I was the first doctor to treat your son.
not_available How is he? 
not_available He suffered a hemothorax.
not_available That's when blood collects in the chest cavity and collapses a lung.
not_available But it's been repaired.
not_available Can I see him? 
not_available He's been taken up to the O.R.
not_available But he's gonna be okay.
not_available There was evidence of a head injury.
not_available Is he in a coma? I'm afraid we won't know until he's out of surgery and the anesthesia wears off.
not_available There's the idiot who was chasing him, right there.
not_available Are you the boy's mother? What did you do? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available I'm sorry
not_available He threw his stick at him.
not_available What? 
not_available You should get back in bed.
not_available No, he's the one who made Jeremy wipe out.
not_available Your boy was riding in the mall.
not_available I asked him to leave.
not_available You knocked him off his skateboard! I didn't! You attacked my son? No! You did! Can you put him in the room? What'd you do? Nothing! I called the ambulance! 
not_available Where is it? Last door on the right.
not_available He hurt my son? 
not_available I don't know, ma'am.
not_available He's the reason Jeremy's here.
not_available He should be arrested or something! I just wanna see Jeremy.
not_available I just wanna be with my son.
not_available I'll get an update and find out when you can go to see him, okay? I think he's having a heart attack! 
not_available Good! He started hyperventilating and complaining of chest pain.
not_available What's going on, Mr.
not_available Hilliker? 
not_available I don't feel so good.
not_available Chest hurts? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Head is spinning.
not_available Okay, put him on oxygen, aspirin and let's get an EKG.
not_available I didn't mean to upset the mother.
not_available I was just trying to offer my condolences.
not_available Just relax.
not_available He rode by me.
not_available He stole my hat.
not_available He was tossing it back and forth, threatening to throw it in the fountain.
not_available They were terrorizing the mall.
not_available Did you throw your nightstick at him? Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Dr.
not_available Zogoiby.
not_available Dr.
not_available Corday.
not_available I've been reviewing charts and I have a question about a patient you worked on with me.
not_available Yes? 
not_available It was a few weeks ago.
not_available A Mrs.
not_available Taylor? I'm having a little difficulty reading your notes.
not_available You put in a central line.
not_available No, I was called away.
not_available That was the day my son fell off the monkey bars at school.
not_available The on
not_available call anesthesiologist stepped in for me.
not_available And who was that? 
not_available Babcock.
not_available Babcock.
not_available Hope this wasn't a waste of time.
not_available Think this kid'll ever wake up? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You're scaring me.
not_available You're not your usual jolly self today.
not_available Haven't developed a drug addiction or drinking problem like your buddies in the ER, have you? 
not_available No.
not_available Give it time.
not_available Jeremy's mother is in the waiting room.
not_available Great.
not_available Jacy, have you tracked down my sister yet? 
not_available I left another message.
not_available All right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You want me to talk to her? 
not_available No.
not_available Good.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Norris.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available I'm one of the surgeons that was with Jeremy.
not_available How is he? 
not_available We tied off the bleeding vessels in the chest, but there's swelling in the brain.
not_available He's with a neuro team now.
not_available With an injury like this, it becomes a 
not_available A waiting game.
not_available Waiting? To see if he wakes up? Waiting to see if he's a vegetable? What? All of that.
not_available They've got to be able to do something.
not_available He's all I've got.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ever gotten an erythropoietic porphyria? 
not_available No.
not_available What about porphyria cutanea tarda? 
not_available No.
not_available The most unusual medical case you've ever seen? I had a guy with a live bullfrog in his ass once.
not_available Ever seen a patient scratch through the skin into the bone? Are you serious? 
not_available Figure he'll hit gray matter by spring.
not_available Mr.
not_available Eldon, could you show a young med student your itch? 
not_available Save me.
not_available What? I have a med student who is in need of a home.
not_available No, thanks.
not_available But he seems nice.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available Of course he does.
not_available That's how they all start, till they grow up to become Residents like Carter.
not_available I wish.
not_available What? 
not_available "I wish"? He turned into a good doctor.
not_available He is.
not_available You and Carter? Dr.
not_available Greene, can I ask you something? I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Not at all.
not_available You don't mind me asking all these questions, do you? Of course not.
not_available This is a teaching hospital.
not_available This is how you learn.
not_available Bye.
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available I was just talking about you.
not_available How's your grandmother? What is it? Looks like Shy
not_available Drager.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available They've been having a lot of success with fludrocortisone and desmopressin.
not_available How'd she take it? 
not_available I haven't told her yet.
not_available They're still running some tests.
not_available Anything I can do? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Let me know.
not_available I will.
not_available Carter! Dr.
not_available John Carter, this is your new med student, Michael 
not_available Gallant.
not_available Hi.
not_available Go get the orientation package, when you're finished just come find me.
not_available I did that while I was waiting.
not_available I try to keep busy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I had a family emergency.
not_available Nothing serious, I hope.
not_available You wanna talk about it? Okay.
not_available Well, I watched a trauma already and helped Dr.
not_available Kovac with a possible Ml.
not_available Both of which were very interesting.
not_available But I was hoping that once you got here I could start working up some of my own cases.
not_available He stepped into the men's room.
not_available His grandmother's sick.
not_available Do you want to see if we can go find you a case to work up? Yeah.
not_available Kit.
not_available I want to apologize for my behavior earlier.
not_available It was completely unprofessional.
not_available I know it's not an excuse, but I have been under a lot of stress lately.
not_available I understand.
not_available That said, I also have a couple of questions about some recent cases.
not_available Do you remember a Mr.
not_available Durning? 
not_available Diverticulitis? No, he was an elderly gentleman, came in for a hemicolectomy for colon cancer.
not_available With all the faded Navy tattoos.
not_available Yes, yes.
not_available You took out his central line on October the 16th.
not_available Yes.
not_available Well, no.
not_available It came out on the 16th.
not_available But we didn't do it.
not_available Babcock did.
not_available Babcock? Why Babcock? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available He just did.
not_available Sometimes he likes to pull his own lines.
not_available In fact, occasionally he insists on it.
not_available So Mrs.
not_available Reynolds, how long have you had the spots? 
not_available About a week.
not_available I gave her some penicillin.
not_available Oh, for what? 
not_available I got a cold.
not_available Cough, sore throat, headaches.
not_available Antibiotics won't help.
not_available I told you.
not_available Where'd you get the penicillin? The medicine cabinet.
not_available Left over from an ear infection.
not_available Oh, yeah, you should never share prescriptions.
not_available If you're given one, try to use all of it.
not_available What's wrong? She's experiencing hypersensitivity vasculitis.
not_available It's from the antibiotics.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Kevorkian.
not_available Is it treatable? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available We'll get some medicine for you and have you feeling as good as new.
not_available You might wanna get a CBC.
not_available I beg your pardon? Her history.
not_available It could be indicative of undiagnosed thrombocytopenia.
not_available You know, low platelets.
not_available And you are? Grace.
not_available I'm a second
not_available year med student.
not_available Ask if she has any unusual bleeding when she brushes her teeth.
not_available Are you a med student at this hospital? 
not_available No.
not_available I'd appreciate it if you kept your comments to yourself.
not_available Hello.
not_available Is he your student? Excuse me? She's a second
not_available year med student who thinks she can diagnose my patients.
not_available He takes a lousy history.
not_available I will bet your lunch money she's got thrombocytopenia.
not_available She's right.
not_available Low platelets.
not_available Needs additional labs, head CT and admission.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available So do you do self
not_available diagnosis too? As a matter of fact, I do.
not_available I've let myself get a little rundown and I can feel the flu coming on.
not_available I can't afford to be sick now.
not_available I was hoping you'd get me a little Relenza or Tamiflu.
not_available We can manage that.
not_available What school are you in? Western and Binville.
not_available I'm getting my law degree simultaneously.
not_available Really? My parents didn't want me to go to med school.
not_available I know that feeling.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Can you get a head CT for Mrs.
not_available Reynolds in Curtain 2? I'm not a nurse.
not_available I'm just training.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I'm sort of in training myself.
not_available I'm a new med student, Michael.
not_available Nicole.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Oh, okay.
not_available Everybody helping you? Abby showed me how to bathe 
not_available a homeless man.
not_available It was a little
not_available Abby is pretty busy.
not_available Stick with Malik and Haleh.
not_available Is this Mr.
not_available Hilliker's 12lead? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Did he have an MI? No.
not_available Probably just an anxiety attack.
not_available Want to give him the good news? 
not_available Can I? Yeah.
not_available I've got a trauma coming in.
not_available We're gonna need some IV saline.
not_available It's in the suture room.
not_available Okay.
not_available It can get a little crazy here.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available It's only my first day.
not_available Are you liking it? 
not_available So far, so good.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Go! Go and get somebody! Take a breath, Mr.
not_available Hilliker.
not_available Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Hang on.
not_available Hang on.
not_available Hey, Gam.
not_available Sorry this is taking so long.
not_available Did you get some lunch? 
not_available No.
not_available I didn't get anything.
not_available That cardiologist has never been back to see me.
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's because I asked to speak to you first.
not_available Why? It's the least I can do, since you've been stuck here all day.
not_available John, don't beat around the bush.
not_available You have what's called Shy
not_available Drager Syndrome.
not_available It's a progressive disease that affects your blood pressure and could put you at a greater risk for a heart attack or stroke.
not_available Is it gonna kill me? Most people die within 10 years.
not_available Ten years? I'm not even sure I want to be around 10 more years.
not_available Ten days, now, that might have put a kink in my plans.
not_available GamCan I go home? 
not_available I think they want you to stay overnight.
not_available John, I want to go home.
not_available You on a break? 
not_available No.
not_available Can I get you a coffee? 
not_available No, thanks.
not_available Do you want to talk? Is he going to die? The guy that hung himself? No.
not_available Well, not today.
not_available He's lucky you and that med student walked in.
not_available Try not to let it upset you too much.
not_available Once in a while some freak tries to off himself in the hospital.
not_available I wish they would just do it at home.
not_available My father hung himself.
not_available I was only 8.
not_available He'd lost another job.
not_available I found him in the kitchen.
not_available I was too little to do anything.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Does Luka know this? 
not_available No.
not_available I never told him.
not_available I never told anyone.
not_available I don't think I can do this.
not_available Well, it's not always this bad.
not_available Look at me.
not_available I'm crying like a baby.
not_available We've all cried.
not_available Sometimes it's the only thing you can do.
not_available I went through my charts.
not_available I found another commonality to all my post
not_available op infection mortalities.
not_available What am I looking for? 
not_available I highlighted his name.
not_available Babcock? Yeah.
not_available He was in every case.
not_available I only missed it before because he stepped in for Dr.
not_available Zogoiby, whose handwriting is illegible.
not_available Dr.
not_available Babcock is gonna have a date with your friend from the health department.
not_available Phone call, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Take a message.
not_available He knew I was being investigated.
not_available Why didn't he step forward, say something? Maybe he didn't want to be probed or forced to give stool samples.
not_available I'm being serious.
not_available Who knows what he's working with in his lab.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available That's Rachel's school.
not_available They need you to pick her up.
not_available Is she all right? 
not_available She got suspended.
not_available For what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available That's not my business.
not_available Suspended? 
not_available It must be some kind of mistake.
not_available Probably drug
not_available related.
not_available You better go.
not_available I'll deal with this.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Pulse ox is 98 on 50%.
not_available Good.
not_available Mr.
not_available Hilliker, we had to put a tube down your throat to help you breathe.
not_available I'm gonna take it out now, okay? I want you to take some deep breaths.
not_available When I say blow, I want you to blow as hard as you can.
not_available Ready? Okay, blow.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Try not to speak, Mr.
not_available Hilliker.
not_available Take some deep breaths.
not_available Tell him.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Hilliker.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Just relax.
not_available He doesn't want us to tell the police.
not_available He's still got buddies on the force.
not_available I'm afraid we have to.
not_available It's gonna be okay, Mr.
not_available Hilliker.
not_available It's gonna be okay.
not_available His wife died last year.
not_available What? Breast cancer.
not_available He was a respected and decorated police officer.
not_available Only reason he took the job at the mall was so that he could still help people.
not_available Why are you telling me this? 
not_available I just thought you should know.
not_available Keep an eye on his vitals and call for a psych consult.
not_available 100.8.
not_available Feels like 108.
not_available BP is 140 over 80.
not_available And your white count is 14,000.
not_available You're a little anemic.
not_available are anemic.
not_available My diagnosis is you're a little rundown.
not_available Maybe it's time to pick a career.
not_available Medicine beats law any day.
not_available My parents will only pay for med school if I graduate law school.
not_available If your parents are both attorneys, why don't you have any health insurance? I have a sad and complicated relationship with them that you couldn't understand.
not_available I might surprise you.
not_available You need to take better care of yourself, Grace.
not_available You need to eat right, get plenty of sleep and lay off the caffeine
not_available I would if I could.
not_available I haven't had eight hours' sleep in months.
not_available Do you think you could get me some Halcion? 
not_available I don't think so.
not_available Just one dose.
not_available I mean Today is shot for me.
not_available If I could just go home and crash.
not_available Please? I diagnosed your student's patient.
not_available This is a one
not_available time special treatment and only if you promise to do the other things we talked about.
not_available Cross my heart.
not_available What are the EKG findings for hyperkalemia? Peaked T waves, prolonged PR and short QT intervals.
not_available You're good.
not_available Hey.
not_available Your day getting any better? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Did you talk to your grandmother? How did she take it? It didn't bother her.
not_available She went home.
not_available You let her drive? 
not_available No.
not_available Her driver picked her up.
not_available You have to notify the DMV.
not_available I didn't tell her that.
not_available Dying's one thing.
not_available Not driving is another story.
not_available You have to mail in the notice.
not_available I didn't see her as an ER patient.
not_available I brought her in.
not_available It's the law.
not_available I can't rat out my own grandmother.
not_available You want me to? She doesn't like me.
not_available Carter! Your patient went down.
not_available What happened? 
not_available She must have vagalled.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's get the gurney.
not_available Whoa All right, come on.
not_available I need to talk.
not_available Somebody took target practice on a crossing guard.
not_available I gotta plug her up.
not_available It's rather important.
not_available Well, give me the Cliff Notes.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available I'd prefer to have your full attention.
not_available Suit yourself.
not_available Are you joining us, Elizabeth? No.
not_available I'm afraid not.
not_available If you could have your assistant page me when you're done, please? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Thanks for coming.
not_available Want something to eat? No, no.
not_available So, what did he say? I talked to Mitch and Sophie, my friend that works in the courthouse.
not_available And? They said the worst thing to do is fight.
not_available I can fight it if I want to? 
not_available It looks like you got something to hide.
not_available What if I'm just offended by the whole principle? Peter, you go in.
not_available You get swabbed.
not_available They run the DNA.
not_available And you can prove once and for all that Reece is your son.
not_available What if he's not, Jackie? Is that really a possibility? What are you doing? 
not_available You're out of surgery.
not_available The patient coded before we even got started.
not_available What are you doing down here? I wanted to ask you about a couple of cases.
not_available You know, it doesn't matter anyway.
not_available It'll have to wait.
not_available I've just been paged.
not_available Elizabeth.
not_available Aren't you forgetting something? I believe those are mine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I must be dehydrated.
not_available All I've had is coffee and a muffin since last night.
not_available You want to tell us about the scars? I used to be a cutter.
not_available My parents fought a lot when I was a kid, and I was a geek in school.
not_available I developed an eating disorder.
not_available It was my way of dealing with stress.
not_available Did you ever see anybody about it? The only people who seemed to care were the doctors and nurses.
not_available Probably why I'm in med school.
not_available What about now? Are you still cutting? No.
not_available Show me your arm.
not_available You don't believe me? You have a fever and a borderline white count.
not_available Maybe from an infection, or using a dirty blade.
not_available I told you I haven't eaten.
not_available So the eating disorder continues? 
not_available No.
not_available I've just been cramming.
not_available Pull up your skirt.
not_available Pardon me? I don't think so.
not_available Let me see your thigh.
not_available You ass! 
not_available You're still cutting.
not_available We just want to help you.
not_available Okay, hold on.
not_available Grace.
not_available I have a pathology final.
not_available If you don't stay I'll put you on psych hold.
not_available On what grounds? 
not_available Danger to self.
not_available That's not true.
not_available Grace, Grace, wait.
not_available Stop! You're blowing this way out of proportion! Why are you doing this? 
not_available I know what it's like to need help when you least want it.
not_available Please just leave me alone.
not_available I can't.
not_available What are you staring at? You couldn't even diagnose thrombocytopenia.
not_available Get five of droperidol.
not_available No! No, stop! Stop! I don't need that! 
not_available Okay.
not_available Get back into bed now.
not_available Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Take it easy.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You'll ruin everything.
not_available Please, you'll ruin everything.
not_available No, please, stop.
not_available Don't.
not_available No, don't
not_available Don't, please.
not_available Can't you just? 
not_available I had to get a doctor to cover for me.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Scissors, Rachel? 
not_available It's not like they said.
not_available Did you threaten this girl? It was Natalie.
not_available I threatened to cut her dreadlocks, not stab her.
not_available Why? She tried to steal Andrew away from me.
not_available She keeps on sending notes in class 
not_available and asking him over to study.
not_available This is over a boy.
not_available It's no big deal, Dad.
not_available Then why aren't you in gym class now? Maybe because they stopped teaching gym in the '70s.
not_available Don't get smart.
not_available This is serious.
not_available You've been suspended.
not_available Next time you will be expelled permanently.
not_available There won't be a next time.
not_available Right.
not_available Because now we have a new set of rules.
not_available Like what? 
not_available No more rides to school unless it's with Elizabeth or me.
not_available No more going out on weeknights or weekends for that matter, for at least a month.
not_available Why don't you send me to a convent? 
not_available I would.
not_available But I need you around the house to do all your chores.
not_available I have chores now? Yep.
not_available Think of yourself as Cinderella 
not_available and I'm your evil stepmother.
not_available I've already got one of those.
not_available Keep it up.
not_available You'll find yourself back in St.
not_available Louis.
not_available Why are you doing this to me? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Maybe because I love you? Oh, really? 
not_available Yes, really.
not_available Do you know how many messedup teenagers I see? Drug addicts, suicides, 10year
not_available old homeless girls who've been raped because nobody gave a damn about them? Well, I give a damn about you.
not_available You may not like it now.
not_available Hell, you may never like it.
not_available This is how it's gonna be.
not_available Get in.
not_available Need any help? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Did you page me? No, but I figured I might find you in here.
not_available Hi, Reece.
not_available How are you? Good.
not_available Did you talk to Jackie? Yeah.
not_available She thinks I should take the test.
not_available So, what happens if you're not a genetic match? Well, I guess it makes it easier for Roger to fight me for custody.
not_available Nothing's changed, Peter.
not_available You're still his father.
not_available So what are you two doing for dinner? Why don't you come to my place? I have those fish sticks in the freezer Reece likes.
not_available Hey, hey! Take it easy.
not_available Someone's getting a little frustrated.
not_available He's tired.
not_available He wants to go home.
not_available Daddy can't take you home.
not_available I have to work.
not_available What's he saying? He wants his other daddy to come take him home.
not_available Gamma, because you cannot drive.
not_available Because you could black out.
not_available No, I'm
not_available Hey, I'm sorry.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available No, I am not.
not_available She won't stop driving? 
not_available She's calling from the car.
not_available She's been driving around for two hours just to prove me wrong.
not_available It's not funny.
not_available She could hurt herself or somebody else.
not_available What are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Call the cops on my grandmother? 
not_available You already made me call the DMV.
not_available Me? Don't make me the bad guy.
not_available I should go home, wait for her.
not_available I can wait with you.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I mean, yeah, if you want.
not_available Enter! I was just about to page you.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available So, Elizabeth.
not_available Dr.
not_available Babcock says that you were trespassing in his office and his research area.
not_available Care to elaborate? 
not_available I wanted to talk to him.
not_available You knew I was in surgery.
not_available He's worked on every one of my cases that died from a post
not_available operative infection.
not_available Is this true? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's true.
not_available And I have evidence to prove it.
not_available So what? You have made it clear on more than one occasion you are not opposed to euthanasia.
not_available I can't imagine a humane doctor who is.
not_available I have four bodies in the morgue! 
not_available That's not my fault.
not_available You need to take responsibility for your gross misjudgment! Time out! 
not_available This is a load of crap.
not_available You allow her to operate on elderly lost souls who should never be in surgery.
not_available And then when they die, which they inevitably will she comes looking for someone to blame! They didn't die from surgery.
not_available They died from post
not_available op infection.
not_available The key word there being "post
not_available op.
not_available " 
not_available Okay.
not_available If you hadn't operated, they'd be alive.
not_available Okay! Enough! This whole thing has gotten out of hand.
not_available The health department has yet to conclude its investigation.
not_available Until they do, neither one of you is in the O.R.
not_available Happy? 
not_available No.
not_available That's not a solution.
not_available It works for me.
not_available I'm not doing another case with her.
not_available You certainly aren't.
not_available Get out, both of you.
not_available You're giving me a headache.
not_available Go.
not_available God is love.
not_available You can go home, Gallant.
not_available Carter signed out.
not_available Oh, yeah, I know.
not_available I think I'm gonna stay and study.
not_available Here? Maybe I'll pick up stuff by osmosis.
not_available You'll pick up something.
not_available Hi.
not_available Feeling better? What do you want? I heard you talking about your pathology exam.
not_available I thought you might like to take a look at Robbins.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'm sorry about some of the crap I said to you.
not_available I think I was just a little stressed.
not_available I know what that's like.
not_available So you obviously know your vasculitidies.
not_available How are you with your glycogenstorage diseases? 
not_available Not so good.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Mr.
not_available Benton? I am Asha.
not_available You're here for a DNA test? Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't worry, it's painless.
not_available I'm just gonna use this swab to wipe the inside of your cheek.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Say "ah.
not_available " Okay, all done.
not_available That wasn't so bad, now, was it? 
not_available I can't believe it.
not_available I didn't believe it either.
not_available Fentanyl.
not_available If you're gonna abuse drugs, abuse a good one.
not_available Wow.
not_available I've been clean and sober for a year.
not_available You got it out of your system.
not_available I wouldn't say that.
not_available What? Nothing.
not_available Disappointed in me? 
not_available No! No.
not_available I'm just You were stabbed.
not_available Twice.
not_available I don't recommend it.
not_available Can I see your scar? What? 
not_available Show me your scar.
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Don't be bashful.
not_available Why? Get your own.
not_available Why do I feel like a school kid sitting out here? Must be the adolescent sexual tension.
not_available That's it.
not_available You know, I used to have a crush on you.
not_available Used to? 
not_available It's all coming back to me now.
not_available I used to have a crush on you too.
not_available Liar.
not_available I did! You were cute.
not_available Real cute.
not_available But
not_available But? Well, you were a med student, I was a Resident I'm a Resident now.
not_available Chief Resident.
not_available That's right.
not_available Glad you came back.
not_available Me too.
not_available Gamma's home.
