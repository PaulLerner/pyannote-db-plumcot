Previously on ER Dr.
not_available Carter, hi.
not_available As of today, I'm only an intern.
not_available I heard, I couldn't believe it.
not_available Kerry, this is Dr.
not_available Dan Litvak.
not_available Just here to get a few tips? I had an interview for the Chief position.
not_available Have you not told everyone? 
not_available My son's deaf, I know.
not_available Don't you set policy? I'm here for the ride
not_available along.
not_available If he gets vomit in his lungs, he could die of aspiration pneumonia.
not_available Two of your classmates almost died.
not_available It was stupid of me to think you could take responsibility.
not_available Doug, what are you doing? It's 5:00.
not_available I'm a week behind on my Q and A reports.
not_available And that is the good news.
not_available How long have you been up? Haven't been to sleep.
not_available Oh, God, anything I can do? Go back to bed, no use both of us being miserable.
not_available No, it's Ionely there without you.
not_available Keep that up, I'm never gonna finish.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Now I know how you felt when you opened your clinic.
not_available It's pretty scary, huh? Are we both nuts? Yeah.
not_available But it's worth it.
not_available Oh, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available I didn't think you'd be up yet.
not_available I left you a note.
not_available I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am that you lost your R.A.
not_available Job because Halloween 
not_available Me too.
not_available I wondered if you thought it might help if I wrote the dean a letter? Thanks, I think you've done enough already.
not_available At least I could help pack.
not_available I'm not on until 7:00.
not_available No, I can manage.
not_available Where will you live? Ow! That's my leg.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't realize you had company.
not_available See you at the hospital.
not_available I'm very glad you're moving.
not_available So your beef is with nurses asking stupid questions over the radio.
not_available I'll say.
not_available Patients freak out when someone asks if they got track marks.
not_available All right, I'll talk to the nurses.
not_available They asked me to remind you not to restock your rig with their supplies.
not_available Oh, man, that is so lame.
not_available Nothing'll change unless we all throw our gripes out on the table.
not_available Want to get some breakfast before we head back? Definitely, I'm hungry.
not_available I could use an omelet and What was that? 
not_available Gunfire.
not_available Came from behind us.
not_available Looks like bangers.
not_available Someone's down! Unit 63, we have a possible GSW on the 1600 block of Halsted.
not_available Gunfire in the vicinity.
not_available Why don't you back up? We have to wait for a secure area.
not_available I don't hear gunfire.
not_available That doesn't mean it won't start again.
not_available I'm not gonna wait in here.
not_available Protocol says we wait for backup.
not_available Wait! Damn it! What the hell are you doing? Did you hear that? We should not be out here.
not_available Doesn't mean they'll come back.
not_available Give me a hand.
not_available Is he shot? There's no entrance wound.
not_available He's beat up.
not_available Ready to roll him? All right, go.
not_available Stopped breathing, intubate.
not_available Not here, in the rig.
not_available Now! There's too much blood, suction.
not_available Morales, gurney! 
not_available Can't see the cords.
not_available Want to crank his head back? We have to clear the C
not_available spine.
not_available He's still not breathing.
not_available Extend his neck.
not_available You ER guys are nuts! 
not_available Yes, I'm in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's move him and bag him.
not_available One, two, three.
not_available I'm losing his pulse.
not_available We have to start two large IVs.
not_available You want to do that here too? No, we'll do it while we're rolling.
not_available Next time you decide to do a ride
not_available along, I'm taking a day off.
not_available Lights and sirens, let's go! Morning, what have we got? Sixteenyear
not_available old male found beaten.
not_available Sustained concussion, contusions Head, neck and extremities.
not_available BP's 140 over 80, pulse 110, regular.
not_available Good air entry bilaterally.
not_available No evidence of pneumothorax.
not_available Any I.D.? 
not_available No, just a couple of bucks.
not_available Everybody, on my 
count One, two, three.
not_available Cowboy Greene to the rescue.
not_available Babinski's normal.
not_available BP 120/78.
not_available Regular rate and rhythm.
not_available Spontaneous eye
not_available opening.
not_available Okay, can you wiggle your toes? Yep, follows commands.
not_available How's he doing? 
not_available Stable, no apparent neurodeficits.
not_available That was some crazy stunt.
not_available You lucked out this time.
not_available What was that all about? Paramedics got perturbed, I tubed him in the field.
not_available Radiology's here.
not_available So word is Dan Litvak turned down ER Chief.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He played the committee for patsies.
not_available Used the offer to negotiate a bigger salary back home.
not_available I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only other candidate.
not_available Really? "Cat lover seeks roommate." 
not_available Forget it.
not_available Would you consider joining a communal vegetarian household? All right, here's 
one "Furnished apartment in old townhome.
not_available Access to full kitchen.
not_available Many amenities." 
not_available That sounds promising.
not_available And not far from the hospital.
not_available I can set up an appointment for you after work.
not_available All right, see you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available Take a deep breath.
not_available All right, blow hard.
not_available Hard! You all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Pulse ox holding at 98.
not_available I'm Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Do you know what happened to you? I was with a john.
not_available Bangers tried to rob us.
not_available And my john pulled a gun.
not_available That's where I go blank.
not_available Found you on the street.
not_available Brought you here by ambulance.
not_available Why were you cruising in my neighborhood? Sometimes I ride along with paramedics.
not_available You're the first guy who's ever saved my life.
not_available I don't go out in the street for just anybody.
not_available Guess I gotta grant you a wish now.
not_available What? Like I Dream of Jeannie, when Major Nelson rescued her from a bottle.
not_available Start with your name and age.
not_available Kevin Delaney.
not_available I'm 16 years old.
not_available Lily, why don't you find Kevin's labs and see if you can get us an Exam Room.
not_available Sure.
not_available Where do you live? Where you found me.
not_available Any family? 
not_available None who want to know me.
not_available Why is that? Year ago my old man caught me having sex with my gymnastics coach, he kicked me out of the house.
not_available Any other details you want to hear? So you survive by hustling.
not_available Yeah, well, someone's gotta pay the bills, right? Use condoms? Sometimes.
not_available Customers pay more to ride me bareback.
not_available We have a new rapid HIV test.
not_available You can get results in 20 minutes.
not_available How about it? You want to bet I'm positive? Well, if you are, we can treat you.
not_available Sure.
not_available Looks like a good turnout for the BP screening.
not_available I posted signs at the Senior Center.
not_available If it stops raining, we'll be jammed.
not_available Not so tight! 
not_available I'm sorry, Mr.
not_available Levy but to get an accurate reading, it has to be snug.
not_available It's too damn tight! Take it easy, I'll loosen it a bit.
not_available My arm's gonna fall off.
not_available Next time we should extend the outreach.
not_available Go into the community, take BPs.
not_available What do you think? That's not a bad idea.
not_available Okay, your pressure's fine.
not_available No thanks to you.
not_available Carol, you page me? 
not_available Oh, yeah, I'll be right back.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I'm swamped here.
not_available I know, I know.
not_available A lab coat? 
not_available Yes.
not_available It's what every division head should wear.
not_available No backing out now.
not_available What do you think? 
not_available Come here.
not_available I thought you said you're busy.
not_available Not that busy.
not_available No? Carter, you paged me? Sixtyeightyear
not_available old male with a history of abdominal surgery.
not_available I'm thinking small bowel obstruction.
not_available You do a threeway? 
not_available Right here.
not_available Air
not_available fluid levels, and he's got a stepladder pattern.
not_available Good call.
not_available I must've driven you crazy.
not_available What do you mean? My student, she's driving me nuts.
not_available Makes stupid mistakes.
not_available Asks too many questions.
not_available Shows poor judgment.
not_available How'd you put up with me? 
not_available I never gave you any thought.
not_available You didn't? 
not_available Medical students don't know anything.
not_available It's your job to teach them, not be their friend.
not_available Exhale, Mrs.
not_available Delpit, like you're blowing out candles.
not_available Before listening with a stethoscope, test for tactile fremitus.
not_available By placing your hand on the patient's back and asking her to repeat "99." I haven't tested for that since my first year.
not_available I have to be sure that you can do a complete exam.
not_available All right.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Delpit, will you please repeat "99" for me.
not_available Ninety
not_available nine 99 99 Blood alcohol level came back.
not_available Did I set a record? No, but it's up there, 0.16.
not_available That's nothing, last time I got picked up I scored a 26.
not_available I also have your HIV results.
not_available It's AIDS, right? No, good news, you're negative.
not_available I guess my johns don't need rubbers after all.
not_available I'm gonna charge them a fortune.
not_available You won't stay negative if you don't use protection.
not_available Time to get your life together.
not_available Yeah, I do kind of stink.
not_available Do you think I could get a shower? Maybe some clean clothes? I'll have the nurses come and take you to the shower room.
not_available Care to join me? No, thanks, I had one this morning.
not_available Peter, hold on.
not_available Have you got a moment? Nope, I've got a small bowel obstruction.
not_available I know, I'm operating with you.
not_available Meet your new intern.
not_available Since when? 
not_available This morning, if you want.
not_available Go ahead, bring him in.
not_available Okay.
not_available Was this Anspaugh's idea? It was mine, but Anspaugh supports it.
not_available Enthusiastically, I might add.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Come on, Peter.
not_available Don't be a wet blanket.
not_available Think, no more Dale Scott.
not_available And you have the chance to work with an alluring intern.
not_available I'm not comfortable with that.
not_available Why not? We've made a great team.
not_available When we were both Residents.
not_available Now I'd have to be your boss.
not_available I don't mind if you don't.
not_available I'll be accused of playing favorites if I don't treat you like an intern.
not_available I don't ask for special treatment just the chance to do something more than pull drains.
not_available Elizabeth, I don't think it'll be I don't think it'd be good for us.
not_available All right, I'll think about it, okay? You know what, you don't have to.
not_available I already heard your answer.
not_available Orange juice? You want orange juice, Reece? Is that what you want? 
not_available Coffee, please.
not_available You want a sip? You guys taking a lunch break? 
not_available Hey.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Figured we'd get some air since the rain stopped.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available He's getting so big.
not_available You're gonna be tall like your daddy, aren't you, huh? I wasn't aware that Reece had a hearing problem.
not_available Yeah, we just found out recently.
not_available He's deaf.
not_available Come on, man.
not_available What approach do you use for language acquisition if you don't mind my asking? We're working with an audiologist.
not_available Have you looked into speech reading? He has residual hearing.
not_available I'm looking for an aggressive ENT who'll consider him for a cochlear implant.
not_available They'd have to destroy his residual hearing.
not_available Yeah, but the technology is very advanced.
not_available You should talk to Lisa Parks at U of C.
not_available She's an outstanding physician and has expertise in this.
not_available She's a friend of yours? I'll give you her number.
not_available She's cutting edge.
not_available Thanks.
not_available ER? Yep, hold on.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available I'm busy here, Jerry.
not_available They said it was urgent.
not_available All right.
not_available This is Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available You too, Carol.
not_available Where are you? I was just thinking about you.
not_available I have to get my sugar checked! Gotta go.
not_available What's the problem? That other nurse said I have to come back.
not_available I have sugar diabetes.
not_available I schlepped all the way here on a bus in the rain and she says I need an appointment! Now, what is that? 
not_available Okay, hang on.
not_available Did you tell Mr.
not_available Levy he'd need an appointment for his blood check? Did he give you that song about taking the bus? 
not_available He's got other complaints.
not_available Ladies, I hate to interrupt but I haven't had a bite to eat all day.
not_available I have sugar diabetes.
not_available Hello? Okay, Mr.
not_available Levy, I'll test your blood glucose once without an appointment.
not_available Then we'll get you food.
not_available You're an angel.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hope you got all afternoon.
not_available How did the accident happen, Kate? I lost it on gravel coming down through a turn.
not_available Your dad said you hit a curb and then fell.
not_available She fell onto the curb after slipping on gravel.
not_available Okay, have a seat.
not_available You might have a fracture.
not_available I'll call Ortho after we get an x
not_available ray.
not_available We'll be right back.
not_available Have Medical Records send up any old charts.
not_available Good idea.
not_available You feel any pain when I press here? Yeah, a lot.
not_available When did you first feel the pain? 
not_available In the shower.
not_available You had a blow to your leg.
not_available Could be a blood clot.
not_available That's no big deal.
not_available I've had them before.
not_available You have? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available I've got a protein S deficiency.
not_available My blood clots all the time.
not_available Should've seen the mother I had a year ago.
not_available I wish you would've told me your history before.
not_available I can't take care of you if you're not straight.
not_available I can't be straight.
not_available Guess you want to order a coag panel and clotting studies, and start a heparin drip? When was the last time you were hospitalized? Right before I took off from home.
not_available All right, I'm gonna start you on the heparin.
not_available Then we're gonna move to the Coumadin before you're to be discharged.
not_available No, I'm not taking Coumadin.
not_available Why not? You have a disease requiring you to take a blood thinner forever.
not_available Coumadin and the streets don't mix.
not_available You ought to know that.
not_available You don't want me back, bleeding my brains out because I got drunk and hit my head.
not_available You'd rather die of a blood clot? I don't sweat it, why should you? How much insulin did you take, Mr.
not_available Levy? I'm not sure.
not_available The lady who used to come always gave it to me.
not_available She also used to trim my toenails.
not_available I think one of them is infected.
not_available I got pain in my left side.
not_available Mr.
not_available Levy's still here.
not_available Apparently, he took too much insulin.
not_available His blood sugar is 61.
not_available I told you I needed to have my blood checked.
not_available Look, you were right.
not_available I'm really stuck.
not_available His home health aide took a new job.
not_available Any family? 
not_available No.
not_available His wife died last year.
not_available No one else in town.
not_available We could try to get a temporary placement until we find a new aide.
not_available I'm not going to a nursing home! Just temporarily, Mr.
not_available Levy.
not_available The desk guy said Mr.
not_available Levy's here? You got my Kung Pao? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Egg rolls? 
not_available Yes, sir, all right here.
not_available That's $8.50.
not_available Very reasonable.
not_available You ordered Chinese? 
not_available She said I needed to eat.
not_available I'll get my wallet.
not_available Why don't you make it an even 10? Where's my fortune cookie? I was just wondering am I gonna get to work with other ER Residents? Why, is there a problem? No, I just thought I'll learn more by working with a variety of teachers.
not_available That's up to the Attendings.
not_available Why don't you tell me about this patient? Brad Enloe, 12, history of recurrent leukemia.
not_available Relapsed after second induction of chemo.
not_available He's here today for a fever and a sore throat.
not_available Poor kid's been through a lot.
not_available It's our job to treat the patient, not feel sorry for him.
not_available Hi, Brad, I'm Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available This is my student, Lucy Knight.
not_available I hear your throat hurts.
not_available Yeah, it started this morning.
not_available He had a temp of 101.
not_available Check for cervical adenopathy and look for infection, particularly in the ears and throat.
not_available Does that hurt? 
not_available Kind of.
not_available It's probably just a virus, Mrs.
not_available Enloe.
not_available I'm gonna give Brad some ibuprofen, and check his blood count.
not_available He's a candidate for immunotoxin therapy.
not_available But unfortunately, he has to be hospitalized to get the drug and our insurance turned him down.
not_available They won't pay for experiments.
not_available If his neutrophil count comes back under 500 we'll admit him for antibiotics.
not_available He could get immunotoxins on the side.
not_available Is that a possibility? Why don't we cross that bridge when we have the results? Does your clinic have any information about shelters for runaways? This for the kid you saved? 
not_available You heard? I thought you were smoothing things out between ER and paramedics.
not_available I got a little carried away.
not_available Doesn't matter, you're a hero.
not_available Yeah, if I don't kill him.
not_available What? He's got a clotting disorder.
not_available If I give him a blood thinner, he could die in the street.
not_available If I don't treat him, he could die of a clot.
not_available Oh, God, between a rock and a hard place? Here's a pamphlet for a shelter that takes in street kids.
not_available Think you'll convince him? 
not_available We'll see.
not_available Good luck.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Mr.
not_available Preston, can I talk to you? I'll be right back.
not_available I got Kate's old records.
not_available There's a pattern that needs explaining.
not_available She wasn't riding a bicycle.
not_available It's not what you're thinking.
not_available What is it? She was riding a unicycle.
not_available A unicycle? 
not_available Backwards, playing the violin.
not_available We were trying to break a Guinness World Record.
not_available I didn't want word to get out.
not_available And her split lip two months ago? 
not_available Balancing glasses on her chin.
not_available Knife cuts? We broke the potato
not_available peeling record.
not_available Kate and I went through tough times.
not_available I was looking for things we could do together.
not_available It sounds crazy but I found a three
not_available legged marathon we could enter.
not_available We won, and we kind of got hooked, started breaking all kinds of records.
not_available May I help you? Yeah, I'm Peter Benton from County.
not_available Kerry Weaver referred me.
not_available I'm Sara Jackson.
not_available She's with a patient.
not_available I'll introduce you.
not_available Excuse me, on the door it says "Family Medicine." I thought she was a surgeon.
not_available No, she has a family practice.
not_available Hi, I'm Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Listen, don't let me interrupt your patient.
not_available No, that's not a problem.
not_available I'm happy that you came over.
not_available I'm sorry, there must be some misunderstanding.
not_available No, Kerry told me about your son.
not_available I'd be happy to discuss cochlear implants, and other options too.
not_available I guess she didn't tell you I was deaf, huh? No, she didn't.
not_available Dr.
not_available Parks asked that when you speak to her, you look directly at her so she can read lips.
not_available Oh, I'm sorry.
not_available Look, I said, I didn't know you were deaf.
not_available That's all right.
not_available Can we talk? Do you have time for some coffee? Yeah, all right, yeah.
not_available Just let me finish up with this patient, and then we'll all go.
not_available Great.
not_available You must be very confused trying to decide what's best for your son.
not_available Look, I want my son to be able to function in the world.
not_available As you can see, I function pretty well without an implant.
not_available Yeah, but if an implant can help him to hear, why not get one? Well, there are other options.
not_available Look, I don't want my son to have to depend on others, no offense.
not_available Do you know any deaf people? No, I don't.
not_available Have you ever thought that being deaf might not be so terrible? So you're saying there's no problem? You can never know what it's like being deaf.
not_available Just like I can never know what it's like being black.
not_available I don't look at me being black as a burden.
not_available That's who I am.
not_available And I don't look at my deafness as a burden.
not_available That's who I am.
not_available If you turn away from your son's deafness you will be robbing him of his identity.
not_available My son has a medical problem.
not_available I'm not turning away, I'm trying to fix it.
not_available Late for a meeting? If I can get through this administrative hellhole maybe I'll get to see a few kids again.
not_available You can do it, keep going.
not_available You're doing great, Dad.
not_available Beats juggling cantaloupes.
not_available Two hours he's been at it, hasn't dropped one yet.
not_available The orthopedic surgeon is gonna come and examine your wrist.
not_available Is it all right if I watch my dad till he gets here? He's trying to break the juggling record.
not_available Kate, did your dad force you to ride that unicycle? Force me? Oh, no, it was my idea.
not_available You've had a lot of injuries.
not_available Dad and I always take Guinness
not_available approved precautions.
not_available If you're gonna be a record breaker, you gotta take chances.
not_available Play it safe and life's boring.
not_available Here's when we broke the marathon.
not_available That's me and Dad, we're in the book.
not_available I'll give you Accutane for the acne.
not_available But you'll need birth control pills.
not_available Birth control pills? Accutane is a very effective medication.
not_available But if you were to get pregnant, it could cause terrible birth defects.
not_available I won't have sex, I promised my mom.
not_available I believe you, Nava but it's my policy to give birth control to girls who take Accutane.
not_available My mom won't let me take them.
not_available Have her call me.
not_available I'll explain it to her.
not_available I don't think she'll change her mind.
not_available Okay, then I can't give you this medication.
not_available Brought you these.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What's that? You might want to read about advances on protein S deficiency.
not_available Hey, look, I like you, but I'm really not worth it.
not_available There's a list of homeless shelters.
not_available If you can't go home, you might as well go to one.
not_available There you can take your Coumadin.
not_available Then what? Maybe get a job at McDonald's? You're a smart guy.
not_available You get a GED, maybe go to college.
not_available Look, what's the use? 
not_available Would you rather die on the streets? You know, you're cute when you get angry.
not_available Is that the only way you can relate to me, by turning me into a customer? Okay, I'll read them.
not_available Anything for you.
not_available Hey, can you write me a scrip for birth control pills? That young lady decided to take them after all? Yeah, she said she would.
not_available You know you have no business giving her birth control pills since she and her mom don't want them.
not_available And what if she got pregnant? You heard, she's not sexually active.
not_available She's a teenager, that doesn't guarantee she's not gonna have sex.
not_available You are undermining her choice.
not_available Giving her the pills isn't gonna make her have sex.
not_available Listen, how would you feel if you were that girl and a white nurse said she didn't trust you? I wouldn't like it no matter what color.
not_available All I'm saying is, you don't know that girl or her mother.
not_available You're volunteering to talk to her? No, I just think it's wrong for you to force birth control on the girl.
not_available Well, maybe.
not_available But I'm not gonna take any chances.
not_available Dr.
not_available Carter, labs are back on Brad Enloe.
not_available You should look at them.
not_available His neutrophil count's over 1000.
not_available We can't admit him.
not_available He's not septic.
not_available Right, he's only dying of leukemia.
not_available He vomited after I gave him ibuprofen.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yep.
not_available When? 
not_available Couple of minutes ago.
not_available He's dehydrated.
not_available We're gonna admit him.
not_available Call upstairs, tell them we have an admit for Pedes.
not_available He only vomited once.
not_available I know, make the call.
not_available He needs to be rehydrated.
not_available I can start an IV.
not_available You shouldn't do one on the kid.
not_available I can do it.
not_available Been through chemo.
not_available His veins are sclerosed.
not_available Not this one.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available Hey! Write me a scrip for birth control? 
not_available Thought you swore it off.
not_available For a patient.
not_available When did you hear? Half
not_available hour ago.
not_available Hey, Mark.
not_available Whenever you have a minute? Yeah, I'll be right there.
not_available Kerry knows this ER better than anybody we'd hire.
not_available I agree, but the committee wants a star with a reputation who can bring in grants.
not_available Mark, trauma's pulling up.
not_available I'll tell her.
not_available You sure? Mark, no sense in telling Kerry she was our second choice.
not_available Only disappoint her even more.
not_available Right.
not_available Here we go, here we go.
not_available What the hell? Brothers got into a fight on the expressway Iost control.
not_available I've never seen such a mess.
not_available You idiot, I said turn left.
not_available Sorry, Marcus.
not_available You jackass.
not_available Can't believe I let you drive.
not_available You never watch the road.
not_available Eddy and Marcus Haney, carpet
not_available layers.
not_available Carpet cement spilled all over them.
not_available Stuck to their seat.
not_available You get stuck, you're on your own.
not_available You're a moron, you know that? 
not_available Just relax.
not_available How can I relax when that idiot did this? Okay, pulse is strong.
not_available Pupils react to light.
not_available Lydia, get me a glove change here.
not_available This stuff is like taffy.
not_available How's he doing? What is that? Got an impalement of some kind.
not_available Oh, my God! It looks like some kind of tool with sharp prongs.
not_available Not the hand stretcher? Fourby
not_available fours.
not_available Eddy? Just don't move so much.
not_available We're gonna take care of him.
not_available Oh, man! Bleeding man here.
not_available Let's take him to Trauma! Gently.
not_available Malik, try and get monitor leads on.
not_available How? Get a tongue depressor, scrape off a few spots.
not_available Why did Eddy stop talking? Hold still.
not_available If you move, you'll kill him.
not_available Pulse ox falling.
not_available Stand by with intubation.
not_available I'll get a tray and an 8.0 ET tube.
not_available Covering Dr.
not_available Benton, need consult? We've got an impalement.
not_available Watch out for the glue.
not_available Lucy, have you ever intubated? 
not_available No, but I'd like to.
not_available Pretty tough intubation.
not_available Let's find out, talk her through.
not_available Great.
not_available Runs of PVCs when he's jostled from the tool against the heart.
not_available Carter, get the crash cart.
not_available Lydia? 
not_available On it.
not_available Malik, we need the cutter down here as fast as you can.
not_available Hang in there, Eddy, all right? You're gonna be okay.
not_available Carter, I need you here and carefully pull Marcus away so that Lucy has room to intubate.
not_available Can you get in? 
not_available Yeah, a little more.
not_available Lydia, snap some pictures.
not_available New 
policy We're documenting our interesting traumas.
not_available Take her through it.
not_available All right, pass the tube.
not_available Not too far.
not_available All right, take out the scope.
not_available Pull the stylet.
not_available Confirm your position.
not_available I'm in.
not_available Good job.
not_available Lets call Respiratory for a vent.
not_available I hear good breath sounds.
not_available He's in SVT! 
not_available We need to shock him.
not_available Not while they're attached.
not_available Try Adenocard.
not_available Please save my brother.
not_available Carter, let go.
not_available I'm stuck! Charging, 200! Get out of your gloves and gown.
not_available My beard is stuck.
not_available Got the cutters.
not_available Pull back, Carter.
not_available I need some exposed skin! I'm stuck! Clear! Got a pulse! Good job, everybody.
not_available Let's get him to the O.R.
not_available Still want pictures? 
not_available Might as well.
not_available Carter? Carter, you all right? Yeah, I think so.
not_available Thank you for saving my brother.
not_available Just doing our job.
not_available We need to extricate Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available So, Lucy, why don't you start with his beard? He was juggling while on a pogo stick? 
not_available Yeah, a guy in Zurich.
not_available What about while skydiving? Isabella from Tangiers holds the record for juggling five balls.
not_available How long has he been at it? 
not_available For over 31/2 hours.
not_available What's the record? Eleven hours, four minutes, It's in the book.
not_available Kate's documenting the event.
not_available This could be our first time on TV.
not_available Less than eight hours to go.
not_available Dad! 
not_available Jerry, watch out! Congratulations, never thought you'd unstick the glue brothers.
not_available Guess you can fix about anything? 
not_available We try.
not_available I got a call.
not_available You picked up a kid, Delaney? 
not_available We got a warrant for his arrest.
not_available What for? Parole violation, prostitution, the usual.
not_available How long do you expect to keep him? Hard to say, we're treating him for blood clotting.
not_available Call when you release him.
not_available We'll pick him up.
not_available Yeah, I'm a doctor, I'm not a cop.
not_available He needs a second chance.
not_available I'm a cop, not a social worker.
not_available You do your job, I'll do mine.
not_available If he gets beat up in jail, he'll bleed to death.
not_available If I don't pick him up, somebody else will.
not_available I have a sitter to guard him until his discharge.
not_available Good job on the trauma.
not_available You came pretty close.
not_available We'll try again later.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hi.
not_available Kate ready to be discharged? Bring her back for a cast check.
not_available No jumping around? 
not_available Not for six weeks.
not_available Thank you for being so kind.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Okay, bye.
not_available I'll miss the event at the pier.
not_available Sorry, sweetheart.
not_available You want to go watch? 
not_available I guess.
not_available Okay.
not_available Brad's bed is ready.
not_available I've written orders for Oncology to continue to rehydrate him.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You should feel fine in a couple days.
not_available Good luck with your treatment.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Malik, can you take him up? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available He isn't dehydrated, is he? He vomited, I gave him fluids.
not_available What will Oncology say? All they want is a diagnosis for his admission.
not_available I gave them one.
not_available Can you give him an IV? Was the only way to admit him.
not_available So you lied? 
not_available Technically, yeah.
not_available Sometimes you gotta work the system.
not_available You lied? I didn't know you were there.
not_available Is it true Brad's not dehydrated? It's a way for him to get chemo.
not_available What if my insurance finds out? 
not_available I see no reason why they should.
not_available I do, they've challenged claims.
not_available If they find out, Brad loses his coverage.
not_available Then what do we do when his leukemia gets worse? I don't see another way of going about doing this.
not_available I'll talk to you later.
not_available Cop stopped by earlier.
not_available Still wants to take you in after I discharge you.
not_available What did you tell him? 
not_available That you were sick.
not_available Are they gonna put me in juvie? 
not_available They want to.
not_available I can't go back there.
not_available I'm a punching bag for those guys.
not_available I know.
not_available I gotta tell you, getting heparinized is the best treatment.
not_available Great.
not_available Listen, I can't stick around here if the cops are coming.
not_available Figured you'd say that.
not_available Are you setting me up? If your leg starts to hurt or gets swollen, you have to come back.
not_available Here's 50 bucks and my pager number.
not_available Coumadin and a list of shelters.
not_available I never promised you I'd take that.
not_available I know.
not_available Maybe I'll see you around? Hey, Peter, you missed a great trauma.
not_available Yeah? I was out talking to Dr.
not_available Parks.
not_available What did you think of her? She had the audacity to say Reece should be with deaf kids more than me.
not_available Yeah, I should've warned you.
not_available Lisa has very strong opinions.
not_available Opinions? Well, she doesn't mind being deaf.
not_available She doesn't want to be cured.
not_available I thought you'd want to see what she's achieved.
not_available I don't want my son to live with a defect if I can help it.
not_available "Defect"? What do you mean by that? It means, what I do with my son is my business.
not_available Be sure and let me know how things work out.
not_available God bless you, sweetheart.
not_available I thought the nursing home said they wouldn't have a bed.
not_available Stan's not going there.
not_available What you said earlier was right.
not_available We need to know the patient's community.
not_available I called his temple.
not_available Another member with diabetes said he'd stay with him.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Doesn't hurt to do a little outreach.
not_available Mr.
not_available KIoner will be staying with you.
not_available What's that son of a bitch doing here? I should have known.
not_available I spit on your grave! I'll see you dead first! You owe me $20,000 for that time
not_available share in Florida! It's a shack in a swamp! There you are.
not_available I've been looking everywhere for you.
not_available I'm late for an appointment What happened with Brad? His mom took him home.
not_available She decided not to risk it.
not_available I'm sorry to hear that.
not_available Me too.
not_available I wouldn't have asked questions if you'd told me what you were doing.
not_available I'm sorry that you thought it was your business to ask me.
not_available What's going to happen? He's gonna die.
not_available Mark, I was putting together a year
not_available Iong ER coverage schedule.
not_available Good.
not_available Kerry, I want to talk to you.
not_available Is it about the Chief position? The executive committee has decided to reopen the search.
not_available The committee feels that they need a candidate with a national reputation.
not_available Personally, I think it stinks.
not_available Well, that's that.
not_available You're not out of the running, Kerry.
not_available They just reopened the search.
not_available No.
not_available And I'm not interested in continuing as Interim Chief.
not_available Who's gonna do it? 
not_available Not my problem.
not_available I shouldn't have yelled, but he's so damn sensitive.
not_available Hold still, Marcus.
not_available Hey, welcome back.
not_available I hear I missed quite a trauma.
not_available You certainly did.
not_available It's all my fault.
not_available Eddy was driving, and I upset him.
not_available I was just upstairs.
not_available They finished the surgery.
not_available They repaired your brother's heart.
not_available Oh, thank God! It was Dr.
not_available Corday here who freed him just in time.
not_available Well, that doesn't surprise me.
not_available She's an excellent doctor.
not_available When you're finished with Marcus, we'll grab dinner.
not_available I beg your pardon? You're my new intern.
not_available I just gave you an order.
not_available Would you excuse us for a moment? Peter, are you sure? Elizabeth, you're no intern.
not_available You'll still have to do scut work and take call every third night.
not_available But you'll have your patients and can operate.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah, don't mention it.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Aren't you on tonight? Yeah, I am.
not_available Sure you don't want something to eat from Doc Magoo's? No, that's all right.
not_available I got indigestion there at lunch.
not_available What are you doing? I opened my big mouth.
not_available I told Anspaugh that Pedes ER was running at peak capacity.
not_available Now he wants me to give a detailed analysis of the daily census.
not_available When will you be home? Around April.
not_available I won't wait up then.
not_available Good night.
not_available Good night.
not_available Hey, doc, where are you headed? Home, you? To the firehouse, we're off duty.
not_available Listen, sorry I broke protocol this morning.
not_available The adrenaline got the best of me.
not_available Happens to me in a couple of hours.
not_available My knees won't stop shaking.
not_available You got any cash on you? 
not_available I'm tapped out.
not_available Bunch of us are playing poker.
not_available Want to come? 
not_available Sure.
not_available We'll stop by the Ready Teller.
not_available Hop in.
not_available All right.
not_available What time do we have to beat? Six hours and 29 minutes.
not_available We're trying to set a new world record.
not_available You're doing great.
not_available Thanks for stepping in for Katie.
not_available My pleasure.
not_available Only six hours, 
not_available Dr.
not_available Weaver.
not_available Carter? What are you doing here? I came to see about a room for rent.
not_available Is this the right address? It is, I rent out my apartment.
not_available I have a basement.
not_available Would you like to see it? Sure.
not_available I don't usually advertise at the hospital.
not_available I always thought it might be kind of, you know, awkward.
not_available Sure, well, if you'd rather not.
not_available No.
not_available I was just having a drink.
not_available Would you like one? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Good, good.
not_available Did you do something to your hair? Hello? Hey, baby.
not_available Your census report? Yeah, I think it's on the kitchen table.
not_available You want me to get it for you? No, I can do it.
not_available It's just gonna take a minute, okay? Just hold on.
not_available Don't get out of the tub.
not_available You look all happy.
not_available Doug, what are you doing here? I came to get this, but then I was thinking that I was working all night last night.
not_available You were.
not_available And I'll be working all day tomorrow.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Maybe I should take tonight off.
not_available That's a good idea.
not_available You like that? What's that, a bubble bath? 
not_available You want to come in?
