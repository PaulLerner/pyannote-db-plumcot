
not_available E.R.
not_available Previously on E.R.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, phone for you.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Your father.
not_available Who? 
not_available He said he was your dad.
not_available Yeah, this isn't a good time.
not_available Vucelich know who I was? Didn't you tell him about me? That I found it? 
not_available I meant to.
not_available The patient is being excluded? 
not_available Oh, yes.
not_available It seems that he has a history of, excuse me, neurological problems Vucelich wouldn't drop bad outcomes just to pretty
not_available up his numbers, would he? I don't know.
not_available You lied to me.
not_available What do you want from me? The truth! She's dying, Ruby! Is that what you wanna hear? "The Right Thing" Oh, I was just dropping off yesterday's post
not_available op notes.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I was up reading.
not_available Didn't you have surgery this morning? Oh, damn! The file on Mrs.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available You finished with it? 
not_available Yeah, I'll drop it off later.
not_available Get going.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available Morning.
not_available And a grand one it is.
not_available Yeah, easy for you to say.
not_available I'm not on until noon.
not_available Yeah, well, it's much more fun to ride in together.
not_available Don't you usually drive to work? 
not_available My car's in the shop.
not_available Did you drive around for two, three weeks with that brake
not_available warning light on? No! A week.
not_available At most.
not_available Is your apartment on this line? No, I'm on the Congress
not_available O'Hare line.
not_available But you're taking Ravenswood today.
not_available Yeah, it's Mark's line.
not_available This is us.
not_available Stop and shop at Davey's Liquor Depot.
not_available Tequila shopping.
not_available Doug Ross' birthday.
not_available Margaritas at my apartment after work.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you later.
not_available Bye.
not_available Right.
not_available I'm doing an endarterectomy at 11:00, if any of your residents want to observe.
not_available And give them an excuse to miss my rounds? How thoughtless of me.
not_available Peter.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hey, there.
not_available So good of you to wake.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was working late last night.
not_available And you overslept.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available I hope not.
not_available I think the patient might have questioned your professionalism.
not_available I stayed up reading the research files.
not_available Impressive, but diligence is no excuse.
not_available There now, the lecture is over.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Rubadoux, Mr.
not_available Roth, Warrington, Dorgan, McFarland And these patients have what in common? You used Lazerol and the clampand
not_available run technique on them.
not_available We used the clampand
not_available run.
not_available I went through the charts.
not_available I'm trying to understand why all of these patients were excluded from the study.
not_available Well, they each had complications which made them unsuitable candidates.
not_available Shouldn't we determine that before? 
not_available They were emergent cases.
not_available Would you have let them die? 
not_available No.
not_available This is the first research project you've participated in? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Then it's my fault.
not_available I failed to communicate the magnitude and scope of this kind of study.
not_available No, I understand the scope.
not_available I don't think you do.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Rubadoux had pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency and heart failure.
not_available She was never a candidate for the study.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll sign those later.
not_available But with Mr.
not_available Roth
not_available With Mr.
not_available Roth we changed surgical procedure in mid
not_available course which benefited the patient.
not_available Would you have us continue the clampand
not_available run just to include him? No, but there are rules for compiling data, right? We're talking about saving lives.
not_available You and I have talked about risks related to this extraordinary level of medicine.
not_available We'd never take the first step if we didn't take risks.
not_available Now, I hope that as we go along, you can grasp that.
not_available I'll try to.
not_available Perhaps I was foolish to bring you in on the team.
not_available No, sir, I don't think so.
not_available Third
not_available year residents rarely have the maturity.
not_available You are lucky to have this opportunity.
not_available Perhaps you don't realize how lucky you are.
not_available Maybe you ought to take a day to consider that.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Carter, seeing as how you have so much time I've got a knee lac on a 6year
not_available old in 2.
not_available Can't do it.
not_available We are observing a thyroidectomy at 11 and we've got rounds at 10.
not_available You've got time.
not_available What? 
not_available Make yourself useful.
not_available Dr.
not_available BentonAbout that knee lac 
not_available Do you mind? Paramedics are pulling up with an apparently intoxicated street individual.
not_available Be my guest.
not_available Man! Come on.
not_available I've missed you, Carter.
not_available By the way, happy birthday, Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available It's not my birthday.
not_available That's an ugly rumor.
not_available And, Jerry, Groundhog Day is over, so let's get rid of that guy.
not_available I am so sorry, Marguerite.
not_available I just can't understand how this happened.
not_available My foot hit the ice.
not_available My bum hit the bricks.
not_available I shoveled all the steps, but there it was, third from the top.
not_available A small, yet undeniably slick patch of ice.
not_available I'm gonna live, Edward.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Yes, but why? Why did this happen? 
not_available It was an accident.
not_available There are no accidents.
not_available He overthinks things.
not_available Studying to be an analyst.
not_available Psychoanalyst? 
not_available Scary, huh? I still can't believe my daughter married him.
not_available Nathan Conley, 27years
not_available old.
not_available ETOH intoxication, ALOC, ataxic.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Nystagmus, BP 90/40, resps 14.
not_available Excuse me, I'm gonna move upwind.
not_available Who called it in? 
not_available Some deadbeat threw him out.
not_available Nathan couldn't stop throwing up.
not_available Drank a gallon of vodka, took some Xanax.
not_available Some Xanax? 
not_available The only number he could think of.
not_available Did you make up today's schedule? 
not_available Like every day.
not_available Where is it? 
not_available That is it.
not_available I was assisting Dr.
not_available Zarem on a parathyroidectomy at 11 and Dr.
not_available Enari on a nephrectomy at 3.
not_available This says Bachtell's assisting.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich said you were going to be tied up in ER, so I reassigned.
not_available Mark and Susan, really? 
not_available Carter said they were very chummy.
not_available On the El? I thought Susan drove.
not_available I saw them in the lounge yesterday.
not_available Hey, I saw them in the cafeteria.
not_available Susan, how are you this morning? I'm fine.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Haven't I already seen you today? Yes, you know, you have.
not_available You have seen me today.
not_available Carol, what do you say we get to that earache in 1? Oh, right.
not_available Earache.
not_available Did you lose consciousness? 
not_available Not this time, she didn't.
not_available This time? 
not_available Two months ago I stumbled over his new puppy and hit my head on the driveway.
not_available My wife and I, we want children, but Okay, let's just get it out in the open.
not_available I have some problems with commitment, accepting responsibility.
not_available We thought a puppy might help.
not_available Any blurry vision this time? 
not_available No, just the cut.
not_available Do you think that I could somehow be causing these accidents? I know that we've been having some difficulties since you moved in.
not_available Let the doctor work, Edward.
not_available Are you allergic to lidocaine? 
not_available I wasn't before.
not_available I had stitches on my arm last summer.
not_available Edward sliced me with a Weed Whacker.
not_available Oh, my God, I did.
not_available I did, didn't I? I can't believe this.
not_available I'm experiencing displacement.
not_available That's a defense mechanism wherein feelings of hostility are inappropriate
not_available Inappropriately redirected! Sorry about this.
not_available My daughter, the only one with a job had to go to work today, so Edward brought me in.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Have you had a tetanus booster? Three months ago.
not_available Cut my leg on the basement stairs.
not_available Tripped over Edward's golf clubs.
not_available Banana bag's going.
not_available Are we done? What's the deal, Carter? Surgery withdrawal? I ordered a blood alcohol level and a tox screen.
not_available Okay, get a CBC, stick him for a glucose and let's get a Chem
not_available 20.
not_available His lytes have gotta be all screwed up.
not_available Got it.
not_available Scattered rales bilaterally.
not_available Did you check his pupils? 
not_available Equal, round and reactive.
not_available Saline's going.
not_available Let's give him naloxone, two IV push.
not_available And why are we doing that, Carter? To reverse the narcotic effect.
not_available Are we boring you, or is it the way he smells? Okay, check his head for contusions.
not_available Glucose is 40.
not_available Give him glucose and thiamine.
not_available Why are we giving him thiamine? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Given his nutritional state, glucose can precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy.
not_available Symptoms which include ataxia and paralysis of eye movement.
not_available Isn't it nice to know you can learn something new? Prep for a gastric lavage.
not_available I'll be back.
not_available Oh, and, Carter, I want you to do a neuro check every 15 minutes.
not_available And don't forget to do a stool guaiac.
not_available Good to see you back down here, Carter.
not_available We missed you.
not_available Hey, Mark, how's it going? 
not_available I'm ready for a margarita.
not_available Little celebration? 
not_available It's your birthday.
not_available No, I mean about you and Susan.
not_available I want you to know I think it's great.
not_available You two went home together last night? What? We arrived this morning, but
not_available Know what? You can fill me in later.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Hi, I'm Reilly Brown.
not_available We haven't met.
not_available You're Dr? Mark Greene.
not_available Shouldn't you be in high school somewhere? I'm a lot older than I look, 21.
not_available What have you got, Reilly? 
not_available Wilson Wolfe, 50.
not_available Stuck his right hand in the snow blower.
not_available BP 120/80, pulse 106.
not_available I think he's a little nervous.
not_available Lose any fingers? 
not_available No.
not_available Got them right here.
not_available Oh, good work there, Reilly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available What is it, Carter? I can understand if you're upset about my claiming that aneurysm.
not_available But I don't see why my surgical education should suffer.
not_available There's no surgical services.
not_available Back to work.
not_available Who needs help in here? Get back to work! Hi, I'm Reilly Brown Mark, can I talk to you? 
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Yeah, yeah.
not_available No big deal.
not_available Reilly, that's all.
not_available You can go now.
not_available BP is 120/80.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wolfe here seems to have put his hand into a snow blower.
not_available Yeah, something was blocking it.
not_available I can't believe I was that stupid.
not_available Lots of people are.
not_available We've got a pumper.
not_available Okay, Lydia, inflate the BP cuff.
not_available We have the two fingers.
not_available Mr.
not_available Wolfe, are you righthanded? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Not anymore, you're not.
not_available Haleh said Nathan's waking up.
not_available Hey! What are you doing? 
not_available Call Security.
not_available Leave us alone! 
not_available No, no, you cannot be here.
not_available I have to take care of him.
not_available Hey, Carter.
not_available It's okay, baby.
not_available I'll take care of you.
not_available Must be the girlfriend.
not_available What exactly do you suspect? 
not_available I'm not quite sure.
not_available But you do have suspicions? 
not_available He's not including any bad outcomes.
not_available And you're certain? 
not_available Yep.
not_available And when you confronted him? 
not_available He said it wasn't true.
not_available But you think it is.
not_available He explained two but there are three others.
not_available First there were five, and now there're only three? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'd make sure.
not_available I'm going over the charts again.
not_available Maybe he can explain all of them.
not_available He took me off the surgical service.
not_available He could have dozens of reasons to do that.
not_available Look, if I was going to talk to somebody I mean, officially, who would it be? The dean.
not_available But going up against a guy like Vucelich He's one of the top cardiovascular surgeons in the country.
not_available What if it comes down to your word against his? You don't think I should pursue it? 
not_available If you're wrong, your career's over.
not_available I can't believe you made me eat chili.
not_available I didn't.
not_available Yes, you did.
not_available You held a gun to my head Watch out! Help! Help! My leg! All right, don't move him.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Paul.
not_available Just relax.
not_available You got it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Lift this bike up.
not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available Let's just back it up here.
not_available This is a cool bike.
not_available Kind of heavy.
not_available Please don't tell him I'm here.
not_available Is someone after you? 
not_available He's gonna kill me.
not_available Who? My father.
not_available He won't let me have a motorcycle.
not_available Doesn't think they're safe.
not_available I guess you didn't listen to him.
not_available Lie back down.
not_available All right.
not_available I bought it this morning.
not_available It was great until the throttle stuck.
not_available I couldn't stop it.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton? 
not_available What is it, Carter? Well, I now know you have the utmost lack of respect for me.
not_available You can quit the study, but you should have told me.
not_available Who told you I quit the study? 
not_available Everybody in the last hour and I think I had the right to know before they did.
not_available It's more complicated than that, Carter.
not_available I did not quit the study.
not_available Right.
not_available I've gotta get rid of the bike! 
not_available Settle down, Paul.
not_available I've got the pink slip in my pocket.
not_available Maybe somebody here will buy it.
not_available It's a little damaged.
not_available How much do you want for it? I'm trying to help him out.
not_available His father is gonna clobber him.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Looks like a fractured fibula.
not_available I can take him from here, Susan.
not_available Yeah.
not_available "Take him" is right.
not_available Okay.
not_available See you later.
not_available You don't have to tell my dad, right? How old are you? 
not_available Seventeen.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You're a minor.
not_available Maybe he'll be grateful that you didn't kill yourself.
not_available I doubt it.
not_available Miss Boulet? Ruby, what are you doing here? I just wanted to thank you again 
not_available for all your help.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available And to let you know my sweetheart passed away yesterday.
not_available Oh, Ruby.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available How are you doing? 
not_available Okay.
not_available Not great.
not_available I knew it was gonna happen but I guess you really never believe it until it does.
not_available Anyway, the services are this afternoon at 4:00 at the Mount Sinai Cemetery, you know, off Grand.
not_available I know you' re busy, but if you'd like to come, it's okay.
not_available Thank you, Ruby.
not_available I would like to come.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available I'll see you later.
not_available Carter.
not_available Nathan's back asleep having puked three more times.
not_available Angel's awake, weepy and full of regret.
not_available "Never gonna drink another drop," she says.
not_available Great couple of SHPOS, these two.
not_available What did you just say? 
not_available SHPOS.
not_available It means subhuman
not_available No, I know what it means, thank you.
not_available I've gotta get these x
not_available rays to the O.R.
not_available Carter's been hanging around Benton too much.
not_available Haven't we all.
not_available Bad day at Black Rock.
not_available Multiple 
not_available A petting zoo run amuck.
not_available Happy birthday, dear Doug.
not_available Hi.
not_available Hi.
not_available How's Ruby? Mr.
not_available Rubadoux.
not_available He's hanging in.
not_available His wife died yesterday.
not_available The service is at 4:00 today, Mount Sinai.
not_available Do you want to go with me? I don't think I can make it.
not_available I'm pretty jammed up today.
not_available These elevators take forever.
not_available I'm gonna take the stairs.
not_available How long have you had that cough? I don't know.
not_available A while.
not_available Your chest x
not_available rays will show us more.
not_available Do they show everything? Why? 
not_available Maybe they'll show I have AIDS.
not_available Do you? Yeah.
not_available Look, you don't have to tell Nathan about me, right? Have you been sick with anything else? Fevers, rashes, night sweats? No.
not_available Just the cough.
not_available Okay, get a CBC, ABG, Chem20 a UA, hepatitis titers, place a PPD and get a CD
not_available 4.
not_available You might have pneumonia so I'm gonna keep you here for a while and run some tests.
not_available Look, you don't have to tell Nathan about me.
not_available Right? It's against the law for me to tell him.
not_available You should.
not_available He has a right to know.
not_available And if he's sick, he should be getting treatment, and so should you.
not_available I just think he might get mad at me, you know? And he might want to take off or something, and he's all I have.
not_available Can you make that out to "cash"? 
not_available You got a deal.
not_available You got robbed.
not_available I'm doing this as a favor.
not_available You still have to explain what happened to your leg.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Tell your dad you were hitchhiking and got picked up by a motorcycle and bam! 
not_available Mark! He hates hitchhiking too, but at least I'll only be grounded.
not_available Watch out for the throttle.
not_available So I got lucky.
not_available In more ways than one, I hear.
not_available What? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Lydia, what did you hear? Do you have pain anywhere else? 
not_available Only in my stomach.
not_available Okay, okay.
not_available Sit back.
not_available What have you got? T
not_available Ball, is that you? I haven't seen you in a while.
not_available My stomach hurts for real.
not_available It does! I ain't lying to you.
not_available Yep.
not_available Jeanie.
not_available I can't remember his real name, but he's under T
not_available Ball in the turkey file.
not_available Frequent flyer.
not_available Drug seeking.
not_available Are you sure? He seems to be in pain.
not_available You'll get used to them.
not_available They'll do anything for Valium, Percodan, Demerol.
not_available Let him moan and groan for an hour.
not_available He'll get bored, go somewhere else.
not_available Carter! I asked you to wake Nathan Conley up every 15 minutes.
not_available I had something to do.
not_available You had that, and you didn't do it.
not_available Okay, I'm sorry.
not_available I want chest films on him.
not_available Jerry, I need you to call Social Services.
not_available I've got an AIDS patient who needs placement.
not_available This thing's still here? 
not_available It belongs to Dr.
not_available Greene now.
not_available Mark bought a motorcycle? Got it cheap.
not_available There's only one helmet.
not_available You're gonna have to get your own.
not_available What? When spring comes, you guys'll be riding in on this instead of the El.
not_available I would.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available You and Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available I think you make a great couple.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available I'm looking for Dr.
not_available Douglas Ross.
not_available He's with a patient right now.
not_available Can I tell him who's here? 
not_available Now, you, over there.
not_available I want to sit by Joseph.
not_available I don't want her near me! 
not_available Bet you can't wait to have that baby.
not_available The baby part's fine.
not_available It's when they get to this age Hey, you know what, guys? Nurse Hathaway, will you give us a hand? 
not_available I want to sit by Joseph.
not_available Get her away from me! I didn't even want you to come to my birthday party.
not_available You're gonna sit over here.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available A guy at the desk wants to see you.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Said you'd know him.
not_available Surprise for your birthday.
not_available Doug? Who is it? My father.
not_available Carol, I looked up T
not_available Ball's card in the file.
not_available He's always claimed back pain.
not_available This time it's his stomach.
not_available Guess he's branching out.
not_available Maybe but I ran some additional blood tests, just in case.
not_available First my parents wouldn't let me have one and then after med school, my wife wouldn't let me.
not_available Got a good one here.
not_available You know about motorcycles? 
not_available Five brothers.
not_available Had them in the yard.
not_available You better get a lock and chain.
not_available E
not_available Ray got his stolen.
not_available Keep it in your apartment.
not_available Third floor, no elevator.
not_available Susan could keep it in her place.
not_available I'm looking for Carter.
not_available I haven't seen him.
not_available Have you seen Carter? 
not_available Is he missing again? It looks like Angel's got pneumocystis.
not_available I asked him to order a bronchoscopy.
not_available Angel? Oh, man, I was afraid this would happen.
not_available I had a feeling she was gonna leave.
not_available That girl was too scared.
not_available If you need to help, I can wait.
not_available I'm a pediatrician.
not_available You've got a damn exciting job here.
not_available Only if you're unlucky which I happen to be today.
not_available Don't they need this? 
not_available They've got plenty of those inside.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on out, Doug.
not_available Come on, Dougy.
not_available Come on.
not_available My name isn't Dougy anymore.
not_available Is that why you came here? To play ball with your boy? 
not_available Not with this.
not_available If this was basketball 
not_available We don't have one.
not_available Remember when you were a kid, I used to put you on my shoulders and you'd slam
not_available dunk.
not_available "Two points, two points! " you'd scream.
not_available How's your mother? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available She's happy.
not_available She deserves it.
not_available I'll tell her you said so.
not_available No, you won't.
not_available You wouldn't even tell her you saw me.
not_available Afraid it will upset her.
not_available Then she'll get all melancholy.
not_available People never gave her enough credit.
not_available She's a strong woman.
not_available She kind of had to be, didn't she? 
not_available She walked out on me once.
not_available Compared to the 12 you walked out.
not_available You mean walked out on you? 
not_available What are you doing here? What do you want from me? I don't want anything from you.
not_available You're all over the airwaves.
not_available You're a big hero.
not_available I was pretty proud of you.
not_available I do have regrets.
not_available I've gotta go to work.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Doug.
not_available Happy birthday, son.
not_available I'm turned around.
not_available Is the El this way? 
not_available It's that way.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Carter.
not_available You look winded.
not_available Yeah, I was hurrying.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich I know Dr.
not_available Benton left the study, and I wanted to say that I've learned more under you than in four years of medical school.
not_available And I'd very much like to continue on the team.
not_available There's initiative, wouldn't you say? For better or worse, there seems to be a plethora of students on the team now.
not_available I can't see that I would have anything of substance for you to do since you're way beyond scut work.
not_available Best of luck.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Did you ask him to take an AIDS test? 
not_available He says it gives him the creeps.
not_available Bilateral perihilar right there.
not_available He needs to know Angel has AIDS so he might have it too.
not_available You can't tell him.
not_available The law protects her.
not_available I could if they were married.
not_available And they're not.
not_available Who's protecting Nathan and all the women he might have sex with? Ethically, I agree with you.
not_available The law is the law, right? 
not_available Even if it's not right.
not_available Hey, T
not_available Ball.
not_available Are you giving up? CBC showed microcytic anemia.
not_available Blood smear showed red
not_available cell stippling.
not_available Get a blood lead level, Erythrocyte protoporphyrin, lead poisoning.
not_available I was sleeping in that building.
not_available I didn't care they was fixing up during the day.
not_available Dust from the renovations.
not_available Full of lead.
not_available Didn't think I needed validation on this.
not_available I called Medicine.
not_available They're admitting him.
not_available Have you seen Doug? I've got that birthday boy in 1.
not_available The llama bite? He's out talking to his dad.
not_available Probably he'll never come back.
not_available Have you seen Benton? 
not_available He wants you to check some patients.
not_available I can't right now.
not_available There's an arm lac in 6, rule
not_available out appendicitis in 3 and Dr.
not_available Lewis wants to talk about Angel.
not_available She split AMA.
not_available I can't deal with those right now, Jerry.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available They're wine coolers.
not_available They're really good.
not_available You want some of mine? 
not_available I fell.
not_available You fell? Couldn't be because you're drunk? Hey, man, you leave her alone.
not_available There's nothing wrong with her.
not_available Get up! 
not_available Nathan, make him stop.
not_available You're the ones that won't stop.
not_available You're sick, and you get drunk.
not_available You both rip out your IVs.
not_available That's enough.
not_available What's the matter with you? 
not_available Look what you did.
not_available Look what I did? Look what I did?! Carter, out of here.
not_available Out of here, now! Okay, you.
not_available Back in bed.
not_available Haleh, help Angel out of here.
not_available Come on, back in bed.
not_available Now! So, what's going on? 
not_available You saw.
not_available No, not with them, with you.
not_available These people come in here on drugs and booze.
not_available They don't listen to us, and we're supposed to treat them.
not_available We're supposed to treat them.
not_available What good is it? Tomorrow they're back on the street doing the same thing.
not_available The day after that they're gonna be back in here.
not_available That's the job.
not_available If you don't like them needy
not_available I don't like the abuse.
not_available None of us do.
not_available You're used to it with your sister.
not_available When you first got here, we were a little concerned about you.
not_available You seemed to care too much.
not_available We're not worried about that anymore.
not_available What happened to you, Carter? 
not_available Loretta.
not_available Hi, Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available How have you been? We've been looking for you.
not_available Jimmy was dying to see The Lion King.
not_available No, I wasn't.
not_available How about some ice cream? I was just going on a break.
not_available It's a little cold for ice cream.
not_available Hot chocolate? 
not_available I couldn't hear you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Exam 1? Could you take Loretta to Exam 1? 
not_available Sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available How did he do it? 
not_available Playing soccer.
not_available I thought you said he was 60.
not_available With his grandchildren.
not_available That's a large joint effusion.
not_available I'll do an arthrocentesis.
not_available Tell him to stick to the sidelines.
not_available Do you have another minute? 
not_available Certainly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Vucelich is telling people that I left the study.
not_available I wasn't sure you'd want to talk.
not_available I didn't exactly leave.
not_available Carl's very discreet.
not_available He didn't think it would look good that he had to fire his star pupil.
not_available Is that what he said? I believe the euphemism was, "We're experiencing a difference in style." I'd have just fired you.
not_available Our differences had to do with the data, who's left in and who's left out.
not_available That's a matter of interpretation.
not_available It's his research study.
not_available He did get the grant on the strength of his reputation and accomplishments.
not_available Do you know how much money he brings into this hospital? If you've had a disagreement with Vucelich I suggest you retreat immediately and apologize.
not_available It wasn't a disagreement.
not_available Peter, you have the arrogance of a great surgeon, the ego and someday, one hopes, the talent.
not_available But what you don't have is the ability to get along, to be a member of the team.
not_available Once you're a Carl Vucelich, you don't need that but you can't be a Carl Vucelich without it.
not_available Here you go, Joseph.
not_available I'll give your dad another call.
not_available Mark, you got a minute? Someone check out that bite? 
not_available It's okay but he needs someone to talk to.
not_available His dad should have been here hours ago.
not_available Sure, in a few minutes.
not_available Please, sit down.
not_available I have some difficult news.
not_available Yeah, I've been tired, but what do you expect from an old hooker? New job's going great, kids are doing well at school, everything is good.
not_available Your biopsy last time was positive for cervical cancer.
not_available It's stage 1
not_available B, which is relatively early in the spread of the disease although that can only be confirmed through surgery.
not_available Treatment is radical hysterectomy.
not_available The removal of the uterus and cervix.
not_available Sometimes radiation therapy is done.
not_available Statistics show that with treatment the five
not_available year survival rate is over 90%.
not_available Five years.
not_available My kids won't even be teenagers.
not_available Mr.
not_available Rubadoux I'm very sorry about your wife.
not_available I made a mistake.
not_available Not in the way I treated her, but in the way I treated you.
not_available I wasn't honest.
not_available I wasn't fair.
not_available I was wrong.
not_available And I'm very, very sorry.
not_available This day isn't about you, Mr.
not_available Carter.
not_available How's Angel? 
not_available She's still asleep.
not_available Are you kicking us out now? 
not_available Not quite yet.
not_available Oh, God, I've gotta stop this, you know? Angel's better at it.
not_available She can stop drinking for a while, you know but then I just drag her right back in.
not_available I don't know why she stays.
not_available Nathan, there's something that Angel's scared to tell you but it's something that I think you have a right to know.
not_available She has AIDS.
not_available She has AIDS? You mean the whole thing? Yes, which means you could have it too.
not_available Have you ever been tested? Could I have given it to her, or could she have given it to me? If you test positive, there's no way to know.
not_available Loretta needs a little time.
not_available Is she going to have surgery? Yeah.
not_available She's just worried who's gonna take her kids for five days.
not_available Al and I can take them.
not_available He thinks after we get married we should adopt three or four.
not_available This'll get him off that kick.
not_available Where have you been? 
not_available The longest walk ever, and I'm freezing.
not_available Start the margaritas in an hour.
not_available Mark, thank you and thank Susan, but I'm gonna have to pass.
not_available Things went that well with your dad? 
not_available No, that was fine.
not_available Same old thing.
not_available He just wanted to borrow 100 bucks.
not_available Llama birthday boy is still here.
not_available What? The bite's been treated, but his father is running late.
not_available Joseph? How's the arm? Did you know that you are my first llama bite in my entire pediatric career? Which makes this a special day.
not_available Also because it happens to be my birthday.
not_available I hate my birthday.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available My dad's always late.
not_available So is mine.
not_available He gave me a trip to the zoo, and then he didn't even come.
not_available What did you get? 
not_available I got a card.
not_available And I got two tickets to the Bulls game.
not_available All right, get this.
not_available There are brownies in the refrigerator in the lounge.
not_available They are not birthday cake, and they are not mine.
not_available But I think we should steal them.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yep.
not_available Yep.
not_available Peter, I'm sorry we couldn't meet in my office.
not_available I can't get rid of the endarterectomy team from Philadelphia.
not_available I went over the charts again.
not_available All of them.
not_available I can see spending a day thinking about this hasn't helped, so stop right here.
not_available Agree to disagree, and move on.
not_available Apparently I already have.
not_available I didn't fire you.
not_available I just let people know that you quit.
not_available Which I hadn't.
not_available I felt you needed help making that decision.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available At least three of those patients should not have been excluded from the study.
not_available I determine who's in and who's out.
not_available I thought the protocol determined that.
not_available If you're manipulating the data, how can the study be valid? How dare you question me? You get the opportunity of a lifetime and you have the temerity to challenge my reputation.
not_available The results won't be accurate.
not_available Aren't lives at stake here? Yes, Peter, lives are at stake.
not_available Lives that I save.
not_available Mothers, fathers, grandparents are living because I made choices.
not_available I risked everything to do what I know is right.
not_available The rules are there for a reason.
not_available Grow up, Peter.
not_available You're no junior chemist at the FDA.
not_available You're a surgical Resident in a struggling county hospital.
not_available How do you think money comes into this place? It takes more than "please" and "I promise to do what's right.
not_available " It takes results.
not_available And that, at any cost, is what I produce.
not_available Now, you screw with that and you will be off surgical service for a hell of a lot longer than one day.
not_available Boy, when they made you stupid, they made you really stupid.
not_available That's the only funny thing I've heard all day.
not_available I'm gonna die, and you're gonna tell me I should give these up? The cold's doing more damage.
not_available You do have pneumonia.
not_available Maybe quicker is better.
not_available I told Nathan.
not_available I know it's illegal, but I did it anyway.
not_available He's really worried about you.
not_available He's worried that maybe he gave it to you.
not_available He wants to go through this together.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available If he has it.
not_available But if If he's clean, and I'm sick why's he gonna wanna stick around? 
not_available Which option are you hoping for? It's cold out here.
not_available I'm gonna go inside.
not_available Sorry about this.
not_available The dean's staff meetings usually don't take this long.
not_available It's okay.
not_available Does the dean know what it's about? 
not_available No, he doesn't.
not_available Yes? Of course.
not_available It'll just be another minute or two.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I just think I've turned into a cliché.
not_available Don't do this, Mark.
not_available I've got that "guy about to be divorced" look all over me.
not_available Here I am in a very attractive single woman's apartment drinking like I'm still in my 20s with a brand
not_available new, used motorcycle.
not_available You are a guy about to be divorced.
not_available But I don't have to act like one.
not_available Here, try this.
not_available Not as good as the first, better than the second.
not_available Does it matter? People at work are making up stories about you anyway.
not_available About us, you mean.
not_available Yeah.
not_available And what is that, can I ask you? My car's in the shop.
not_available I drop Susie off at my parents'.
not_available Meet up with you to go tequila shopping and all of a sudden, we're having a torrid affair.
not_available Who said it was torrid? No one.
not_available I'm just assuming it would be.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available That's okay.
not_available I know what you meant.
not_available I'm sure it would be too.
not_available Why wouldn't it be? No reason at all.
not_available There's not enough lime in this.
not_available Hey, bro.
not_available What's up, Walt? Same old thing.
not_available What happened? You look like you lost your tenth patient.
not_available I don't know, man.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm off the study I told you about.
not_available I thought the main man loved you.
not_available Yeah, well, he was breaking some rules, and I called him on it.
not_available Were you right? 
not_available I just thought it'd be different.
not_available The work we were doing, where I was going Different from what? 
not_available From everything that got me here.
not_available Scratching my way through med school.
not_available Playing this game and that game.
not_available You angle for the best Residency no matter what.
not_available You did what you had to do.
not_available What we all have to do every day.
not_available Why do we keep on doing it? That's up to you.
not_available The world doesn't change because you're moving up in it.
not_available I went to the dean to tell him what was going on.
not_available And I waited around for 20 minutes, and I left.
not_available I just left.
not_available I'm stupid enough to ruin my career, but I don't even have the courage to do it the right way.
not_available You don't understand, Walt.
not_available I always thought when the time came I'd do the right thing.
