not_available I'm calling the police.
not_available No.
not_available I'm trying to help a sick child.
not_available Mom, he has leukemia.
not_available He may not survive.
not_available If you've got some kind of twisted need to relive this, that's fine.
not_available I'm not gonna do it again.
not_available I made my peace a long time ago.
not_available What the hell happened? She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.
not_available She could still die! 
not_available I know, Dad! Please, please, Dad.
not_available I'm sorry! I don't understand why this has happened.

not_available 8x14 "A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE" Dr.
not_available Lewis, you need to get up.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis! 
not_available What? You need to get up.
not_available What time is it? 
not_available Almost 7.
not_available Oh, my God, I was just gonna lie down for a second.
not_available When was that? I need to get home.
not_available Animal attack from the zoo in 15 to 20.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I'm not on till noon.
not_available Weaver needs you now.
not_available Yeah, and I need a hot shower and some mouthwash.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene is still up in the PICU.
not_available Someone has to cover him.
not_available You happened to be curled up in the lounge.
not_available Is she extubated? His daughter? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're waiting on a blood gas.
not_available She triggering the vent? 
not_available No.
not_available Did Neurology read the EEG? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I said, no! 
not_available We're talking bagels and cream cheese.
not_available No one is taking a bribe.
not_available Promotions like this add to the cost of pharmaceuticals.
not_available Marketing expenditures passed on to mostly elderly consumers.
not_available I'm elderly.
not_available There's no free lunch, Frank.
not_available This is breakfast.
not_available Yes.
not_available This is Susan Lewis in the ER.
not_available I need to speak with the charge nurse.
not_available They weaned her down to 30 percent, she's off sedation and the PICU fellow ordered a CPAP trial.
not_available Oh, thanks.
not_available Never mind.
not_available I'll take the rack.
not_available You clear the pass
not_available ons and get this borborygmi out of 4.
not_available You wanna ask me to cover all day after staying all night? All night was your choice.
not_available Welcome to management.
not_available No whining allowed.
not_available You sleep with your eyelids open.
not_available Partly open.
not_available Still kind of freaky.
not_available Not as freaky as watching you eat with your mouth open.
not_available Any strawberry? 
not_available Wait.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Looking for a knife.
not_available Next to the penlights.
not_available All right.
not_available You're gonna eat that? Why not? The next time you get a pneumonitis and you have to prescribe Reprotrex or the cheaper, effective generic drug, you're not gonna feel slightly beholden? By a bagel? No.
not_available Are you sure? Okay.
not_available I'm gonna go to Doc Magoo's, get some breakfast, find a toothbrush change my underwear, and then I'll clear your borborygmi.
not_available Fifteen minutes.
not_available If I stick with the underwear I've got on, can we at least keep the food out? It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You can't titrate a little Versed so she won't remember? Any benzo decreases her ventilatory drive.
not_available Then do it.
not_available But if you allow the sedation to wear off, you have to be ready.
not_available I need to warn you.
not_available Extubation's a leap of faith with little ones.

not_available That's a happy sound.
not_available We're here.
not_available We're here.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Yeah, we're here.
not_available Is his car still there? Sometimes he skips Marketing, but he won't skip Cost Accounting.
not_available If you wanna wait, I can be there when you do it.
not_available No.
not_available I'm gonna ask him at school.
not_available He'll stay calm in front of his study group.
not_available You can't ask him, Joyce.
not_available Right.
not_available I know.
not_available And you have to leave if he doesn't
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Do you wanna come to work with me? Can I stay here until he leaves? 
not_available Of course.
not_available Call me after you talk to him.

not_available Joyce

not_available Lock the door.
not_available Abby? You seen Joyce? 
not_available Abby, my wife.
not_available You seen her? 
not_available What? No.
not_available She didn't come home.
not_available I'm getting worried.
not_available She didn't call you? 
not_available No.
not_available Did you call the police? No.
not_available We had a fight.
not_available She might just be mad at me.
not_available If you hear from her, have her call me? Yeah, sure.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have a good day.
not_available She's moving extremities? All four.
not_available Fixing and following.
not_available Good color.
not_available Oh, Mark, that's great.
not_available No seizure in the next 48 hours, we should be home free.
not_available What's that for? The breast pump up in OB is missing a collection tube.
not_available She's eating? 
not_available She's about to try.
not_available Thank you for covering.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available Take care of your daughter.
not_available Positive LOC.

not_available Yeah.
not_available He got bit by a monkey.
not_available It was a sloth.
not_available What is a sloth? 
not_available It's like a monkey.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available They're not anything like primates.
not_available They're not even in the same order.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? I hear your baby's doing better.
not_available Off the vent.
not_available Oh, good.
not_available That's really good news.
not_available So far.
not_available I didn't file a H
not_available 5122 with the chart.
not_available A what? Mandatory reporting of illegal substance abuse.
not_available Oh, right.
not_available I just wasn't sure.
not_available I thought maybe you'd want to
not_available Yeah, I'll take care of it.
not_available Sometimes it takes a little longer during shift change.
not_available Shift change? When one nurse goes home, another comes on? Oh, right.
not_available I'll go get her.
not_available Etoposide? Two
not_available CdA.
not_available He'll piggyback in the second phase.
not_available Hey.
not_available His IV has run out, and there's an alarm going off.
not_available It's only a pretreatment solution.
not_available The nurse will change it when they move him.
not_available Move him? 
not_available To the treatment room.
not_available His cells are almost 100 percent leukemic.
not_available He'll need a second chemo induction now.
not_available And then a bone marrow transplant.
not_available He's already failed one.
not_available Another one's gonna make him sicker and be more dangerous.
not_available Chemotherapy alone is gonna save him? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available He's gonna get a set of drugs he didn't get before.
not_available You've decided to experiment on him? 
not_available I haven't decided anything.
not_available Look, it's as much luck as science involved at this point.
not_available You look like you need a rest.
not_available No.
not_available You're gonna pump that junk back into his veins, I'm gonna stay right here.
not_available I meant to get the ring sized smaller, but I didn't get the chance.
not_available How did you swallow it? He likes me to suck on his fingers.
not_available I see.
not_available Nothing to panic about.
not_available It should pass in two or three days.
not_available "Pass"? 
not_available Two or three days? She'll be fine.
not_available Add some fiber to your diet and let nature take its course.
not_available He's not worried about me.
not_available He's afraid his wife'll notice his wedding ring is missing.
not_available There's nothing we can do? 
not_available Well, I could try an endoscopy.
not_available I don't like the sound of that.
not_available We stick a tube down your throat
not_available I gotta get to work.
not_available Honey, I need my ring! Well, I need my job.
not_available I'm on stage in an hour.
not_available I gotta get to work.
not_available And I ain't searching my stool.
not_available Abby's ready for that vag bleed in 1.
not_available I got Registry to fill in for me.
not_available You're leaving? I'm on my second dose of Compazine.
not_available I'm still puking.
not_available Five hundred? 
not_available Hey.
not_available How much would you charge to stick a tube down your throat? You two negotiate.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Frank, are you sick too? I ain't praying! How many pads? 
not_available Two so far.
not_available Started bleeding yesterday.
not_available Hi, Valerie, I'm Dr.

not_available Where is she? Home.
not_available Katherine stayed over.
not_available Did they charge her with anything? 
not_available Who? The police.
not_available No.
not_available Well, what did they do? You didn't tell them, did you? I wasn't the Attending physician.
not_available Mark, she was in possession of a controlled substance that could've killed our daughter.
not_available She wasn't trying to hurt her.
not_available It was three pills.
not_available I don't think they're gonna waste a lot of time on it.
not_available Waste time? 
not_available You know what I mean.
not_available You're already making excuses for her.
not_available No, I'm not.
not_available You're not doing anything, are you? What would you like me to do? You want me to have her arrested? You think she should go to juvenile hall? Would that be better? Do something.

not_available Well, I've been a little busyThere's a phone! 
not_available She's in court all day.

not_available Not again.
not_available What did you expect? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You can't get this kid's hopes up and leave! You're gonna do this? You're gonna drag me back and bail when it gets tough? The kid doesn't think he has to do this alone again! Don't leave him! Thank you.

not_available Good.
not_available Good.
not_available That's a good sign.
not_available Yeah, for now.
not_available You missed the consult.
not_available I thought you were only gonna be here half an hour.
not_available They got swamped down here.
not_available Swamped? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available What? 
not_available Your daughter's in the PICU, Mark.
not_available Breathing and showing signs of recovery.
not_available You run away and leave it all to me! I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna shower, I'm gonna change my clothes, okay? Be careful, because the evil daughter's there, waiting for me.
not_available Just go upstairs and sit with your baby.
not_available You told her to leave.
not_available She asked me what she could do.
not_available You're serious? 
not_available I'm perfectly serious.
not_available I can't do that.
not_available Can't do what? I can't turn her away, not now.
not_available What has to happen? Does she have to kill her? Elizabeth
not_available No! No! This time, I'm doing something.
not_available She's out! I'm not choosing between my daughters.
not_available You don't have to! I'm choosing for you! What am I telling her by letting you ship her away? That she needs to grow up! That she needs to take responsibility! That what she does has very real consequences for people besides herself! She realizes that.
not_available Do you think she would actually hurt Ella again? Either she's out of the house or I'm not taking that baby home.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Calm down.
not_available Take a breathShe's my child, Mark! I know that! She's mine too! Then start acting like it! 
not_available Ma'am, we're trying to help.
not_available You called the cops? 
not_available He fractured your face.
not_available No, he didn't! He didn't even touch me! Where can we find him? Did you check the university? 
not_available Abby, no! That's a big area.
not_available He's not at home.
not_available He hangs out at a bar down the street.
not_available I don't want to press charges.
not_available It's called The Windbreaker, on Fourth and Ashland.
not_available There's obvious signs of abuse.
not_available It's not up to you.
not_available Tell them no! Tell them not to do this! We'll check it out.
not_available Call if he shows up here again.
not_available He was here? 
not_available Sit down and let the doctor finish.
not_available What did he say? We're gonna find you a shelter, someplace where he can't hurt you.
not_available I don't want to go to a shelter! I wanna go home! What if you have a kid with him? Is this what you want for your kids? You want him to beat them? He wouldn't do that! 
not_available Oh, wake up, Joyce! This is it.
not_available This is your chance to get away, right now.
not_available It doesn't matter how wonderful he can be sometimes.
not_available If you go back now, you're telling him it's okay to do this to you and it is not okay.
not_available It's not okay.
not_available Your car's here.
not_available I managed to get a flight to Logan, but I'm on standby.
not_available Can you imagine? I'll call you from the Cape.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available John, I really am.
not_available Kids, you know they get over stuff.
not_available I bet if you went back Mickey would forget today as quick as he can down a milk shake.
not_available No, you were right.
not_available I became too involved.
not_available I'm thinking maybe I wasn't right.
not_available You see that tree? You and your brother built a fort on that big limb 
not_available and you played Tarzan.
not_available Bobby played Tarzan.
not_available I played Cheetah.
not_available You fell down and you sprained your wrist.
not_available And you never even thought about telling me that he pushed you.
not_available You knew? You two had your secrets.
not_available You stuck together.
not_available I saw no reason to pull you apart.
not_available I didn't spend much time thinking about how your brother's death affected you.
not_available I didn't spend much time on anyone.
not_available Do you have time now? I won't betray another little boy.
not_available Betray? 
not_available You don't wanna give up hope.
not_available You can't.
not_available Hope is all either of you have.
not_available Your brother believed me when I told him he'd get better.
not_available It didn't matter where he was how he felt, what the doctor said.
not_available I told him he'd get better.
not_available He died believing me.
not_available No.
not_available He was pretending for you.
not_available That was another one of our secrets.
not_available I was supposed to not let you be sad.
not_available I was supposed to make you forget to make you happy.
not_available He made me promise to make you happy.
not_available I'm sorry, Mom.
not_available I love you.
not_available Do you hear me? I love you.
not_available Well, if there's no money, it should be fairlyCan you hold on one second? Yeah? 
not_available Campanelli's.
not_available I got your pizza.
not_available Come on up.
not_available If there's no money, it should be fairly straightforward, right? Well, there's a counselor there, isn't there? Well, talk to her tomorrow.
not_available I don't know, I guess you just go and get what you need when you know he's not there.
not_available You know, you did the right thing, Joyce.
not_available Okay.
not_available Can you hold on one second? We
not_available We like this place too.
not_available Good fettuccine.
not_available I'm gonna have to call you back.
not_available Where's the delivery guy? Oh, I got it.
not_available It's on me.
not_available No, that's okay.
not_available Where do you want it? Over here? Yeah, that's fine.
not_available We're still planning on inviting you for dinner.
not_available Brian 
not_available Listen, I screwed up.
not_available I have a problem, I need to get some help for it.
not_available But I love my wife.
not_available I just have these strong feelings, you know? And that's not an excuse, and she might not talk to me.
not_available I understand I don't deserve forgiveness, but I just wanna tell her I'm sorry.
not_available County Social Services can get her a letter.
not_available So she's in a group home or something? I can't talk to you about this, Brian.
not_available I just wanna make sure she's all right.
not_available She will be.
not_available Tell me where she is.
not_available I promise I won't hurt her.
not_available I think you should leave.
not_available She's my life.
not_available Don't you get that? She's everything to me.
not_available You can't take her away from me.
not_available I didn't! 
not_available Abby, please.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available No.
not_available Where is she? 
not_available All right, listen.
not_available You have to leave now, or I'm gonna call the police.
not_available And I'm pretty sure you're not interested in talking to them again, right? You're right.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Good night.
not_available Brian.
not_available Brian! Oh, my God.
not_available Did she recommend a diet? Did she talk to your parents? 
not_available My mom.
not_available Tim is my stepdad.
not_available Well, I know it'll be hard at first.
not_available But if you start eating better, you'll start feeling better.
not_available I know I'm fat.
not_available I don't care.
not_available I'm glad you're comfortable with your body.
not_available That's very important.
not_available But you put on a lot of weight in a short time and that can cause health problems.
not_available And, you know, you'll be going to high school soon.
not_available You'll be interested in boys.
not_available I don't like boys.
not_available Well, you say that now, but trust me, in a couple of years, you'll want
not_available No, I won't.
not_available I hate boys.
not_available Why? Why do you hate boys? Do you have problems with boys? With men? I don't want boys to touch me.
